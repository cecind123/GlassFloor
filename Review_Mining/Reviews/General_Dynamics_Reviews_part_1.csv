rating,review
bad,The job wasn’t that bad but the pay really sucked. A lot of inexperienced managers and supervisors. Had positions just to say they had a position. Really GHETTO
bad,They treat people like garbage and it’s the good ol boy system where it doesn’t matter what happens right or wrong they back up the supervisors regardless of anything.
bad,When I started this job it was under another company. Once General Dynamic took over it went down hill for me. They got so Hostile I could not work there anymore I had to resign after 6 years just could not take no more Harrassment.
bad,"No onsite management for IT. Other only IT employee does not care about the work. The work is a “Contract” / Project and there is NO sense of job security at all. No help from management which is not located onsite but in Albany, NY. Opinions are not valued and you are left with doing all of the “boots on the ground work” by yourself."
bad,This company does not support their people nor cares about them The salary was low and the level of support from leadership was nonexistent   Think twice before accepting a job here
bad,Under paid.  Phone hours no compensation worked on holidays should have given us some kind of appreciation.. this is all I can say in kind words for now about this company
bad,"Worse place to work in the NOVA area, I would not ask anyone I know to apply to GDIT. I knew after my first week I made a huge mistake by joining GDIT. I stuck it out for 4 months but finally had to throw in the towel, worse place I have ever worked in my 20 plus year in the government industry."
bad,hrs were based on previous cumulative performance. but no flexibility. not taken drive in terrible weather into account. drove in blizzard to get to work. was 5 minutes late and was docked.
bad,Management care nothing about being an agent. They care nothing of personal or emergent actions and care nothing but making themselves look good. If there is something wrong it’s everyone else’s fault no fault of management or corporate.
bad,I was hired by GD and reported to work at Fort Belvoir.  My supervisor never told me they were not going to rebid on my position and that I was only to be working for 2 years.  My supervisor also did not offer me any other positions within GD.  He told me I did a great job and it was nice knowing me.
bad,"After 30 years of service this what GDIT do to people. I could not give a good honest opinion about this company."
bad,"When I started with GDIT, this was a new account for them and new management. They were very unorganized and it took me over 3 months to get my credentials for my computer. The team managers didn't know anymore than the member employees. Also there was a lot of unprofessional people working there and bringing personal things to work causing interruptions almost everyday."
bad,Answer phone calls and helped with Insurnace questions. Management was horrible very un organized. Hardest part was having to deal with out rate customers who were not happy with the insurance plane they chose.
bad,"Horrible place to work for. Bad management."
bad,I was a CSR at General dynamics and it was so stressful and definitely not worth the money. calls were graded and people were so rude and irritating on the phone when you tried to explain to them their insurance got cancelled because THEY didn't pay the premium.
bad,"The company was so unethical, and took many questionable actions toward their employees and customers. Management was hard to reach out to, I personally had about 8 different supervisors and only 2 of them helped in improving my career within the company or make the job easier."
bad,"Despite the low salary, things were good and I was respected... then a new boss came in and screwed everything up... after he fired me senior management realized he was the problem... I already had a new job so I never looked back."
bad,"General Dynamics was not a great place to work.  There were too many restrictions, managers were not helpful, workers were not appreciated and the atmosphere was full of cliques."
bad,This is a very stressful strict job. They monitor all calls and you must make sure that you are following all the guidelines from the beginning of the call to the end.
bad,"This is not the place to work if you want effective leadership, engaging work and fair compensation. Due to poor and misdirected business development the entire local office shut down. The wrong people were placed in positions of responsibility and did little more than call wasteful meetings and set unrealistic goals."
bad,I worked for the first implementation of the Affordable Care Act. It was a nightmare. It was a temp job with no benefits. I was one of their top employees and my manager and his manager told me because of my work ethic that they would hire me as a full-time employee once the temporary job ended. I was laid off and never called back. They treat you like a piece of meat - a number.Just another #.
bad,Everything is robotic and cold. If you had a issue there was nobody in the building to resolve it everything had to be escalated to an office in another state.
bad,"When I was being hired/recruited, was told it was for an IT position, and that the job I was being offered would have me assisting less experienced or knowledgeable agents. When I started working, however, I was doing exactly the same work as the other, lower tier agents, for just a couple dollars more. Also, it was not an actual IT position, but a call center help desk, and we were essentially call routers, only able to assist with the most basic of tasks, like password resets."
bad,This job has to many chiefs and not enough indians. It is very disorganized and need more breaks taking calls back to back. U can't schedule ur breaks or take any time off the phone unless its in ur empower.
bad,i would not recommend this job to anyone. The lack of professionalism is definitely there. You are just a number. As long as you pass the calls you may make it for a while. The old buddy system is what goes there.
bad,The management department is awful. The work environment is awful. The job itself is awful. It's just an awful and miserable place to work. Dealing with rude people on the phone all day.
bad,"This job is absolutely just a paycheck, nothing more, nothing less. The company shows no regard for employees that are understaffed and trained. They expect employees to work hard with no incentive."
bad,I don't recognize this listing as a place that I have worked. The fact that I can not skip this section only frustrates me. This is definitely a section that ruins the site for me.
bad,"They will over work you and will not pay you. Work at your own risk. They micro manage, employees don't get along. They suck entirely. Pitiful company to  work for"
bad,"Terrible company to work for, managers do not get involved with major contracts, and they tend to hire anybody. General Dynamics is a body shop and they tend to hire people without skills."
bad,Working for this company was unless and inorganized efforts to get the career path going for each and every employee wanted to excel in the company couldn't and wouldn't for the efforts was not recognized
bad,"I wont say more than the title. Get a job somewhere, anywhere else. Somewhere where you wont be treated like dirt. Anywhere else in the USA. Dont work for them"
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked in my life, I am a loyal employee so I took every advantage to make this place workable and enjoyable but the management staff have no idea what they are doing"
bad,"One of the worst jobs I've ever had in my entire life. Pay is horrible, management has no clue. No direction from anyone ever. You get in more trouble the more you do."
bad,NYCBS truly cares about not only the patients they serve but the employees that work hard to render the best quality care. There is much focus and emphasis on making sure employees succeed in their respective roles.
bad,"low wages, poor management, poor employees attitude. Sweat shop business model. Little to no wage increases, poor break times. Poor HR staff. Poor everything."
bad,nightmare  is not the word its a horrible place  the management is trash  co workers are great and  hours are ok that about it  the pay in minimum  and they dont care about your safety
bad,"From the first time I heard from this company is wasn’t professional. You get an email at 10:30 the night before about setting interview for that morning. Training was a joke, didn’t learn anything. Nesting was joke you feel like you’re doing something wrong by asking questions. The work was terrible. When training told you one thing and than you get on the floor and your supervisor tells to do something else it doesn’t feel like everyone’s on the same page. I wasn’t told doing my application or interview it was a seasonal job. Had to wait a month and a half to receive my first paycheck. And on a Monday they call a meeting to tell everyone I started with we were being let go on Friday. I just found they’re posting on here for more people, keep in mind they posted this the day they let over 50 people go, didn’t matter if you had perfect scores on your calls, or attendance. This is probably ramping but I don’t want anyone else getting let down by this company like I did."
bad,"The company as a call center is very unorganized, poor leadership, chooses the most unqualified people to work for them, dress code non existent and very poor management as a call center."
bad,"Looking for competitive benefits, decent salary/promotion/adjustments? Don't bother here. This company is all about ""returning value to the shareholder"" - translation???  Means, the more the stock price goes up, the more money senior management makes through their executive compensation.  And it is at the expense of the employees who are doing the day to day work of this company."
bad,"This company, or specifically this job does not offer any pay, no work/life balance, no room for growth, no ability to move up, no training, there is no perk of working here."
bad,"I was the wrong color for this job, I am a white female who never got any help from Mgt the black employees get the promotions and get help from the staff."
bad,"General Dynamics Company is a very slow and stagnant place to work with the head quarters in Taunton, MA. This is a very ossified and beaurocratic organization. DO not expect a lot of vertical growth here."
bad,"They hire anyone off the street and the trashier, the better. This job is my biggest regret. I learned absolutely nothing from my Workforce role. No time off, no management on site, trashy employees with no respect for anyone. Racist employees."
bad,Company management was awful . didn't care for employees just calls. Tolerated fights. Disrespectful associates. Treated us like criminals by having a metal detector before we went in . bad attitudes
bad,It was not a good experience. The pay was not fair. The company picked and choose who they wanted. I was over looked for positions even though I have the experience and knowledge to complete the job
bad,"You will never get a raise and General Dynamics.  Training was poor, never kept the agent in the loop.  Advised they know that information was slow coming to the agent and they liked it that way."
bad,"Worked in an old building which was were dirty and dangerous.  Also, some of the other workers were not to be trusted for any reason.  This was not a very good place to work at."
bad,"The worst turnover rate in the world, all they care about is their ghetto company. They want you to do several lines of business when they barely pay you for one."
bad,"Management sucks here is not what you know is who you know. People use this company as a stepping stone to move a different company. You will be asked to do work that does not pertain to your job tittle but how you are a salary employ you have to do what they ask you to as stated on your contract ""as other duties assigned"" so if your supervisor does not want to his or her work they pawn it off on you to do it and you can't refused to do so. Most likely the supervisor is tasking you because they don't know how to do it them self."
bad,"Good ole boys.its ok for them to talk about making moonshine but any else like ,how you being teated is a crime."
bad,"Company couldn't care any less about their employees. Their goal is to have you on a contract, regardless of your skills, and if you are not on a contract then to get you off their books."
bad,"Scripts and info on what/how to do things constantly change making it hard to keep this straight. No advancement what so ever. If you are not taking calls for more than a minute for any reason (going to the bathroom), they act like you are not doing your job."
bad,I answered calls through medicare and marketplace. Reading scripts to callers. It was a lot of information with medicare. much more laid back and easy with Marketplace.
bad,"Treated terrible. Don't have anything else to say but the dept was very cliquish , contractors were treated differently at the Post Office I would never recommend going to General Dynamics via Raleigh Post Office"
bad,did not like this job at all.  I am not it was very wishy washy in the begining of operation at this site.  After a while that was all worked out but the unknown and little nit picky things that you can fail a call for is just to much.  Just wasnt the right fit for me.
bad,"Very stressful place of employment. Shift changes happen every 6 months, and there is no consideration for those that have children or have issues with daycare hours."
bad,One of the worst companies i have ever worked for. Unorganized and there was no form of structured what so ever. They hired felons every having you go through a background check.
bad,"unorganized, many fights, unprofessional, hired people just to fill positions, supervisors didn't know what they were doing would ask call agents, etc."
bad,working for the department of defense is such a treat. working in a call center is an even bigger treat. i think the current leadership leaves a little something to be desired though.
bad,It seems no one 2 people are on the same page. Supervisors are to busy with their own work so therefore they are unable to provide accurate support to their team members.
bad,"to be honest I really did not working for general dynamics. They like to show a lot of favoritizim toward people in the ""clicks"". They also don't like to train people when it comes to learning new things on the job...if you don't know it you won't learn about it"
bad,"General Dynamics is not a good company to work for; All they care about is paying their CEO, CFOs and all those other people who don't want to see you succeed. Such a waste of time; the company and everyone there only care about themselves. They don't consider your experience, education nor skills when determining your pay. GOOD LUCK during hurricane season, no accommodations or PAY!!!!!!"
bad,"There was unfair treatment of this job, when you explain your mental state, it did not matter to the company at all, whether you were depressed, issues with sleeping, or whatever the case, the supervisors did not care.  Also, the supervisors were always in a clique, and several occasion where I heard my supervisor was talking about me."
bad,Schedule was Monday-Friday would take inbound calls from medicare beneficiaries. Everything is scripted so you have to explain everything verbatim. The most stressful thing was if you failed two calls you would be fired. There was absolutely no job security at all.
bad,"Do not recommend this job to anyone, if you don't believe the other negative stuff people have said, go ahead and work there and find out first hand, but don't quit a decent job to go work here"
bad,It was a half a** company to work for. They have no loyalty to employees. You are just a number and thats all you will be. Its not enjoyable and went home crying everynight.
bad,"I was miserable at this job. I loved my job itself, as far as helping the customes. But this place is very inconsistent when it comes to Ethics, Policy and Procedures, Management, and Human Resources. You are required to sometimes work overtime, and never receive pay raises. General Dynamics has a big turnover rate when it comes to keeping employees due unfair practices."
bad,"Promised a $2000 sign-on bonus, and alluded to growth to management positions by recruiter.  After starting work, found out that ""sign-on"" bonus was a longevity bonus (after 6 months), and promotions were vacancy based, only as ""shift leads""."
bad,"This place is located out in Springboro.They had a lot of  favortisim there. They had just called a lot of people back to work, which I didn't know till after I started working there."
bad,I wouldn't work here again unless I had no other choice. They try to teach you too much too fast and you don't really have all the support that you need when heading out on the floor. You kind of feel like you've been thrown to the wolves.
bad,"If i had the chance to not give any stars, I would this place of employment was horrible. They always set expectations that were false provided last minute lay off's with little to no secondary job placement ."
bad,"stressful,  not a good place to work, if you don't make in sale  in the first hour you will be sent home. not enough pay , no vacation, no paid time off not a good environment."
bad,"Company sold to untied technologies I left for higher pay, better benefits and job security, company closed down office two weeks after I left, it was fortunate for me as I did not miss a paycheck made $7,00 more an hour and had a job that was excellent"
bad,Management Doesn’t Care About Your Life Outside Of Work Doesn’t Care That You Have Kids Or A Family Very Inconsidarate Of They Employees Allow Supervisor To get Away With A lot Just Isn’t A Good Place To Work
bad,Don't have to go to the bathroom unless it is your break. You will be penalized. Don't expect your supervisor to know your job or the answers to your questions.
bad,"A job that uses people to get more money from the government for false reasons. No real leadership or goals to be set for employees. The anniston army depot/ General Dynamics location is misleading in their vision that they show when you first start to work for them, but soon realize that there really is no vision or even to use the knowledge and experience of their employees."
bad,its only temporary. its a great job. but very boring. the same thing over and over again. has too much structure. but because of the sensitive information it has to be
bad,very stressful work place phone call after phone calls barely get a break the management was rude sometimes if u had a question about something that you didnt know it was hard to get an answer
bad,Stressful workplace with little care about workers personal lives. Not able to advance in the company as you wish. This job is recommended for a qualified high school student
bad,"Shifts bids available, but hard to get/switch. Very dirty. Stays on the floor and walls and overcrowded. Supervisors are rude. Are not flexible with your schedule. Give you certain amount of hours you can miss and if you miss more you're terminated. Trainers are nice but not the supervisors. old and cranky."
bad,This was a temporary position where it was paid well. But at the end of assignment they made it complicated to receive paycheck. There system that was supposed to make it easy.
bad,worked here for a year and it was the worst job ive ever had. I would not recommend this job to anyone. Daily you worry whether you will have a job. It is a scripted call center yet if you follow script and not what they tell you they will repeatedly fail your calls. The women are half naked dressed and the men are mostly homosexual. Very uncomfortable day to day environment. Stress level at this job is at a 10 or above. I began with a group of 200 worked my way to the top and by the time I left each and everyone that I worked with had left and said it was the worst company they've ever worked for.
bad,"I could not handle this job. Some people are cut out for call center work. If you have a drive to listen to people scream at you with barely any breaks, low hourly wage and low amount of days off. Then good for you."
bad,"The best job I ever had just to short. Loved my job duties and the people I worked with was very friendly. and our location worked great for me as well as the floor I worked on. it was a eight hour a day job and the pay was fantastic. I would return given the opportunity again. my HR person was a unique person and gave me direction as well as assistance. The training was hand on and I adapted to growth and to always give my best for my employer. Most enjoyable part of my job was the people that I work for. they was kind, caring and very professional."
bad,Supervisors are no help and the one's that do help get into trouble for helping trainibg classes are set to pass everyone if you fail its because you dont want a job
bad,This company needs improvement. The company lacks structure and sometimes could be confusing of what the real objective is for the company. It seems like you are just taking pointless calls after call for no reason.
bad,"I worked their for a month and my profile for taking calls was still messed up, they blamed me for their technical calls.  They ran you dry, the managers left me alone in the conference room for an hour when I needed to talk to them."
bad,"terrible place to work no advancements and no raises                        "
bad,I was not satisfied with company due to the fact that I was sent out for traveling jobs out of state with non acceptable pay and long working hours. The management did not appreciate the efforts done and ignored struggles of the daily job.
bad,Poor management practices. Constant threat of being fired. No respect from higher management. No respect from subordinate's. Only place I have worked where they set you up to fail on a daily bases. Benefits and pay do not compensate for the amount of stress and demands placed on the lower management employees. The work itself would be fun if not for the lack of support and failure rate of those appointed to make the job run smoothly.
bad,"I did not like working there because they only cared about whether you came to work to fulfill their needs, only few was friendly. They did not give out any raises no matter how long you were there."
bad,GDIT just herds people in like cattle. Dealing with insurance it would make sense to make sure that everyone is properly trained but manager hardly know what is going on most of the time.
bad,I do not have much to say about GDIT. The company did not provide the pay or benefits that the employee needed. The only reason I stayed as long as I did was because I needed to use the FMLA/Short-Term Disability benefits.
bad,"I went to work for the company because I thought it was a reputable company to work for. I was not told from the beginning what the job really truly entailed. Customer Service Representative only receive 2 weeks of training, Not to mention the 2nd week we had to take ATO without pay because of something they said about the security clearances not going thru. They said we would get 3 weeks of training in the beginning. The training was awful and the trainer did not know what they were doing. The staff was sloppily dressed jeans and t-shirts not professional at all. The pay was 11.63 an hour and got a generous penny raise before I quit. Management never came around much, even though the people who worked there was nice but you could tell it was far from a great job. The time limits they put on the calls were ridiculous, 5-6 minutes tops. The only enjoyable part of the job was at quitting time."
bad,sorry to say this was a terrible company to work for.  Answered questions of callers concerning their own passport application.  Used a scripted based system to answer the questions.  Limited in the information to provide the public by the Department of state.  Fielded question for other CSR seeking information to advise callers.
bad,"Very quick-paced, and had to deal with the public over the phone on a daily basis. The training I receive was not helpful in any way towards this job."
bad,General Dynamics was on of the worst work environments I have encountered. Training to perform the job was inadequate. They threw you on the floor with expectations that training did not prepare you for. Management would overload some agents with in bound routed calls while others received minimal calls. There was very visible race discrimination. Management provided a lack of respect. Poorly managed. Supervisory had no skills and were promoted from within. It perpetuated the existing problems. I for one was happy to see them close.
bad,"One of the worst jobs i have ever had, Very temporary I left after a couple of months. I do not recommend this company unless your into getting yelled at all day!"
bad,"bad facility, little consider or care for employees, poor management."
bad,"NEVER WORK HERE! The atmosphere of the job place was very ugly. There was always people getting into it and they even have a on duty Sheriff or police officer 24/7 due to fights and confrontations. They have metal detectors that you had to walk through before entering the building due to people bringing guns and knifes on the production floor.The ""help"" you had were not even trained in a professional manner to give you the help you needed to make it through the call. It was a overall bad experience while working there."
bad,I would not recommend this company to any one who is looking for a company that is supposed to have equal opportunity.  The working conditions in the plant that I was at was contaminated with black mold.
bad,Cool place to work at. Would be better if they didn't hire just anybody. A lot of people with little to no experience and makes production very low and unprofessional atmosphere.
bad,"Affordable Care Act .Answering questions on benefits, enrollment, coverage information. Processing applications, updating personal private information"
bad,This is a customer service position with disgruntled customers on a daily basis.  Not having management to help in hostile daily work loads is very hard with this position.  The customer is not always right. This is a government position and the management is horrible.  They let too many customers get away with fraud documentation.  I see it on a daily basis.
bad,hated working here. supervisor was not helpful at all. needed help on a simple question and supervisor was no where to be found. training was fun though.
bad,I was fired the week before Christmas because i had to be hospitalized and they made a day of it a mandatory attendance day that i could not attend. I was devestated.
bad,"I worked there for almost 3yrs and got fired, there's a lot of preference for Caucasians. There's a lot of two faced people, would not recommend unless you like the stress and headaches."
bad,"I must say that I was appreciative to be able to work there during a time when I really needed employment.  However, my mother always said ""if you do not have anything nice to say then to say nothing"". I will leave it up to you on how this company affects you during a typical day."
bad,they are not very professional at all there is drama all throughout the work place. they do not train you enough before they put you on the phones if you can avoid working here please do
bad,"I enjoyed the position being full-time, with benefits, and over-time. I enjoyed taking calls, and assisting customers."
bad,At the moment of my employment it was called vangent. terrible company no type of organization or plan terrible hours no supervisor in majority of the shifts too over crowded and never understanding to employees another typical call center draining every bit out of employees
bad,If you love to lie then this is the job for you. You are on the phone all day and sit in front of a computer. They do not care about you or your family. Oh and if you plan on starting a family this is not the job for you ether.
bad,"I was working in the Healthcare Marketplace.  I didn't pass the testing, so my employment was very short-term.  I also didn't care for the required scripting."
bad,this job was not for me i had a hard time getting my self ready for the day and wanting to go to work i never wanted to go to work didnt feel like was wanted there
bad,This job is for a young person.  People with grown up responsibilities can not make it on the pay.  I heard they pay more now but its a big ghetto call center
bad,They fire you so that they can rehire you to fulfill government contracts each year. BEDBUGS...need I say more. I got sick last year because of the pesticide stuff they were using to rid out the bugs
bad,It is very easy to get a job here and its also very easy to get fired and shipped out the door . There is not room for mistakes with this company .
bad,Compensation is lacking due to the company takes most of the government contract monies and does not help the employee.  Horrible handling of the launch of the Affordable Care Act on the Federal Exchange.  Too many scripts.  Callers were treated like numbers and not people.  Attrition is terrible.
bad,horrible unsafe place to work. dirty enviorment. poor management.team work is non existant. learned not to trust people. unsafe.
bad,Wouldn't work there again. It is a depressing environment that you only build in if you know somebody higher up in management. Co-workers were bullies and did nothing to help the environment.
bad,The future of the Affordable Healthcare Act a government contract is very unstable due to the next presidential election. A person never knows when the contract will end due to mismanagement and or government cuts and mandatory lay offs. I wish I could just do the job that I was trained to do and not worry about losing my job everyday that I work. They promote FMLA (time without pay). Stay away from any company that has a shift bid unless you don't have a life.
bad,"Hated it!!  Worst working environment ever.  As a Function Analyst, I felt like a the cow or pig of the office...I had to often move my desk and find a place to work because the developers had priority over the work stations in the office."
bad,The hiring staff at General Dynamics in the London/Corbin area are very unprofessional. First I went to an interview session online and was told I would be contacted in a couple of days but then never received no such call. I sent e-mails to both hiring recruiters with no answer. I would have liked a reason why I was not selected for employment seeing how I have prior call center experience. Ignoring my e-mails I believe was very unprofessional.
bad,A typical day is when my computer go down or I can not get in before my shift starts. I learned how to sell insurance for the government. The management is sweet and the co-workers are so nice and sweet as well. The hardest thing about this job is finding the scripts you needs to assist. The enjoyable thing is talking to the customer on the phones and helping them enroll into coverage or assisting them with their accounts.
bad,"Bad benefits"
bad,"In my opinion the company was unorganized and the management was at a loss.  Communication was not clear amongst the teams, which led to a lot of problems."
bad,"very uinprofessional , rude, and unorganized. I cant believe they havent shut down the building yet. This job is for high school students maybe even middle school. Nothing is keep confidential"
bad,Management is very unorganized.Second time working with this company and again disappointed with the working environment.
bad,"not even going to talk about this place nothing nice to say about here . worse place to work they do not care about their employees, especially for the ones who have been there the longest"
bad,the pay is not worth all the drama you have to put up with in the work place. Very unprofessional and unorganized work place. everyone is sleeping with each other to get higher positions.
bad,"They only take in full-time/part-time temp employees. Their interview portion for the job if very poor. They will literally take anyone. When you work there you won't have job security unless they offer you regular full time, which is very seldom."
bad,I would have to say the overall job is not bad. I just really hate the rude people. That's why i came and left in less than five months. That job and those childish supervisors are not for me. Worst place I've ever worked
bad,"Management is good. Work conditions good. Committed to do what is right and meet the business needs. Code Of Ethics is impeccable. a great Company to work for."
bad,just terrible. The hired the most ignorant and ridiculous people I've ever met. treated you like a school child. had no grasp how to help american people. a 20minute phone call would result to a 4+ hr call due to computer issues.
bad,"You're not trained very well. Management is not selected wisely. Also, training class can come late. This leaves you unaware of any changes the company has made."
bad,"A very good company to work for; excellent benefits. I do enjoy the co-workers and the work environment. The hardest part of the job is, no control of the volume, as volume is dictated by requirements. However, completing all requirements in a timely fashion is very rewarding"
bad,"You might as well be going to jail everyday working here! Upper management is mean, the pay isn't worth the hassle. Do yourself a favor and run."
bad,I love helping the CSR assist consumer. I love my co-workers they all are very helpful. But there is not room for growth. I now have to find another job.
bad,GD treat their employees terribly in reference to compensation. Many of the jobs require college degrees but many of the employees do not have degrees but are promoted and employees who have degrees are passed over for promotions.
bad,they don't care about their employees at all. its an easy job but it just felt like I was lied to among taking the job and that is was not what it was advertise to be.
bad,"This job is great when you are going to school and need flexible hours or when you need a job that doesn't require much physical work. I think this job is great and works for people of any ages. The most enjoyable thing about GDIT is that if you have a problem with something or you need clarification, everyone is knowledgeable and do not give you the runaround."
bad,n/a I refuse to comment on this company not a company that a lot of people in Houston would go back too it wasn't a great company and the things that they do are all about the company they could care less about there employees
bad,"Consumers and Bene's were great to work with, very poor management"
bad,"This company provided an outlet for the ACA (Affordable Care ACt)"
bad,This company should be used as a stepping stone in your career.  It is most definatly not a place where you want to spend more than a year of your time. Schedule changes are promised and never rewarded. Management is very very unorganized and fickle.
bad,"management sucks, they have no type of management skills, worked with difficult beneficiaries about their medicare, To many snitches, everyone is trying get ahead, no rasies, other benefits are ok."
bad,I was hired to utilize my expertise and experiences; but assigned to a lead to be frozen for all my skills
bad,"This review may cause potential employers to not choose me as a candidate for employment, but I have to be truthful about my experience with this company.  I take pride in my job, but with General Dynamics I could not enjoy my job.  This job makes you lie to consumers and mislead them into obtaining health insurance coverage.  I could not sleep at night and stayed sick all of the time.  I am not the type of person to quit a job until I have another job, but I decided that I morally could not work with this employer any longer and chose to leave the company.  Every six months you have to bid for a shift and it is based on your compliance and quality.  You constantly change supervisors and managers, so it is hard to meet compliance and quality due to each supervisor and manager having different requirements."
bad,"This was the worst employer I have ever worked for."
bad,"Assisting beneficiaries with their Medicare inquires."
bad,"General Dynamics is a terrible place to work.  Management is far more concerned about political intrigue and oppressing their workers than they are about doing work.  As a defense firm, you'd think that GDLS would promote veterans.  The opposite is the case.  Veterans are treated badly by management."
bad,"I am a rehire at the company and why did I go back, SMH it seems like the company has gotten worse. No one in HR seems to know what is going on They play the blame game on each other in the RIVERVIEW,FL office since they switched to the night shift paychecks have been messedm up from the start. Talking to hr there reple was YOUR PAY WILL BE STRAIGHT BY MAY 9,2014( IN WHICH IS THE DAY THE CONTRACT IS OVER) now they show no concern or any ump about assisting employees with pay issues. Insteasd of them being concerned its play the blame game first talk to your supervisor, then send a Remedy ticket, then contact payrol, and after contacting all of them I still was turned back to my LOCAL HR OFFICE. its awful but at the end of the day I am currentlly seeking a LAWYER maybe then I can get some understanding about my pay being corrected. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A STABLE CAREER DONT APPLY NO ROOM FOR ADVANCEMENT, NO PAY RAISES, AND VERY STRICT. THIS JOB IS FOR PEOPLE WITH NO KIDS AND NO LIFE."
bad,"Management was poor with communication, Pay checks were short, a lot of empty promises."
bad,"It is very hard with knowing that everyone is getting laid off, and there are such good people there just trying to make a living!"
bad,"Not a good experience."
bad,"GD took over a contract for the Dept. of Commissary Agency at Fort Lee, by underbidding ManTech (who had the contract for 20 years).  They offered jobs to most everyone on the team, but lowered their salaries dramatically.  Then as it takes off, most of the Techs quit because of inept management on GD's part."
bad,"No loyalty to workers. Management for Quality Assurance does not protect it's workers."
bad,"The worst job I could have ever imagined working for. If CMS really knew what went on at this company, they would lose their contract."
bad,"This was an excellent job, to see an EFV hull/chassis enter one end of the building and then see the EFV depart at the other end fully build was amazing"
bad,This is a really good place to work for however there is not chance to move up in the company. You are stuck at one job for the entire time you are there.
bad,"worked with very unethical people, informed management and they swept it under the carpet."
bad,"I have worked here for two years now and one thing I can say is this company cares nothing for it's hourly employees. This is the most unprofessional company I have ever worked for. The pay rate is so pathetic that the best you can hope for yearly is a 1% or 2% raise, but that is if there will be any raises. This will be the second year we have not gotten a raise with rumor of a third. No room for growth here, not slandering the company, just telling the truth."
bad,I was very unhappy with this company and they dont care on how there employees are treated
bad,"I learned how to be a productive part of management, the hardest part of the job was directing a crew of people, the most enjoyable thing about my job was the end result when we were finished with a module or submarine"
bad,"The Managers hate the work and long hours, sharing cubicles..and must not be paid very well from all the grumbling you hear. The workers are mostly contract hoping to get hired which they won't because that means ""buying"" them from the agency involved and giving them a raise in pay!"
bad,One of the best companies to work for in the Northern Virginia area.
bad,"From my start at my position, my employer noticed I knew and had more experience than they could ever train me for. I didn't want to be greedy from the start by asking too much and settled for the pay they provided. "
bad,I hate the place management sucks the union is worthless to them you are nothing but a number. The only good thing about this place is the pay for the area.
bad,I came to work for GDIT under the selling points from Managers who had been told by the upper leadership and CEO that the company was expanding its investigations section on the OPM contract.  The company continued to hire and give bonuses while still laying off people on the east coast.  We were told it was because they over hired on the east coast and were trying to fix the amount of people working in the areas to ensure there was enough work for the people in those areas but that the West coast would be fine.  We were told on multiple occasions that the company was in good standing on the contract and that we were continuing to grow before being told that the contract was mutually dissolving.
bad,"I’ve worked for the company for almost 4 years as a customer service rep, the system is terrible, management doesn’t  know what to do half the time and my pay was lowered."
bad,"Since the acquisition of CSRA primary decision making authority has been given to CSRA management.  They have created an environment that is shallow, non-collaborative, and short sighted.  Employees are told to be open minded and to think outside the box, but are condemned for doing so.  It is an environment that is fostering hostility and is destroying the fiber of what made GDIT a good company to work for."
bad,"What can I say, its a call center. The pay is low, you are given an extremely low degree of autonomy and you are generally working with low to no skill people. While this works for college students just needing something in Lawrence which is hard to find, or people who just need SOMETHING to pay the bills. you will get enough to pay rent but not by much in a college town and certainly it is not the place you generally go as a career path. Demoralizing and repetitive work especially on contracts like medicare and supervisors will ride you about numbers such as schedule adherence because youre grades on these comprise their scores. Long calls are not an excuse for not taking breaks on time etc.  Overall its a good temporary job but over the long haul its not incredibly feasible unless you just have no other options."
bad,Management ignores issues and concerns.  Education is available to select staff.  No work balance / flexibility. Lack of communication from management.
bad,"No room for advancement. Constantly wonder if your job is on the line. Too many rules and policies that seem designed to set you up for failure so that you can be fired. Back to back phone calls, poor health insurance, lowest paying call center in this area. Absolutely horrible. Most employees and supervisors hate the job."
bad,"not a healthy or enjoyable place to work at morale is low and upper management is short fused and micro mangers, issues always roll down hill to subordinates"
bad,GDIT hires bad managers and management created a cut-throat work environment.  There are no camaraderie among the staff and they hate each other with a passion.  Worst experience of my life.
bad,Management is horrible. You never get a raise unless you move up to a different position and moving up is hard because there are so many employees. Its all about who you know.
bad,GDIT cares about itself - not it's staff. They will bully you into staying on a contracts and make you work ridiculous hours with the threat of losing your job. I do not recommend for anyone with any self respect.
bad,its a great place to use your communication skills you plan an important role in a persons life due to your health is how you live. making a difference in a persons life is a great feeling
bad,"go to sleep every night wondering if you're going to be laid off tomorrow. if that isn't stressful to you, enjoy your yearly pay cuts instead."
bad,"Workers are always talking bad about HR, Supervisors and Managers. Management is never communicating with you to let you know if you are doing good, but are always their to let you know when you did something wrong and not work with you to make it better. This company has way to many expectations and not equal pay. Most of the workers are their just to get money and not dedicate effort  to make the working environment better."
bad,"Child care"
bad,"I worked on a temporary basis at this company.  I am thankful for that, because the time I was there was filled with dealing with unprofessional people who were seriously incompetent."
bad,"Build my customer service skills stronger than before. Also, the benefits are great and they allow you use a lot of attendance time they always area of  opportunity to grow in the company."
bad,"no advancement hit the ceiling ,no one knows what they are doing and running around with head cut off bad place to be. never would go back"
bad,"I hated working there."
bad,It is a shipyard. The shipyard life is either for you or it is not. It was not for me. There was nothing enjoyable about the job and there did not seem room for advancement for those who excelled in their positions.
bad,I've only been here for a little over a month and I'm ready to call it quits! They could care less about your personal life. They will schedule you for overtime (up to 12 hours) and on your day off without even asking. Lunch break is very short for the long hours we work. They are very demanding for the little pay that we get and this job is very stressful! Avoid this job if you have a second choice!
bad,"Managers are clueless.  HR is incompetent.  I had to inform the company when I was losing my job (due to the project ending), received virtually no help from anyone in finding another position, and was basically on my own while on the job site (at a customer)."
bad,"The team at GDST Richardson, is a highly skilled, technical team of people consisting of manufacturing, engineering, and test.  "
bad,Very stressful environment. No organization. I did enjoy the people I met and worked with.
bad,The Healdsburg site is a GD procurement that neither has nor follows company or government regulations.
bad,if your an attractive woman and don't mind sleeping with your suppervisor then you can advance with good pay if your a man or woman with morals and good core principals you will be termnated and labled as not a team player or worst i personaly witnessed this in pawcatuck ct. the worst example of abuse sexual harassment and cival rights violations i have ever seen in my 58 years on this earth in other words i have seen alot of things -i have witnessed 6 people get layed off to cover up and prevent a lawsuit for sexual harassment intimadation and threats from suppervisors --i have witnessed a suppervisor comeing out of the ladies room with one of his female subordinants --it goes on and on in the pawcatuck ct. plant
bad,Employed 12.5 years with GDIT. I have enjoyed the 11 years but the last year and half have shown me a terrible side of the NHSD business unit.
bad,"12 hour shift work, people not too good, management very bad, certain people are given everything and do not deserve anything, hardest part of job just being there, age of workers plays a lot into how people are rated."
bad,"At Vangent, I am responsible for monitoring quality assurance for all calls, which are taken by the call center to ensue that consumers are provided with the best level of service."
bad,"Morale is very low, no support from anyone that works there except coworkers that are unhappy as you are."
bad,"There is not much to say about this company.  If you do not want to be micromanaged, than this is not the job for you.   Mostly they support Beneficiaries and assist them with all of their Medicare issues.  Not a lot of room for advancement."
bad,Great starter job not one to retire from. Do not repect employees and soon as your no use tossed aside. Good old boy culture. Who you know gets you ahead  before what you know. Govt overcharging rampant. Told to charge contracts even if no work was done
bad,Supervisors are a joke management is a joke Human Resources only want to gossip and not help. When the company changed to Maximus no one could answer questions. I was on short term disability and now I am getting bills from doctors that were previously paid and I’ve called GDIT and have had no help or response.
bad,There are so many broken promises and no real way to advance. You ask a million times for ways to get a raise but when you follow the steps it still comes down to the supervisor. They rather claim the job is too busy then put you in the necessary classes to advance yourself. Then on top of that they will give you lead or supervisor roles but don’t want to pay you to do the extra time and work added to your plate
bad,Stressful workplace environment. Inconsistent management. They are strict on working your schedule and rarely approve time off if in peak season. In horrible driving conditions (snow) expect to be forced to still come in or work your full shift.
bad,"During my time working for general Dynamics, it was no very organized. After i left and returned back, it was a much better work environment. I would return to GDIT for work."
bad,GDIT pockets most of their government cash and leaves nothing for employees. Potlucks and events are paid for out of supervisor and manager pockets. That’s disgusting.
bad,Spent almost 4.5 years there. It's all about the money and playing politics to get more of the money at GDIT. If a program doesn't have enough money to give raises they will give a poor performance review to justify it. I was forced to do this with my staff several times.
bad,"First the pros"
bad,"My supervisor told the team that she was there to tell us what to do but not to answer any questions."
bad,"Pays your bills but not enough to live and eat. Unless your bilingual or your going to HAVE to work overtime. Back to back calls. HR loses documents so ALWAYS make copies and keep them.  Supervisors walk around, leave the facility or smoke most of the day. There are some good ones that will be at their desk but believe me they’ll be all over the place. A manager told a rep that their mom passed on the floor while we where working. The callers could be mean or they could be sweet but expect rudeness. Training dept is awesome so they will help you. Cafeteria is high and the food is mediocre. You’ll make friends that make you come to work instead of the company itself. Multiple shifts, two weeks vacay and immediate health insurance. No raises, it goes by the government not the cost of living. Last year there was a 30 cent raise to make it 12.88 an hr. IF YOUR NOT BILINGUAL. If you are bilingual you will get paid more. To make more money you have to be offered about 6 more positions in order. So you’ll do a lot of work until you get to the highest rep. Good luck!"
bad,I've never worked for this company. I need to rework my resume. I worked for general motors but never for general dynamics information technology. not sure how this mistake happened
bad,GDIT is the worst company I've ever worked for and working there as a customer service representative is the worse job I've ever had. You are treated as a number instead as an employee or even as a human being.
bad,Under paid for the work that is performed and the cost of living is high . Not willing to pay employees a competitive rate for the area. No room to grow. the only good thing about working there is the hours.
bad,"Taking calls and helping consumers with whatever issue they may have. "
bad,General Dynamics Information Technology is a overall ok company. The work environment is not very great. Management is very poor and unprofessional. It can be very stressful at times.
bad,The incoming calls literally were 4 seconds apart. They claim to have a strict dress code and secure floor policy but it depends on who you are: some employees (supervisors included) basically get away with dressing like hookers while others are sent home for wearing shorts the wrong length. Some employees are fired when caught with a cell phone on the floor while others obviously walk around with their phone visibly in their bra or back pocket. Really?
bad,"Not a place i will go back, is very unorganized, doesn't have good supervisors, nor employees. I will definitely not recommend this place to any one to go there."
bad,"General Dynamics is a company that will hide information at the time of hire, is very dishonest and unfair, especially to their long term employees..."
bad,"Extremely dirty! You talk to the elderly people all day and if you take longer to help them you get a bad review! Cannot take a bathroom break it goes against you! Cannot take a cell phone inside the building, pay is about $13 an hour! Supppper GHETTO!!! ALot of kids work there."
bad,"a typical day was go in log onto your system put your head set on and constantly get cussed at.The job was highly stressful,management was terrible and showed favoritism and they look for reasons to fire. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the strict rules that kept your hands tied to how you could actually do your job, and the best part was when you got off or didn't have to be there."
bad,"The management, supervisors, and some of the HR department needs completely replaced with individuals whom are understanding and abiding by the ethical laws. There are many there that lie, and do anything they can to protect themselves,. Exceptions not put in when they are supposed to be. Thus hurting the csr;s whom are the backbone of the company doing their jobs. In the end it is the csr's whom lose their jobs over this. Regardless of how good of a caller the csr may be. When corporate looks at numbers, they have set time limits on phone calls, expect csr's to have callers off the phone in set amount of time. yet computers dont work right half the time, one application may take up to thirty minutes on a good call. On a bad call with a family of four and computer lagging it can take up to an hour an half to enroll consumers into coverage, thus hurting a csr's adherence. Yet nothing is done. Supervisors are vey rude, managers wont back csr's when complains made about supervisors. Supervisors will talk about csr's, they will gather in groups with other csr's and talk about other employees. This is not how supervisors, managers, and yes even some HR have done this. If anyone ever wnet in undercover as a csr, not dressed perfect, not skinny, not perfect, that may need some accommodations of some sort. They would find that this is not exactly the work force it claims to be. Why do you think it has such a high turnover rate?"
bad,This place you constantly have to worry if you have a job when you come in. Management is rude and they don't care about the employees. They are horrible and will literally do anything to save the company a dollar!
bad,I wouldn't recommend a stranger or anyone that I know to work for General Dynamics.The supervisors and managers have power trip problems and do not listen to the agents.
bad,This establishment is woefully mismanaged. My advice to you is only work there if you're desperate because they treat employees like criminals. They lie in the interview process to fill seats in the call center because their turnover is out of control.
bad,"Interesting work and some good colleagues, but management is not very ethical at best.  Can be dangerous to work there as a result. if the Government decides to investigate them."
bad,"If you want to be treated like a slave working 60 hour mandatory weeks then this company is for you."
bad,The company didn't put you in a position to be successful.  They put you in a job and don't show or tell you what your job duties consist of in that position.  Leadership doesn't want to show you or tell you what needs to be done.
bad,"Over the period of  LPTA contract award has come into existence, employees have been less and less respected and put into an overworked situation with little acknowledgement of appreciation for accomplishments and efforts. There is little to no effective management training and unprepared managers make for an unproductive environment where micromanagement stifles any individual creativity and desire to strive to be the best."
bad,"Hire any people from anywhere right away, after usage, get rid off them, not get reward of project. Younger engineer does not listen to authority, no discipline, no experience. Promise customer randomly. no empowerment, purely satisfy customer request, people flow out fast, no organized engineering process and knowledge. Leadership is poor. Product is not very nice, use inaccurate dummy FEA software and poor engineering, don't understand engineering,  don't want change. Poor manufacturing, poor engineering, basically, it is a mess."
bad,"They put a posting stating the salary is $14.64 however once you get hired on, one of the managers said they deliberately did that just to bring people in. The real pay was $10.83 and the remaining $3.81 went towards paying for your health insurance benefits which they make it seem in the post that your pay would be $14.64 plus benefits. NOT True. They are completely unorganized. The call center manager micro manages to the extreme. If you ever need help from HR, there is never a clear answer except I don't know. They have a strict occurence policy even if you are one minute late coming in, returning from break or lunch, or leaving early (5 chances a day) to receive an occurrence. Ten occurrences within 90 days, FIRED. No matter the reason either. They have no empathy for single mothers or whatever the reason maybe. They also have mandatory ATO which is approved time off. You are lucky to get a full 40 hours a week. The upper management are highly misleading and very disorganized. If you work here there is NO room for advancement. A lot of run around and empty promises. I would not recommend this company simply because you can get a job like this that pays $14-16 plus benefits elsewhere. I wouldn't trust anything anyone says about advancement or higher pay...it never happens."
bad,Terrible call center to work for. If they were to ever open this specific call center back up I would NEVER fill out the application again.
bad,It's all about money and commission. Nobody cares if the job is not meeting the requirements. No support from the company what so ever. Extremely disappointed. Lots of promises just to get you onboard.
bad,"In A typical day at work, I would take dozens of inbound phone calls from Medicare patients asking questions from general information to why a claim was not paid. The management was not good, they often told employees what we wanted to here in order to placate us, but seldom followed through on any promises. My co-workers at Vangent weren't the best either, the job requirements were pretty much a pulse, read and speak english. The hardest part of the job was trying to help people who just wanted someone to scream at and  not hanging up on them. There really wasn't anything enjoyable about that job"
bad,"After starting with GDIT it was then discussed that the starting rate would NEVER change, no matter how long you worked in this call center. The advancement opportunities were limited."
bad,"The other reviews on this location made me laugh. Did we work at the same place? Because I was miserable... no room for advancement, and don't believe them if they tell you you are permanent, it's a ruse. Management sucked."
bad,"They was good when I move move to satellite communications away from the management of that department everything was good."
bad,"Unprofessional.  Favoritism.  Discrimination."
bad,"By far the worst place I've ever worked. There is NO opportunity for advancement. People that have been there for years make the same rate as someone walking through the door, that's ridiculous. Calls are back to back to back everyday for no reason. Having to deal with rude and irate callers that repeatedly call because it seems like they have nothing better to do with life. It almost seems as if you are wasting your breath with these callers because they call in thinking they know everything or they just don't listen to what you tell them.They warned us in training that the job is mentally draining and I took that lightly but it is definitely the truth. If you don't adhere to your schedule you could be coached and possibly terminated for it. It's almost impossible to adhere to your schedule when calls are back to back. The time they expect you to get callers of the phone is impossible because every call is different and a lot of calls take time. They say let them vent and talk but expect us to get them off the line in specific amount of time..Yeah ok! Don't bother to get sick or be on your death bed because they won't accommodate you for it you just have to have the ""hours"" to cover yourself. This is just a warning if you know you want more out of life and you would like to be in a position that allows you to at least be content please look else where. I shed a tear every time I sit at my desk because this job is the absolute worse!"
bad,"coworkers are top hands, Management are  clueless, priorities for Navel customers are ignored  in lieu of supervisors own agenda.Always last minute, catching up. not much overtime. Logistics for materials needed is non-existant. Awesome insurance tho."
bad,"it was not very organized, no supervisors no one to keep track hard to get in and speak with any managment"
bad,This place has very poor management and direction with no advancement.
bad,This company does not care at all about the employees. Even if you do exactly as you are supposed to they will get rid of you. Management does not care and only cares about the company and their salary. The only good thing is the coworkers but they keep getting walked out on a daily basis. Do NOT work there unless you have no other options.
bad,"No strategice direction or understanding of how to resource or provide services appropriatly, mass reducndancies without proper consideration for business requrements, overpaid and ineffective management. "
bad,"company has threats of violence daily, does door searches and have metal detectors. is patrolled 24/7 by police"
bad,"This corporation is a 1-800-Medicare contractor and The Worst company I've ever worked for. The incessant protocols & absurd ""secure floor  policy"" (I.e no pen, paper, coats, soft candy,etc. at your desk) made CSRs feel like parolees not employees. Upper management never admitted mistakes like when they messed up payroll. GDIT makes securing another contract more important than employee safety & happiness. It was like a call center/sweat shop/concentration camp. Only work here if you are desperate or an Ex-con because there are no background checks and you have access to 52million social security numbers!!"
bad,"It was a busy inbound call center, with extreme security procedures. I understand the elderly and disabled population a lot more. I learned so much about medication and social security. The process of aging and the importance of healthcare coverage was paramount."
bad,"Don't waste your time. Very unprofessional and never organize. For high schoolers only, because that's exactly how they treat you there. They lay off every 6months no chance for permanent or growth within."
bad,Would only consider people to work there if they were a student or have no children. Good job if you don't want something permanent.
bad,I love interacting with the Customers and being able to resolve their problems in a timely manner. I do not like the fact that the Management is pro reaction versus proactive in dealing with the implementation of new policies and procedures. The opportunity for advancement is slim to none and we are grossly under paid for the amount of work we do and the stress involved in that work.
bad,I love being able to help orgranizations with their Information Systems projects.  Very passioniate about what I do and very dedicated to seeing the project to completion.
bad,"I'm not sure about all GD locations, but GD-AIS in Pittsfield, MA went from being a great place to work about 10 yrs ago, to horrible under a new VP that took over around 2006, who just left a few months back to go ruin SAIC now... And the moral in that company is low, very low."
bad,"After seeing a challenging, rewarding project to completion, I spent my last year there being bounced around from one poorly managed, boring project to another.  "
bad,Cannot go tot he bath room unless you are on break. Will be denied time off work for just about anything even if you ask in advance. Not a great company to work for..
bad,"Management is incompetent, plays favorites. Has what we love to call the ""Good Ol Boys"". People constantly getting thrown under the bus. Can't trust anyone. 40+ year olds acting like children. It's downright disgusting."
bad,"GDIT bought out Vangent Inc. Since the buy out moral and the sense of security has gone out the window. Recently found out that a new call center opened in Alabama for a specific contract that already has a few locations; now fear is running rampant that our sight will close. The only thing that is keeping people's hopes up is the bilingual advantage we have. Health benefits are terrible and cost is rising. No opportunity for advancement nor are you groomed or taught skills to give you the upper hand to advance. They are starting to enforce a clean floor rule. This means no paper, writing instruments, or personal belongs are with you. You are require to leave items in a locker before you reach your desk. Yes, this is to protect PII of the customers; however in the end this can make anyone feel like a they are.not a crucial part of the company and makes you feel like a felon as opposed to an employee. Human resources are worthless to the average customer service rep. They are mainly there to support management, fire, and hire employees. No perks or team building activities.... unless you are in management or your department is lucky enough to have the funds to put something together. The company expects/asks you to give back to the community but are quick to give back to the employee. Supervisors are real quick to forget what it's like when ""life"" happens and provide no wiggle room to adjust. Recently, my aunt who was recently hired lost her mother to cancer. GDIT/vangent did give her leave because she a new hire nor offer leave without pay. The company uses a point system to"
bad,"Terrible place to work, bad business ethics, everyone is a number, a chair that can be filled just as easy."
bad,Very political and environment. Production doesn't matter.
bad,As a former employee of General Dynamics I found that the company was extreamly weak in defending employees against the primary customer and this in itself was quite disheartening. The government agency that I worked for ran rough shod over the contract employees from General Dynamics and I found that the corporate program managers FAILED to support the employees when they were clearly in the right. With any large corporation employees are nothing but numbers and I found the HR department to be especially poor when attempting to resolve issues.General Dynamics refuses to get involved in any dispute which might cost the corporation money and will dismiss employees rather quickly if they make waves under the most questionable reasons for dismissal. I would never go back to General dynamics and would dissuade anyone from considering employment with this company.
bad,"Giant faceless, heartless, gutless corporation that cares absolutely nothing about it's employees careers. Managers seem to be political appointees with no actual qualifications for their assigned duties and completely inept at basic management skills. Same old story, different company with a big smiling face to the public and nothing but general cowardice and heartlessness underneath."
bad,"High turnover!!!! You are just another body in the building. Low pay, high expectations, overworked, uncaring management, lots of favoritism, no room for advancement opportunities if you are not a ""fave"" DON’T DO IT!!!"
bad,"My team is hot garbage. Other teams might be better. A lot of their company-wide resources, like their portal, is also not very good to awful. Pay is good, but not for the amount of chaos and redundant work needed.  PTO is a joke. 14 (maybe going to 15) a year for Vacay, Sick, and get this, if you are in a Fed building and Feds call a snow day, it comes out of your PTO (depending on which state you live). Lots of options for health care. 401k is pathetic. Three weeks in I started looking for another position."
bad,"Typical call center, training department is good. Supervisors very: some are great and some are terrible: luck of the draw. Great benefits, low pay, good for a short term job but not a career"
bad,I was fired due to me having a child that has disease that she can die from. She was sick in the hospital I called my manger to inform her that I wouldn’t be able to come into work. Before this happen I informed my manager and her manager about my daughter and her disease.  When my daughter was better I came back to work. After almost a week of me being back they fired me. I am single mother of 6. I feel the way they do things are wrong. They don’t care about the life you have outside of work.
bad,"Horrible management, lack of materials to complete job, expect you to perform unsafe work practices and break rules to complete jobs, forces employees to work overtime. Just a flat out terrible place to work."
bad,"Employment here was not a good experience and I choose not to post a public review for concerns of retaliation. Therefore, I feel it best not to leave a review at this time."
bad,"A typical day involved 8 hours of contacts calls from people on Medicare, their families, lawyers and medical providers.  The hardest part of the job is the policies in place that make it impossible to help the callers."
bad,The OPM contract was not making money. Management assured us after the first RIF that there would be no more. Subsequently there were 3 more. I was a casualty as a result. I worked here 18 months and this RIF came as a surprise. My respect for the upper management in the company is very poor. We were lied to as far as how safe our jobs were. My job consisted of both working in the field and working at home. I was responsible for working Security Clearance cases by performing interviews and investigations to complete the cases for those seeking security clearances. The most enjoyable part of my job was interviewing people. The hardest part was making sure that all bases were covered and all issues that were developed were covered with all the required information needed.
bad,Too much documentation required in GDIT Technology Division.  Crazy. Terrible place to work . They act like they care about. News flash. They don't.  The level of documentation required is ridiculous.
bad,"There is discord between direct managment, and up the chain of command. In some cases, upper management makes promises that lower management cannot fulfill."
bad,Underpaid and classed as a customer service rep when we are actually computer support to gdit can get away with under paying its employees. Supervisers will reprimand you for something then tell you to do the thing they just told you not to do
bad,Do not work here if you are a single parent. I had the worst experience with these people. Absolutely zero care about the families we have outside of work.
bad,The government requires us to reach as many clients as possible and fill complete the applications with most of the required data to process one plus agency.
bad,"I think most people work there for a long time if they get a kick out of being rude to poor sick people not to their face,  like most federal and state jobs have in common."
bad,There are too many lazy people and spoiled people and old. Manpower Management doesn't know what happens on the floor in GD. It's a shame that when a new person trying to do their best helps others and the company doesn't appreciate that.
bad,"Sorry company to work for. This company only cares about what you can do for them, not about the employers at all. I would never recommend this company to my worse enemy."
bad,"Very poorly managed. If you're a relative of someone, you're better off than anyone else. Very discriminatory to random people. Some people have it made for no real reason and others endure a hostile work environment. No real ethics at this place. Is ran worse than a McDonald's."
bad,"The management picks and chooses which and against whom they will 'make the rules apply'. There is limited training and support, and those who try to do there jobs are punished for ridiculous things while those who do the bare minimum or nothing are allowed to continue working."
bad,General Dynamics provides systems integration and data networking services that aid consumers in their search for qualified healthcare.
bad,Talk on the phone with medicare beneficiaries in regards to medicare policies and insurances.In need of more to help make employees feel more important to business and not just a number! Extremely dull environemt
bad,"Just a horrible job all the way around. I have over three years' experience in call center environments and this is the worst call center that I have ever had the displeasure of entering. They have unrealistic goals for call handling times and break schedules. The system they use is unreliable and difficult to use. For an information technology company they are certainly lacking in the computer systems tools they should be providing for employees to effectively do their job. The only positive aspects are the insurance they provide to employees, and a decent pay wage for this area. They have a huge turnover rate because entering the building sucks the life out of you."
bad,"I was told that I could not be promoted . I was doing a wonderful job doing what I was doing. This put me in a box. with the skills that I have accumulated in a 16 year work history, I felt that there is always for advancement."
bad,Very easy job. The company was very unorganized. Too many other staff trying to be the boss. They will hire you with a small background and then fire you.
bad,"Working as a CSR in the Houston call center is challenging. They don't have a real hiring process, you can apply and get hired without ever speaking to a person face to face. Most of management & supervisors are clueless as to how to use systems, work phones & and give any support or instruction to those who don't know how to do their job. Training is a joke, the trainers are contractors who know very little as well. There is mass confusion over simple things such as how to create a schedule, find a seat, and assign a supervisor. You will be massively babysat for things non job related, such as cell phone use,dress code, stealing from the deli etc. The pay and benefits are mediocre at best."
bad,"The market is collapsing on GDC4S.  Leadership has not positioned this company to weather the cuts to government spending."
bad,Management puts undue stress on the employees and not enough positive reenforcement and/or recognition
bad,When it comes to respect I feel like I was railroaded. I feel the company was trying to cut costs and nit picked the job people were doing. Giving good customer service was sacrificed by the use of double standards.
bad,"Terrible starts at the top. It trickles down to all areas of the GD-AIS organization. Baseline computers are inadequate for engineering jobs. Moreover, computers are locked down by administrators in a significant way. Hard to use. The intranet documents businesses processes on the intranet. The processes are entirely inscrutable. When computer problems occur, IT offers little support and slow turnaround. Information security team fails audits repeatedly making it difficult to finish classified projects. Benefits are painfully reduced every year. HR support is inadequate. Mindless training is involuntary. It is not fully possible to describe the intolerable agony of working here. You may wish to look elsewhere."
bad,"Wosrt, most unorganized, biased mess ever. If you are not a part of the ""Sally Mae"" click, your experience is the absolute worst experience you can have. The site manager is the leader of the pack of all the drama. She gives the pass for the others to put a target on your back yet corporate has been made aware and nothing is done ever. They will target family members if family is employed there, just to get you."
bad,They have no appreciation for hard work the way you move up is by who you know or who's behind your under they have team leads that dont know their job or want to do it at that and we relied on each other to keep up on billing knowledge and provider inquiries. Literally trained myself trading is inconsistent which isnt fair for people who do like to provide accuracy the informant is toxic and they are unprofessional  when corporate came they tightened up but let it be know that once they leave back to the bs and they condone the unprofessionalism amongst themselves.  I liked the company but management  is horrible I had to quit not my kind of working  environment
bad,Customers were rude and other employees. I had one person tell me that we loved our jobs because the president was putting drugs in the ac and when you tell management about being harassed by a consumer they laugh at you.
bad,"Nothing good to say about this company.  To me they were more on the ""not want to help"" side of the business.  Whenever you needed a supervisor, no one was to be found.  They would all take smoke breaks at the same time.  So, if anyone needed help, you were on your own."
bad,Fired me due to me not being able to work overtime.  Having 20 year olds as a supervisor is a really bad idea.   Mandatory overtime is never a good thing.   I had bad back pain but could not see a doctor due to a 6000.00 deductible
bad,"Allot of shady things happen here with sub-contractors."
bad,Managers tried to have their crew cut corners an hr protected them only reason people stay is for the money if you didn’t want to cut corners an reported them to hr you would be subjected to retaliation
bad,Rules were not consistently practiced and personnel who did their jobs were punished and personnel who collected pay checks or never showed up for work were tolerated.
bad,Was a good job to work. The environment was pleasant. There was no bad things happening. I was excited to be working at General Dynamics Technology and I learned a lot about the company.
bad,"Typical work day, come in, log on to the call room, take calls, and assist clients. "
bad,i didnt like the job because of alot of micro-managing from your supervisor when your not on the phone. Calls are back to back and their are no pay raises.
bad,I have no positive reviews. This place will puts you in so many tough situations that you start to feel as though you are a burden rather than an employee.
bad,it was like working in a higschool with constant drama.  Poor management and communication.  No structure involved with hiring process at all.  NOt the worst place ia have worked nor the best.
bad,"Extremely poor management/workforce relations based on distrust and animosity between the two entities. Extremely poor management decision processes led to inappropriate hiring, firing and promotion decisions, leading to distrust and poor morale."
bad,GDIT does not treat employees well from top down. There are good people working for GDIT who try really hard but lack the backing and consistency of corporate leadership
bad,"In the Information Technology department contract; This place is a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah. You will literally feel like a Hebrew slave. Management does not know how to treat people, you will feel like an immigrant/non-citizen."
bad,"The management staff and the supervisors are not professional.  Policies and guidelines change to often to know if you are doing something that jeopardizes your job.  There is not a consistent quality process....it's open to each qualify representatives interpretation which does not lead to fair scoring on calls.  The open door policy is a joke.  There are grey areas all over the place, and they apply for some while not applying for others.  This is not a good place to work.  I've tried it twice now, and I will never go back."
bad,Environment is very restricted and there is limited growth opportunites. Obtained and extensive amount of knowledge pertaining to Medicare benefits. Training and learning resources was readily available upon hire.
bad,"ne respecte pas l'ancienneté, environnement toxique,abus de pouvoir"
bad,"My company was bought out by general dynamics land systems (typical GD business strategy).  Our business unit was profitable and while it took considerable downsizing to maintain its profitability, we were still all let go.  It gets worse.  Our business unit worked extremely hard (worked holidays and overtime) to submit proposals that would win us over $200M in revenue.  We were let go AFTER we won the contracts.  However, the [leadership?] thought they could make us do the bulk of the work during our final days there.  Inevitably people found other jobs, and the people remaining were not incentivized to complete the mountains of work required (would you be if you were getting laid off?).  To add to the chaos, [leadership?] decided to change our enterprise processes and IT systems smack in the middle of the projects, further crippling anyone from completing work (yes, we are people and still want to do a good job - for each other at least). "
bad,after months of being told that if we did our job that we would have job security.  I was let go for no other reason than business need; where other less proforming workers were still retained. I was also told that I would be receiving a bonus that has yet to be paid.
bad,"Working for GD was a horrible experience between nepotism gone wild and poor manager who believe to be a leader you have to threaten and ""ride"" the employee.  Going to Human resources to complain your human rights have been violated or the working conditions are unsafe is a one way ticket out the door.   This is a company that says all the right things, but cannot back them up.   I have heard of people being physically attacked by other co-workers with no consequences to the other worker.   The battle damaged vehicles coming back from the front line are not ""clean"" but HR will tell you they are and that you are a liar.   I have seen things that GD did not prepare me to see.  Forced to work over-time upto 7 days a week for over a year.   No regard for burning out employees,  plenty more waiting in line to join GD is the theory they subscribe too."
bad,"I worked here 3 months and had to get out.  They work you 8 hours a day, then expect you to go home, get on your computer and do things like check email, do deployments and troubleshoot issues until late at night.  And this is when you are not even 'on call'.  When I asked about going to shifts I was told 'That's just the way it is'.  Avoid this place."
bad,Looking to relocate to Illinois and continue working for military/Government contracting
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work there unless you wish to see your career become stagnant.
bad,"i have been in the business for over 15 yeas. the management team in pittsfield, ma is, by far, the worst i have ever seen, without exception."
bad,Dont believe in training or keeping logs up to date. They work on the buddy buddy system. People out there are very secluded. Always trying to find bad in u not the good. Dont ever run a scrap part they will fire you. Have a big turnover rate cause u cant trust knowbody
bad,"If you work here very long you might die young. The health hazards are out of control, it is just not worth it."
bad,"This is a great first job for someone, but if you're already skilled, it will take forever to move up. And you need to befriend someone in management because they definitely play favorites here."
bad,"If you are talented, there is no room for advancement. Managers are selected at random and display incompetency daily. Environment is hostile, and they pit employees against each other. You will not do the job you were hired to do, but rather, do jobs outside of your scope, and without compensation."
bad,"Dishonesty within the corporation. I was promised a chance of career advancement after six months of employment and an increase in pay. I have not been covered on any performance appraisals, have been denied employment over thirty applied applications internal General Dynamic Information Technology, and no pay increase."
bad,The managers we very in caring you get 1.5 hours of sick pay leave Evey two weeks and 2 hours of unpaid earned time off every week that you dont miss any time
bad,"Compensation is great, not very good environment to work. Upper Management are horrible. Lower Management you deal with daily are great, higher ups in the office are horrible. Alot of Jealousy in the environment."
bad,"Good Company, that started out with serious problems but had some dedicated leadership that worked hard to make it better. However, as they began tp leave  the Sandy site has been plagued with poor management that has been almost criminally inept. The last good manager left last spring, there are good sups that still try but have no support."
bad,"Lots of nepotism and favoritism . Upper management doesn’t care or concerned about employees. Good ole buddy system. Work on charge code system, have to have charge code to get paid"
bad,Its a very face pace job. You can only go to the bathroom on your breaks. Dont miss over your hours you will be fired no matter what the problem or situation is.
bad,This company is not worried about the associate at all. They do not allow you to take off when you need to. They do not care about people with long standing illness.
bad,"Taking phones calls, helping callers with questions about Medicare, billing, and helping the beneficiary's getting supplies that they need. As far as Supervisor's, they were good; Management I felt that they were not for the workers on the production floor. They were basically for themselves, not wanting to help or the wellness to help.  I enjoyed meeting new people that I work with, and helping the beneficiary's with their questions."
bad,Each day is nice that you help callers but everyone has a sense that they can't take a breath.  CSRs are nervous that they might get disciplined at anytime.  Management is very disconnected from the regular agent.  Peers seem overworked.  The hardest part is time managing to get everything done.  The nice thing is that you are helping callers with important information that they couldn't get otherwise.  The work is very rewarding.
bad,"The typical day at work consists of reading scripts and following strict company policies. The HR is ridiculous however, they have outstanding supervisors"
bad,"When I worked at this place they would give you ""trainings"" which were just a 3 page pdf to read over. They'd block out about 90 minutes to do them, though.  Once I didn't have a supervisor and had one of these trainings and left to get ice cream and nobody noticed.  I recently met someone else who still works there and they told me this still hasn't changed. It's a good job if you want to goof off, but if you want an actual job you should maybe look somewhere else."
bad,"I m p r o v e m e n t   needed."
bad,"A typical day at work is to make sure you come in prepared to take calls all day long. Also, if you have any questions or concerns, don't bother asking your supervisor or manager anything because they knew nothing. It's as if they trained the CSR and the supervisors (some, not all) just sit at their desk, gossip, tell CSR personal business and get attitudes with the person asking questions. This was not a great place to work. I would also like to point out that there are fake reviews posted on april 25th, 2014, which was the houston sites last day. This place lacks professionals. Again, the fake reviews must stop. This place was filled with con artist and incompetents."
bad,"A typical day at GDIT is hell. This is a very stressful job. You have to be blessed for this place. You have to have patience with not just the beneficiaries, but the employees as well! That's exactly what General Dynamics has taught me. The management sucks. The are very unorganized, and you rarely find supervisors/managers that actually care about their employees. IF you do, it wont be your supervisor or manager. The co-workers... nobody comes to work to actually WORK, but to gossip and for a fashion show. You would think you're back in high school. This place wouldn't know how to spell professional if it stared them in their face! The hardest part of the job is the strictness. I mean there is no reason why they have to be so strict. In one of the meetings they said it's for the contract. Because they are in competition with other companies, they want to be the best. Honestly, you get fired for speaking your opinion about the company because they don't want higher authority to find out how they really treat the employees. They said that in another meeting! Truthfully, the only enjoyable part of the day is going home. I dont know about you, but I like working where I feel appreciated and welcome. However, to each is own. Work at your own risk."
bad,I accomplished all assigned work in accordance with established standards. I was complimented by my management regularly yet was affected by Reduction In Force while I was on vacation.
bad,Run... This place has no positives. No raises. No promotions. Horrible work culture. I do not know how they stay in business. This place is ran on the good ol boy system.
bad,"At the time, I was a single mom newly separated. I had to miss work due to court dates, doctors visits for myself and my children. GDIT would not accept the doctor notes to excuse absences. This led me to have no choice but to voluntarily resign."
bad,Was told what was need to make me take the job and now its a nightmare. Stay far away from this company. Salary is a joke and the benefits are not worth the cost and pain you have to go through for them.
bad,"This company seriously doesn’t know anything about human services. They were contracted to Medicare and cams but only cared about their employees who built their war machines (tanks, naval ships, aircraft). People that worked for the company close to 15 years had never NEVER received a raise. Only recently when the labor board was called and investigated General Dynamins did they give a raise to their human service location employees. This company is very sketchy and will do anything they can to their employees to save a buck"
bad,General Dynamics technology was not a bad place to work but it wasn’t the best. Hard hours to work around and stricked protocall. They where a good employer but I wouldn’t recommend.
bad,"GDIT is the worst job I have ever had in my entire career. They treat you as a number instead of as a human being or even an employee. The supervisors and especially the managers do not communicate well. If and/or when you ask for help or if you have a question, you almost always never get help or get your questions answered. I worked in the Hattiesburg, MS call center as a customer service representative for Medicare. I honestly didn't mind taking calls and helping people over the phone. It was the culture and the way that GDIT treated me and other employees that made me want to leave. I noticed my health was starting to get worse. I started gaining weight. I did get depressed at times. The only pro I can think of is GDIT has great insurance benefits. Also, the only way to get promotions and pay raises is to apply through their website. I would not recommend this job to anyone, even my worse enemy."
bad,"As an employee I would take calls on a daily basis this included general questions , co worker support questions and supervisor calls for irate upset callers, address issues or re route to appropriate persons for resolution  . I learned all lines of business to support my job title . I learned leadership, and a the capability of being the best of the best . This job taught me that you can be whatever you wish , it is based on hard work and dedication. I feel like we could have been more appreciated for our outstanding work , I feel management could have been more hands on instead of being so critical and petty. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co workers they made the place tolerable on those bad days and we all helped each other to get through the bad times."
bad,"Overall the company is so large that it is difficult for one employee to make a difference.  The company lives in fear of audit scrutiny or ending up in the Washington Post.  Senior leadership is not tied into the missions of their customers, and is only driven by making financial targets."
bad,"This place use to be an awesome place to work, then upper management started making unnecessary changes and made it the worst place to work, lots of favoritism from upper management to individuals they like and want to advance up within the company."
bad,You learn how health insurances work. You learn about tax credits and how its applicable. Help consumer have health coverage without seeing their medical history is a +.
bad,"It was a terrible place the only thing nearly enjoyable about GDIT is the training, this place will literally hire anyone, in our training class we literally had a woman Over dose in our training room and she was back in class 2 day's later, apparently you are allowed to fail 3 drug tests before you get fired."
bad,"While working there for the second time, they converted all temporary employees to regular employees and laid off shortly after.  They offered 30 positions to 270 people."
bad,"Stressful.  Handicap parking limited.  Picnic tables for smokers, none for nonsmokers.  Bathrooms often without paper towels.  Supervisors don't care."
bad,"The benefits are great but the atmosphere and pay compensation is HORRIBLE for the DRAMA you are put through on this job.Did not like the rotation of bidding for hours or bidding to keep your current schedule. Quality was never on the same page as one could see your graded call as great and  another QC rep could see it as horrible. If you were like, it was graded with high marks; but if you were not a boot- licker, your graded calls could be down in the dumps"
bad,"Excellent pay, fair benefits, good managers and supervision was in the minority. A lot of favoritism, big attitudes (management and staff) and micromanagement."
bad,After working for this company for two years they just decided to close down the site with very short notice. No compensation just good bye. Then it took 5 weeks to get my unemployment.
bad,"This is a very stressful job. I worked with insurance for years, but i sat next to people that was selling insurance to customers and they didn't know what they were doing. It was very frustrating."
bad,"There was not much opportunity to participate in other activities in the building because I was bilingual, but all those who were not bilingual get to participate in all of the activities. There was time for English CSR's off the phone but not for bilingual."
bad,"Worked for this company for several years, no job security worked two years got laid off the twice, terrible trainers(CFPB/BCRC Las cruces) , bad management, low pay(based on the local similar jobs. only upside good benefits."
bad,"Time allowable for call is inappropriate for duties/tasks to be performed on call, for example call time must be under 6 minutes however application takes 20-30 minutes to complete. Standards need to match for this should not be a timed process...the company goes with quantity over quality; quite unfortunate."
bad,"General Dynamics is an aerospace and defense company that offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; shipbuilding; and communication and IT systems and solutions."
bad,I have never worked for a company as micromanaged as this company. I'm an educated adult and have a variety of experience in different fields. This company treats everyone as a number and not by experience or special training. Its completely ran by who knows who.
bad,"The pay is $11.63 per hour, and no matter how long you work there or how many different skills you are forced to learn the pay stays the same.  Twice a year your schedule will change when shift bid happens, you are led to believe the schedule you were hired for will be permanent.  You are a temporary employee upon being hired, you are led to believe you are a permanent employee.  You are NOT told any of this when you are hired."
bad,"A typical day at work is you come in on the dot of the hour, take calls all day. Watching management and supervisors acting unprofessionally. Not knowing what to do or how to do it. All they cared about was attendance and barely even that.  They had their favorites and their favorites got away with everything. I learned from management is that most of them are professional con artist/liars. There were a few good ones who did their work and stayed out of drama but it was few. I liked my co-workers, even though I wish they would have been more selective with their hiring process. They hired criminals and wackos. The hardest part of the job, is coming to work every day having to deal with the upper management and the incompetent supervisors. The most enjoyable part is that I met great people with a bright future ahead of them. I wish management would have treated us with more respect. Great people were employed by GDIT, many of them just weren't management."
bad,"Lack of complete knowledge, mass confusion, unattainable metrics."
bad,"Do to job security at GD, I would rather spend extra time looking for a full time job with more stable company and caring, that also means with health ins and so on."
bad,"No family work life balance, had 5 supervisors in under one year! Stressful and not rewarded for the overtime I worked. LA state dept. of labor did investigation on wages & contract and GDIT was forced to give us a raise. They listed our job title as general clerks. Some Government contractors are liars and cheats! Just saying, this was not my first rodeo with big Gov't contractors."
bad,"Its NOT FLEXIBLE HOURS! OR SHIFTS, its 3 different shifts n that's that, not one hour off of that shift or one hour later.Only EXACTLY THAT SHIFT LISTED No part time, only full time. U can only miss 40 HRS n u fired! NO DOCTORS NOTES ACCEPTED!!, YES, ITS LEGAL, THEY DOOO NOT ACCEPT DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL NOTES...so forget it if u have a spouse or child sick or EVEN Worse--  dying!!"
bad,"Hopefully it has changed since ive been there but it was extremely hostile when i was there. Management was allowed to scream at their employees. Doors were slammed, tables were hit. Toddler rages were allowable by grown men. It was a very yucky place to work."
bad,"Worked there for 3 months, was horrible. Started out fed with a firehose, literally a couple of days having all types of information just thrown at you. Job aids and documentation are scattered across shared drives and repos instead of being searchable via something like Confluence or a wiki. Then were assigned tasks to just go and do, with a minimum of mentoring. Expected to not struggle with things, and just come ask the team leads who are absent from their office for a majority of the time. ""Just stay in your lane and fix what your task calls for, leave other problems alone"". Ticketing system and customer use cases were completely unclear on the work that needed to be done, and management was unwilling to do anything to make it any clearer. Peer review process is at once both perfunctory and draconian; unnecessary paperwork and no assurance of quality. Overall, the company is rooted in mediocrity and ""we do it because it's the way it's always been done"". After all of that suffering, I was let go without any explanation or counseling beforehand."
bad,"The company needs a lot to pursue some of its targets. In many areas it doesn't know what it doesn't know and it will not accept that as a possibility. For example, there is no/tiny market research including competitive analysis. Get that! A $9B company hoping to hit $15B with no real market awareness. How can strategy be achieved with zero situational awareness?"
bad,"Doing the actual work is easy, however management walks around with an invisible bullwhip. They will hire anything off the streets even though they perform background and drug tests. I think one of the lowest things I saw from management was them walking around looking under the womens desk to see if the dresses or skirts were to short."
bad,Working here was like working at a high school. Employees when I was there were rude and hostile. I even had to be pulled out of training because a co worker thought I said something about her having her cell phone when I was actually asking a question about the material and she wanted to fight me. This is supposed to be a government agency and it was a big joke.
bad,"All day you talk on the phone for 8 hours and have to tell people they don’t qualify for insurance and then they cry and break your heart, after that the management is ridiculous and I truly believe they have no idea what’s going on. Maybe If the pay was equal to the other call centers I would have stayed and tolerated it all but basically I’m not working a 14/15.00 per hour job for 10.00. Training is good and has amazing teachers but once you get on the floor no one helps or is rude coming to tell you how you spent too much time on aux or came back from lunch 2 minutes late"
bad,"If a job with a lot of stress and poor management isn't your thing, then this job definitely isn't for you. I would not recommend to anyone to work at GDIT"
bad,I wouldnt recommend the gdit unless they get some differnt contracts. My supervisor was great but other departments were awful. Customers get very irate with you.
bad,a typical day at general dynamics is very stressful. people cursing you out on the phone managers dont care about the stree you go through they are more concern about you being on the phone
bad,I worked with GDIT for 5 years in the healthcare department. I have heard many great things about GDIT overall but this division is not like the rest of the company. Good benefits but you may have a hard time advancing. They don't treat their performers well so if you work hard or do the bare minimum you will get the same feedback.
bad,The sups are a lot of unconcerned people.. they don’t explain all the rules they write u up for.. and didn’t do anything for their employees that suffered from hurricane Michael
bad,okay place to work not good management    not enough pay for the job you are required to do.  get cussed out on a daily basis and people blame you for everything that happens with social security because they think you control the government
bad,"Call center.  Constantly on phone.  Breaks and lunches timed to the second.  Demerit for exceeding scheduled breaks over a second.  Incredibly fast paced call center, taking one phone call after another.  Calls monitored and evaluated.  Demerit for one tiny detail off topic/script."
bad,"If looking for something temporary part time this may work, company show no employee appreciation, low pay, promotion only temporary, no pay raises"
bad,How my day starts at work is I get to work between 7:50am and 8:00am I log into my phone check my emails and start answering calls.
bad,"Guest service agent for obama care."
bad,"This place is not a good place to work at, they lie about there shifts and hours. They dont care about if you are sick or if your kids are sick. But the other employees are great to work with they treat you like you are part of the family. The management department dont care about you. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the point system. and the different rules. The enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy."
bad,"The job was great, you were able to speak to many different people for different walks of life."
bad,"Great coworkers and benefits, however management was poor."
bad,When i first worked here it was great then the longer i worked here it started feeling like a nightmare. Benefits are great and the pay sucks for basic csr
bad,Was not promised what I signed up for. Many wishful promises. There was much moral and team building but they decided to replace work over national security goals.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know my co-workers better.  Having team building activities allows you to communicate with the people that you work with outside of the office better.
bad,"2400 Oakdale Blvd, Coralville, IA 52241"
bad,"Suppervisor did not want to do her job, ask question for support and help. My suppervisor did not want to assist with helping me.She had her favorites and did not care about  helping me."
bad,"great place to work at, friendly managers friendly people , quiet place and everyone minds their own business, no drama unlike other places ive worked at"
bad,"I didnt have much support from my manager during stressful times,I didnt like the fact that my job actually wasnt customer service as they told me in my interview"
bad,I didnt like working for this company at all. I felt they were dishonest and sneaky. I felt as if this company was very rude toward the workers. This was very upsetting to me.
bad,The company is disguised as plantation. If you are not any color other than white you will not get far.  I wouldn't recommend this company to anybody.
bad,"Productive, fun, professional work environment. Most enjoyable part of the job would be the achievement celebrations. Management is laid back and reasonable."
bad,I worked as a contractor here for 6 months. The funding was low on the AWS project so they had to let a lot of contractors go. I would not suggest working here on a contract.
bad,This place is boring I work there. The training isnt long enough to learn things will. It is very disorganized and everything changes like policies and what not. The place has horrible HRs which do not know I-9 information and will not accept my forms.
bad,"The management doesn't do their job and your schedules are constantly changing so you never know the correct time to clock in or out. The company itself is good, but the management is terrible!"
bad,"Negative atmosphere, unrealistic standards, outdated systems. The culture of the company could really use a facelift."
bad,"The people were ok to work with. the thing I did not like about the place was the stress it cause on a daily basis. although helping people was good, the co workers were like high schoolers, very immature"
bad,"Very micro managing, very unpleasant place to work, pay was decent. Management constantly changing things making employees aware, not honest work."
bad,I was able to grow my skills significantly over the 14 years of employment and I found the environment stimulating. There was an open door policy between the staff and managers.
bad,I was hired in the early days of the F-16 FSD program and GDFW hired a huge excess of Material Department personnel.  There was nothing to occupy our time and there was no challenge to this job.  I resigned and opened my own businesses.
bad,I would not recommend Sandy GDIT but I would recommend other center in the company. Other sites have competent management.
bad,"The coworkers within Tier 2 and Tier 3 groups were the worst.  They cursed all of the time and made it hard for Tier 1 workers to speak with customers on the phone.  The customers could hear the cursing in the background, yet GDIT Managers did nothing to curtail the situation.  Very hard for Tier 1 employees to get ahead.  Scheduling for Tier1 employees was the worst as managers did not take into consideration that women should not be working the 3:30pm to 11:30pm shift, especially if you were taking the metrorail system home."
bad,"Avoid this General Dynamics company.  Other locations like Electric Boat in Groton, CT are better.  Shipyard has not enough parking and you have to take a shuttle in."
bad,but the cutomers were almost always angry because of the affordable care act and most of the time it was over cost of insurance
bad,I'm a hard worker Into computers and repairs have great customer service i attend school to become a computer engineer AND THE PLACE IS NICE
bad,I can remember say I want a sit down job... and I found it in this company but it was very boring when there was no calls coming thru..
bad,"Advance Resolution Center Rep, no room to grow in the company"
bad,"it doesn't give you any benefits."
bad,Customer service job.  Answering phones. Trouble shooting website that consumer would use.
bad,I give the company a five star review. I enjoyed and grew to love my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was being laid off and not being able to health consumers get health coverage. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to get low income middle class consumer health coverage.
bad,Not having the right answer to help the consumer on receiving affordable coverage on a fix income.
bad,"These clowns are a joke - For a 'Help Desk Technican' position, which would required existing TOP SECRET clearance, or obtainable in 6 months, an associates degree with 3 years experience...It pays a whoppin' $12.50 an hour. It's no wonder they've had the job posted for 2 months and continues to go unfilled. People that stand on street corners spinning signs for any given business makes $11/hr. Wise up morons...You get what you pay for."
bad,Vast opportunity for advancement and schedule changes once the time permits. Thoroughly enjoyed personable colleagues.
bad,Good people loved the location and commute to work. No stress or pressure just perform and get things done.
bad,"enjoyed working with CSR's, HR does not follow company policies, very predjudice."
bad,Terrible place to work. Awful management. Worker abuse. Favoritism.
bad,"A welcoming environment. Staff and co-workers worked together to complete government contracts on ship repair. I felt like a part of their team, even though I was a temporary employee."
bad,I loved my job working here. I loved the atmosphere that myself and my co-workers created. I enjoyed the team I assisted and the people that I helped to manage. There is 0 job security here. You can put in 80 hours a week and they will still lay you off as if you are nothing. You don't have a chance to move to other positions. I was moved to the location I worked at 6 hours from any family or friends and promised way more than they ever delivered. I do not recommend working for them if you are looking to have a career. I will stress to you that any promise they make to you will be meaningless even when it is written in black and white. My experience may be one of a kind but I will speak the truth about how it was for me. I wouldn't recommend them to any up and coming professional or someone who has worked for years. They will not value you. No matter how hard you work or what you give to them. Unorganized company. Your opinions will be unheard in meetings. I can't count how many times that I came up with a solution to a problem or a way to re-organize something and it was ignored or just tossed aside. This wasn't unique  to me. I saw this happen to my co-workers and other inside the company daily. Changes to problems were simply ignored. Then when the contract we were on started to be fined we were blamed because we didn't create solutions. The same solutions that were tossed. This is not a next-generation solution. This is a company that is set in its ways and will not make the strides it needs to stay on top at least in the area I worked. They will not have the contract I
bad,"Working at GDIT was stressful. No help with management. Orientation was helpful, but everything was really stressful and confusing. But we also was able to get on the floor in our own area & took calls for a week with help. But once all the orientation was done, you was stuck on your own & having to find your own answers to give to customers."
bad,"I loved working here, but on June of 2019, one of three major lay offs occurred site unseen and left many of my friends without good paying jobs in remote areas.  After the first major lay off, I was lied to and told that there would be no more layoffs, however, another occurred out of the blue and then I was informed last week that I will be laid off as well sometime in September, but I was kept on to mop up the mess that senior management made.  I am expected to bust my back in the last month for a company that tossed me to the curb because the program was “unprofitable” and yet the day before the program was announced to be shut down, there was a town-hall gloating about how profitable the company is.  What a joke.  Such a dishonest place.  I would give a zero star rating if I could."
bad,was very hard had to speak with people thru pre written scripts and unable to think for yourself. Girls would fight among themselves. This company is to hard to please to easy .  Schedule was easy to have
bad,Under payed dont care about there emplyees.it dont matter how much you kno they dont hire for permanent position.two years before any kind of benefits sad place to work.
bad,This is like every other call center. There is limited room for advancement. There is not an flexibility with scheduling time off for personal reasons. There is training offered in the beginning of the
bad,Answer all incoming calls regarding Medicare. Explained the difference of Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage Plans. Provided all information on program that are available for Low Income through the state.
bad,"Working at GDIT was difficult.  The employee were hired just to meet the quotas, not because they were qualified.  Supervisors ignored questions from their reps.  No one had accountability."
bad,"Only a few people work the job they applied and were hired for. Most Engineers end up as Supervisors, which are nothing more than glorified babysitters to watch over the out of control union that has the company scared out of its wits. Toxic leadership bred from the belly of the good ole boys club. In the last 18 months, more engineers have left, than have been fired; this somehow does not concern corporate. management has restructured 5 times in 2 years, in reality, it is just musical chairs for incompetent managers who failed to keep up with technology when the internet became mainstream; most managers 30+ years at company, and equipment is from WWII. There is no such thing as work-life balance, have heard engineer say ""I worked 1 hour away from my house, and saw my family more at that job than I do here"". Avoid at all costs, the turnover rate is astounding"
bad,"They are always looking for ways to fire you! Everything you do they have something to say. If you are not a loud, messy person, they don't want you there. Its like they treat the good hard working people like dirt and they treat the ones who are always using vulgar language better... It is a big buddy system. So if you don't fit into the category of what they say is ""normal"" then do not waste your time!!!"
bad,Everyone and everything was new and it was really tough to get things going but at the end we found a way to keep what we can control going. Culture was all about working then clock out and go home.
bad,"The Affordable Care Act was very confusing for the consumers.  Quality on calls was graded by someone different each time, most times you did not have the answers they needed and you were held responsible for not having that information."
bad,"It's not as good as before any more. At certain location, they took advantage of employees. They lay off employees but they even don't pay the normal two week salary. Some of them had worked there for over 10 or 20 years."
bad,Had the opportunity to travel to a couple of Foreign countries which a good experience. Some of the people working here are good people.
bad,The company is not stable and will need more improvement before I can reconsider but has good benefits.
bad,General Dynamics is the biggest scam known to mankind. They don't assist in job transfers when your contract is up. They will pay for your security clearance which is a big plus but the contracts are short and the managers don't seem to care about their employees.
bad,"HR is nothing but rude when you need something. Management has no idea what they're talking about or what is going on at any given time. I watched three ""supervisors"" literally running around and grabbing their hair because they were ""stressed"" about where new employees were going to sit...and the entire side of the building was empty. This place is an absolute joke. Management got jobs by picking their noses. They have no actual skills. Don't work here."
bad,"This company does not offer pay increase. Job career changes"
bad,No raises and lack of promoting within as well as not fulfilling their word on future leadership roles. There is rampant drug abuse in the workplace.. not a Place I would recommend for professionals.
bad,"A typical day at work would be answering phone calls and enrolling people in the obama care health plan. The hardest part of the job, was telling people they didn't qualify for insurance. The workplace culture was fun. I enjoyed working with different people with different attitudes."
bad,"this company doesnt care about their employees or their employees well being, they are not professional or courteous. the benefits are great but the job and work environment sucks"
bad,"Take calls helping consumers with healthcare.gov and advising how to apply for coverage, management is very unprofessional and tries to find ways to micro manage"
bad,"Very unprofessional bosses and HR are very uninformed about employee rights and regulations. Unfortunately you are just another ""worker"" who's replaceable. You are always be expected to work overtime or be at work regardless of what personal matters you are dealing with outside of work."
bad,"Good starting point for recent college graduates, no growth potential past first year of employment.  Lack of qualified management."
bad,"Poor Management"
bad,Starting out you will be trained for three weeks which is great yet they only verbally education when the job is hands on. You will be taught their phone system for a day than tested to be thrown out on the floor. Regardless of experience on taking calls you will still get points for failing your first call. Management is very shady will throw you under the bus and the work place is very ghetto loud and unorganized. Their is sexist mangers and very inappropriate conversation always taking place on the floor.
bad,This place was great to work for. I was able to learn so many things from them. Was able to move up in the company by showing I was capable to do several jobs.
bad,This is a temp job to say the least. No room for advancement. No career opportunities either. Co-workers are great but there is no future here.
bad,"If CMS knew how GDIT managed their call centers they would pull the contract immediately!!! The company needs to clean house on the directors and deputy directors levels as they keep constant chaos and confusion going within the different sites. Managers don't  have a clue and they don't follow their own policies and procedures.  Supervisor and manager positions are filled based on whether you are liked not whether you perform, are qualified or meet and of the requirements for a position. . HR is a joke and incompetent. The Company's Core Values: trust, integrity  and teamwork are not practiced by leadership, and those who do try   are ostracized and targeted by their superiors. The bottom line for this company is ""headcount"" (the numbers). CSR's run the sites. And as long as they keep the seats filled they will continue to take CMS' s money."
bad,"Was a great company to work for when it was Axsys Tech. but when General Dynamics bought them out the company went into a tailspin. Very top heavy in management."
bad,the company is great as long as you happen to be placed on a good contract.
bad,"When I first started, it was a dream job in which I learned something new each day, then the mood began to sour due to the lack of work."
bad,"I enjoyed my time at this location not from the job itself, but because of the people I worked with. Some were great people, some were not so great, but everyone worked as a team for the most part. "
bad,"Supervisors did not follow through with your request for help and when you made a mistake because of something they were supposed to do, then you would get the blame."
bad,GDIT was an oppressive culture with low pay and high demands.  Performance evaluations were terrible along with productivity demands.  I had a great manager which made life bearable.  GDIT closed this diviosion and l;aid everyone off.
bad,It was very relaxing and boring but most of all it was okay. I learned how to interact with customers. I learned more about computers and I also learned how to multi task.
bad,"The company only wants you there to keep up their numbers. They don't genuinely care about personal or health issues and don't except doctor's notes, even if you've been hospitalized."
bad,"Although the corporate leadership in VA speaks highly of cultural change (which we embrace), local management laughs at it and tightly holds onto their punitive working environment with great zeal. Senior leadership in AZ truly needs to be shown the door. Behind closed doors, employees (even the best) are often spoke of with great distain. Very Sad."
bad,"There was always miscommunication between management and it affected the workplace and employees very negatively.  In the end, miscommunication and favoritism is what cost me the job that my quality was very high at."
bad,"This place was a nightmare and I stayed way too long. No offence but they pick up anybody to work there. This was not a professional job or environment. they managed this place like a high school or worst. The so called ""supervisor"" were disrespectful and down right rude. They forced you as a customer service to work under very nasty conditions and humiliate you have of the time. If you were rude  you will fit right in. I am glad I left."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of answering inbound calls from students around the country who required assistance in filling out financial aid forms. Most of the time the students wanted to know if they completed the forms correctly and wanted to know if there were any discrepancies and if so how to correct them. After forms were reviewed, they were sent to colleges and universities to which student applied. Students were then informed that the rest of the financial aid process will be completed at the financial aid office at their school campus."
bad,The work day was unorganized and hectic. If you had to go to the restroom you were required to ask. The main goal was to rush the client through process to keep your call minutes down.
bad,I have nothing good or bad to say. It was a reason they closed their doors. You took the good with the bad. You have great employees and then you had the mediocre ones.
bad,"it was a job that ended too soon. not too many jobs for upward mobility with the company."
bad,Call center job processing complaints for the CFPB. The consumers that you end up dealing with are sometimes verbally abusive and it gets mentally tiring.
bad,"Management don't support there employees, no growth potential. Unprofessional managers and hostile  work environment. Micro managers out of the woodwork. Not a good place to work."
bad,"A terrible work environment culture. It is ethically challenged. You have no way of expressing your frustration. The levels of evaluation is questionable. Quality personnel who are not experienced are evaluating  senior-level  complicated  Marketplace calls. The training consist of getting emails and maybe twice a year in a classroom with refresher courses. Matrix of performance changes midstream which affect your performance and your scoring. You are asked to lie to Consumers. Example, consumer asks to speak with a supervisor,  and they're just speaking with an experienced representative.  Do not have the authority to make any changes. That is a failure to all consumers. Managers refuses to take calls, when consumers are asking to speak with my manager or speak with my supervisors' manager. Because they are the most aggressive calls. Many of these consumers are looking for assistance. Difficult to do in an environment that's not offering any assistance to their senior employees and placed in a black hole. Just like the consumer.  And yet they said words professionalism, I believe most of them have never been in an environment of professionalism. Their actions are amateurish at best and immature, and ethically challenged. No professionalism. What a joke."
bad,I've worked for this company multiple times in the Civilian Sector. It has been a bad experience both times. The way that the company is run makes you want to quit. If you are okay with only earning $11 an hour with no potential for a raise then I guess it's fine. Trying to advance within the company itself is very difficult to do. In most cases you don't know whether or not you've received the position in an official correspondence. You usually find out through the grapevine. The people are the only pleasant thing at this company.
bad,It could have been a nice job but their process to go from temp to perm is so slow that it is beyond frustrating.  Management is in no hurry for change or making any descisions.
bad,"GDIT leadership knowingly allows or turns their head to unethical behavior within their contracts. They have horrible benefits that actually managed to get worse this year. Not a family company at all. If you want to work for a place that cares only about the dollar, over works you, under pays you and approves for you to work outside the scope of your contract- this place is for you."
bad,"I worked at GDIT as a transition employee from a smaller company that GDIT bought. The benefits of GDIT were not comparable to other companies. I went from a PPO with a low co-pay to high deductible plan with an HSA. Vacation was always blacked out after GDIT took over, the accruement of vacation was lowered when GDIT took over. The management was a very poor class of people. They played favoritism and still promoted people based on ""seniority"" instead of proven skills and knowledge. Even though vacation was always blacked out, certain people would always be able to take vacation whenever they wanted."
bad,"A typical day at work involved  security, putting items away in locker, signing into system and answering calls from consumers. During the day, continuing training was also required.  "
bad,"No job security, no pay advances, misleading information provided by managers.  Once hired, you are responsible for finding your own work within the company."
bad,N/A.............Learned to have more patience consumers are very demanding
bad,"This is a very hard place to work for, you are just a number not a person."
bad,The contracts were unstable and the morals of who team were low. People were placed but had no experience in doing what they were hired for. The blame game started and the good people were blamed. So decided to leave.
bad,Visited schedule and resources on a daily basis without a final decision. No idea of what each day would bring.
bad,"No room for advancement, and there are to many in work relationships going on between mgmt and CSR."
bad,Worked from home as a contract worker.Little to no contact with co-workers or staff.
bad,"Typical day, you show up, meet with superiors if the priorities are uncertain"
bad,its a ok company to work for. company needs a new management team to run its company. the morale in the work area is poor
bad,"Hopefully some things have changed. When I was there it was a lot of drama and mess. The OT was great. Once you hit your 40 hours for the week, everything else was OT."
bad,General Dynamics/Maximus was a pretty easy job for pretty good pay and benefits. The problem with it is managers that seem out of their element or just unconcerned and other employees who act like jerks because they know the managers like them and they can get away with it.
bad,Everything about this job work wise was amazing. The one and only BAD thing about my job was my boss. She was a horrible person and even more horrible boss. I worked for this company for 2 years and she was the only reason I left.
bad,"The company may be decent, but the management and leadership are not good. There is way too much politics which gets in the way of truly performing and getting work done."
bad,"Back 3 companies ago, it was nice to work for.  It was team oriented and promoted a good balance between work and activities outside of work.  Employees were recognized for their work.  Now it seems that all management cares about is making money at the expense of their employees' happiness.  Corporate is trying to improve this but lower management could care less."
bad,My initial impression has changed since working here. A lot of hallway conversations and politics that get in the way of concrete information that could alleviate concerns. Retention is an issue due to this.
bad,General dynamics was a very unorganized company to work for. Being a supervisor there were so many changes but not a positive outcome. Many things and rules would change last minute and require quick result but not enough time to conquire. The teams changed to often to even build your team and coach them to were they needed to be.  There was a lot of turnover but rehiring the same person they would terminate. The managers were not interactive enough they depended on supervisors to make a majority of difference with there commands but no support. The building ended up closing down due to the outcome of non experienced management
bad,"The insurance was great. However, there were arrogant people in place of position that should have never been in such a positon. The training is subpar and if you get a supervisor with a stick up HER butt, she is useless unless you kiss her butt...Im no butt kisser"
bad,"This is a Call Center for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A typical day is answering phone calls from Medicare and Medicaid recipients to provide information regarding their Medicare benefits to include claims information, drug/medical plan enrollment and disenrollment."
bad,"I have a degree in management and applied for a management position. I did not receive an interview and was overlooked for CSRs who slept on the job and were late most of the time. I was always on time, stayed late and came in early when they asked, and never called out of work. If you are looking for a job where you can advance to a Supervisor or Manager, always be late and sleep on the clock. They will promote you. I would not work here."
bad,Managers work remote and didn't have clue as to what it took to perform the job duties. The company was ok the management was really bad. Wouldn't work for them again.
bad,"A typical day at work is slowly walking customers through getting (Health) Insurance, sometimes getting yelled at, sometimes consoling an upset customer. Nothing is allowed at your desk, including phones, paper, wallet, writing utensils, you name it. You can bring a small snack, but not lunch to your desk. You do learn a bit about insurance, and the management is nice, but not efficient. The workplace culture is pretty boring, and seems to be a workplace for persons wanting part time if they aren't employed elsewhere. Hardest part of the job is getting through the day trying not to die from boredom in between calls. The most enjoyable part is your break, which will be the most valued part of your day. All in all, it's not a bad temporary job, as bonuses and pay is generous, but not a very friendly long-term job. (Also you get paid training)."
bad,Did not like the culture at all they did not care to implement a culture. Management never seen eye to eye everything seem to be done on the fly and they did not care much about accommodating they’re employees
bad,"It's a ""I have to have a job"" job. It's got good pay but management sucks and training sucks. They prepare you for what they think you will get calls about but you never really do."
bad,It was an alright place to work. The best part about it to me were the people that I met. I did not care too much for the work there and the systems would always go down so that would make it very frustrating.
bad,Management is difficult to communicate with. Seems like everyone is out for themselves and don't really care about the employees. The environment is not a good one.
bad,"job is easy enough once you get used to information and systems. however, it does become quite repetitive after working for company a while. good location however you are limited to spend breaks/lunches in the office and no canteen."
bad,"My reviews on this company is negative because of the management views is un professional I feel if you have never had a write up about anything because you made one mistake with a phone you was fired being there are 3 process into being fired and some management bypass the 3 process and fire you because they don't care for you."
bad,Site closed. Poor management. Lack of oversight. Hopefully the remaining sites are better managed. Very low pay for the industry and the area. Enough said.
bad,"General Dynamics is a great company to work for depending on the contract. The Call center environment is to lax and there isn't any consistency within the center as far as policies. However, the pay is a good start for those that are in school or those who have not attended college but need work experience."
bad,"I learn by being challenged...I live by ""do unto others,"" therefore, I always place myself in the shoes of the client in order to resolve any issues to their and my employers satisfaction."
bad,"They expect a lot of you, but they give you nothing in exchange!  The place it's in a extremely unhealthy environment.  They never clean the carpets, the dust is literally everywhere consuming your lungs.  Management is horrible as well as Human Resources.  They don't have a good team recruitment, they hire anyone to do the job.  Supervisors are way unprofessional and desire nothing good for you.  If you want to be miserable, then you go work there!"
bad,"bad benefits. terrible management. even worse HR.  They have a major turn over rate.  They pay minimum wages for maximum amount or work.  Also, their hiring process is very long and drawn out."
bad,"The time i was there it was a facility of over 3000 employees and lots of learning very stressful environment no note on paper no cell phone no nothing to write you had to memorize  mostly everything . But i had a great team to work for as well and fantastic team mgr that she was helpful in every aspect, The training was for 4 weeks and lots of scripting . Good place to work for lots of concentration. Good people as far employees they usually mind there own business"
bad,Military work for satellites to replace some that were still being communicated with for 60 years. No company standards existed and once a project was completed they would review it based on what the supervisor remembered from previous projects that couldn't be viewed by contract engineers.
bad,"not sure where to begin. apply here and find out, its a good company depending what department you work in. so come check it out and enjoy it if you make it in"
bad,"The upper Management was very nice to deal with and he was very helpful to me, but my immediate supervisor was awful to deal with he only cared about himself."
bad,"Its ok to work. "
bad,"Company benefits are great.  But management are not.  They adding more rules that makes your work complicated.  Call Center here in Las Cruces, NM are very difficult on there company rules.  You have to take the next call after 5 seconds you finish from your previous call.  You cannot you ACW to go to the bathroom.  It's a stressful job.  I'm amaze that this is sub contractor company for the Federal Government such as Medicare and  they don't required a secret clearance for there employee which dealing on sensitive information."
bad,"My typical day at work was slightly stressful, the management is horrible plus a few of the supervisors. The most enjoyable thing about coming to work was being able to help someone in need who is having issues understanding."
bad,Loading up your computer and seeing how many outbound calls you had to make in a certain time period for the day. I learned a lot about health insurance. Management was at times unprofessional. I had some awesome co-workers within my team/isle. Hardest part of the job was not having proper information in front of me so I could perform duties that were requested by customers. Most enjoyable part of the job was decent pay.
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist others in getting health insurance. the work environment was very uptight. management was horrible.
bad,On the phone all of your day breaks are 2 15s 1 30 and management very unprofessional
bad,"Upper Management is terrible. You cannot expect a long term career at JBLM due to if the work is not there the Management surely will also be missing. A very stressful and uneventful 8 years I have put up with.... it's only a paycheck, you are not allowed to take any pride in the company or your work."
bad,The hardest pat of this role was ensuring that all the callers where on the sam epage meeting all the CMS Guidelines.
bad,GDIT is a company that is not employee focused and does nothing to provide a career path for younger people. Only those employees who belong to the manager's list of favorites will be provided an opportunity to advance.
bad,"No communication between management and the rest of the staff. Felt completely disconnected from the company as a whole. Seemingly no room for advancement. Many cliques and plenty of bureaucracy. Management actively **ignored** my requests for help during a time of personal struggle, and later penalized me for my performance during that time."
bad,"The role was that of an outside contractor working with a major contractor.  The pay was very good, but the employee was subject to whatever the prime contractor dictated."
bad,Only have a job as long as they have  a contract. If they have to rebid and win you have to interview for the job you are already doing. Except for managers.
bad,"Unprofessional environment, including most of the hiring staff and individuals who would be considered as role models. Very dangerous at times. Fights have literally broken out in the middle of workday and working hours."
bad,I hate it here. They drive you hard and make no sense with the way they do things. The reviewers are totally maladjusted.The reviewers make no sense and split hairs about every little detail.
bad,"day to day directing sub contractors and ensuring materials were ready, at the time work place was a A, hardest part was keeping the sub contractors on schedule. Enjoyed the people I worked with."
bad,It was ok just just impossible to balance work schedule and every day life. And workers are very under paid. Company recently went bankrupt so workers are without job.
bad,"The only way I would recommend this job is if you are in school or really need a job otherwise I would not recommend this job to anyone!!  There is no place for advancement. The rate of pay is ridiculous for everything we have to do.  Literally you spend most of the time on the phone with people who are having bad days and want to take it out on you. You have to be these people's financial adviser, counselor, psychiatrist, etc.  Whenever pay is mentioned, everyone gives this bs explanation.  They claim the rate is appropriate due to the insurance they offer however, they do not give you the option to decline the insurance to be paid more even if you have other coverage already.  If you can, run as far away from this company as you can!!  There is no room for advancement so if you are fine with being a CSR for the rest of you life, then go for it.  The company speaks itself up as a good company due to the discounts they offer, but most of the time the discounts have stipulations that you can't even benefit from.  If you have the option to work somewhere else, anywhere but here you should take that opportunity!!"
bad,they act like they don;t care for the employee or about our community. i think they hurt them selves by not working in the kilgore area and the stress on the employees.
bad,"General Dynamics has been a challenging effort since I was brought on board several months ago. Though I have appreciated the opportunity to grow and advance my customer service skills along with my information technology background, I have found this environment to be difficult to acclimate to and find the lack of communication from management to be an unnecessary stumbling block. Though I excercise my work ethic to the best of my ability every day, I continually find myself experiencing the hassle of investigating why my pay period came up short or why I did not receive a pertinent email that is beneficial to my current role. There is a lack of willingness it appears to provide the team with proper learning tools, and I feel there is more time unnecessarily spent on attempting to decipher problems within the database when it could be made public knowledge. I have experienced the reward of having customers complement my efforts to make them feel like they are truly being taken care of, and that they would rate me extremely high on customer service as a whole."
bad,No shortage of work compared to the shortage of advancement opportunities and recognition for going above and beyond. Co-workers are the best part of the work experience but that is counterbalanced by other less pleasant co-workers and poor upper management.
bad,The workplace was very nice. I enjoy the people I work with in the call center. It was job for me. It was a new type work for me.i enjoy taking calls .
bad,"Such a boring place to work. Not that work is meat to be a playground, but it was difficult maintaining consciousness during my shift. Lack of stimulation accompanied by the inability to pass the time, often 40 minutes between calls. If you love, doing nothing, having no responsibility, and wasting your time for the sake of a paycheck, look no further!"
bad,"Management sucks. The job is pretty easy, its the environment that makes it intolerable. Only tolerated because I needed a job. Would only go back if it was my last resort."
bad,Horrible place to work and the management needed training. The site manager was not equipped to do her job. Too much blame and focus on things that were not important.
bad,Poor talent acquisition model and management. Micromanagement and impervious to reason or sound recruiting practice. Did not understand professional services recruiting or how to create and read tracking reports.
bad,"i would come to work, we would has our morning meetings and get a general lo-down on what expected for that morning. after which the foreman would always ask any question on what needs to be done?? if no spoke up we all would go to our work station and start the day and do our appointed task at the best of our abilities. the hardest thing would be lack of communication in general and the most enjoyable part would be the end of the day."
bad,This location has not many advantages other than a constant flow of complaints from the mid-level management. It does have a nice facility but when it gets subtracted out there is not much left to offer an individual.
bad,"I did not like the time I spent working here. I had a death in the family in another state and they treated me badly about taking time off. There is really nothing more to say, my time at this company was horrible."
bad,"Great work environment just not the place for me."
bad,I really don't know that my review would be fare I worked there when things were not running smoothly. People would sit on hold for four hours and you would have on mad person after the next.You would get to work and just know that it was going to be the longest day. Management for the most part were just as frustrated. I did meet a lot of great people.
bad,"As a weapons engineer, I'm sure this is an excellent place to work.  In a call center environment GDIT has ALOT to learn.  They need to focus on what they are good at."
bad,"It was a big company that gave you good benefits but didn't pay everyone correctly. Micro-managed .. Fast paced, Strict attendance policy, unable to get assistance from HR or anyone to assist me regarding accomodation for me or my child and also identity breach."
bad,"This is a fast paced and ever changing environment so training is an ongoing process. The work can be interesting as you are helping others make the most effective, sometimes lifesaving, decisions about their healthcare. A typical day can be as easy as ordering a new medical card to as complex as comparing and explaining the various health and drug plans to assessing and reporting fraud and more.  "
bad,Was a very dirty job the boss was very difficult to work with and couyld not communicate with employees very well. Coworkers were awesom to work with hardest part of the job was how dirty it was and you got wasnt any enjoable time on the jpb.
bad,Poor management and high turnover rate.  Hiring standards are sub par.  Would not recommend working here.  Only positive I can give is the availability of overtime.
bad,"Nothing to say, good company, free snacks from time to time, good pay, you make a lot of friends, nothing more, helpful management, work around the clock."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,Totally non professional workers and supervisors.  Management is ok.  Need to work on hiring process and be more selective on who they hire.
bad,"Great place to work employees stay for long periods of time, Very seldom do employees retire. Benefits could be improved such as health insurance."
bad,Overall General Dynamics was a good contract job for the time being with long hours although the pay was low and the management was everywhere.
bad,Total chaos. The wrong people were setup as management.  Everything and everyone didn't know whether they were going or coming.  Overall I enjoyed what I was there for and that was to enroll individuals in Healthcare for the affordable care act. The only reason I left was due to the call center closing.
bad,"I would say this is a good place to work. I wish there were more opportunities for advancement. I must say it is hard to get them to be on one accord, and there is a lot of favoritism. I am almost certain that it is probably just the site I work at. but overall, the company as a whole is a pretty good place to work."
bad,"This place over hires for opening season of the ""ACA"" and expects you to put your life on hold for short time. Then you are dismissed til next open enrollment."
bad,"After ten years I was laid off due to budget cuts. The only people that were retained were the friends of the manager. The managers showed a lot of favoritism and sexism. There were no females that were retained on site after the lay offs. A lot of backstabbing and numerous illegal and unethical acts were committed by higher officials. The  money was great but if you value your sense of worth, do not get a job with them. This company only cares about making money, they do not care about those working for them."
bad,Typical day at work very busy and interesting due to the coworker attitude. No opportunity to growth. Excellent income. Management not organize. Job culture in medium level. Lack of communications before make any decision about laid off. Hardest part of the job is the partners and other management personal to make decision without great sense of loyalty and honesty. Frustrated with the decision to do business and take advantage of the employee to then filed position with prejudice with another employee who was not best qualified than me.
bad,"They hire on a lot of employees when they have plenty of work, they are quick to ""release"" employees when work is completed. A well known name in defense but as an American employer, they are no longer a stable and fair company to work for. Company uses outside contractors to fill positions fast. The contracting company quickly fills positions and takes about half of what the employee gets paid. If you get offered a position, remember its likely only temporary. I'm not a job hopper, but with so many companies requiring contracting employees, you suffer with outrageous ins premiums, and your salary being halved with a contracting company. I would not recommend working here unless you are just looking for seasonal employment."
bad,"The information that we have to give our callers, is very vague and we are not able to help them at all."
bad,Typical union labor shop.  Poor to dangerous work environment.  moral is horrible.
bad,"Good job starting out, nice benefits & hours. However, after about a year realized there was little to no opportunity for career advancement. Promotions are based more on favortism & cliques than actual qualifications. And there is no possibility of a raise unless promoted, no matter how long you have worked for the company. Claims representatives do the bulk of the work at this call center, yet they are paid the exact same wage as a temp employee with no possibility of extra compensation for their work, ever. As an employee at Vangent, I felt that my contributions were overlooked and undervalued. Lack of opportunity eventually led me to seek & accept employment at a company offering better pay and greater possibilities."
bad,"Work is very satisfying, especially getting our troops ready for combat and getting them the best possible equipment and training! My fellow instructors and I enjoy our jobs greatly since we all served and want our fellow soldiers to be prepared and come home after deployment safely to their families. On the other hand, the employer is not a great company.....too many faults from low echelon to high echelon...apparently this has been going one for alot of years and we came in on the tail end.... Benefits and pay are great but dedication from company to employee is null and void!!!"
bad,If your in the MRAP field ---RUN-RUN-RUN! GDLS is all about M1 and Strykers...
bad,We had no job security at any moment you could be let go without a days notice. A very pins and needles stressful environment. The actual work itself was easy because we dealt with medicare beneficiaries instead of upset customers. I enjoyed working on the phones helping people but the call center politics made it rough day to day.
bad,"Management is incompetent, rude, and arrogant. Work you are given can be done by lobotomized monkey."
bad,"each job position at a location can be completely independent of the others you see on a daily basis, and each project may be handled across several locations, and management suffers accordingly."
bad,GDIT hires extremely talented people. However in our section the management did their best to run these talented people off.  Management spent time trying to trap employees into doing something wrong.  Our management put effort into building an environment of stress and distrust.
bad,"And poor administrative support. When I filed the application I lived in one state but moved to another to perform the job.  Changed my address with the company.  "
bad,"I really liked helping the consumers be able to sign up for insurance, for most people it was easy. Application process was very easy as well. A lot of people had difficulties receiving health care, and most of my consumers were able to sign up for benefits"
bad,Call center setting that became fast paced during the open enrollment period. It sometimes became overwhelming with non stop back to back phone calls. Definitely was a learning experience.
bad,"Pay was terrible (starts at$13.50) after your performance review you get .25 raise. Managers are terrible. Benefits ok. Location great. Phones always busy, some down time."
bad,Too many politics for advancement. A lot of unprofessional behavior. Enjoyed helping people. Would have stayed had I been able to do something different.
bad,Management was broken and was focused on the bottom line the team I was on had nearly 90% turn over. Just a overall bad experience. I was offered a transfer but decided to leave
bad,The Management Staff needs more training on how to follow policy and updating their knowledge on company changes. They need stricter poilcies on theft and violence on the job site.
bad,"GDLS used to be a workplace of choice but over recent years the leadership has tlaked about how to change and be a leader in the industry as well as the workplace of choice but its really just words that provide an illusion when in reality they continue to support a soloed workforce and leadership. "
bad,It is a high security place and the only electronics allowed in the facility those issued by them. It gave me a view of what the job work place is going to be like.
bad,everything was horrible about this position. I started out there it was great until you were injured and they expected you to work after having a stroke
bad,"This job was horrible. Pay is not worth the abuse you receive on the phone with customers, nor is it enough to survive on...unless you live alone in a cheap place or have someone helping foot the bill."
bad,GDIT bought out the company that I originally worked for and since that time the contract I work on has been consistently lacking in all areas except frustration!
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of me desperately trying to control my thoughts and emotions so that I didn't have a panic attack or heart attack. "
bad,"Very little communication between upper and middle management."
bad,There was lack of diversity and long hours. There was no work family balance. Could not predict a typical work day and workplace culture was not friendly
bad,The HR Ethics personnel are not skilled int the ability to investigate events. They make opinionated assessments and are biased against any other opinion.
bad,General Dynamics was a good job at first. It was very stressful because the call volume . Was able to get over time often. Was able to take off work to take children to doctor.
bad,"It is not a fit for everyone. Some people sincerely enjoy working in a call-in center, and have no problem being treated disrespectfully for a large majority of all calls. I admire them. I worked there for three years and worked hard to not take it personally. However, I started to experience health issues such as hypertension, weight loss and hair loss from this stress."
bad,"If you're looking to retire from this company, this is not the job for you.  Majority of positions are tied to contract funding anywhere from 1-5 years typically.  Must be willing to deal with the good old boy system (hold overs from previous military officers).  If you're a Program Manager, plan on your discretionary program funds to be raided for Sr. Management bonuses which makes it difficult to give deserving employees raises or bonuses. Women in equal positions/responsibilities tend to be paid a fraction of what their male counterparts receive."
bad,"Summary line says it all. If you are looking for steady income, this place may suit your needs temporarily, but not for long-term aspirations.. I'm not a fan of GDIT."
bad,"Management need more training. Employee was treat fair.  Never felt comfortable at work. No break, short lunch.  Space too small. Employee lacking in customer services skills."
bad,"This was a call center environment, that was fast paced and with an average talktime per call of between 3 to 5 minutes.  This is an incomming call center without any cold calling."
bad,bathrooms and break room nasty. Outside around the building is covered in cigarette buds and trash for years and no one was hired to clean it. Barely any training.
bad,"I felt that I received no support from those above me, and all the great engineers that were on my team were all subcontractors. I've worked for companies as big and bigger before this, and they all were able to manage making employees feel like they were part of a family, giving them pride to say they worked for the company, and feel like the company had your back. GDIT is so disjointed and bottom line focused, you do not feel like you are part of the larger organization, only part of the team you work with day to day, and that the company sees you more as a material than a person."
bad,what i have learned at general dynamtics is i know alot more about health insurance than what i did before. im way more careful about picking plans and making sure everything i need is covered
bad,"Great structure, supervisors could do better at calling meetings, and have more communication with their team. Still a good place fo work at if you dont mind being yelled at alot."
bad,"I am only a contractor but my experience here is not a good one.  The turn over rate is too high and my contract states that I only work 40 hours but when no one comes to work, it forces me to stay over.  My work hours averages around 45 per week.  "
bad,"If your looking for something quick . Just during the open enrollment period great job! Aug - Jan  great place to go , quick 1000 every 2wks (before) management does not care about anything but taking calls. I was fired due to my grandfather passing away"
bad,You will be sitting at a cubical all day with phone calls coming back to back with the supervisors all over your shoulders your whole shift. It was very stressful.
bad,Unorganized and supervisors and managers had favorites. You have to do a bid every 3 mths for your schedule but they came up with the switch schedule swaps.
bad,customer service for obama health care. Provide health care information for families that calls for health care. Provide customer health care they can afford. Give information that needs to be given about their current health care plan
bad,"Given BIW is a Government Contractor the contracts are bid very aggressively in order to obtain new work, which results in a lot of pressure to perform, often with limited resources."
bad,Decent place to work. Leaves a lot to be desired as far as career advancement and the caliber of people being hired is far less than desirable.  HR does not allow supervision to supervise.
bad,"I care not to smear the company. I was not happy with my work environment. The overall company may be fine, I was just dropped into the place of employment."
bad,It is what it is. It is something that you probably wouldn't want to experience unless you have an abundant amount of patience. It can be a stressful and messy environment.
bad,this is a call center for health care you are only busy at the end of the year it runs like a prison they do not except doctors notes for excused absences
bad,"good pay, it is unsociable hours which would not be a problem however, there is no fair system in place for christmas and new year. was hard to get holidays accepted throughout the year. The team is great and everyone is welcoming, however one manager is very difficult and unless you are a friend or someone she knows personally she is not pleasant at all."
bad,"Workplace Is Discusting , Management Is Almost Impossible To Get Ahold Of Because Meetings Are More Important, Bed Bugs , Employees Are Always Wrong Here ."
bad,I didn't work for these people. I worked for General Dynamics of Nassco. I like my job there as a competent person. I came to work everyday. I really did like it there
bad,When the company first opened up everything was in organized. Training was long and some information was pointless. Nothing ever went smooth in the work place
bad,"GDIT has no concern for their employees. Pay is poor, Health insurance is worse than poor and costly. The site manager was not approachable, less than friendly and gave no support to her supervisors and CSRS"
bad,Once you get to a certain position the one i acquired you are really not going anywhere else in this company. There is no pay increase for tier 2 position.
bad,"A typical day was spent trying to fulfill high expectations for sales calls and visits, while fending off complaints and cramming in ridiculous amounts of computer entry. I learned a lot about closing business - excellent sales training. Unfortunately the company is poorly outfitted and capitalized, so your promises of even average service delivery were often unfulfilled. Hardest part of the job was dealing with inventory shortfalls; most enjoyable parts"
bad,Management was not organized. the hardest part was how unorganized the company was and the systems. The most enjoyable was co-workers. A typical day would start out great
bad,I helped consumers get enrolled in health coverage. Did applications over the phone. Enjoyed talking to all the different people. No one had the same story. Management was difficult to reach at times.
bad,"Needs lots of work. This location is not a well oiled machine like it could be. To many in leadership positions not going by all company policies and producers, which become a conflict when having to switch supervisors.  We switch twice a year when you bid on what shift you want. "
bad,"I worked here for about 6 months and when I got another job I ran away from this place so fast, I didn't know that I could run that fast. the best thing about this job is when you call in you don't have to speak to a supv., also the ATO is good when the call volume is low. Supervisors stand around and do nothing."
bad,The pace of work is steady and the co-workers are nice to be around.  Management is nice and they also have a state of the art gym available to the employees.
bad,This is a good place for a new graduate or someone who has no professional aspirations.   The latter will get a salary and the former will get some experience for the next job.
bad,Overall organization is spread out a little too much (over multiple states) - Primary vendor is a bit difficult to work with.  Needs a better system of formalized training for new people.
bad,"The pay is low for Supervisors for the work they need to do. GDIT really needs to be cleaned up, they need to spend money on the facilities walls carpets etc.. There is no overtime for Supervisors."
bad,I use to love coming to work at GD but now it is stressful .I enjoy working with my coworkers they feel the same as I do WE work 4 tens have Fridays off I truly look forward to having it off!
bad,"Management is grossly incompetent from the top down. Workload is moderately steady depending on politics of defense spending. Co-Workers mostly try to do their job and get along with each other. Star performers will quickly get beaten into submission. Show up each day, do the minimal to get by, and you will fit right in."
bad,"The pay at this company is very decent.  However, depending on  the department, they treat their employees as highly expendable. Lots of office politics and behind the scenes shenanigans."
bad,The most frustrating part about working for this call center is that you aren't able to help out consumers and resolve their issues most of the time. The program is still very new and there is a lot if room for improvements.
bad,"Okay I don't even care enough about GDIT to even bother giving them a proper review.  Terrible place to work, you are treated like you are a dog and some managers use fear tactics instead of actually being managers and helping you improve the quality of your work.  I would avoid this place."
bad,Assisting the govt and contractors with issues concerning password resets and the writing up of it issues.  This was sift work so we had to inform the next shift of any issues that went on during our shift from the last evening.
bad,"the job is very unorganized and very picky about everything. they find any little thing to fire you for its ridiculous."
bad,Lots of time and “bodies” to accomplish tasks.  Program faced with many challenges that seem to be the re-invention of the wheel.
bad,"Limited chance for advancement, limited opportunity to learn every aspect of your job (they keep you working in one area so you don't get a chance to learn every aspect of your job, and they show a lot of favoritism there, have to be in the ""clique"" and they have to like you, if not they will dog you out). It's ok as a stepping stone because they will pay for your education, but don't stay there too long. Will tear your body up in that environment with the physicality, breathing environment, etc....."
bad,"Vangent was a corporate call center.  The culture focused on regimentation and conformity.  A typical day included meetings to discuss more rules and regulations, and how to further grade workers calls on accuracy, tone and language."
bad,"Co-workers were great to work with very helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the supervisory staff and the strict rules regarding 15 minute breaks, clocking in and out for lunch breaks, and inability to work with employees with disabilities."
bad,as soon as you get there you are looking for the end of shift. No support for supervisors and little relief for issues. I would not recommend this job for serious job seekers.
bad,Company has grown to fast and needs to change how they manage the company as a large business rather than a small business like they are used to.
bad,"•	Answered Marketplace related questions for customers "
bad,"The pros:"
bad,"I was hired on by this company 4 different times within 1 year! Each time you are ""Re-hired"" you have to take the 2 week training class over again, which Is bogus. You work hard, and get laid-off, even though they keep the people that don't give a darn. You can only have 3 objects at your desk, excluding paper or pen. And they don't care if you need to have a day off, because your child is sick. That place is like a prison. DON'T WORK THERE AND GET BELITTLED!"
bad,good company for temp. employment. Management was ok but you could tell that most people were there for just a paycheck. But i would go back cause there is a potential to become full-time you just have to be truly dedicated and look past the people that are just there to collect
bad,"This was my first job after retiring from the US Army and I really didn't know what to expect. The work hours were fine 7 AM to 3:30 PM, but the hostility and politics on the work site were not needed or helpful. The people seem like ""good ole boys"" from outward appearances, but some of them can be downright nasty and backstabbing if you looked at them cross-eyed. I was at the site when one of the good managers was basically lynched by his subordinates, because he was making them do their job and they didn't want to do what they were hired to do. The team filed complaints and came up with a story that got the manager fired. It was one of the craziest things I'd ever seen and I knew it was time for me to go. I wouldn't work for this company again if you offered me a million dollars a year."
bad,The training here is sub-par along with the organizational structure of the teams. I was moved to three different supervisors within the first two month. The management genuinely don't care about their teams (with a few exceptions) and the weekend work structure is all but chaotic.
bad,"Very Good Money however there very unorganized. The Trainers were very lazy and rude, You had to do your best to understand the job and requirements."
bad,I really liked working here it was a great experience I love my co-workers on my team but they don't really care about their employees or what they have going on in their life whether its a death or a child is sick you aren't recognized for the good work you do but the pay and overtime was good.
bad,This is not a good company to work for. The only thing to enjoy is the pay. The supervisor are unhelpful. Upper management is unbearable. The only thing that they know how to do it lie and threaten their workers.
bad,"Some very, very good people in Production, Engineering, and Management are taken advantage of on a continuous basis.  Aging and unmaintained machines and facilities.  Unfortunately, GD is not willing to reinvest capital in this division's operations.  Most processes suffer from unassailable inertia since their development in the 1960's and 1970's.  ""We've done it that way for thirty-two years!"" should be the company motto."
bad,"Managed a staff ranging between 4 and 6 depending on established need, ensured software builds and environment met contractual standards, created CM plan, procedures, work instructions to standardize daily activities."
bad,Not a good company to work for if your looking for long term employment. There is no guarantee you will be made permanent.
bad,Every day I sat at a desk and answered inbound calls and web chat requests. Usually it was not the same desk that I sat at the previous week. Work environment was fairly isolated except for company e-mails sent out frequently. Co-workers often stole each others lunch and fridges in the break room were always crammed to over flowing. The best part of the day was training seminars because they provided a break in the tedium. The hardest part was the unpredictability. Equipment would frequently malfunction with no estimate of when it would be fixed. Also job assignments would change with little or no notice. About the only plus was the competitive wages and benefits offered.
bad,they are currently reducing the workforce to compensate for the government budget cuts.
bad,"Good benefits, tight schedules, no leverage,strict attendance policy, management is rude and unorganized."
bad,"Challenging company to thrive.  There is no training available, no mentors, no career advancement, etc.  Friday off are good, pay is decent, vacation is average, pension is gone, benefits get worse every year."
bad,"A typical work day would be logging into my computer and taking back to back calls with little to no wait times while working on other assigned tasks until the end of the shift."
bad,Company closed Tampa branch and terminated everybody. Made good friends.
bad,Locked down to your desk with scheduled breaks that MUST be adhered to or you will be penalized. Also penalized for phone calls that last more than 3.5 minutes. Customers are often rushed off the phone as a result and dissatisfied. There are very little opportunities for advancement or raises due to workforce management and Federal regulations.
bad,Company had contract with the US Department Direct Loans program. Dealing with current and former students with loans. Sometimes dealt with people that would yell at you for them if they missed a payment. Explaining to people that you can't control how fast the Department of Treasury gives back a refund if they are due one and being yelled at about it.
bad,It is a temp job. Call center. It's a job o get by with for the season. 
bad,"I've been employed there for three and half years.  I've been able to pay my bills."
bad,This job provides a service to our country by helping our military perform their job; but it is lacks to pay and rewards that are equivalent to the work being performed.
bad,"I have been less than impressed during my entire time at GDIT. The pay they offered was ridiculously low, but in my situation at the time I had to take it. Their heath benefits cost more and cover less than any other place I have worked. The cost was so much more I dropped their health insurance to use my wife's instead. So if the pay is bad, and the benefits are poor, why work here?"
bad,busy with inquiries
bad,"General Dynamics at JBLM (Joint Base Lewis McChord), is not a company you can be proud of. Management at the local level is dishonest and can be proven by the news media coverage recently. I have been employed for 10 years with this company and have watched it go from a strong family oriented business to a bunch of thugs and crooks."
bad,"I worked at NASSCO for about 2 years, like I said you work long hours, when I worked overtime I wouldn't have a day off for months sometimes. The work is very dangerous(many people have DIED there) when I was there, their workforce was about 5,000 and they had parking for 600. They operate on a point system that is unforgiving unless you know the supervisor. There are constant layoffs and if you don't speak Spanish you'll be treated as an outsider in most departments. NASSCO routinely broke their own safety policies, we we're not supplied with the proper tools and equipment half the time and most of the supervisors were practically slave drivers, favoritism to certain employees was part of life there as well. Overtime, at least in some departments was pretty much mandatory if you want to stay there long term. I went to school for a very long time to learn my trade and worked hard for them and made $15/hour. My girlfriend at the time passed away, and they would not give me time off because we weren't married. On the plus side, you learn a lot and they will pay for part of your training, but much of it is done on your own time after work. It is quite an experience, and if you can work there, other jobs will feel like a walk in the park. To sum it up, it takes a certain type of personality to survive there, I believe they have a 60% turn over rate within the 1st 6 months of someone starting. If you do manage to even get hired there, which is NOT easy, all I have to say is good luck."
bad,"Big company, get lost in the shuffle. Terrible manager with no people skills"
bad,People were very friendlyand very helpful. Also quiet and peaceful place to be.
bad,"I took a position at GD for the security offered by working for a federal contractor. I ended up in a cycle where layoffs would happen every 3-4 months, and the next big project was always on the horizon."
bad,"I truly loved this job for the first five years I worked there. Everything changed after GDAIS purchased us and brought in a new set of priorities and methods that were supposed to align us with the way other parts of GDAIS did business. These new focus areas were supposed to help us win business by being able to leverage all of the areas of excellence withing GDAIS. Instead, GDAIS failed to get follow-on work with established customers or win new contracts via the GD business development model, largely because it was inconsistent with the way we had done business with customers in the past (some of these customer relationships went back decades). With so little work, many people lost their jobs and many others simply left. Now the company is a shell of what it used to be."
bad,"Dont work here for as nothing less than 18hr. Theyll never give it. Low pay, angry workers, laziness in older employees. Management doesnt follow their own rules."
bad,"Management was not good and was not held responsible for mistakes or misinformation provided to his employees."
bad,"The environment was cold and we were not allowed dignity. To have clear purses and not trusted with paper and pens was degrading. The real thieves don't need paper."
bad,"If you want to feel like a number with no recourse or control over your career, GDIT is the place for you. "
bad,If you need a check they are always hiring and firing at GDIT your schedule will change whenever they fell like it for 6 months or long. they are very unprofessional people management works off of the buddy system so if you not one of their preferred employees you will be mistreated. This job is not for anyone with a family that may need time off from work.
bad,Does not pay for the talent and knowledge the employee provides The initial start pay was a lot lower than the average income for the type of work being performed. The raises were lower than the cost of living averages in the state I live in
bad,"Work aligns with job description. Receiving a promotion and/or salary increase is very difficult with this company. When trying to move to a more skilled position, was told to prepare for a salary decrease."
bad,"Last resort then for a recent college student then college graduate. This is not a job I plan on returning to, God forbid I have too. It is okay for those in the area because for them it’s the best pay they may ever see and/or receive. I left for a 5$ pay raise and continued to progress from there. Besides the benefits everything else is below par."
bad,I worked on a computer we’re u fill out application for insurance and submit to them their results if they were approve say a low cost rate but it was ok.oretty good job
bad,"If you're looking for a decent paying, 40 hour a week job, this place will hire nearly anyone when they are having their hiring season. The benefits are good and the job itself isn't difficult, just boring. However, the worst part is that they do not take harassment claims very seriously and most women there are made uncomfortable on a daily basis by their peers. It can be frustrating."
bad,"After acquisition, a new management team was brought in and they completely devastated the organization. The doors were shut within two years, displacing approximately 500 employees. Prior to that, it was a great environment."
bad,Stressful and you will be written up for every little thing. Only thing i like is the people i met that make the day go by. You barely can take a bathroom break without getting an e-coaching (a warning)
bad,Busy call center with benefits. Hours are great. Pay is fair. Long hours. Management was strict something's too strict. Never enough breaks for restroom runs and penalties for emergencies big or small.
bad,This is an ok job. It is very stressful and repetitive. You sit in a cube all day answering phone calls from sometimes very mean and rude people. You can't really leave your cube unless it is break time and the calls are constant non stop ringing in your ear. You would have to be a very special person to enjoy this job.
bad,"In late 2011, GDLS came in bought out Force Protection Industries for pennies on the dollar. They immediately cut pay and then staff in Afghanistan. They have had no follow-on work for the MRAP Cougar or the Buffalo Route Clearance vehicles."
bad,"The company is not ran professionally at all, but one good thing is there is all ways room to move up in the company  you just have to want the opportunity  and they will help you move to the next level."
bad,Sitting in the same spot for 8 hours just is not for me. I like to move around and that was not possible at GDIT. Management was okay I just did not like staying in one spot for 8 hours without being able to communicate with fellow employees.
bad,"GDIT is a large company with many layers of supervisors, directors and managers.  I have been working here for many years and it seems like things are constantly changing."
bad,GDIT was a very stressful place to work in. The management was unfair and mostly unapproachable. If there were problems most of the time they wouldn't be solved. The pay was not worth the daily stress.
bad,"if you are looking for a steady job, then this is the one for you. peak seasons are the worse because your'e under staffed, so it be a lot of mandatory overtime. i'm talking 8am-7pm from monday thru friday. no time to handle any business outside of work. and the dont accept doctor's notes if you have to call out."
bad,Is learning about the Nixie and TWS systems on Naval Ships. Management has failed to keep my work space a non hostile environment. I am constantly being pushed in uncomfortable situations and no effort from management that I could be trained in fields that could help me succeed in my career.
bad,"GDIT offers good benefits, but salary is insulting. Require college and advanced degrees for low level customer service positions, then pays employees based on 'no or little education' levels. Treats employees with little respect. Often sets up work schedules with holidays paid as regular workday pay. Creates an atmospher of low morale. "
bad,"A good place for a temporary job, especially during the Marketplace enrollment rush. Answered phone calls and helped people sign up for insurance through the affordable care act."
bad,"The call center portion of GDIT was brutal, it was like a farm for customer service representatives. There is nothing fun about the job and it has almost no room to grow. They pay a living wage that is basically the minimum to live on in the area, which says the company really doesn't care about their employees standard of living."
bad,Typical day sitting at your desk all day receiving inbound calls. I learned to be patient because not everyone learn on the same pace. Management was ok. Coworkers was great.
bad,"I feel that this Company does take their employees in consideration. Their matrix standards for hiring for other positions are low. They just have no loyalty for their employees. I feel that a lot of people are in positions that I have no idea how that would be with their scores, adherence, ect."
bad,This place was ok when I started but as time went on I began to dislike it. I came in got on the phones and did my job. We read from scripts all the time.
bad,It was okay but not great. Most of the people didn't like working there and more than half of them walked off the job because of the poor management.
bad,"I dint like the lies about being able to get all the O.T. you want. Its first come first serve. The offer straight insurance. Nothing to special. They pay is $11.39 a hour. That's bad for this area. You can pick your own shift for the most part out of what is available, but if you need to change it you cant unless they let you find someone else who wants to swap shifts with you.."
bad,"I have found it hard to advance my career in with this company in the area that I work.  I feel that it has to do something with me being female and not part of the ""good-ol-boy"" clique.  I have experience and educational background; more than some people who have been advanced before me."
bad,"First few years are ok.  They make you feel like you are important to the world and making a difference, but once the honeymoon is over and one realizes that the raises are non-existent or not enough to compensate for the benefit changes much less a cost of living increase and that your actually losing money year over year working there."
bad,"The managers rarely interact with the rest of the company, and the training is inadequate for the job that you are to preform."
bad,"If you do not mind being micro managed, you may love this job. You must report your ever move as if you are in a prison detention camp. You must do training videos and provide screen shoots from video before you begin work each day. All training videos have to be screen shotted to verify that it was completed. They don't accept verbal confirmation"
bad,Challenging. Rolled out the new Affordable Care Act. Federal Government contractor. Daily changes. Ongoing training.
bad,"GDIT is not the ideal company to work for. If you just need a job, then take it. This is not somewhere you would want to work as your career. The only thing I like about GDIT is that health insurance through them is FREE. other than that, company sucks. They butter you up and make it seem like everything is peaches and cream. NOPE! This is a temp position. you are NOT guaranteed permanent. Its ratchet and ghetto. Not to mention GDIT, is an ""at-will"" company, meaning they can fire you for any reason, at any time. I got extremely sick and was hospitalized for a week. Had doctors note and all, think they let me keep my job?? NO!! Due to me missing more than 40 hrs of wrk, they terminated me per their ""policy"". Its a bunch of BS. They're lucky I cant sue b/c of them being ""at-will"", but I definitely was. Its to each it owns but you shall see....don't say I didn't warn you. Just know, if you get sick, child gets sick, have death in the family, whatever the case may be, if u miss more than 40 hrs or reach your occurrences, you're GONE!!! And they don't care b/c im sure they have another 150 ppl starting the following week or month. They famous for hiring a lot of ppl then laying them off once medicare enrollment period ends. SMH"
bad,"My day started out with letting my team know it was time to go onto the phones for the day.  We had constant training and and updates on the changes in procedures for the Healthcare.gov website and signing up for the Affordable Care Act.  We were required to learn how all the agencies interacted with each other and how to effectively explain to customers how insurance works. We were rated both individually and as a team for quality, adherence and attendance.  I then did my best to assist customers and agents in navigating and completing the application on a website that was not working properly.  Our training was 40 hrs. and then we were on the phones.  I learned to use soft skills (personal peace of mind techniques) to assist a very diverse group of people from across the U.S.  I also learned a great deal about all aspects of the health and dental insurance industries, including medicaid and medicare.  My coworkers were also a very diverse and awesome group of people and we helped each other all day everyday. I got skilled at managing my time and effectively assisting people.  I learned to be more flexible because in a six month period we changed supervisors, teams, desks and lockers five times.  The most difficult part of the job was working with a website that wasn't working properly for people who didn't want to have to sign up in the first place.  We all needed more training.  Communicating with consumers the results of their applications when they were not what they wanted to hear or when we knew there was an error because of the website and there was nothing we could"
bad,"Used to love it but now the management is structured poorly.  None of them know what really goes on to bring a product from a customer specification to a finished deliverable.  They can only evaluate an employee's worth by his educational and social background, and not the talent or skills he has.  Many of the managers are not even on site now so they are disconnected from the people here.  They do not compensate their current experienced employees, but will hire new employees and pay them more.  Therefore, it is good for initial starting pay, but it is not a good place for advancement."
bad,"The work is good and the people are generally better. Just seems as though the defense industry is on the decline and the benefits keep getting reduced in some manner via frozen pensions, lesser match on 401k, frozen promotions. Doesn't seem like a stable place. Everything is based on government funding, so if it goes you go with it."
bad,Management is very lackluster and training is horrible do not have the right resources.
bad,"This once great company was an incredible place to work for quality of life and capability to make a difference for our brave soldiers.  To their vast credit, the workforce continues to perform and serve in an extraordinary manner."
bad,The company it self is a wonderful company. The work environment is the worst work place I have ever worked in in my life. The supervisors particularly the web chat team is horrible and they will make your work experience a living HE double hockey sticks. Worst place to work and I would not recommend that job to a homeless man.
bad,Typical days at General Dynamics were being on the phones or chatting for customer service.
bad,"Only a temp job will not keep you past 6 mths. Poor management,"
bad,I learned many aspects of government contracting. I am able to explain most aspects of health plans offered in the Unitedd states.
bad,"With migrating to Win 7, not everything went well, some applications needed more study before launching in Win 7, also management was pushing toward completing the project fast as well."
bad,"my dept. paid much lip service to ''doing what it takes'' to accomplish tasks & mission but, when push came to shove, leadership did not walk like they talk."
bad,"GD has struggled with what to do with ERIM (Veridian) in Ypsilanti MI since we were bought out. Even after streams of layoffs and employee initiated turnover it's still not looking any better."
bad,"Poor Moral, people are afraid of this GDC4S going under. Good benefits, good pay, good people. Management treats people like numbers."
bad,"A typical day at work is mainly time management and getting the work done. I have learned how to work with others, communicate with my peers, and stay focus without letting others bring me into distress. The hardest part of my job is not being acknowleged about the great work that you do. The most enjoyable part is being able to come to work to support my team and making them feel comfortable."
bad,"It was clear from the moment General Dynamics took over that those at the top had no idea how to run a small, innovative, and efficient satellite design and manufacturing company. The culture was oriented to big assembly-line production, not one-of-a-kind, highly reliable products. Employees were seen as expendable and replaceable machine parts, not as individually important contributors to company success."
bad,"Excellent Pay and benefits, Very critical in helping Medicare Beneficiaries with benefits. Very helpful ques to help with call flow."
bad,"I felt like I was on the game show big brother. They can see every little thing that you do on your computer to entering and exiting the building. I feel they put too much pressure on you with all these expectations you have to complete during a phone call. The lunches and breaks are horrible. A 30 min lunch after sitting on the phone for 4 hrs is pretty bad. You also get 2 15 min breaks, which gives you enough time to do absolutely nothing."
bad,Pros
bad,"It is a typical defense contractor type of job. The pay is OK, the paid time off is 14 days though that covers all the paid time that you get to take off for anything for the entire year. We have no personal workspaces and we have to share workstations that we use to do our work."
bad,I have nothing else to say about this company. I don't believe giving out information about my former employer is appropriate nor has anything to do with applying for your company.
bad,When I had worked with the company. It was a pretty good training. Very informative. But after the training and working in the position that we were hired for management was very unprofessional inconsiderate. Felt like I was in high school with a lot of drama
bad,"Great pay. Almost worth dealing with the upper level managers. You are encouraged to go the extra mile and do more work, but they dont want it to cost the company any money. I often had to lie on my timecards and say that I didnt work an 18hr shift because it wasnt ""in the budget"". The warehouse ""supervisor"" is a neat freak with OCD and a little man complex. Or little woman in her case. She has to be in charge or she isnt happy and will do anything to keep you on the bottom of the corporate ladder so that she remains relevant"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of talking with customers and following up on their needs passing technical questions on to DUATS Help Desk staff if I could not provide. To make sure that the up coming magazine ads schedule mirrors our trade show events and that the graphic department has material in a timely manner. The enjoyable part of my days always, Planning for trade show or event."
bad,The job was great in benefits and pay but the culture was not aligned with the mission statement. Most of the problems were with the leniency of policy.
bad,"Has the ability to be a great job. Good benefit programs, however the company lacks basic communication and in-person training. The company states Entry Level but does not provide the proper training to assist with job effectiveness, which in some cases results in termination. Upper management also makes decisions that tends to have a negative effect on the work culture."
bad,Program closed. Never received raises. Seat location and teams were constantly changing for no apparent reason. I really don't have anything else to say about this company.
bad,I was not compensated well given the number of hours I worked and how much work I turned in on a monthly basis. I will say that my manager was fantastic and an excellent communicator. That was one of few positives of this job. Job
bad,"My first supervisor made going to work bearable. He made our team feel like a family. I really enjoyed helping people and finding solutions and making them happy, but i would get in trouble if i went off script and told them what the real deal was. Alot of drama in the workplace, cliques and queens."
bad,The training program is an absolute joke. My supervisor had no people skills whatsoever and you constantly get griped at for failing calls when you half trained.
bad,"Good for people with families due to insurance offered. But advancement is very limited and based on favoritism. "
bad,"The company does a lot of contract work with the government. That said, each contract is different however mine is pretty rough. Unless you like talking to people nonstop or can handle the verbal abuse from frustrated customers. This job is not going to be great. They pay is good, but honestly there is no way to grow in this field of work."
bad,"Overall, General Dynamics IT is just another Defense Contractor that is out to make money without much regard for the people working for them. They were known for cutting benefits and wages of anyone who worked any extended period of time at the company, and for not being competitive in wages compared to the rest of the companies in the market. All of this, while at the same time boasting of record high years and management bonuses. While it is understandable that working in a call center is high pace, be prepared for management to be critical of the time you spend going to the bathroom, and for them to micro-manage your every move. They will absolutely treat you like a number unless you become buddies with management."
bad,"Very poor management and not a great work environment, I would not recommend this place to anyone, the pay and benefits are good but you sacrifice a good environment to work."
bad,This company employees people on a needed basis. Will hire if you meet all criteria after 6 months of working for them. Will be put in teams and have multiple supervisors.
bad,Too much micro management. The pay and benefits are great but the job itself is too demanding on shift schedule. I feel that you are in a regime. You cant even go to the bathroom without someone questioning where you went. To stressful.
bad,Great pay. Friendly environment. No space for attendance issues. Will not work with you on the hours that you can or can't miss. They are not caring of any personal issues you may have
bad,"Poor management, lack of moral and over worked. Management does not care for the employees. Only about their own well being within the company. They make it mandatory for weekends and holidays while they are never there."
bad,When you are working for a governement contractor you will find that they are very set in their ways be them good or bad. Which can make it very difficult to create a culture where new ideas are openly accepted.
bad,"I have learned a lot since I started here, years ago. I truly enjoyed those I worked for, and around (overall, because there are always exceptions) and the contract I work for can give you a real sense of meaning and truly help people. It was once an, overall, optimistic place where the majority of people in support/management roles knew what they were doing and genuinely wanted to help. About a year ago, management went a complete change and brought in people that did not take the time to understand the contract or the people they were managing and their roles."
bad,"Working at this place is stressful. Its not organized, and you have to worry about your manager degrading you. It's not the ideal workplace. It causes too many problems and it's not professional."
bad,"The job was great and working with the military was a huge plus, but some in upper management were a joke.  Most of the environment here was who you were friends with and who's butt you kissed.  Don't disagree with the wrong people or your job life will be heck."
bad,I enjoyed working at general dynamics. It was in fact very dynamic and diverse. It was also very stressful at times. Being to help people with their medicare questions and enrolling them in prescription drug plans.
bad,"At Pittsfield, you have to be in the snow mobile's club in order to integrate the group. Most of discussions are about snow mobile and you don't have one........................."
bad,"not one of the better contracts I've ever worked on.  the drive in Amman, Jordan was over an hour.  no compensation for the extra 3 hours a day in driving time.  worked 12 hour days on top of the 3 hours of driving time."
bad,"Despite lots of smart, talented people, antiquated management practices hinder much progress. I am not doing the job I was hired to do. Due to extreme turnover, subject matter experts are hard to come by."
bad,"Company started off great from the start, turned out to be a money scam from the government when the ACA was created. To bad, it could have turned out to be something great. Part of the reason the ACA is so messed up is because of the management and HR folks that do not enforce policies unless it suits them. Sad times."
bad,"Working for this company has its pros and cons. I am satisfied with the production of work and benefits offered, but are seeking a more stable work environment that are fair to their employees."
bad,Great benefits but hard to find permanent positions or work schedules. Lack of proper training and qualified management in many cases. Very poor culture as there is always non-work related issues going on.
bad,"I have learned how to work with different pieces of gear and test equipment.  The management is great though and will work with your work schedule.  Co-workers are the moodiest and lazy group I personally have ever worked with.  While I am usually at my bench working they are surfing the internet or playing on facebook.  The hardest part of my job is using outdated information (schematics, if there are any) or not having any information of the gear to assist in troubleshooting and repair..  Most enjoyable is the management personal that I have to answer to."
bad,This would be an ideal job if there was more structure. The pay is competitive and the benefits are amazing!! It really depends on your job title and the division in which you are employed.
bad,So I like call center type work. I'm huge on customer service. They had nice pay and good hours. It's open 24/7 so I chose the night shift because I'm not a huge morning person. I was part time and took home $700 something every 2 weeks so it was nice.
bad,"Short contract- Good training, great support staff, but lack of advancement with the temp positions. Very hard to hire to perm.employment."
bad,constantly get build up for promotion just to get more out of you for nothing. Management has no clue and doesn't seem to want a clue. Promotions are buddy based
bad,"The most challenging obstacle was the absence of consistent guidance, and the negligence of management in providing the appropriate resources to complete job requirements and tasks."
bad,"Company is in need of restructuring, operating costs and overhead is costing company productivity. Poor support systems exist for managers and opportunities for employee educational advancement and development is near non-existent."
bad,The overall work environment is fairly decent but the way that the company is managed is atrocious. There are some supervisors and managers there that do honestly try to work with the employees but most are very abrupt or honestly don't care what their employees have to say. The policies and procedures are never flush across the board and it takes entirely too long to get direct answers about things going on within the business or how things need to be run overall.
bad,"You work 12 hours a day and the call flow is heavy.  The chat program is also busy, as well.  It is call after call after call but the training is comprehensive but tough--be prepared to hit the ground running."
bad,"Certified CSR; Government Contractor"
bad,"The organization was in the midst of development.  The office was recently purchased by General Dynamics.  The administrative staff was poorly prepared to handle many complications that were surfacing during my training period.  Most of the time, I was in a small office open to the staff while waiting for the completion of a security clearance specific to the type of work I was hired to perform."
bad,"•	A typical day at work – Report to work unsupervised. Report to signed work location, conduct customer needs (Military). Plan meetings, site visits, assist users with tracking systems out in the field, prepare spreadsheets for tracking Containers, send out to users in the field to follow to ensure the same measures of accountability is being followed. Monitor accountability of Government owed containers use in CENTCOM (AOR’s)."
bad,"I have worked in call centers for a number of years.  This call center was perpetually understaffed, resulting in at least 10 hours per week of scheduled mandatory overtime.  As well, schedules were based upon call volume, and could change (and did) every day, and sometimes in the middle of a shift.  I was advised when I was hired that I would be expected to work approximately four to five hours of overtime per week -- I worked that on my first day out of training.  There were many ten to twelve-hour workdays, and in the entire time I was there, I never had less than 10 hours of scheduled overtime in a week. Other CSRs who had been there for a while and had accrued time off were not allowed to use it because of the overwhelming call volume.  I finally left when I came to work after being sick (on a Monday, after having worked the previous Saturday and noting that my start time for Tuesday was an hour earlier than normal) and finding out that I was two hours late, because my start time had been changed to accommodate the mandatory overtime for the call volume.  Maybe the culture has changed, but in my time there, the CSRs were treated poorly and were at the whims of the call volume, which was not managed correctly."
bad,goverment/private sector pitting union members against each other making for difficult work enviroment
bad,"Bad management, they treat employee like they are nothing. Very stressful place"
bad,"No job security, pay incentives, and life balancing. More work seems to be added without adequate  training. "
bad,"If you have no experience in a call center this will give you that experience. The co-workers are all very nice and make the day go fast. A typical day is taking calls with 6 seconds between the calls. The company has different contracts at the center in Coralville it has Medicare, Health Insurance Marketplace, CFPB, FSAIC and Direct Loans."
bad,Call center. No excitement. Every same work answering calls. Read scripts to callers. No advancement in pay.
bad,"GDLS harbors a pathetic culture, mismanaged assets, infighting among internal interests and interestingly enough... great benefits and pay."
bad,"The supervisors are great, however the hours are horrible, and the notice that you have before working MAJOR HOLIDAYS is little to none, with no option to make arrangement, vacation schedule is based on who knows who, and breaks are short and far between."
bad,"training, work on project"
bad,Typically day - Communication meeting with production supervisors at the beginning of each day. Gemba Walks then typical engineering work.
bad,"GD changes strategic direction frequently and has failed to convey an understanding to the staff. GD has many of the problems of big corporations: Lack of true leadership, weak adherence to ethics, too many layers of management, disconnect between corporate goals and staff incentives."
bad,"good job, bad manager."
bad,This job was very stressful. A lot of the times the customer didn't know what they was signing up for. Or the price of the insurance would increase and they would want to change plans.
bad,They give you the opportunity. But they treat you like a machine. Few really care. Just worry about yourself. Open 24 hours need a new start go for it!
bad,"If you want to feel like a rat in a maze or an anonymous gear in a big machine, then this is the place for you.  Employees are treated like disposable parts."
bad,The place always had problems with bedbugs and other insects it was terrible! Very stressful because the management was bad. The pay was a lot lower than other call centers. I got anxiety working there
bad,we had to follow a script word by word however if we gave the same info in the script but reworded it we got a low grade on our calls which meant our job was at risk
bad,"Overall this job was just a paycheck and nothing more, only because i am not the call center type. If you enjoy sitting on the phone listening to pt's complain about their Medicare plan all day then this is the job for you. I am borderline a tomboy and very active. SOOO not the job for me."
bad,"Because of the government contracts, this job is very strict.  No cell phones are allowed in the work area, no pens/pencils or paper allowed, no recording devices, no purses or backpacks/personal belongings in workspace; all items must be stored in a provided locker, which takes time away from breaks and lunch to access.  Limited snacks are permitted, but no food. Schedules are rigorous, timing for beginning/ending shifts are expected to be to the exact minute for logging in/out.  There is no breathing time between calls.  There is a lot of toggling of screens, as you need to access consumer info from previous calls and separate insurance applications, and scripts to guide you on what to say, which has to be exact."
bad,"My idea of being a customer services rep is different from management.  Helping people to accomplish what they called for is what I wanted to do, however you are timed and you have to keep your time down or you get written up.  I could not figure out how the others were getting the times down, then one day I saw it, they would mute their phones and not answer the calls, the caller would hang up, they did that for about 15 times a day to get their call times down."
bad,GDIT is the Health Insurance Marketplace and Medicare. Consumers call to apply for their health insurance or to complain about the fact that everyone has to have insurance because of Obama Care. A lot of times you get yelled at and called every name under the book. There were some rewarding times when a consumer with a preexisting condition would call and praise you for helping them find affordable insurance for them.
bad,Typical day at work consists of answering calls and helping consumers enroll into insurance plans. Also answering any questions consumers may have about insurance plans. The hardest part about this job is staying calm and resolving the solution even though consumers may become irate. The most enjoyable part about this job is all the lives you can make a difference in
bad,High pressure position required clear communication challenges to complete work.  Deadlines and high expectations for excellence to ensure profitable program.
bad,"There is discord between direct managment, and up the chain of command. In some cases, upper management makes promises that lower management cannot fulfill."
bad,The company was really great to work for until about 3-4 years ago.  Upper management changed and so did the workplace culture.  They layers of management increased dramatically and that caused the work to slow down.
bad,"i wish not to talk about it due to the company not showing how they work with  there staff and other people in the company, They make it hard or people to move  in the company"
bad,"Working at GDIT has been honestly one of the most stressful and annoying time of my life. They are not organized, rules change literally every week, managers are told one thing(usually negative) but they tell us something different(usually positive). Currently they are going through a large issue where some of our sites would like to create a Union, so they send us anti-union emails every week. Temporary employee's continue to stay temporary beyond the ""contract"" date, also with no word as to when they ever will make us permanent. I just don't believe that this job is worth anyone's time if you are a good employee and do your job well."
bad,"The atmosphere there is awful, it is very cut throat and no one wants to help anyone. They do not seem to want you to succeed. It is a hostile work environment."
bad,"The job was repetitive and fast-paced, so both boring and demanding.  The environment was very impersonal, with people often working side by side for many weeks before even knowing each others' names."
bad,"Working at GDIT is very stressful. The polices change all the time when it comes to what you are scored on during your calls. That makes this job very confusing as well. Policies should always be consistent. Each supervisor seems to do different things. One may update you on important things...the other does not. One supervisor says one thing, the other says another. Again confusing."
bad,"To high of call volume, back to back calls for two and half hours of shifts at a time.  my manager was sympathetic with our demands on us.  No win situation."
bad,It just doesn't suite me amazon is a younger company built for a younger person yet I do work hard and help people and that's what I'd like to do as a career. GDIT feels like it has no heart amazon is a glowing warm place where everyone is friendly and GDIT just doesn't have that.
bad,My first time working with a call center it is very stressful call center. Potential to move up to achieve better  experience in other position after a year
bad,Fast pace a lot of emotional callers and not enough information or ways to help customer. Everything is so scripted but basic. Not a bad place to work if you are really needing a job.
bad,"I worked there for over a year, and if you add the two times together, it was about 2. The training is insufficient for the job itself, the rules are not regulated among supervisors, and too much emphasis is put on how long you're on a call instead of resolving any issues. They tell you there is advancement opportunities, like they are special, but you can work there forever and never move. You still have to have the highest education and experience in order to move up. You barely see most of the managers. Favorite runs deep in this company."
bad,If you have alot of health problems at first they will work with you then all of a sudden they will find a way to get rid of you even stating that I violated a privacy policy stating that I left my computer unlocked & they could not prove it to me. I've worked there off & on since 2013 & I know better than to leave my computer unlocked.
bad,Handling. Consumer a health insurance company. High call volume and getting people enrolled into affordable health care.Handling high call volumes and providing excellent customer service
bad,A typical day at work includes being present for work on a daily basic log into the phone and start answering calls regarding customers medicare insurance accounts. I have learned about the medicare insurance and HIPPA and PHI is not to be release unless authorized. Management at GDIT is not professional at all. Co-workers were friendly and nice. The hardest part of the job is being stressed out when receiving certain accurate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is having that ability to help the customers to the greatest length so that they will appreciate the customer service that was dgiving.
bad,Laid back professional  work place with really good  pay and overtime  and benefits. I would work here again in this environment . Very serious take no excuses so always  show up ready to work.
bad,"These environment was never professional."
bad,"Despite having so many company policies, there is ever-changing processes that seem reactive over proactive. Co-workers function well together, however upper management does not seem to have a finger on the pulse of the work force. Decisions are made without consideration of the full scope of effect."
bad,If you want to advance in that job place you can not because of the management is so close pack and you cant move up. You do not have a chance to move up you stay in the same position for the whole time being there
bad,"it was a decent job you get paid 10.52 hour with health benefits provided only bad thing is sometimes consumers that barely make the money to pay there normal bills were offered plans at extremely unaffordable prices and the people who make 100,000 a year were offered plans at next to nothing which seems to me that should be the other way around and it makes you emotionally unstable"
bad,"This was my first experience with the call center environment. Therefor I am unqualified to critique as I don’t have additional experiences to compare this on too."
bad,"Excellent Benefits. However, GDIT has a very high employment turnover. Extremely stressful job and working conditions."
bad,"If a call center is your ideal job, then GDIT is just a stepping stone to gaining some experience. And it is also great for learning Medicare and Medicaid Health Insurance and how it works"
bad,"very boring work, call center, not much interaction with co-workers or managers, hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult costumers."
bad,Met a lot of great people but many were afraid of management and the leaders I looked up to were forced out.
bad,Sum it up  I hated it the day I stepped in the doors for training. I had a family to raise so had to do what I had to do. But was actively seeking other employment. Which I found. Gave my 2 wk notice & the nxt day they fired me. The words I hve for them I cant express here. But im sooooo relieved to never have to go back to this god awful place again!!!!!!
bad,Awful upper management practices: bottom line is king.  Great pay for the geographic area
bad,This used to be a solid company to work at.  Lately they have been reducing benefits to make the bottom line look better.
bad,The people that work there are friendly and the management is nice.
bad,Dealing with people issues on a regular bases and feeling like you cant help them when you really want to.
bad,"No further comments.  Males are far more appreciated at GD.  There is a ""boys"" club and unless you are really in with the ""boys"" you are working on the outside."
bad,Upper management lied to us the entire way regarding layoffs. It was especially disappointing because after the first round of layoffs we were told they were restructuring and everything was in order and the entire division went under.
bad,I do not have any information about this job thank you that is all it’s talking non stop to consumers in a very face paste working environment very stressful and at times can be overwhelming
bad,"Management requires allot with little appreciation. If you are too good at your job they will not promote you. They have decent benefits like 401K, and small discounts with Gyms, and Cell phone companies, but the healthcare sucks. They offer high deductible plans that take all your money."
bad,The company culture is fine.  There is opportunity for advancement in the company if your manager pushes for it.  Otherwise it won't happen.  Otherwise the dress is relaxed.
bad,The contract GD had with the State of Iowa was under bid by another company and my position was liquidates shortly thereafter. I would work for GD again.
bad,Company treated employees like pawns and numbers. Overworked and underpaid. Typical day consisted of working remedy tickets and most times we had to take working lunches due to not enough manpower.
bad,I understood that the job was a seasonal position but we were told there was the possibility of being hired on full time well that was not the case. Was very upset that I was laid off.
bad,Working with the military as a contractor was just a cover to fill a position so the company executives would continue getting their high salaries. The job position was ill-defined and had no possibility for advancement.
bad,"General Dynamics would a great place to work for if the process of following a career path was easier. This company always offers an acting position for every role in leadership, but if there is a regular full time position that becomes available, you are unable to qualify for it because you accepted the ""acting"" position. This allows you to get experience in different areas, but it also hinders those who would a be a great asset to the company. Some of the managers are excellent at what they do and others are there to say that they hold a management position. There are several career paths that one can take. Just make sure you aren't falling for the okie doke when taking those acting positions."
bad,"I prefer not to comment on General Dynamics..  I worked for General Dynamics as a Government Contractor, although they never really saw my work ethics because I worked in a government facility, which means my GDIT PM never actually saw the work I did for this customer.  They chose to not assist me in finding another job after the ""Customer"" decided to go in a different direction once a new COS came aboard; I worked with this customer for almost 3 years.    This wouldn't have been the worst thing ever, if they didn't let my SCI Top Secret Clearance go inactive in the process of finding another job.  Now I have No job and No clearance.  I was in the process of my reinvestigation, which is usually done every 5 years and of course was cooperative as usual.  I worked really hard to get that specific clearance and it took me years to get where I was.  I was never told that my clearance was going to be dropped.  They stated to me they were going to assist me with finding another job and everything would work out, this was not the case."
bad,"Needs to show care for the employee health and well being .but for the most part, I did enjoy working there and helping the consumers on the phones. Thank you"
bad,"Stayed very busy on the phone dealing with customer apply for insurance. How to help a customer apply for insurance or direct them to another source, if they didn't qualify. The most enjoyable part of the job, was helping a customer who didn't know they could get the insurance they needed. It was very hard to tell someone who was really in need of the insurance that they did not qualify. The phones consistently rang."
bad,"I personally do not like to be micromanaged. I loved helping the beneficiaries when they called but your WHOLE job depends on you pleasing the beneficiary. Not all problems can be solved by a low level CSR, and not all beneficiaries are easy to please. Management spends more time micromanaging personnel than actually teaching."
bad,A typical day at work was not just your average work environment. Majority of the time  supervisors were arguing and having verbal altercations with their team. I can only speak from my experiences. As far as how to handle yourself as a professional that is common sense. The knowledge about the job details as for as medicare/medicaid was very helpful.
bad,"A typical workday consists of taking calls almost all day long. I have learned that in order to succeed you must be thorough, accurate, have great attention to detail, be highly organized, and know how to answer any question thrown your way. The hardest part about this job is dealing with all of the frustrated callers and the lack of accountability from the other departments to fulfill with their job responsibilities. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to talk with co-workers and enjoy potlucks but these activities are very limited."
bad,"Very nice people to work with, but some higher up political issues."
bad,"Assisted consumers apply for health insurance."
bad,"I am a contractor through GDIT and a typical day is come in, do my work and go home.  The hardest part of the job is the micromanaging managers.  The duo I currently work for are the worst I have ever seen.  Their is nothing special about the benefits package although it's not too bad."
bad,Recieve inbound calls.  Review policies and calls to help customers.
bad,"Only worked for the company one year.  Said they were going to pursue renewal of a contract that most of us hung our professional careers on only to be told ""no"" they weren't pursuing it, effectively laying of hundreds of investigators at a time when the industry is in a period of constant flux."
bad,GD is a great place to work! The company's that they do work for though have extremely high expectations and are not realistic. I would recommend this work
bad,"You are not Medicare.  But all the elderly think you are. If you transfer a call to a specialist, because you were asked, but the csr doesn't get along with caller you can get wrote up for nothing. Even if your call went correctly."
bad,This is where I developed migraines.  I thought this place was fair though.  The training was good here and the system of attendance was fair.  They also were fair when I was sick
bad,General Dynamics was great job at first. I really enjoyed going to work. Overtime this job did get the best of me. The only way you made more money was if you took a different position. You did not get raises based on your performs.
bad,"I wish I was a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb. There once was a man from Nantucket. I like turtles. Hello? Is anybody out there? Can anyone hear me?"
bad,Fast paced call center for the Affordable Care Act. Very stressful and constantly taking phone calls to assist consumers with any questions or application help. Low paying compared to other near by call centers.
bad,As a military contractor the work varies a great deal. One of the only jobs I ever heard of where all the employees are way over paid and do not do enough to justifiy compensation.
bad,"I got up at 6:00 a,m and I drove for 45 minutes to 1:00 hr to work and I got there and I set up my head phones and get my mind right so that I can be of service to the customer. And so I sat for 7:00 hours answering a phone and providing a service. I liked very much just not the pay or the ride."
bad,This is a basic customer service job. That offers 401k and health insurance this job lets you meet lots of new people and assist callers from all around the world.
bad,My typical day at work was just sitting st my desk doing nothing. I would finish all my work on Monday and have nothing to do for the rest of the week and my manager knew this. I learned nothing at this job. I had no management at all. I was in a cubical all day and barely interacted with anyone. There did not see to be any culture that I could elaborate on. The hardest part of the job was sitting there all day with nothing to do. The most enjoyable part of the day was when it ended and I could go home. I hate sitting around with no work to do. I like to be busy at work and doing nothing drove me crazy.
bad,Had a little to much freedom and not enough restrictions . Layed good workers off and kept workers only because they were their longer . Fun but a little to fun
bad,"At General Dynamics, the calls are back to back. You may have a caller from out of state calling to check on their coverage. The environment is nothing calm like, its loud and hectic."
bad,gdit is mainly a govt services organization.  they treat each contract as a separate business unit which makes cohesion difficult.  this is especially difficult if your line of work falls outside of the govt mentality  - they have a hard time wrapping their mind around something different and continuously try to fit their square peg into a round hole .
bad,"very productive, very collective place to work at. I enjoyed the time there I would recommend my friend to work here; everyone is work friendly and well respectful."
bad,Great Job. this job has shown me a lot. This position has prepaid me for a great opportunities in other area. I would recommend this job to anyone to better themselves
bad,typlcial day was good there are some days that are mandatory and you have to show up to work even if its on your day off but you get paid for it. very good people but poor management and unorganized. but overall its an ok workplace
bad,They were unorganized & cut hour by 10 for to an error which they didn't fix. They also terminated me for time missed taking care of my infant daughter who has a heart condition.
bad,I haven't worked at GD in quite a few years.  If you like working for a very large company (with many subsidiaries) then this would be the place for you.
bad,this a great company for medicare. with the new health care act this company over see's the marketplace and is the most stressful work environment I've ever worked at. the benefits were great when i was there in 2013. Good luck if interested
bad,"My experience at this location was not so pleasant, this location was always at the bottom of all call centers. Some of the staff where so overwhelmed with HR complaints."
bad,"I did not like the fact its government contract and nobody took drug test before being hired. The people that call mostly are rude. Three times already I have had an angry person call using profanity. The building is kept cold and not well ventilated, I have went through three supervisors in less than a year. Due to incidents involving guns in parking lot, and person coming through with a bat with intent to harm. There is now a security check point complete with metal detectors.  Metal utensils are not allowed in building,  It took awhile but human resources did work with me on days I need to go to appointments."
bad,"Easy job once you learn the material.  Supervisors are not helpful since they do not handle calls.  Depending on the supervisor, they may or not be willing to help you.  High turnover rates."
bad,"Not organized, not well put together...no room for advancement. To many layoffs."
bad,"If you want to go back to high school, this would be a great company to work for! The supervisors are not professional at all and I didn't enjoy coming to work every day."
bad,"The Job was easy when it came to speaking with customers and also when I participated in training fellow employees. I learned a lot of social skills, navigation skills, Keyboarding and Teamwork. For the most part my co-workers were excellent. I met a lot of incredible people. Who I wouldn't mind working with again. "
bad,A typical day at work would be answering phones and signing people up for health insurance.  It was a great job but Id like something a little more active.
bad,"I worked there as a contractor to perm position.  The pay was good, but the job security wasn't reliable and everything took forever to happen."
bad,"This job has great pay and benefits..that is about all. The hours are inconsistent every 6 months, the area you work in gets moved every other week and you switch supervisors all the time. It's honestly a mess."
bad,Assisting callers with any & all questions they had in regards to their insurance coverage. Searching claims & coverage policies to ensure giving the caller the correct information they're looking for.
bad,High volume call center more interested in phone metrics than in customer service.  Supervisor was a ghost until end.
bad,Taking inbound calls about health insurance and Medicaid.
bad,"The benefits was the best part of job. You have a lot of chances to advance in this company, Some supervisors help and some don't. Hardest part about this job is talking to the customers that are upset and will not let you help them."
bad,"This was not a good job for anyone that want advancement. They fired worker every other day, they made worker fear for their jobs. Overall not a great place to work."
bad,Consistent pay lots of overtime but very unorganized. It is frustrating to come to work and deal with this type of environment.
bad,"I was not satisfied with the Marketplace department, it was not organized and they change your schedules without first letting you know if it's okay."
bad,"Taking inbound calls and assisting the consumers with Medicare or their drug plans. Sometimes you would enroll them into new drug plans, give them some claims information, let them know what Medicare does and does not cover, order new Medicare cards if they need one and at times file complaints against doctors, drug plans and other services that work along with Medicare. Work was easy but to strict about being back on time to take calls even if your just seconds late, its a bit more strict if your bilingual. Bilinguals don't get to be off the phones like the none Bilinguals but they get paid a bit more. Co-workers are great we help each other out when we cant get a hold of a supervisor."
bad,Some parts of some of the tasks were enjoyable but for the most part I'd rather not say.
bad,"The company was doing well as Axsys Technologies, then purchased by GD and as with a lot of big company buy outs things started changing. A long story short, we had a lot of promising things planned that never went through and down sizing of the company."
bad,"Company lacks proper means to communicate with employees expeditiously. Leads to some frustration. However, benefits and salary were excellent"
bad,I had my good days and bad days with this company. It was very stressful especially when I couldnt help the people as much as I wish I could and the rules sometimes wasnt fair.
bad,"It is sad to say but this company did not want to spend much money on their employees and the work building we had to work in. Until recently, this company finally moved to a new building and before that we had work at a rundown building with stain flooring, bugs, leaking ceiling, and ect."
bad,working for GDIT was a fun place to work because every team I've been on accomplish goals each and every person on the team who done a excellence job.
bad,"As a contract job, the GDIT management is focused on renewing the Government contract rather than retaining their talent. Work activities are interesting."
bad,"You have a fixed schedule that changes every 6 months, per shift bidding process."
bad,"Great company to work for.  Management team are amazing!"
bad,"A typical day at work was fine from the beginning."
bad,Organized and sometimes unorganized chaos/no one really knows what there doing..  It seems the they care more about company policies rather than customer service or the consumer which is who pays everyone's salary
bad,they just hired supervisors off the street and they would try to fight you.
bad,"On a typical day you clock in at certain time stay logged in til break lunch etc. "
bad,I loved it only missed one day since working there was waiting on permanent but was offered . Looking to start  a  home with this company I'm very interested
bad,"I worked 8 hours a week. Off weekends,  I learned to work customers claims, and handle customers issues/concerns. Management was not helpful and very unprofessional. My co-workers were great team players. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help the customers as I wanted to.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customers"
bad,Just keep looking for another job. It is not worth your soul. Much like seeing everyone at closing time. The bright side is that it definitely teaches you that there is only so much you can do for someone.
bad,"It was difficult to tell people that we didn't have an answer, or they needed to call someone else. Most of the time beneficiaries wanted coverage options, but for some of the more emotional stuff, there wasn't much we could do."
bad,"The company have great benefits but lacks the empathy of everyday life. They have mandatory shift bid but don't care about why you must keep your shift unless it is for a medical accommodation for yourself. Nothing about being a single parent and caring for children or daycare hours or if you have a medically needy parent at home to care for.  If time of day to work an issue then this job is not the job to work. The shift bid is based on ranking that canbe effected the hours you miss, it doesn't matter how good youare at your job,  a simple hiccups as in being in the hospital or having school and daycare close can kick you out of top ranking which results inyou bein getting leftover shifts that nobody wants, and everybody else bid on the shift they want."
bad,This job is good to fall back on when you have no where else to go. However the management do not care about your daily life or Doctor appointments. GDIT is very un-organized on the daily basis. It's never a normal day.
bad,"my day at work i would enter every day get my equipment out of the locker and put my person items in my lockers. after that i would head to my work area and start to log into my account and start helping out the consumer with any question they would have. Throughout the day i would take different types of call such as; basic question about the marketplace, filling out application, checking for updates on status of the consumer, sometimes i would get hostel calls when consumer would verbally insult you and threat the company, but over all it was good. The only problem in the company is that some supervisor wouldn't have any knowledge about question we as workers would have."
bad,"Gdeneral dynmics was an amazing place to work, however i do not drive and working from home for me was my best option as rhw commute to London general dyamics was a 40 mile drive from me./ plus alot of drama in the workplace. I think there needs to be alot of changes un the workplacw/"
bad,The problem with GDIT is that contracts end and there may not be a spot for you when that happens. the overall atmosphere is great. People do seem to become like family.
bad,"This is a very fast paced company. This call center generates over 100,000 calls a day all going to different customer service representatives. Of those representatives I have the pleasure of supervising a small group of 20 people. These individuals depend on the best supervision possible in order to address their questions and concerns in order to assist high call volumes. Daily I go over procedures and policies, read over changes to new information scripting wise and also make sure my team is equipped with the information and answers they need in order to assist consumers."
good,Some things discussed in the interview isn't what the job entitled. My job has been threaten while I was going through some personal issues. This position wasn't what the posting explained.
good,"I truly loved this job but one person saying one thing and another person saying a different thing makes work conflicting, you can never do anything correctly. The supervisors have favorites and HR is extremely rude. If you want to work here be ready to suck up and kiss butt."
good,Love  talking to the Customer Helping the enroll in insurance if needed and if they need to change there information on the insurance policy I could assistance
good,It start off well then as your time goes it start to fill like a challange to maintain the empolyment their hard on you at every turn in this work place given the job is stressfull and they really mad to the stress level with all their rules and ways to get you out of their...Its a revoling door and the job secerity isnt their at all
good,"This is nothing more than a job, individuals get 4 hours off phone while others were doing the same job, management didnt offer any support and environment can become a little hostile. overall good job for individuals willing to bypass the work environment."
good,"Our manager taught us how NOT to be a manager.  He was horrible.  Hide in his office and left us to fend for our selves against our customers when issues arose.  There was distension among co-workers and the atmosphere was always stressful.  You were forced to stay long past your 8 hrs days and were NOT compensated for the time."
good,They will not work with you when you have medical issues that prevent you from working. They will tell you one thing then turn around and write you up for something that they can't prove to be honest and true.
good,not for everyone. paid sick days should atlest be a full day 8 hours. supervisors are not all on the same page there is some mangers and staff whom seem to have there own set of rules.
good,"I would answer calls about The Affordable Care Act. I would enroll, change, and assist callers with questions about their healthcare benefits."
good,"A typical day included mandatory 3-4 hour meetings. These meeting continually discussed the same issues and resolution process, without taking into account any milestones that had previously been determined. Associates that were responsible for job product were professional and hardworking. Market management was based on bullying."
good,A typical day at work would be to mentor junior staff in SOX requirements as well as CPSR requirements.  Management within my department is non-technical which hampers decisions.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when the light bulb comes on in junior staff and the realization that they are more than paper-pushers.
good,"Must know someone to get promoted. Once you get to leadership, you pay an arm and leg for Insurance that has super high deductibles making it hard to even get a benefit from it."
good,"Too Many Acquisitions.  Been bought out as a company several times in two years.  Constantly dynamic culture, mgmt,  policies, client is ignored, bottom line is money not the client or mission."
good,I've been at this job for a while this was a awesome experience to learn something new.  A lot of learning and advancements great supervisory and also management.
good,"They do not pay contractors what they are worth and there is no room for advancement. Within the previous 4 year contract, contractors had not received a pay increase. It was only when they won the most recent bid that they gave $1."
good,My job was to satisfy the callers if they have any problems with their health or if they need help gettin their medications or if they need their social security card i would be able to provide them with the service but the hardest thing about the job is when u really cant do anything to help them as they needed as in their medication or if they have a doctor's appointment and they do not habe the money to go to the doctor and u would be the representative that will tell them if u can help them or not
good,I have been employed with the company since 2007. I was unable to move to any other positions until GDIT bought out Vangent. Since then I have moved to multiple positions and excelled at every position.
good,I was given the responsibility of training new hires the correct procedure on cable idenification .and installing . I was also lead man for a couple years and responsable for running cable crews
good,Optician Technician 2/ CNC Machinist
good,• Set up and operated CNC Precitech Nanoform 250 Ultrapath and Nanoform 350.
good,"was able to assist customers with information regarding their medicare coverage, claim status, eligibilty"
good,"learned about claims pertaining to worker's compensation, general and property liabilities, helped callers locate therapy clinics"
good,"Large company still very focused on the bottom line rather than investing in decentralizing authority and investing in its people.  When you have so much Sr. Leadership lurching from one fire drill to the next, they often do not have the time to pay attention to some of the innovative ideas that burble up through the ranks. There are few innovation thought leaders in the top ranks, but lots of ideas from HR to try to make the company as a whole better in benefits, and options. The flexibility to work remote is great, and we hear everyones kids and dogs on telecomm calls.  This company is driven by contracts captured, and networking between the various centers of practice, working long hours on bids, and diving in when needed is key to being indispensable and finding your next gig when contracts end."
good,Communication sucks . Dont care for employees family life. Everything changes daily. Have to be on good ol boy club to move around or move up. Employees kill themselves for no job security.
good,"Left the job this time last year, noticed they advertise this position every few months. I would steer clear of this place.   There was an ole boy culture there that did not bode well for employees that came from a non law enforcement background."
good,My supervisor was amazing. Always there to help me with any issues I had. She would always go above and beyond. The only bad thing was you was always moved around and had to work with different people often.
good,working at general Dynamics was great at the beginning. but after time the job became to unorganized and stressful.the Hours that you work changed every couple months.
good,"General Dynamics you can advance pretty quick in the company, but what sucks is they don't have respect for their employees. There are so many things that go against the employees that General Dynamics is a revolving door. People can't stay because there is no respect for the employees at all. They don't care at all. I feel like an animal in a cage there."
good,Unhealthy practices and work environment.  Profanity is the norm and leadership are absent. Bias and favoritism are constant. Nepotism and group association are predominant with the organization.  Contractors are treated as second-class citizens.
good,I Worked in civilian sector of company and my experience was from the position I held with this company from that sector. The demographic that this position may entice would be a college student attending school or someone not necessary looking for a career.It a customer call center and direction is backwards. Employees are treated like tools rather then humans. The security of Information does not allow the employee in this sector to have any electronic/paper items on you. The job rules may make you feel like a child rather then adult employees.
good,Doing health care applications is actually fullfilling for the ACA. You get to meet different people from all over world and learn while your work.  Even though at times its gets rough but knowing you helped someone makes the job very fullfilling.
good,It was a good job but they make you deal with so much and so man guild lines with no Liesure. Usually took calls all day to assist beneficiaries with their Medicare and marketplace insurance
good,"Working here was a little stressful. The training was a bit unprofessional and unorganized. After training was even worse because I had no clue who my supervisor was and when I finally found out they had no clue what they were doing. NONE of the systems that we were poorly trained on worked properly. Overall all it was ""ok"" I guess because my checks were pretty cool."
good,This place is easy to work at but the scripts are a bit much to read verbatim. The building I worked at had a really bad issue with bed bugs and the management promised plenty bonuses that weren't acknowledged.
good,"Handling escalation calls and doing reporting for 15 or more employees to ensure that they are on task, as well as completing additional task that is given by the management team."
good,"Working hours were good, but atmosphere was not very encouraging."
good,"This is place does have good pay but not enough for the mental stress that comes with it. There are always chances to work overtime which is great if you want to make extra money. Management does not care about their employees and when you ask a question about open positions, your fringe benefits, or anything they give you a generic answer. The vision insurance is horrible. There is chance for advancement but it takes a long time and brown nosing to get there. I do enjoy helping people with Medicare with their problems or questions."
good,General Dynamics was a good work place but had a lot of drama and a lot of unorganized supervisors who couldn't rally help and it was stressful at moments but it was nice to be able t solve issues and problems that consumers were having and I learned quite a bit of patience in this field of work.The hardest part of the job was knowing I couldn't help everyone faced with an unfortunate situation.
good,Typical work day log in check my emails. I have to make sure that I don't have to no reviews due in my e-power. After I complete my reviews. I have to log in and be ready for phone calls or web chat.
good,It's a nice place to work at. Busy taking calls all day. Management is ok they are always there to help you. Co- workers are nice. the hardest thing about the job is the new shift bid. the most enjoyable thing about the job is the ato they offer.
good,"A typical work day included checking inventory, checking facility for anything wrong, ordering supplies, doing monthly reports, helping with returns and shipping."
good,A day at work answering calls with irate consumers and assisting them. I learned that with great communication and understanding the consumers enjoy talking to me and management appreciates me taking control of the calls which is normally the hardest part of the job but I was able to create great call management skills throughout the day which made everyday enjoyable dealing with different consumers and personalities ending with a great outcome.
good,"As a temp with aerotek, i was paid well, and laid off first.lol...I learned that my age has everything to do with weather or not i got hired as a permanennt employee. No ranks were evident. i dont know if it was to avoid responsibility or not. My coworkers were out for themselves, meaning some of them, have no problems telling on someone that did something wrong. In my experience, this behavior is because supervisors award it instead of discouraging it. The hardest part of the job was the high temperature in the main spaces we were working in. Acytually that probably wasnt the hardest part. I think the hardest part is when i took over leading the crew because the supervisor had anoter job in florida that lasted for 10 days. The crew was expected to fail and fall behind. I new most of the employees from previous jobs, they had worked for me before. Some of the crew refused, but most looked to me for guidance. I led the crew to a level of production far beyond the previous weeks.So the hardest part, is not being recognized (by the management for my accomplishments) when lay off time came. Or maybe i was....The most enjoyable part of the job, honestly, was going home."
good,"I gained a wealth of knowlege about Medicare. Management varied. Some were good, some were bad. The company is not very understaning about medical issues. Co-workers were the best. The hardest part of the job was taking inbound phone calls. They came in every 1 to 8 seconds and you did not have time to transition from one call to the next. The most enjoyable part of the job was the inbound correspondence."
good,Monitor employees on phone making sure they were giving correct information. Attend all ongoing training and disperse what I learnt to my team.
good,"GD management had no involvement with my job working for the US Govt under contract.  I felt I worked for my Govt COTR, more than for GD.  It felt like since they weren't involved, my salary wasn't based on any first hand knowledge of my performance."
good,"A typical day is 5:00am - 3:00pm"
good,GDIT started out really treating employees like people. That changed wildly over the course of a decade. They are not competitive in wages nor benefits.
good,"GDIT does not keep up with the industry in an effort to low ball contracts and under pay talent. When people want to move up they cant. I worked hard to move up and learn more, but was kept low and not treated like a coworker but a menial worker."
good,"I actually really enjoyed working for GDIT for University of Maryland University College. I revel in assisting As a Student Service Center Representative, I would help students with their Financial Aid, Student Accounts, including providing information as to if and when their Student loans and Grants would disburse, as well as assisted with applying for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)."
good,"quick paced, very strict, follow a points system always hired on as temporary so there isnt much job security especially working for the marketplace. There is a severe lack of management knowledge of policies. if you get hired permanently they will tell you your new schedule if you dont agree to it, whether it's due to schedule conflicts or whatever the reason may be, they will let you know when your last day will be."
good,"Good old boy network with little chance for advancement.  "
good,"Managing call volume; learning new material during training about healthcare procedures and policy; GDIT is a functional and productive workplace with equal opportunity for all associates; the most enjoyable part of the job is helping consumers and beneficiaries with healthcare that fits their needs based on cost, coverage and convenience."
good,They are more focused on their contracts than employees. I had been fighting termination for 3 months due to having surgery . They then fired me for another reason. They closed the site and combined 2.
good,"Even though majority of the days I dreaded going to work, my role as a Customer Service Representative Tier 2 was to ensure that the consumers were taken care of to the fullest extent possible.  However, that was not the importance for the supervisor.  They want you gone with no exceptions for anything."
good,"It's an alright place. It's not a hard job at all, but leadership makes it unbearable. The restrictive guidelines and rude atmosphere can be a bit much at times."
good,"It's ok, it served it purpose. It's not to bad . Management could be a lot better. The hours are ok as long as you meet the requirements,  pay raises are long over due."
good,"If you're looking for a happy review, please don't look here."
good,No comment. Do not wish to make a comment. I am currently seeking for employment to relocate to another company for growth and development that aligns with my personal convictions.
good,My typical day of work at general dynamics was very stressful. The computers were usually down. When I was in the middle of an application with a consumer the system would shut down and I would lose all the data and sometimes the consumer. It is not a very friendly environment. My pay check was incorrect numerous times.
good,"data entry for the affordable care act.  consumers would call in to submit applications for insurance.   would let consumers know what insurance they qualify for.  or if they didn't qualify, let them know that they either were eligible for medicaid or not at all."
good,Took calls at the building when the Health Care Marketplace just opened up and the website wasn't operating correctly. Was let go from the company after the second month for a failed background check. Mostly took calls and apologized for the site being down and telling them to check back later. It was a bit embarrassing but wasn't able to do more before let go.
good,"Stagnant working environment, absolutely no room for advancement. If a manager leaves or retires job not posted and another individual is moved internally. Statement, ""takes an act of congress to move into next pay band"" so employees top out and receive .5-1% even when annual performance ratings high."
good,"The company has some pretty decent benefits but, when it comes to their contracted work it leaves more to be desired. The culture also can leave a bitter taste in one's mouth. If you are an independent person your best opportunities can be located within their internal resources. Management can use some improvement and you shouldn't expect much for your annual raise. It is a good stepping stone but it's difficult to advance in your career without making some pretty good connections. Most of the time you're treated as a number instead of a person."
good,"It's an ok place to work, not to bad. Pay is pretty good and it is climate controlled. About the worse part is having to put up with some of the people that called in. A good thing about working there is free health insurance, but it is just a bronze plan which kinda sucks"
good,Prepare to work for a company making extremely serious and dangerous weapons. Management is scattered across the country and you will have about 8 superiors most likely...
good,It was an experience to say the least worked 8 hour days and helped people with their insurance if you are mental unstable do not get this job
good,the call center i was at was one of the most unprofessional place of work with managers telling on other angers about cellphones to stay goodgraces with sr management
good,Utilize an in house software to enter patient information in the computer for insurance applications. Answer the telephone and effectively communicate with patients and other insurance agency.
good,"great incentives the company and benefits, the company is no long open. i had a wonderful schedule that was based on what you can work"
good,"The management is set on groupthink when one is outside that, to succeed is impossible. The company is overly strict on security that individual's ability to function normally is tightly restricted. I do not have complaint as for me because of the need but many would."
good,"Loyalty is only a word.  Management is clueless.  Employees are just part of the furniture.  On the plus side, every other Friday off is nice."
good,I learned alot working there but no one is on the same page.Some supervisors go buy different rules. You will work like crazy and the point system isn't lieniant to those who may have children or when the weather is bad they expect you to still show up.
good,"Hard to get any sort of advancement, kept in the dark more often than was necessary, management lacked basic skills with programs used and therefore could not resolve issues when required. Agents like myself had the knowledge, but not the importance, to make valuable and needed changes."
good,We generally take calls all day about Obamacare and help consumers apply.
good,This is the third time I've worked for General Dynamanics and their loyality is clearly to the bottom line and not to the employee.
good,I cannot say more than I had some excellent co-workers and that I worked on an interesting project.
good,vangent was a 1800 medicare hotline that was there to assist people with disabilities and over the age of 65 that were on medicare with there insurance claims and accounts
good,Company acquired an company which turned into actually a merger. Virtually all GDIT management and support area employees have been fired and replaced with the new company 's staff.
good,"Horrible company as far as management goes, its all a game of who brown noses the best. and heaven forbid you have a personal matter to deal with during your scheduled hours, they will make you feel like a worthless emoloyee for it. The job its self, not bad at all, inbound customer service calls. Coworkers were are great and the only reason I keep showing up."
good,While I did enjoy the flexability of the schedule I didn't enjoy the manager or the way he ran his business due to some possible illegal activity.
good,"I worked first shift, and i my day went by fast. It was a call center, and we provided information to beneficiaries about what coverage they had under their insurance."
good,This project had weak management and lacked the organizational skills to maintain an efficient work environment.
good,I feel GDIT is a good place to work if you like a face pace as well as relaxing type of job.  Work there is and experience that kinda take you by surprise when faced with customers.
good,As and area contract manager sat in the office of the client. managed  17 staff from other companies and no space for an office or my own in the building.
good,"back when i worked there they were underpaying us, but they are somewhat decent on the time missed and the ATO that they'll allow you to take. My supervisor i had last was a significant improvement over my initial supervisor and most supervisors cant do their job effectively. as well as a few of the managers who were way outta their element. "
good,"The required rules, across the board are not consistent. Certain positions are ""held to a higher standard"" however, this ""higher standard"" is not noted anywhere and is at the hands of the inexperienced Project Coordinator/manager."
good,"General Dynamics Information Technology is a job that you can move up in if you have no other life outside of your employment. If you have kids, then this may not be the job for you. It's seasonal employment, and although you make 10.35 per hour, you bring home very little money."
good,"Federal contact, had the opportunity to be apart of something great! Manager was unorganized but it was expected being that it's was a new contract and new roll out."
good,GDIT is OK if you are just starting out looking for a job but there really isn't much room to grow. You have to apply for everything instead of them just promoting you. I have learned and is still learning to have patience with the callers and provide a peace of mind. My supervisor is great and my Manager was wonderful to work with. The hardest part of the job is having to sit and listen to beneficiaries when they are angry and taking it out on me. However I enjoy helping them and making sure they get the information that is needed.
good,Very miss managed and stressful work environment created by  unprofessional and biased managers and supervisors. The management has fostered a very backstabbing and cutthroat work environment among the staff.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is helping others! I was able to experience mentoring, knowing what others deal with financial institutions. The work wasn't hard, it was dealing with others. Challenge yes, but impossible NO!"
good,"I enjoyed working at the warehouse for the most part, the people were great and the work was steady. There was simply a lack of stability and communication. Would only recommend if you can get a permanent job there."
good,"Like every other Govt contractor as long as there is work you have a job, once the money or project finishes so are you.  No real training or educational opportunities."
good,"Unethical Management.  No job security.  Not a great place to work.  If you like being on the road and have no family it may be for you, otherwise keep looking."
good,Take inbound calls all day and make sure you were caught up with all new material
good,Fast past environment where you had to learn on your own for some applications of the job. 
good,"Typical defense job - slightly interesting work. The product was interesting, the line people, leads and management wanted you to participate in the operation and design of the product. Very collaborative."
good,A typical day at work would be just sitting at my desk not being able to talk to others. I learned how to have patience when it comes to dealing with all types of customers.
good,"There's not much to say other than it's temporary work, unless you're hired on permanently. SOME supervisors are great, while the others are just awful and very rude! It's a job though, so it pays the bills for now."
good,"Before I was hired, I was given information that sounded good. After I was hired I found  out most of that information was wrong. Bad pay, bad hours, bad management. i left the first day"
good,The job is ok i just feel that they need new management and to be more n when it comes to people losing family members especially there daughter! I would say get your checks and plan on getting something better!
good,This is a very easy job. The pay is poor and the work can be very stressful. It can be easy at times. Must be able to maintain a balance  between personal life and work life.
good,"I like to meet people and learn more more form other things ."
good,"Stuck to your phone and desk all day."
good,The 3 months I was there I notice.... They treat there contractor like garage and thier manufacting manager is a worthless . They don't know how to manage their work load. So their are constantly hiring and firing contractor.
good,"Not that great of a comany to work for and breaks and lunch seem to fly then the rest of the day drags on. Only temp comany, very few people are actually hired on. Good insurance and training on material"
good,When I began working at GDIT we didn't even have computers to use while in training and when we went live and began taking calls we had to do the best we could.
good,while working there I saw a lot of non-white people getting upset about how they were being treated and white staff using there power to get people out
good,"This was a great place to work, but had funding issues. The work was easy and I had plenty to do. It was devastating when I found out that I had to leave because they lost their funding."
good,"GDIT is a good company if you are looking for further opportunities within the company. They are known for hiring within for management positions, quality, or even the company's training department."
good,general dynamics was an okay place to work however there wasn't much organization and mandatory overtime was tough and lack of flexibility
good,This atmosphere was very unprofessional and seemed as anyone was qualified to work for this company. A lot of fraud took place from this company due to the employees that were hired
good,Would not recommend working at this place of employment constantly getting cussed out by callers calls are back to back cannot breath in between calls the system they use is horrible hard to navigate to verify information
good,"I would love to keep my review and opinions of other workplaces to myself, since this company does not focus on the employees. But the production itself."
good,"At the start of open enrollment things started off a little slow. Managers and Supervisors were learning the correct procedures to implement on the floor. As time went by, we were getting things done and people were getting their results."
good,My review for them is rather low the job is easy the money is decent but the management is horrible. The environment with the Co workers feel like high school with all the drama.
good,I've learned a lot from my time with GDIT it was a good place to work I was able to network and complete several projects with the company that help strength my management skills.
good,"A typical day on the job consist of unstructured work environment that has high expectations, yet low accommodations. This place of employment has potential to be better than it is, but need to go through a serious restructuring."
good,"Drive to secure new business at all costs leads to unrealistic bids on work."
good,The pay is okay but the benefits are just terrible. I have never spent more on health care in my life. The different teams don't communicate and are always at odds. Also because everything is on a contract there is no security at all.
good,"Se iba rapido el tiempo teniendo trabajo, aprendi a tener paciencia, la direccion gerencia no los conoci eran muchas empresas involucradas y la comunicacion era soo por telefono; los compañeros que me tocaron eran amables, responsables y divertidos, lo mas dificil eran las personas problematicas y que a pesar de todo se le daba un buen trato."
good,This is a great entry level job for someone entering the workforce. It is a call center open 24 hours and you took inbound calls from members wanting to enroll in the Market place plan under the Affordable Care Act
good,Poorly managed in multiple departments. lack of pay does not help the long hours and mandatory days. Back to Back calls and poorly staffed.
good,"Collections representative for Macy's, Home Depot, Avon and Chevron. High volume calls, at-least 120 plus calls per day."
good,Not a good company to work for if you are not in the actual marketing department as far as pay goes
good,"Customer Service "
good,"I found General Dynamics to be a stressful place to work. You're graded on each phone call and they do come back to back most of the time. Your entire work life there seems to revolve around a score card. Nothing is consistent, not your locker, not your desk, they move you around several times. I was there 6 months and my desk was moved 3 times as was my locker. Oh and each call is timed! So rather than taking your time to help each person you are expected to take as many calls as possible while giving them accurate information. Less than 5 minutes is desirable. Not nearly enough time to properly help because you start looking at the clock and rushing them off the phone. It's my opinion this needs to change!"
good,"- Poor management"
good,"Company flopped after 6 months and laid everyone off its typical with General Dynamics they hire you hype. you up about great perks and than drop you in no time flat."
good,"The strives to provide excellent service to the general public. However, General Dynamics fails when it comes to the employees. The benefits are poor, the work conditions are stringent and advancement seems to follow the good old boy network."
good,Management needs serious improvement. Work 60-80 hrs a week and you are expected to pick up the slack of other co-workers that can not perform their basic duties.
good,Enjoyed the experience of working there. I would love to see and work at a more structured company.
good,I enjoyed working here. i love to help people and my team were always one of the top teams on the floor. I like to make my team a laid back atmostphere where they can fell rewarded for doing a good job. But this call center went the other direction and do not show positive reinforcement. they only punish if you do bad but give nothing if you do good. People do like that as a motivator.  I love Coworkers and talking about a situation and working as a team to get something resolved.  Most enjoyable was knowing that all CSR on the floor always wanted on my team because i treat them right. Hardest part of the job is understanding certain processes that make the job harder for no reason what so ever.
good,"Really don't have much to say for now."
good,"Working under GDIT at AFRC was my first job post retirement from the Armed Forces. I enjoyed my work but the work environment at Robins AFB is kinda reminiscent of the Good Ole Boy era. "
good,"Overall, I was impressed with GDIT as a company and it's benefits, worldwide presence and familiarity with Defense and Intelligence. I happened to be placed on a contract with managers that probably were overwhelmed and mission focused ONLY. Customers are a priority, but let's not forget about the personnel that work for you. I can provide more details upon request."
good,"Decent place to work. Management is disconnected.  Training is minimal, you definitely have to be a self-starter here."
good,"Overall - Good place to work"
good,"If you are looking for some expierence in the customer service /healthcare fields. .this job will teach you that. Otherwise, coming from a customer service background, to this business was NOT at all what id imagined. The secure floor policy means just that. ANY personal belongings, ie., cellphone, purse, comb, etc needs & must be securely locked in your personal locker or car. Its not a joke. They take this very seriously. Managenent is a bit unorganized, you get so many diff instructions you dont know who you shld or shldnt follow. Just do your job, stay to yourself if at all possible. Be careful who you discuss personal life with, it will spread like wildfire. They tend to hire alot of recent hs grad/college grads...which speaks for alot of the drama goin on there.  Its 90% female. If you are prepared for the constant changes this job is perfect for you. I couldnt make that place a final step in my career. I see those that do & love it there. I would def recomm this job to my younger siblings who are fresh to the job world. But it paid *some* of my bills. That 12.06 p/hr didnt scratch the surface for me. I cld go on & on. Honesty I hated this place. Will never go back!"
good,Co-workers are great. Work is fun in that it is diverse: ME's preform a wide range of tasks
good,"Exciting product. Talented engineering team, and for most part smart folks."
good,Enjoyed working with the defense clients and recruiting military personnel leaving the military to come work for GDIT
good,"There is a lack of support from upper management, everyone is working 3 or more jobs either in or out of their realm, and staff is under valued under paid. Additional demands to hire resources are shot down."
good,Calls coming in back to back and you can't even done you can't even done your last call. They have the claims reps taking all the calls while the Tier 1 reps are getting paid for nothing.
good,"working in a team enviroment, daily repairs on computers, laptops, printers, and servers"
good,this is a long term temp position. So not secure for secure employment
good,"Take inbound calls for Medicare beneficiaries. The job was easy, but management was very difficult at times.The lunches were only 30 minutes and that would be fine if you didnt have to walk so far to get out the building or to the cafeteria because it takes 15 minutes off the lunch."
good,Answer phones
good,Worked for GDC4S for almost 5 years. Management was conerned about nothing but profits. There was no Work/Life Balance and no concern for the emloyees at all.
good,I have no real complaints. The work/life balance with this job is difficult. Promotion opportunity didn't seem promising. Overall the position supplied my income.
good,I would have loved it if not for the toxic and negative atmosphere in the office and stringent requirements and tests for being able to work certain contracts.
good,"It was a great experience being the first class of reps at GDIT when the company was originally setting up. Things were still good for about 6 months and then the massive hiring events began and the quantity of people may have increased but definitely not the quality. It seemed like the more people hired, the more problems occurred. I'm glad to be free!"
good,If you speak Spanish this is a great place to work. The work is easy once you complete training. You’ll have a schedule pool to decide what shift you’ll be assigned to. The job is team oriented which helps with staying included with the company. Hardest part of job is getting the schedule you desire. Most enjoyable part of job is servicing the customer to the best of your ability. Management could be better but if you  perform well you’ll be ok.
good,"Generally, a good place for a job, but not a career. Better company for individuals with technology/computer science backgrounds than typical analytical backgrounds."
good,"If you can handle sitting in one place, taking back to back calls, with the good possibility that you will get cussed on each one, then this one is for you. However the company is no longer there."
good,Decent place for entry level personnel to gain experience.  Provides remote resources for self development.  Practically no interaction with employer or leadership if working on contract. Training is not easily attained.  In processing was no clear with requirements of new employees.  Evaluation requirements are in constant state of change.  Overtime is not authorized but work schedule can be reasonably accommodated.
good,I've been working for this company for that last 7 years but there is constant contract turnover and under bidding.  I've seen numerous lay offs due to the under bidding.
good,The people and salary and bonus are the only good thing there.  management expects you to do overtime all the time.  They have flex time but when you are on overtime all the time it seems impossible to make the time up.
good,"I liked most of the people that I worked with, but management and supervisors were very uneven in how they treated the crew. When I was sick and in the hospital, I didn't loose my job."
good,very stressful. no one really wants to help as they say.  Throwed into the fire after coming out a training class to fend for yourself. I fought to get my short term disability even when i submitted the paperwork from my doctor about the surgery i was getting prepared for
good,"We held the contract for 8.5 years and now GDIT has taken over. There has been huge shift in moral and people are leaving."
good,"Steady job, good benefits."
good,"This was a temporary/contract position, so I was not there for a long period of time. A subsidiary of GD, Vangent is a provider of healthcare technology."
good,Being hired for a specific job and then being placed in a lesser role stunted my career growth. Once laid off the lack of growth is hurt me severely in trying to find another job.
good,It was a ok place to work. Once yu learn the call flows and how to handle difficult callers the jobs get easier. You’ll just never know what kinda day or night your supervisor or manager has had and that could affect your work production.
good,"It was an okay job for a temp job. Decent pay, interesting topic to discus on phone. Opportunity to work OT & make extra money. Management isnt all that good but i am sure they could improve."
good,flexible schedules and easy work. you will like this place if you like talking to new people a lot and solving problems. However that is about it. Its not fulling and there is little to improve upon.
good,"I transferred from one government contract to another.  I was very disappointed in a large company.  The benefits are mostly non existent.  Leave is a joke, as a single mother the leave not professional."
good,"The job is a great way to get work related experience, However, they do not give raises and they have a high turn over rate. The work environment is toxic and they'll hire anybody that can fill a seat."
good,"They are the worst in micro management! No one super has the same info as another and everything comes with a ""difference of opinion""  Your job is hanging over your head every minute of every day so much that I personally had night mares about it often. They would treat you good by paying you for your ""mandatory"" over time by adding to your paycheck but in the end...taxes still come out so you still have nothing.  It's a freaking sham over there!"
good,"If you come from an environment where work is expected of the employee? Do not work here. The worst of the worst. They enjoy failing. Union employees can do absolutely nothing all day long and never be reprimanded. Zero teamwork. Everyone is more focused on spreading rumors and what misery is going on in someone's life. Its a constant soap opera, high drama."
good,"Was a unique experience as it was a large call center. Training was not very good and computers had a lot of issues. You were like tied to desk, not much freedom to move around. Hired people to fill the desks."
good,"GDIT was a smaller component division of General Dynamics.  Because of this relationship, often the employees of GDIT appeared to be esteemed as less than those of the primary company."
good,"If you are okay with no job security, then gdit can work out for you. They offer health benefits, 401k, and bonus incentives. However, you stay employed for anywhere from 3-8 months of the year and then you're let go until the season starts again."
good,This job is a typical government contract call center job. The hardest part of this job was there was no time to breathe between calls. 2nd was the equipment we had at the time was substandard
good,"General Dynamics would be recommended to anyone that enjoys very fast-paced job. This call center is so unpredictable when it comes to breaks , lunches and clock out due to the high call volume and not being able to tell what the next person is calling for. call could last anywhere from 3 mins to 2 hours also getting penalized for not taking breaks and lunches when scheduled."
good,"GD was suppose to be my last job. They decided to close our division. It was hard to trasistion to another job, because they needed my expertise until the last."
good,"GDIT used a point system to decide who was hired and fired. They also had internal audits of the phone calls that you were taking. Some things seem to go good but for the most part it felt as if you were threatened during your counseling with the quality team. All in all, the company received raises but it was never tickled to down to the customer service representatives"
good,"Contracting world so your job is always hanging over your head. Lot's of hours, poor management, little room for advancement.  Good people, but contracts seem hard to come by, especially in the Montgomery, AL area."
good,"The part of GDIT worked for was just a job.  Did not believe in the part that they were involved in so it made it hard to go to work.  The people at the facility were nice, but the job itself was not.  Several days I felt like crying because of the stuff I saw and heard. Glad I was able to leave that place."
good,GD was a great company to work for for a while. When I first started it was a great laid back place to work then we had a lot of turnover mostly because of poor compensation.  And then we lost our military contract.
good,My co-workers are helpful and treat me very well. The only draw back is the type of material that we use most is hazardous to peoples health. Other than the health risk it is a good place to work.
good,Answered inbound calls regarding Marketplace applications and coverage.  Metrics based environment with not much emphasis on the culture.  Used relevant resources and scripts to process applications.
good,"textbook dead end job:  no advancement, company doesn't give references or referrals, a basic professional courtesy.  in-house training offers little transferable skills.  Advancement is on the outside, revolving door turn over rate."
good,"Great a first poor management, the Manager was only worried about how he looked. He was not educated on the industry at all and was a big towards female workers."
good,"I have worked in the medial field for many years and in many different offices. This was the first time that I had worked in a pediatric office and I found it very difficult and enjoyable. I got to see babies a week after they were born and then see them grow up. Sometimes it was difficult since the children would not always enjoy the visits. "
good,"HR is difficult to work with and will not reply back to you about accommodations, will end up firing you for medical reasons even if you submit a medical accommodation and the supporting documentation from a doctor about your condition. "
good,you were your own boss had an amount of hours needed to work worked for the affordable care act.always learning new information to keep up with customer concerns
good,It's employment. Can't complain. As long as you do your job you are golden. Not much room for advancement. Set salary with no increases due to current contract.
good,"There was a demand for leadership here at this job, and I was happy to ablige it with my one of many roles that i played here at this company, it was over all a good experience with the company, however the home life does fall short due to the demand of the job, as in shift selection not being very good."
good,"Overall good company, the balance between family was a challenge. There was little to no advancement unless you knew upper management"
good,Employees who came in under a different contract get paid more than those who started at the same time. The management is very weak. I did learn more about working in a very diverse culture.
good,Supervisors are great and very approachable. Management is not that good. Training is mediocre at best. They do the bare minimum in training. When you get to the floor you will most likely not know how to do your job. The office manager thinks you are below him and treats you that way. No raises at all. You can become an acting supervisor but chances are after OEP ends you go back to your previous position. Near impossible to advance beyond Tier I/Tier II/ISG. Most of the time you end up with an acting position anyway. Extremely strict on processes instead of focused on the consumer. They don't really care about the consumer they just want a good scorecard. Pay is not worth the positions offered.
good,"Received and processed incoming phone calls from customer or client base. Recorded details of customer transactions, interactions, complaints, comments. Effectively identified customer concerns over the phone. Responded to customer inquiries. Assessed validity of customer complaints. Determined possible causes of customer complaints. Communicated with a clear, distinct voice. Maintained effective working relationships with customers. Performed office duties such as data entry, word processing, filing."
good,"its an ok company to work for upper management don't care for the employees, too many issues with the upper management that has not been iron out. and the employees have to pay the price."
good,"I enjoy helping my consumers with their Market Place issues, the company have a lot to be desired in the management, they change the policies and standard operating procedures to their liking and without revision. Their quality on calls is very nit picking. Making it hard to stay within standards. Work is very busy calls are back to back."
good,"Good fair wages, Great company but small sections and advancement is very limited. Tend to favor your past military rank for positions and responsibility regardless of your current time or accomplishments"
good,"easy job, management is horrible though, co workers were great for the most part, enjoyed my job and the pay. managers were very disrespectful"
good,Lack of communication! The upper management were not innovative. They lacked communication with their employees. The company was fair with their decisions.
good,"most the people at GD are ok, however, the few make is painful."
good,The contracts and customers are more important than the employees that they derive revenue from.  Churn and burn culture.
good,"Just a job that paid the bills. No chance of advancement if you did not have a BA Degree, or was a member of the good-ole-boys club."
good,Company offers great health insurance benefits. The pay is not great due to not being able to get raises each year due to being on SCA contract.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering phone calls for the Marketplace Affordable Care Act. "
good,Dynamic environment where an HR Professional never gets bored.  Always challenging and lots to do especially during ramp up and ramp down.
good,Nice work environment for sub-contractors. The GD partnership with CSC proved to be problematic at times and challenging to IT services.
good,Thankful for the experience. Excellent benefits but disappointed because I was moved to a new department that did not exist.Seem to be only interested in bilingual workers.
good,Start work at 6am every morning. Which means we sit around the conex box till almost 8am waiting on paper work from the leadmen. Once given our work package we go to the location of the job to inspect it for what supplys we may need to finish or repair the job. Now that it is almost lunch we will not start the job until after lunch. After lunch we began work which leaves 2 to 4 hours of working. I believe in getting to work and getting the job done.
good,"Assisting Medicare benificiaries understand medicare benefits."
good,"This Market was not set-up properly and never had a chance. The lack of management ability was mind blowing."
good,"Constant threats of lay offs - power hungry people."
good,"Working as a call center supervisor, My job consist of on a daily basis supervising 15 to 25 reps a day. Handling daily reports such as Schedule adherence, attendance, monitors, managing of calls per day. My job is to make sure my team has the tools and support in order for them to do their job. I also take calls such as suicide calls and supervisor calls which can be challenging at times. The hardest part of my job is being able to spend enough time to coach and develop my reps on a weekly bases. Due to a large team and work load. Coaching and developing 20 reps at a time can be challenging. Also due to shift bids every six months, I don't really have enough time to develop a strong relationship and development plan with each reps. One thing I love about my job is that every day I get to help or save at least one person life by enrolling them into the best insurance plan to fit there living needs."
good,friendly people to work with but no job security and stability.
good,"5x8 work week when not under the gun"
good,"very difficult to be promoted, a solid job for those who have strong attendance. They recognize attendance over quality of work.  I did learn about the lending process with the Dept of Education. Left job because they were not flexible with scheduling and there were no opportunities for career advancement."
good,"The management lacks depth and experience. Is more considered about the bottom line and not a quality product, because they are extremely willing to cut the most experience people just to low ball a contract."
good,Assist callers with their questions on the medicare coverage and enroll beneficiaries in their drug plans.
good,The job felt like a job and did not focus on the employees at all.
good,"I enjoyed this job most because it's dealing with a really hot-button topic such as healthcare and insurance and I was the messenger at the helm of it helping people make sense out of a very confusing process."
good,"I love working at General Dynamics IT and helping consumers with any issues they may have but Management/Supervisors are unprofessional. They don't care about their employers at GDIT. They make sure there is plenty of security but when it comes to the employees personal lives and safety traveling in inclement weather, they can care less. As long as you're there to assist consumers, they're happy. The pay and benefits are great and it could be a good work environment sometimes. They just need to get rid of the bad apples."
good,"no dan viáticos para moverte de los diversos lugares de trabajo"
good,"I have always enjoyed fostering new learning and thinking outside the box to help others."
good,Managers were very unpleasant.  At least they pay well though!
good,"You get there at 5 in the morning to start your working day. You go checkout what you are going to do for the day. As the day goes by you will find yourself taking on small different projects. It all depends on what you are doing on the job. It changes as time goes."
good,"There were too many people doing the same job. Not enough work to go around & you were reprimanded for not ""looking bisy"" How can you ""look busy"" when there is NOTHING to look busy doing!"
good,Typical day at work:
good,"I have been in several areas of the business. I left a huge corporation for a small to mid-size company in 2007. At that time, I felt like what I did mattered to the company; all the employees at that time felt like family. I thrived in an environment where I could openly share my opinions and speak candidly about the issues that we were experiencing. I started in IT, transferred to Accounting, then to Finance and finally HR. In late 2011, we were acquired by a huge defense contractor. Our culture went through a terrible shock, and GDLS has done little to improve morale. I have experienced at least 6 RIFs during my time of employment; I have seen many good people come and go. The most rewarding experience I have had in my career so far has been speaking for myself and for what I feel is right. I also have realized that I know I can do any job that I put my mind to and I'm well rounded enough to fit nicely in the departments that require analytical and detail oriented skills to solve problems and provide solutions"
good,Long days behind computer screen. Learned very little. Management sub-par. Leadership lacking. I am not interested in reviewing this company. The pay is sub-par for the amount of grief and work you are given. If you want to know more about this organization perhaps you should ask someone who has been working there longer than 8 months.
good,I worked on site with the government accounting staff and learned a lot about the government's financial processes. I also learned first hand how government contractors and government employees can interact. This was my first taste of government contracting.
good,"A typical day at work is very complicated only because ypu are being monitored and scored on your calls, having to be off a call within a certain time frame. I learned alot about Medicare and true customer service. Management is not great at all some people plays by one set 0f rules and others y therer own so you dont know what is right or wrong. Your co- worker on your team are the best part of the job an is what keeps you going."
good,"Working at this company was shortlived because they primarily rely on gaining contractual bids. They lost the bid for broadband wireless when I was employed by them and I was laid off. As a result, I do not have much to add regarding this employer."
good,No room for any type of vertical movements within the company.
good,On a daily basis I build and calibrate military SATCO antennas.
good,- Pay and benefits are competitive.
good,Cafeteria in building made it nice not having to leave the office. GD merged with Anteon so alot of things changed from GD culture to Anteon culture
good,"The company provides hours to work but they do not have enough people for the work load. They can careless about your family life. They can careless about your time you have to use, they want you to use it to their advantage."
good,Although the company no longer exist they were not organized  and they pay grade was lower than expected. I learned a lot and picked up a few skills that I can use for future careers.
good,Low wage compensation even at the highest Tier level. Employees are taken advantage of and generally will not be compensated for the hard work put forward.
good,"I enjoyed the training program. However, once out of nesting, the managers have shown favoritism and social circles. If they don't like you they get rid of you by grading your calls badly."
good,Fine place to work although orkplace culture is non-existent and it makes it hard to grow as an employee. Lack of training opportunities and lack of interest from upper management.
good,General Dynamics manangement of the  OPM contract was abysmal since the day they were awarded the contract.  Ended up being laid off due to contract loss.
good,"If you have worked for a government services company, then you know how it is. They are burdened by the government and it slows down innovation. If you can find your way onto a good team, you will have a good time."
good,working for General Dynamics was an absolute challenge regarding customer service and helping other CSR's and Medicare recipients they would require shift changes that were not feasible for working oncatered
good,"GD was an okay job, my supervisor was great, some managers showed favoritism towards certain races, would talk to some and laugh and joke around and ignore others"
good,I was a temporary hire.  Hundreds of people and I were laid off without notice. The pay is 10.34! You talk to people about insurance all day not worth it
good,was a good culture and fun place until they acquired CSRA and everything changed and not for the better... no communication whatsoever...  doors closed all the time with whispering in the hallways..
good,"Easy going job but crazy call volume 3 seconds between each call, you have to be the absolute pick of the crop to get promoted, the people in the high levels of the job have been there for at least 5-6 years ."
good,"a typical day at work is logging in and helping the beneficiaries when they call."
good,"General Dynamics was a great place to work but offered no room for advancement. They had excellent benefits including (health insurance, life insurance, retirement, vacation and sick days)."
good,"I would like to see better level of fair treatment between the genders and fair salaries vs hours of work. Loved the team and the manager, but the rest of the set up for a contractor was poorly managed"
good,"As part of acquisition, company moved too fast (i.e., setting deadlines and timetables) transitioning new organizational processes and systems without consideration of all ramifications."
good,This place is rather stressful and everything is in a hyper state of change constantly. You are in constant fear of becoming obsolete because things change so often that you could become obsolete
good,"The company expanded its service throughout the world by the late 1970s. The company was primarily interested in offshore and intercontinental deliveries, but the success of FedEx prompted their own intra-US expansion starting in 1983."
good,"I can't speak for GDIT as a whole, just for the contract I am on. There is a need for improvement on the management level, and there is no real opportunity for advancement, because management holds you back."
good,"I worked out of a lab, so it was a great place to learn.  If the person is driven, they can learn enough to be an engineer.  However, the company does not pay well."
good,"It pays well, but you kind of just feel like a number. I had supervisors that seemed to invest and supervisors and didn't. "
good,"Ambiente de trabajo duro y bajo presión, con poco deseo por la calidad,"
good,It was difficult to move up within the company and the pay was low for industry standards.  Contract work was volatile and management wasn't a professional as they could have been.
good,Disorganized management. Lack of communication. Constant little prizes and contests for everything under the sun almost highlight the necessity for consolation prizes when you look at your paycheck. On the opposite end the benefits are decent.
good,"I liked the company when I started years ago. Too many changes and after bought out this last time, not as good of company to work for. Health insurance is a bit high for family and wages are not the best. Some people have not had raises in several years of working there."
good,Things are always changing and systematic controls are not in place. As with any call center you have to deal with the clicks and the negativity. but there are also good people working there trying to make it a good place to work.
good,Poor management overall led to the project being sold and many people losing jobs that they spent hard work and countless hours to achieve. I would not recommend this job.
good,"A typical work day would begin between 530 & 6, most days were very busy & demanding. I learned a great deal about asset management and supply chain. The management at my location left something to be desired. Hard work was not rewarded or acknowledged per individual. I was told repeatedly that in my position, I would not advance and that my raises would probably stop. The location I worked at was predominately male & had that old school, good old boys attitude. It was very hard to be a female employee. I never felt I was taken seriously."
good,"the company is not a bad company but there are things that make it a drag coming into work , doing the same thing over and over, with no set course to advance within the company"
good,"Good people, good environment. The personnel and daily interaction with the customer is both rewarding and satisfying. The negative is the ability to impact change within the company."
good,"Not much to say here, the management team sucked and they showed favoritism, the consumers were okay at times, that would be the best part of the job is assisting them for whatever needs they had"
good,Contract base work.  Contracts won were under bid so developers had to work 50+ hours.  Very stressful.  No work life balance.  No job security.  When contracts run out of money the company will lay you off.
good,"CRQ's , Incident tickets, small and large scale projects CRQ's , learned UFS configuration, troubleshooting. Engaged many other service lanes to complete projects."
good,This is a good job to have while searching for another.  The compensation is one of the best in the area.  They do work with Students on schedule.  However if you have an issue with childcare they may or may not adjust you to a more doable shift. So apply? Yes. Plan on staying for a long time? Well...keep an eye out for other positions just in case. Also benefits can be hard to access.
good,I  passed my review and productivity. I passed quality. My report from my supervisors have been good.I received kudos with customers on the phone.I was always at work.
good,"went back this year when CSR jobs were offered. allot of things have changed and this new environment doesn't seem very conducive for a positive work experience. still in training right now, but based on information provided in training I am currently looking for new employment since the work place sounds very unlikely for a chance to keep position once contract is fulfilled and allot of new employee rules and more like to be terminated before advancement."
good,"If you want something long term, then this is not the job for you. If job security is something you value, forget about it. This job last for about 5 months. After that you are released and you could possibly be brought back. Most likely you are relased and never heard from again for a few years. It is hard to plan your life when you don't know if you will be working for a while."
good,"The management was very nice.  A typical day would be spent on the phone assisting persons nationwide with knowledge of Marketplace Healthcare Plan and assisting them to enroll or make changes to their existing accounts.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist someone in getting coverage.  The hardest part of the job was  enduring rude, profane people."
good,"Overall this is a call center job so there will always be tough customers who seem to only want to scream at the workers but this seems to be a standard for this type of work. I've learned that the more training you get, limits what positions you'll be considered for (do NOT do dual training if you have a desire to advance). There are a lot of bigoted conservative people working here but this may just be the site location issue and not a workplace culture issue. The hardest part of the job can be the apathy of those in charge to fix toxic environments for the workers. Filing complaints don't mean that anything will change in any meaningful way. The perks of this job include: 2 weeks of paid vacation (after a year), 401k, dental, vision, health insurance, and approved time off (during certain parts of the year)."
good,"A typical day at work is getting right on phones and taking calls, helping consumers apply for health insurance. The hardest part of the job is difficult consumers giving a hard time. Accepting the fact that not everyone is eligible to get health coverage. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you can change a person's life for the better."
good,There were many good things about GDIT  that i like when i was working there..And i enjoy working for the company. The Supervision was great and the training was great as well.
good,Would help assist customer's with signing up for the ACA and help maintain good Health coverage. Helping them apply for Tax Credit to lower their monthly premium
good,Typical day at work would include answering calls from beneficiaries. Would provide them with general information on Medicare.
good,"It's useful, honest work, but there is very little incentive to stay on. It's a shame GDIT doesn't help employees move to other employment. It could be highly regarded as a labor developer."
good,Company should have advised that they were losing the contract. Too much time training for the job. Very intense environment.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but needed more pay. Typical work week, 40 hours and over time if need when offered. Made it fun and rewarded for your hard work and meeting goals."
good,GDIT is a call center.  Inbound customer service dealing with consumers of ACA insurance.  The people are very nice and the management is very knowledgeable.  My only problem is the lack of job security.  A job at GDIT lasts anywhere from 6 months to two weeks depending on company need.  At the time I was told my position was temp to hire but that changed frequently all while management insisted there was a possibility of a full-time position.  That did not happen.  I enjoyed being a quality specialist but did not enjoy the mandatory work days and overtime.
good,"i loved this job other than the new attendance policy, they lost some of their best representatives because they just had missed too many hours."
good,"Typical day at work is answering phone calls back to back, best part of the day is helping people, worst part of the day is getting yelled at a lot for things that you can't change. They will force you to up-train but for no additional pay. I currently perform 5 different jobs for my position and get the same pay as someone who is just hired that does only one job. It's not a bad job but it's not a great job either."
good,"There was work , but there was to much miss management . To much back stabbing , not enough leadership , trying to do a good job isn't what this company wanted . They wanted quantity not quality ."
good,"Unfortunately, there was no advancement available for people who were in my position; either look for other employment opportunities or be content. Stagnation and complacency in the position with no room for growth."
good,Average Company to work for with only average benefits. Really busy at times with lots of dead time at other times. Seems like crisis management when projects are due with a lot of stress involved.
good,"GDIT is somewhat of a good company to work for.  The benefits are excellent.  But, some of the supervisor/management don't really understand how it is to be a CSR at the company.  There should be a little more compassion for the representatives because we are the first line of defense at the company."
good,No room for advancement. Always had to worry about getting laid off or losing my job every year. Little support from states when working overseas. EX: had doctors note from hospital and they would not except.
good,"Big company, not-so-great in terms of advancement and benefits. No real appreciation for the ""little people."""
good,I spent the last 10 years working for GDLS .Work overseas in Iraq and Qatar. Enjoyed my career and the employees I worked with were great people.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others everyday.  We speak to all sorts of people all day that deal with some very complex health concerns and being able to provide them a piece of mind was the most fulfilling everyday.
good,"Assisted Consumers in the Affordable Care Act, which included the application process, explaining the tax credit process and if consumer was eligible for the Affordable Care Act or state Medicaid if the state consumer resided in had expanded the Medicaid program.  Explained what documents were needed for the consumer to obtain the insurance through the Affordable Care Act."
good,Its a job that I found decent. If you are a temp if your full time you tend to get treated worse. I feel the job could have been more directed towards teaching to fix issues and knowledge gaps instead they terminated and replace people bye the dozens. There was different teaching styles through out the time I worked there. The hours for attendance changed by the season. There were alot of supervisors not qualified and not ready for the position. They had supervisors who did not do their jobs and when a new position opens it begins a cut throat throw you under the bus atmosphere.. Good luck. The benefits are good and the overtime is great and optional.
good,The company is all about work with little to no incentives. In undesired and unmanageable circumstances the company does not provide many options to continue employment.
good,"Primarily responsible for providing phone based support to end users in the medical community. The position requires the ability to listen, analyze, document, resolve and or escalate issues while providing excellent customer service skills. This is a fast paced, rapidly changing environment which requires continuous learning of the programs and products that we support. Respond to inquiries requiring written response. Use proper resources available to ensure accurate answers to more complex questions along with following up on escalated issues that requires a solution for participants. Along with process government based application for health care."
good,"Good starting job for call centers due to training, dealing with all types of incoming callers.  Rules designed to keep you from taking breaks if calls go into breaks quality/ adherence is penalized, no raises and starting wage less than most call centers, holiday weeks when offered extra hours won't be paid overtime until after 40 hrs worked, Adherence penalties if you take part of your scheduled shift time off even if you've worked well over 40 hours for the week. Offered incentives to stay on (e.g. $500 bonus then say b/c you went RFT not eligible or Referral rewards -names don't match accurately so ineligible, requests for vacation time they will work around everyone's schedule that is later denied for ALL, etc. bylines that make it so you won't receive bonus incentives or ANY vacation time), those who do stay on are put into mandatory shift bids for less desirable shifts while new hires take the better shifts, none reward systems in place for improving skills good attendance or not taking breaks, continually being degraded about quality scores and script adherence that may or may not be related to your calls. None vacation time and penalized on quality if take time off. Considerable frequent glitches in the system, and changes to consumer's account that are not explained to CSR or consumer to understand and fix.  Holiday wks offered extra hours won't be paid overtime until after 40 hrs worked."
good,"If you want to learn you have to do it yourself here. The training for a new position is poor, and no one want to teach."
good,negative enviorment and their is no advancement. If your looking to better yourself and find something you love this is not it.
good,"Supervise, develop, and coach CSRs to assure productivity, quality, attendance, and timeliness of work in the completion of assigned projects and departmental goals."
good,Helping to resolve a consumer's healthcare issue is rewarding. There is a time limit to solving a consumers problem and generally first call resolution is sought.
good,As with any company there are good supervisors and the WORSE!! If they could get away from the good old boy system and hire based on skills and not friendship things might be better.
good,"Working at General Dynamics was fun and enjoyable. There were wide ranges of people to interact with over the phone and learn about while assisting them with their needs.Though some policies (such as those regarding attendance) seemed unfair, their implementation created an environment of successful and hard working people who were dedicated to their success. Management lacked a personal one on one connection as employees were hired and fired daily, however, the benefits, pay, and environment made up for such."
good,I enjoyed my coworker and the call volume but i hated being laid off or Bribed to work under strenuous conditions. I think the company could use some work but the compensation is great.
good,"I have been with General Dynamics for two years now, I have learned all that I can in my current position but am having a hard time migrating into something new or more progressive.  Management is not readily available to me, matter of fact I just met my manager about two weeks ago for the first time since he began last year.  I DO NOT like my co-workers but they're not all GD employees as we are not the prime on this contract.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with these other employees who are lazy and/or slow.  I was recently passed up for a position and am now expected to train the person the job was given to.  I used to enjoy going to work as something different and new would happen day to day, now I dread it due to the atmosphere and lack of motivation."
good,el apoyo era por teléfono para soporte técnico y muy complicado para poder solucionar un problema  de esa manera.
good,Vangent Inc was an ok company to work for along with management there were a lot of misunderstanding with upper managerment and peers
good,It was good for the most part but the management would always lie to us. They would offer employee referral and wouldn't give you your bonuses and stuff like that.
good,"Deparment has moved from independent work, to a micromangment stress employees. No challanges other than to monitors and no recognition, or a way to feel you are doing a something good for the company."
good,"I started at Metro Machine three months after I separated from service, which was sold to General Dynamics along with three other companies. I like my job, but the opportunity for advancement has gone up in smoke due to the managers who have been at Earl Industries or Metro for 20+ years. I like the companies direction, but I have a skill set meant for a management position. "
good,"*Accounts payable reports and entering payroll for today before and issue checks at end of week"
good,"Manage day-to-day operation of a team of call center Supervisors and Customer Service Representative.  Lead the team toward fulfillment of department goals and service standards. Monitor and review progress of calls as necessary to ensure representatives are adequately trained. Ensure high quality customer service that promotes customer satisfaction. Train new representatives on procedures, practices, and service standards. Recommend methods to resolve customer complaints and inquires. Enforce attendance policy to provide adequate telephone coverage. Receive, verify, and distribute documents related to new hires, status changes, and departmental transfers.  Interview new hires for HR during job fair. Take phone calls as needed when call volume or the speed of answer is high. Maintain computerized personnel records by entering, updating, and deleting data. Serve as lead worker and perform call center work as necessary."
good,"Started off as a great program and an awesome position. After sequestration became a common word, the work was becoming very unstable and the contract award uncertain. I chose to leave and care for my son."
good,HIgh call volume. Learned a lot about HIPAA and customer service values
good,"Assist consumers with anything dealing with the Affordable Care Act,  from how to sign up, how it works, how it came about, etc. Direct management was very helpful, sometimes upper management not so much. The job sometimes became stressful because of the deadlines for consumers and the website not properly working all the time. Most enjoyable part of the job was when the consumer would leave the line happy and satisfied."
good,"There was never a dull moment. Great co-workers. I truly enjoyed taking care of my personnel. On another note, the management was very unprofessional & used personal feelings versus professionalism when it came to a lot of the personnel. Promotion was the good ole boy system."
good,Great place to start working in corporate. Needs more youth in executive positions. Could use more fresh ideas.
good,"I got to learn how to run a CNC drill router! It wasn't all easy, but I enjoyed learning and my short time there!"
good,"Contract work, I was laid off due to AT&T budget cut right before getting my offer for Permanent position."
good,"Nice people and nice company, things are changing so there is some uncertainty."
good,"At nassco, you get out what you put in. When i put in 110%, i got raises, promoted, and recognized. Management were okay as long as you didnt threaten thier job. co-workers were the same. The hardest part of my job was finding a balance of doing your best without making someone else look bad. I was promoted to a salaried position in less than 8 months. The most enjoyable part of my job was cashing the overtime checks.I would never recommend GDNassco to my worst enemy. You have to marry nassco to make  it there. Thats the big saying there. I married Nassco.lol"
good,"Not a lot of opportunity for advancement.  Old school mindset to manufacturing and ""this is how we've always done it"" mentality.  Overall good benefits, flexible work hours, and 9/80 work week make up for a lot."
good,Will hire based upon resume whether information is true or not.
good,Strong company but not interested in providing least-cost services to the government
good,"Small company culture, struggling with several large complex programs"
good,This is the place that got my feet wet in the Workforce Management Role. Government contracting can be tricky business. 
good,"General Dynamics Information Technology has the potential to be a great company. It has the right people and some very interesting projects and contracts. However, there are no set guidelines or option s to move up."
good,"I work for GDIT, but I have yet to see how they work starting with upper management onto CSR. The morale of the current call center is not good. With GDIT taking over, hopefully that will help the CSR to get a Peace Of Mind."
good,"I did enjoy working for the Company Vangent, I loved knowing that by me coming to work everyday and answering the phone for the Medicare Beneficiaries that called in I was really helping them the customer better understand their health insurance coverage,"
good,It was a good company to start out of college and gain some experience but the room for advancement is not what i would expect.
good,"Work on the production floor assigning duties/ provide support, guideance and training. Report daily to program manager on tasks/issues at hand. Get clarification when needed working with engineering. My position was multi-tasking in all area's of manufacturing and test support. I learned a great deal from my technicians and engineers, as well as presentation stills and analyizing data/ issues. My co-workers were supportive and responsive - healthy work enviorment. The hardest part of the job was not fully trusting management. The most enjoyable part was the mass varity of hardware and opportunites to always learn something new every day- my whole 27 years. and training people."
good,"I am currently a call center supervisor, I have 20 subordinates that report directly to me. I monitor the team's quality and metrics. Each representative is coached on a weekly basis on there overall performance and given smart goals to reach each metric successfully."
good,stand up and work all day.co workers ok.boardom is worest part.
good,"My Review On Vangent Inc, being there for almost 3 years, has its ups and downs, ups meaning when its not busy you either, stay off the phones and do work related work and still get paid, down is when alot of callers call in about the most simplest task, clearly stated on the letter their reading to call elsewhere and they still call medicare..Some needs the guidance, Some I really don't know why they even call, No room for advancement, something just to get customer service experience wouldnt be something to make a career out of.."
good,on the phones all days helping people with medicare processing their claim on dail basis
good,Vangent is a call center for health care benefits for older americans. My day begins at 8:30 and ends at 5:00 pm. During this time frame i may answer as many as 60 phone calls a day. These calls consist of inquiries as to explanation of claims denied or paid. Referrals to other federal government entities.
good,"What I learned from working there was you can not trust anyone. People will lie to your face then turn around and throw you under the bus. I loved what I did. I loved helping people and know that I was able to make someones day, but as for the managment and the way it's ran it was horrible."
good,"I performed duties as an Executive Assistant and was assigned to a government office and charged to support two very demanding and difficult female senior executives. I managed their calendars, arranged local travel, coordinated meetings to include teleconference and video conferences. I also prepared correspondence and other duties as required. My co-workers were very nice and willing to assist. The hardest part was keeping the calendars up-to-date. The most enjoyable part was the monthly socials."
good,Technical work in support of US Navy programs. Support Infrastructure subsystem.
good,A typical day was receiving inbound calls from Medicare providers about consumer products.
good,The company had great benefits and the hours was great since it was part time and fit my life situation. Work was fast pace but good learning opportunity for that department.
good,"Overall, General Dynamics was a nice place to work.  People were friendly and overall easy to get along with.  The workplace culture was more relaxed that I was accustom to but worked out really well."
good,Currently this contract is coming to an end and GDIT is not looking to let us go to other divisions as this one ends. Also when an issue is reported they (GDIT) do not follow up and review the issues.
good,"Advancement can but super hard. They are not a workplace that is a fan of innovation from their employees unless it is apart of your job role. Which I disliked, for example I made some automatic code for self service/ for people who did not know their job well enough. That would completely do it for either parties. We wouldn't get a massive amount of less calls while using it either.  So it was a win. But instead they'd rather you do your actually job roles than anything else. If you can do that its a great paying place. Just don't prepare your self to advance quickly. Its highly unlikely you will. Best opportunity to get IT experience and then move to another better company."
good,"When working in the training department, there is one on site lead, but no manager. The manager resides in a different state and oversees multiple sites. "
good,I did not like this job. The pay and benefits were good  but the management and work ethic was awful. They definitely had their picks and favorites at this job.
good,"Its a good company to work for if you have the right manager on the call floor, mine was not very great when i left, he was always negative to me. There was another manager who was really great on a prior team. If you don't mind crazy fast pace of calls during the fast times, and really slow during the slow, this up and down pace is for you!"
good,"Carreer lines were already drawn. It didn't matter how much education one had or experience one had. The selctions for management had already been made and if you were not one of the chosen, you were just spinning you wheels."
good,"Working with general dynamics has been hard mostly due to the training received wasn't the best. We went for 5 weeks as pipefitters and we still came to the main yard very unsure of things, they didn't take the one on one time necessary to really get the best of their employees. Their only employee self service and internal employment applications are extremely non user friendly. The website constantly had issues. They are a union company for their mechanics however it seemed like the union doesn't really want to help you. Also I noticed along my other female coworkers that very few of us got brought in and compensated fairly even with previous experience. It's a hard place to work for."
good,People calling in asking about their medicare or loved one's status or coverage not room for advancement even supervisors do not make enough to be out of FPL
good,"Management was fair in their treatment of the employees, but deadlines were often tight, and there was about 80%-85% traveling involved with the field work. So not much time with your family."
good,The job is great if the work is there. Otherwise they like to do mass layoffs cause the company isn’t profitable. This is of course based on mass hirings they do just prior to these events
good,"- Different daily experiences"
good,"General Dynamics is one of the places where you really have to think long and hard, if you quit or get fired, if you REALLY want to go back. For the most part, the people/staff there, were great. The calls were sometimes unpredictable, and could get very hectic at times. The pay is okay-ish, but I definitely think that they should pay the employees a little bit more, especially for the job that is being asked of them to do. The managers & supervisors are TRASH. There were maybe 2-3 that were good, but the rest of them? awful. Causing unnecessary drama w/ other employees, and bringing personal life matters into things. Very unprofessional. BUT, despite ALL of that, the actual work environment is actually pretty chill, and generally, the people are good to."
good,"Good company, but don't expect to be treated equally.  Lots of racial bias in my area.  First impressions are huge on this contract.  If one manager decides they don't like you, plan on hanging it up sooner rather than later"
good,While working at General Dynamics you will have sense that what you are doing makes a difference for people in this country but in the way of life for people around the world.
good,GDIT was a great place to work and we supported several government contracts.  I left GDIT for career growth.  The infrastructure staff was amazing and always willing to go the extra mile to get the job done.
good,I was able to grow in my career. I worked with wonderful people at GDIT.  I value my experience at GDIT.I was able to leverage all skills and knowledge I gained to retain employment with FEI.
good,"Government contract, they refused raises for more than 10 years. I was told that they had not paid any wages increase in that time.  Very good at utilizing current work force to get the job done and under paying for the job."
good,The work environment is  not very good for growth and/or promotions.  The management team is  in place already and  they generally don't promote  others. There's little chance for advancement.
good,This is a tidious and stresfful job. Doable once you take the time to learn everything. Must be open to adapting for frequent changes and enjoy with working with different types of people.
good,"but you  had to learn as much as you could on your own because depending on who was your instructor and who was assigned as your supervisor, the level of knowledge imparted varied.  Very quick-paced, stressful position which required stead-fast active listening despite customers' expressed frustration, intimate knowledge of location of information on computer system and effective problem resolution on the first call."
good,Work is sporadic - much training.  Training may or may not be applicable to role.  Learn more of the group task on hand.  Very structured workplace.  Assignments are broken down.  Team playing is not consistent between departments; compartmentalized. People great to work with - achievers.
good,"The position here is much different than a System Administrator in the private sector. There's a TON of additional duties that the client requires and that the company will not recognize you on. They give the blanket speech about how ""everyone did a great job"" in monthly meetings regardless of how well or poorly your team did that month."
good,"No comment. I retired. I was able to move up from working on my tools, to a structural planner then a estimator. I was offered a better opportunity so I retired."
good,"The 401k is okay. The pay is okay. The hours are not the greatest, and if you don't want to work shift, you'll have a difficult time finding a day spot."
good,I liked my job until they changed it. I was doing data entry keying in correct addressing and working in the mailroom everyone had the title customer service rep. As time went on everyone had to get on the phone. We took a class had a test I miss one question and was let go
good,Its a great company to work for if you are not ready or looking for advancement. Company is open 24/7 and you have option to pick shift that works best for you.
good,"●	Build Junit testing framework to automate testing"
good,"working there was not my biggest joy , the flow of the place was stressful , the place could use better attitudes and that's for everyone . the staff had it bad and good people ."
good,From the time you clock in you are taking calls and assisting customers. There were opportunities for breaks and the desk were ergonomical in that you were able to stand and complete work if needed. Supervisors were awesome and very helpful.
good,It is a high paced work environment and there are many individual's futures at stake when determining the outcomes of those you serve. 
good,"not too bad but micromanagement is terrible"
good,"Recruitment full cycle and generalist HR duties, Working job fairs and assessment of all qualified applicants. Generalist duties as assigned or needed daily"
good,"Most work is on ships in shipyard environment- difficult access and locations.  Access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Huntington  Ingalls (Newport News) is extremely difficult to get through security /,Pass office. Mostly due to high column but clearance checks are really slow. Once eventually cleared, then the walk to work site is close to 1 mile. Then one has to deal with shipyard requirements in daily work."
good,Work everyday consisted of back to back phone calls from Medicare beneficiaries about inquires regarding their health insurance. Reading scripts verbatim that give you information about what most callers inquire about.
good,A typical day at work would be assisting consumers with insurance policy's. Calls would be coming in every 3 minutes so there's not much down time unless your on break
good,"I do not feel that the management puts forth the effort to help their employees. They do not consider an employee's set schedule needed, nor let you switch shifts when needed. There is no pay raises"
good,There are very few chances for advancement. The company will however work with an employee to move them from one project to another to keep them employed when possible.
good,Work harder. Work harder. and then be sure to work some more. And then work some more and a little more. and a little more. Be sure to fill out your time card. Be sure to be nice while getting yelled at.
good,Poor Benefits.  Large company with very poor top down communication. Not for all candidates.  Supports candidates with very strong technical capabilities.
good,"The management was not good at all with communication. The job had great pay overall but not such a fun or welcoming environment. "
good,Work Required that you be able to assist individuals in selecting healthcare that the consumer could afford and use. found the job functional in that the system was sufficient but found management and the culture around the job lacking. in that many of the people that you would work with would leave within a month due to lack of leadership and the stress of assisting people with shopping for insurance
good,"Each day involved machining parts to prepare them for assembly, the work was very interesting. There were a lot of steps that were needed for the final outcome. Generally the supervision was little help, we were on our own to learn things. There was a lack of team atmosphere generally. The work was noisy and dirty, but each day was filled with accomplishment. The exciting part of the day was getting my parts through the inspection area, that was a great feeling!"
good,Typical day is easy answer phone go home thats pretty much it. Management is ok they will work with you but their hands get tied to often and the salary is the lowest of the other competing call centers out of the four here
good,General Dynamics is a good company to work for. Working with a variety of people and learning all of the various components that go in to working in a customer service environment
good,"Because of federal guidelines the tasks involved in taking calls can at sometimes be stressful to get customers to give you their information or know what you can tell to someone calling for the actual customer. The hardest part of the job is that while you are on the work floor, any personal items are explicitly prohibited except for drink and snack. No cell phones or any electronic devices can be on and either must be left in your locker or your car."
good,"The Bilingual Representatives are performing the job for two people. "
good,People deserved more in wages and responsibilities.  Very tight win margins prevented any extra benefits to the employees even though they put hours over weekends to try to win every contract.
good,Really enjoyed my time there.  If I didn't have gotten laid off will still be working there. The people I worked with and for was extremely pleasant to work for especially my supervisor.
good,Call center environment but strict on scripts and such to read to customers which makes it very hard when trying to calm and angry customer down. at that time I don't feel a script will help someone.
good,Enrolling folks in ACA Insurance and Medicaid.  Not to much more to say.  Just a long distance from my home.  If you like it there there is definitely room to grow and advance.
good,"This site was closed. This job is no longer offered. "
good,GD won a new contract.  I was the first employee placed on the contract.  The encumbants were still there.  I was instructed to learn what each employee leaving was doing.  I was resented by these departing employees whom made my life miserable.  I stuck it out!
good,"General Dynamics is a good company to work for although their upper management will twist every word you say to give your manager a bad name, they are evil and liars about what there intentions are"
good,"Company was acquired by General Dynamics"
good,Hours are good but management doesn't care about you or your job at all. They don't help with anything. You're pretty much on your own. Which is okay with me..
good,Call center environment / Medicare / Claims / Enrollment / Assist Medicare beneficiaries with general and complex issues pertaining to their coverage.
good,"The atmosphere is not good, have a lot situations between the employee and management. The consumer are so rude and  the payment is not enough for the all responsibilities."
good,"It was a part time temporary job. My day consisted of scanning employee record documents into the computer. There were various types of records such as health records, housing records, and employment records, and insurance records. I was given folders and then left to do the work by myself. The people were very nice to work with and helpful. The hardest part of the job was just that it ended too soon. I enjoyed the fact that my work made me feel that I was accomplishing something of worth."
good,Really you have to be able to break rough information to all the people you really don't feel like deserve the bad news you give them. If you like helping people through this insurance market place we have now it's the job for you.
good,Working for GDIT wasn't terrible but it definately wasn't the best job I have had. The pay could have been better and so could the training program. I don't feel we were given all of the information we needed to help the clients.
good,this job is good for having a job my only complain is the culture of this job its hard to do your job when the others around you wont stop gossiping about other people and try to get you into the conversation.
good,"Working at GD provided exposure to various cabinet level agencies and you are get a glimpse into the behind scenes how government works. Some managers at GD were awesome while others were just awful, this is program specific. In my time, I had 6 different managers while working on the same program. The program I participated in was geographically located throughout the mid-atlantic and mid-west. Most interactions with co-workers was through technology and not face to face. For co-workers not located in the mid-atlantic region the position at GD was their only position in life, groupthink is constant and is a huge challenge to overcome. The most enjoyable part was working with the client, easy going, fun, and we became friends. The most difficult part of the position was not being in the same region and the loss of the personal interaction between co-workers, the work was very transactional based at times."
good,With the right location the job was good but upper management got into a fight and closed the office.Everyone got laid off with no other reason and we all had to find work elsewhere.
good,I enjoyed my time while employed here and I did learn so much that helped me in my next job. It is a call center however and it can be a little more hectic that normal.
good,Call center environment with a lot of sitting and being confined to a cubicle. Decent pay and insurance and benefits are offered. Not very easy to be guaranteed a full time position.
good,"Family oriented but growth is difficult if not management material.  Way too generous, very misleading towards true personal growth.  Makes it difficult for advancement."
good,"I wish I had did more research before I had applied.  "
good,I had a rough day at GDIT everyday...Its a lot of information that they try to pack into your head in 2 weeks to prepare you to be ready to go to the floor to start answering calls from consumers. The consumers were most of the time on edge because they didn't like the reality of what was told to them. I would be talked to like I was nothing...cursed out on a regular basis. its very stressful trying to make sure you find the right script to read to the consumer and make sure you give them the right information. trying not to fail a call is the hardest thing when in training you don't learn everything you need to now. It was challenging for me. We litarally cant have anything at your cubical but snacks. it actually very depressing.
good,"income never increases, management sucks, and the only time u get more money is during open enrollment period from November to January. Other than that, the pay rate sucks."
good,"You can get lost in this company. I never had any interaction with General Dynamics management, if fact, I never knew who they were or their location. Bottom line:  It's lives up to the term ""military industrial complex."""
good,"A typical day would start by randomly taking calls from customers, with supervisors assisting you if you absolutely needed help. We were constantly being monitored for breaks lunches and call volume"
good,The work environment sucks! There is no organization. The only time y'all understand where to be and how to get started is during training after that you are on your own. Management SUCKS. Everything except security and health benefits sucks!
good,"Good place to work. "
good,"Decent pay and benefits for someone who doe not have many expenses. Can be stressful at time, not a very flexible schedules. Shifts do change according to performances."
good,"The Company is very strict and controlling, the pay could improve, I worked there for 4 years and never received a raise, I started at 12.58 per hour and when I left I was still making the same.  Even though I have health insurance thru Medicare,I was also forced to take there health insurance"
good,"Every once in a while some mint projects would pop up. I was lucky to be on one of those. The work itself was great. "
good,"Actual work wasn't bad at all. However, once open enrollment ended your job was on the chopping block. Job consisted of taking inbound calls assisting people to get enrolled in various types of health care coverage."
good,"The company is not bad, the job is easy however the people that work there are not very unprofessional from the top down. There leadership are to motivate and empower their CSR'S but instead they treat them as if they are just a number, a place that just needs a human figure to take these calls! Call volume is always high that can be a good thing because the time will go by quickly. Best thing to do if you get a job here is to stay to your self even though more than likely you will know someone there."
good,"Very nice work environment, very little room to grow. Great job for holidays if your looking to have extra money. Would recommend for someone who is able to"
good,I stayed stressed out the whole time I was employed with the company most people there was friendly its just you had to deal with a lot of stressful things with the consumers
good,A typical day would include answering calls for Medicare participants and assisting them with finding a physician or a drug plan in their area or where they maybe be locating to as well as directing them to the proper resources.
good,The company does provide benefits and upward mobility.  Management positions can be extremely demanding.  Management positions require self direction and creative thinking.
good,"Worked there for about a year, and once I was about to hit a year they decided to fire me over something that I had already discussed with HR."
good,you basically have to stay to yourself working there. The pay was decent however the work environment was unprofessional.
good,"We were hired in on a temp service ensuring we would be hired on full time within 6 months and are being informed we all will be laid off within the next month.  I appreciate the timely manner to search for other career opportunities, but at the same time, I am a dedicated employee and hoped to see advanced career opportunities.  Unfortunately, I was mislead.  No hard feelings, just a little disappointed, but life goes on."
good,"There is a lot of exposure to to the latest cutting edge technology and the people I work with are very friendly."
good,There was little to no change in the workflow that made the keying of the same information quite dull. There was no room for creativity or innovation to help improve the workflow.
good,Everyone I've met and had to work directly with seems to be hardworking and dedicated to getting the job done. The only issue I have is that this is not a very stable industry. One month you're so busy you have to work through lunch to keep up and then the next month your employment is on the live if another contract isn't secured
good,I did like working for the department the first time I worked for this employer.  They had many fun events and were always looking for a way to show their employees how much they care for our service.
good,"Fun place to work, great pay, No good benefits for part timers. They hire a bunch of new people for Open Enrollment ( OEP), and then let them all go in January the following year. Too many bosses, everyone wants to be in charge. Mixed instructions, and also training was IRRELEVANT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Things are pretty cut and dry: "
good,"Found sitting long hours repeating the same thing to be very draining."
good,it's extremely disorganized from the higher up's corresponding with the lower level employees. your basically disposable with this company.
good,"Great flexibility, but needs better process to show employee appreciation. The Corporate culture is not a fun atmosphere, as everyone is very busy and always focused on work. Lacks employee motivation, engagement, and reduction of turnover processes."
good,"Throughout my two years at the company working on a contract, management was too frequently focused on cost and not on performance."
good,Job stability is always an issue when it comes to contract work. Lower level management is often disconnected from higher level management. Very little room for advancement without a Master's Degree. Pay is very good. Benefits have steadily been getting worse over the last 5 years.
good,"Inbound call center for medicare. Assist beneficiaries with insurance coverage information, billing, drug pan enrollments, medicare advantage plan enrollments/disenrollments, researching medical claims, assiting with fruad related issues, and contacting medicare contractors and ssa offices on behalf of clients."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I made a difference to someone who couldn't help themselves. Our beneficiaries were elderly and most times we were all they had.
good,"Good place to work, good benefits and pay. Government Contractor, so work environment was not great. Management was okay, not very knowledgeable about the job."
good,"Colleagues are the best!  I've learned you can accomplish much with less.  Hardest part of the job is communication, the work in itself is not difficult, lack of effective communication makes it a challenge."
good,Needs to be updated and cleaned.  It has outdated equipment and it has dirty carpet and bug infestation.  The break areas could be better equipment as well s pricing and availability for overnight staff as far as the mini deli area.
good,owner was/is a very likable guy but the hours where short and the pay was low for what i was expecting with my experience. Also the jobs would be far and few at many a times.
good,"A typical day at GDIT was very stressful because of the management they was poorly. I meet some great co workers there that will be a friend from now on and I have also meet some there that try there best to get anyone in trouble for anything that hey could come up with or make up on you. That was the hardest part of the job, But the most enjoyable part of working there you got to work with some really good people."
good,"Work experience good in general, however, unsatisfied with the way they ended my career with them. Contract came up for rebid/rewrite and was terminated for unreasonable cause."
good,A typical day at General Dynamics is making sure that we get things done in a one call resolution. We deal with Medicare and also the Affordable Care Act. Its never a dull moment.
good,Just assist consumers with anything they need help with the marketplace. It is nice to assist those that need insurance.
good,"I answered phone call, answered questions, and fill out application. I enrolled people in insurance. Or just helped them find if it was the right option for them. Management has no experience with calls so they cannot help as far as that goes. Some of them are very help, other are not. I enjoyed helping people, I just enjoyed the different conversations. But of course not all of them were good, and that is the hardest part of the job is dealing with irate callers."
good,"It was a had job from the perspective of personally. We only had so much ability to assist people. There are laws that prevent us from going the extra mile at times. That made the job tough."
good,"Management at location is very.... discombobulated. the head doesn't know what the hands are doing."
good,"I work in a small editorial department and most of my day is spent making calls, creating documents, and researching information. My department is quite close knit and I work with a great group of people. Our management is virtually non-existent and it is sometimes hard to get any guidance from management. All in all I enjoy my department, but I can't speak for any of the other departments, as i have remained with my department for the past 15 years."
good,there were great training done at this company. The hours that were available to work were very good as well. Unfortunate that the job is only temporary
good,Very busy answering phone calls.  Things are always changing.  Management doesn't acknowledge staff.  Co-workers were there for the paycheck and not the job.  Hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the changes.  Having special luncheons.
good,"Typical IT Helpdesk environment.  High turnover, low possibility for advancement within the helpdesk."
good,"Worked to track, integrated, deploy cell site equiment to upgrade Sprint 4G network with Samsung cabinet materials."
good,Disorganized management and no communications to supervisors or customer service representatives
good,Owner had too much to do with everyday operations wasn't willing to try anything new
good,"When General Dynamics bought Motorola in 2002, they inherited many employees. In 2014, many of those same employees are there. So, go in with your hopes low that you will effect any real change on the culture and way of doing business that has(n't) worked for this branch of the company."
good,"I truly enjoy one on one contact with customers, this position was confined to a cubicle and a phone,  was not something I enjoyed"
good,In general a good company to work for. Easy to be overlooked for advancement because of it being such a large company.
good,"My review is that there was lack of motivation, coming from those in higher authority."
good,"Learning about the forensic field is fantastic. So many areas. During the course of the day you may be required to be involved in many aspects of the course. The management to me is partial to many and could have more discipline in controlling individual action of coworkers. Some of the co-workers are very knowledgeable and many need to grow up. These, unfortunately are the ones in the ""Good old Boy"" arena. Communication is the hardest part between the workers. I believe the most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that comes from seeing the students graduate with a wealth of knowledge this course has to offer."
good,The new healthcare law made this job very stressful. No one ever knew for sure answers to many questions. The pay and benefits were very good though. My co-workers were equally as amazing. My manager did the best she could and I respected her for that. The hardest part of the job for me was the suicide call.
good,"great benefits, great company, bad leadership and management"
good,Very busy work day. Learned many things about the healthcare field. Arrive a couple minutes early to the site to log in on time. 2 15 minute breaks along with a 30 min lunch. be ready to be on the phone all day helping consumers and making sure their questions are answered appropriately.
good,They pay well the problem is your job is never secure.  Management is very concerned about themselves and only them.  Benefits every year that I was there were cut and never got better.
good,"There was always work to be done during peak season. When learning to operate the machinery, it was easier than it seemed. There was lots of paperwork to process on a daily basis."
good,"Took calls from consumers wanting information regarding the Affordable Care Act. Some were curious; some were interested in signing up. Most were very vocal and opinionated due to being forced to buy health insurance. The pay was extremely good.  Most of my shift (evening) was spent reading scripts. Learned to not take too much stock in what was said and what was going on. Most folks had prior training in a call center atmosphere and knew what and what not to expect. Set my limits too high, I think. Training was lackluster at best. Group meetings were almost non-existent. Hardest part of the job was having to tell a consumer they did not qualify for health insurance due to low or non-existent income. Thought it was ridiculous to be assigned a locker on the south end of the building when you were assigned a cubicle on the north end. SWP did not like their authority being questioned. Probably the only enjoyable part of the job was when shift ended."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job at Sonic was that you were always surrounded by people who wanted to work and loved their job.
good,Enjoyed working with a company to help individuals in need of healthcare and resolving website issues .
good,"It is pretty good pay for this area, but can be pretty difficult to advance, and management is pretty inconsistant. Also, there have been no raises for years, and at times you are doing more work than what you are being accomodated for.  Most work days you will be busy, and a lot of the people are good people that are hardworking and just trying to make a living. If it werent for managment or the idea that you can be laid off at a moments notice, this would be a good fit."
good,"This job was my foot in the door for plant work. It trained me in IPC soldering, but only the minimal and the trainer wasn't the best teacher. I honestly can't tell you much about this company as I was laid off only two months after I started. I will say they hired some sketchy characters and there was a fight on the factory floor one of my first days there."
good,"In my current position as a quality control inspector, each day is consumed with ensuring that top quality communication equipment is supplied to the US military.  I am responsible for inspecting production material, including presenting material to government representatives for final inspection.  "
good,"This was my first call center experience, and it was alright. The management and supervisors knew little to nothing about the work representatives were doing. Therefore, there wasn't much help around. Lunches were terribly short, only 30 mins. Rules constantly changes, what is okay one day may be a write up the next day. Also, my entire site is getting laid off, so job security is nonexistent for me."
good,Going through a Corporate Re-Structuring and waiting for things to settle back down currently.
good,This is an interesting plave to work. Challenged to think and provid solution for solutions that will be provided with technology that is still in the R&D phases. Provide solution to complex system based on limited and vague information.
good,"The best part about GD is the people you work with, every day.  They are fantastic people and willing to help when needed.  "
good,This used to be a descent workplace.  Recent cutbacks have lowered the morale of the entire company.
good,Its a good place to work if you far away from the other choices
good,No decent direction from management.  Management not accountable for any decisions.
good,"A typical day at work involved inspecting, troubleshooting and Repairing M1 Abrams Tanks.  I would identify and document deficiencies, order parts, and make repairs."
good,would think this large business was more in control - could be the sector. no approved systems
good,"I did customer service. Its a call center, there's not a lot I can say, I've worked at many and they're all the same. There is no work-life balance and the benefits are always horrible. I have two young children and my husband and I both were working here, and sometimes things come up with our kids one of us would always have to take attendance points. But again, its a job. "
good,My typical day was formatting documents on the computer and printing training manuals.  I especially loved creating forms and templates.  The hardest part of my job was the overlapping deadlines.  
good,The engineers and program level people at GD are outstanding.  Management allows a few poorly performing program consume resources that would have allowed other program to succeed.  This has created a crisis in customer relations and employee morale.
good,"You would sign in and have a safety meeting. Then your day would be outlined by your specialist. You would learn what the changes would be for the future. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you would get the ""pink slip"". The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to do your job with trust from upper management."
good,Requires versatility and multi-tasking ability. A good place to work.
good,The management tends to leave senior personnel on legacy systems opposed to allowing them to move on and learn newer technologies. Even when the worker requests being moved to something else they will end up being pulled back to resolve issues and/or add new functionality to the legacy system. Most coworkers were great to work with. One would also encounter a few people that wouldn't hesitate to blame others for their failures and weren't team players. Recent contracts were delayed by the customer so we would be waiting doing minimal work then the contract would be turned on and everything had to be done at once !!
good,"Typically, I would build servers and manage networks from the back-end."
good,Excellent benefits and ethical behavior at the Corporate level only.
good,The job gets done.Work long hours. Little to no time for life outside of work.
good,"nothing spectacular, but a decent paycheck. Lots of micro-managing."
good,"I was a contract employee for them workin in Bartow, Fl. They were there to support me when needed. Good pay and benefits."
good,General Dynamics was a good company to work for. The managers understood people well and my co-workers were team players like myself. My team was to be commended. It takes a team to achieve anything of significance.
good,This was an awesome job for many years but not very secure! Lots of travel opportunity.
good,Vangent was a company that dealt with government contracts. I was a temp to hire for Medicare.
good,"The job we do is very important and highly stressful. We have no hope of getting raises, incentives, or opportunity to further our career. The company doesn't treat their employee as if they are important. They have taken about all simple perks and this has caused all morale to be at an all time low."
good,"Competitive Salary"
good,"As a rule the company has pretty good benefits. However, are not prepared for the Huntsville, Redstone Arsenal customer. Management seems to be unable to engage and produce work and opportunities in the Huntsville area"
good,"Program manager is pretty lenient about flex time, as long as you work your allocated hours and can manage to work outside of normal hours whenever you can"
good,This position at this company should only be a temporary situation. Utilize this job as a stepping stone to get to a better place of employment. That's all thanks!
good,"Good pay, good benefits, every federal holiday off with pay, 2 weeks of paid vacation, several paid sick days. Very stressful job though, you’re working with immigration so they’re very hard to understand at time and can be hostile. You will get cussed at, yelled at, and bawled out. You’re not allowed to hang up on them you have to sit and take it. Mandatory over time, any holiday you’re off the next day you’ll work at least 2 extra hours the next day. If they’re really busy mandatory over time will be put on your schedule too ranging from 2 hours to 30 minutes. The systems crash a lot and managers are still learning the system as well so no one really knows what to do. It’s M-F but last shift stays until call que is done."
good,"this would be a great place if they could see how much they need new management. Poor, uncaring leadership leads to low morale and a lot of  unneeded stress."
good,I was on a 5 yr contract but I barely worked over 1 yr due to a reduction in workforce.  There was several reductions back-to-back.  The pay was okay but should be more due to the cost of living being more in the northern VA area.
good,I worked both marketplace and Medicare as a customer service representative at general dynamics. I enjoyed working at general dynamics as a employee ..  I’m looking forward to working again
good,"GDIT is a challenging place in which to work. The most difficult part of the job was using an ineffective document review tool. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to work remotely some days during week. There is a lack of managerial direction and guidance. Working remotely, it is difficult to gauge the workplace culture."
good,Hard to review because in contracting the local culture stands out more.  GDIT seems a good company but the contract I was on with them had several issues.
good,"If you know about Defense Contracting, you know about GDIT. It's a good company to learn and get plenty of good opportunities if you want to stay in the world of Defense, Intelligence, etc..."
good,"The calls could be stressful being yelled at by angry clients sometimes for no fault of your own. Your patience will be tried, but it can be done I think."
good,Had to listen to customers calls and offer assistance per a script. Spent many hours on the phone listening to customers and providing information of referrals.
good,Not enough assessment at this time since I am working remotely at the client's site. I rarely communicate with the management.  GDIT does have smooth business work flows for efficiency.
good,The only good thing is the flexible working hours and part time work option. The management structure is very poor and does not help engineers develop good products.
good,The pay was lousy.  The management structure was restricting. The people hired were not very motivated.  There was an aura of micro-management and it was very depressing.
good,You meet a lot of people from different backgrounds. The two week orientation/training process is very thorough depending on who your instructor is. You also get your own work cubicle for the duration of your shift.
good,"A somewhat decent company to work for. Benefits are not great, but that's what pretty much everybody gets nowadays. I've questioned upper management behavior on a couple of occassions, but my direct management seems ethical and pleasant to work with."
good,The work environment is clean and well maintained.  Good 5x8 work schedule.  Co-workers were easy to get along with.  Working with the customer's security requirements  to complete assigned tasks has been difficult.
good,"I was laid off due to the divestiture of my business units.  As a result of the merger, none of the Sr. Managers who knew me over the past decade were left with the company."
good,I was on a 6 month contract but it increased to 20 months. A very different work environment being that it was military and very high security. As a contractor you never had a good feeling of being a employee because you did not know when your contract would end. Worked on some very interesting and huge military vehicles. I learned a lot there in a short amount of time as they were constantly training you on workplace rules.
good,It is a place you can earn a solid earnings and a day at work is filled with teamwork. I learned that you need to know more than just your job. The culture is more of work related and its nothing hard about my job.
good,GDIT is family oriented and very flexible when it comes to work life balance.  The dress code is casual which allows employees to be comfortable while working.
good,In my field there was not room for growth or job development. I went to managers and asked what I could do in order to grow and they could not give me an answer. I also found that that GD gave me a low salary and had done nothing to improve it. If I hadn't said anything they would still be paying less. I am hoping they consider my request and give me what I am worth.
good,I was able to learn and develop myself on the device that I work on and continue to gain confidence in my skillset. This company although not able to receive raises that often I was able to move up as people would resign.
good,"GDIT is amazing with work-life balance as most employees work from home.  Benefits are below par regarding health insurance, bonus structure, promotion within, etc.  Salary is below market from within and at market for those that come from the outside, including subcontractors playing in a staff augmentation role."
good,Management style is definitely a concern at General Dynamic and during my time there was not communicated  of future actions involving my salary and felt like just a number filling a seat and meeting their average call handling time with their customer.  Hourly starting salary was $12.53 per hour and remained at that rate for several years and never kept up with inflation when similar business in the area were paying a much higher salary.
good,"The time, I'd work there I realized that if you sucked up to the boss or management that you were going to advance. If you were a hard worker they realize they can't afford to loose you in that position, so they promote someone less knowledgeable."
good,A typical day consisted of talking to people about health insurance and signing them up for the plans they approve of and the ones they can afford on a monthly basis.
good,"• Answers incoming phone calls on behalf of client; provides accurate and appropriate information to callers."
good,"It was an okay job, but quite stressful dealing with the drama in the building.  Dealing with the consumer is wonder.  What makes the job not work for me is the people I have to see everyday in the building."
good,Learned how to improve my customer service skills. Learned how to properly answer phone calls and work with computers. The hardy part of the job was when the systems where down and upset customers were calling in and having to tell them they’d have to call back
good,"I enjoyed my position at GDIT. I gained customer service experience and met some great co-workers. There is not advancement options in place for employees that have degrees, company does not move current employees up or give them the tools to move up with in the organization. Too much time and waste of money that is not geared toward employee rapid turnovers. Contracts are not validated and employee does not have any idea if or when the contract will end by the first acquired date."
good,Not too much as well as programming needed to keep the machines running and operating successfully. I believe they could use more help in the engineering area and I know right now they are looking for someone
good,"My review of this company is that it was great to work for them when I continued to have employment. You can learn a lot here. However, this is a government contractor, which means if they don't keep the contract you work on then you may be out of a job. "
good,I haven't worked there in a few years but it was basically -stuck to your desk in a tiny half cubicle answering back to back calls to angry and sad customers at the Health Insurance Marketplace.
good,"Call center environment that has great benefits, but can take a toll on an agents ability to deal with consumers every day due to the stress and pain of health insurance issues. No room for advancement as I was at the top but could not move up in the company."
good,Answering multiple calls during the day. Helping consumers with questions they have about their enrollment. Helping consumers how to navigate the website.
good,"Good place to meet a lot of people.  it was a customer service call center that assisted Medicare and Medicaid recipients,  You would have to start out as a CSR and work your way to supervisor and at first it would be acting supervisor before they would promote you to regular full time supervisor.  It was my first and last call center job"
good,The Manager that I had was amazing the tried to work with me on the hours because I had small children and my husband hours were clashing with mine...
good,"Got a cut in pay when they won the contract. The good thing was they stressed the need for continuing education to meet DOD requirements, but the pay was very low for the job we did."
good,"I think General Dynamics hires anyone that comes regardlesss of attitude, work ethics, and  demeanor. I was very disappointed in the attitude and rudeness of my coworkers, and I was told to just ignore and do my job. I was cursed at called names and felt like I was just that there was a lot of things that are overlooked. I was like the job but not the environment, and people that were loud and disrespectful. They never give raises unless you are moved up to supervisor or manager. It seems like they only help certain individuals that they favor regardless if you are just as hard working as others."
good,It was difficult to place any trust in the senior management.  Seen on several occasions misleading or inappropriate discussions occur. Management would say one thing thinking that you believed story being told.
good,The job wasn't hard however sometimes it could become stressful depending on the call volumn. I didn't like the idea of bidding for my shift. You could be hired for one shift and then six months later be assigned to another.
good,"The site has days where we can wear what we want and they provide food and snacks on days where call volume is really high. Consumers call in for a number of reasons, such as updating/creating their application, general inquires or getting the accurate information to do their taxes."
good,"9 hour days"
good,"Relaxed working environment  , easy  tasks to perform ."
good,I'm definitely grateful for the longevity with the company.  I would recommend this job only temporarily not long term. I've had one raise in 10 yrs and a new employee will be paid the same rate as a tenured employee.
good,"The ""team"" was not welcoming to a new hire which created a hostile work environment. The Senior Finance Manager had few years of comparable experience; however, expected more than what was possible given I was working in a new cost structure. I did receive company paid training for proposal pricing with GSA rates, so that was a plus."
good,It is an okay place to work. I think it could use better management and some of the policies are a little crazy in my opinion. The benefits are great though the discounts. I believe the pay could be better for the things we have to deal with when it comes to the beneficiaries.
good,Company forced employees to use PTO balance for snow days when facility was closed to non-essential personnel. Company not very employee friendly. Employees were not allowed to choose to use PTO or not. No compensation added or agreed upon.
good,"The job was easy, but the rules is unbelievable. A day at work was talking to customer trying to solve whatever problem or issue that customer may have. But the job is stressful because people call making threats to harm someone or theirselves and on the phone you are trying to keep calm while at the same time trying to get your supervisor. And if that person decide to harm theirselves or someone else your job is on the line. As an employee part of your job is to meet the customer need and keep them as calm as possible but at the end of the day you do have any control over what a person want to do. The job is overwhelm and stressful because sometimes customer do not want to hear anything you have to say. Breaks and lunch are short."
good,"General Dynamics offers great benefits, but it is so unorganized. The dynamics of management were a big challenge for me to adjust to, simply because of the lack of communication."
good,"When coming to work, all belongings was put in a locker. you could not even keep a coat/sweater with you and put it over your chair at your desk. A manager was constantly walking by to check on you."
good,"Health insurance customer service for the Affordable Care Act. Provides great benefits, pay is decent and the advancement opportunities are definitely there. "
good,Something's needed to be worked on by management. The communication needed a little more work. Treat everybody equally. When something is going on try to change it so it does not keep happening over and over.
good,This is your average call center position. Good pay for the area. Not a good place for a single parent. Individuals who did lesser work made the same as others.
good,"CAD design of Structures, Hull and Foundations.I was hire to do extractions not the Structure, hull and foundation design. I was spread to thin in several directions and set up for failure. I should have been only working in one department, not all three."
good,"Inbound call center environment helping people that have Medicare and Marketplace A.K.A healthcare.gov. Solutions provided need a third party agency such as the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service even for a simple address change. Paid is based on Cost of Living, therefore it can be years before a raise can happen. Unrealistic quality assurance goals with frequent changes by management who do not understand basic call flow."
good,GDIT conducts frequent lay offs without feed back or disclosing criteria for selecting candidates to lay off. ........................................
good,The job itself was incredibly stressful due to the fast paced nature of a call center. It was also very boring. The company how ever was good to work for and valued their employees as much as they could with the high level of turn around.
good,"Typical call center work, fast pace, always changing. Decent benefits, little room for advancement, although they are lenient with attendance and after a year of working you get 2 weeks of paid vacation."
good,A typical day at work is going to work log up the work load for the day and start grading calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is that when we are call to phone to take calls being able to help people sign up for insurance. And as well listening to the things that they may be experiences in life.
good,"You get benefits and a paycheck. If you have other options, don't choose this place. It just slowly kills you inside. Took me 2 years to figure out who my bosses were. Learned the job quickly and proved more skill than most of my coworkers, but even though I steady received more tasks and responsibility, getting an actual promotion proved impossible. They choose based on seniority here. The benefits are ""okay"" if you have no other choice. You'll never hit your deductible. Ever. You receive a raise each year, but it's always the bare minimum. Supervisors like to keep everything a secret, even the things that don't matter, which makes for a hostile work environment and stressful daily life."
good,The people are always there to help. THe job its self is not very fun because of th nature of the job it is a very strict company to work for. Pay is about average and there is little room to move up.
good,"this company is a very strict , they provide you with lockers to put all your personal belongings , you also have to stick with a tight schedule when to take your breaks and lunch."
good,Advancement opportunity awesome. Loved the overtime opportunities during the fall/winter season. Enjoyed working as a team and the willingness to assist each other.
good,"i really enjoyed the physical work that i did, soldering under a microscope was new to me, but fun & electromechanical assembly is my forte...but we literally had to ""steal"" work from eachother just to keep (or look) busy"
good,They needs to pay more and do some remodeling the place is dirty also they need to get better supircirsers that's abs better trainers that's understand
good,strict rules but a fun place to work i was pregnant when i worked there and there were many accommodations made for me to be comfortable. I really enjoyed management and the lunches they serve
good,"Majority of this job is showing up and reading a script. The key is speed and finding the RIGHT script. You must remember this is customer based and hold times are extremely high. That being said, some customers are short fused by the time you speak to them."
good,It is a good environment to work with for people who like answering the phone and understand health insurance. They are very strict with their privacy policy due to all the personal information handled. The training is good but not the best. You are thrown on the phones even if you are not completely ready or confident
good,They could have actually did more with training instead of just throwing you in after the 2nd day... explain things alot more and actually how to look everything up on point instead of just reading scripts... how to actually handle an angry consumer
good,A typical day consists of answering calls from the American public seeking assistance with the application for health care.  This is done over the phone or via chat.  These applications are completed on Healthcare.gov
good,"The job itself is fine, you come into work and get on the phones to answer inbound calls. I learned a lot there, how to take calls, work the phones and operate many windows and tabs at once. The management is a little disorganized. The culture of the job varies and can be stressful. The hardest part of the job is that consumers are rather hateful about the program. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the consumers who want help."
good,"I would wake up walk to my car drive to work. park, never any good parking close to the door. I would swipe my card at the door, no piggybacking."
good,"Enjoyed working at this facility many opportunities for advancement. There benefits are really not worth the cost and the point system that was in place was ridiculous if you have children, but overall if there was a facility in Huntsville Alabama I'd apply."
good,Too strict on hrs to miss. They dont care if your kids are sick or anything. All they care about are numbers. It does not matter if you take an excuse with you for the time yiu missed. It will still be considered unexcused. Overall its an easy job
good,Very bland job with no stimulation. Restrictions to protect info are so harsh much of the job is sitting in dead silence between calls to assist consumers. Nothing to do during that time nothing exepcted to do in between calls except sit and wait.
good,"Great work place to work, great pay, warm environment, very easy to get the work, wonderful hours, I love helping customers, to know I'm doing something great for the community"
good,"The lack of professionalism throughout this particular site can be witnessed on a daily basis. There are limitations to the amount help agents can offer the callers. The company promoted from within, witch is a good policy."
good,A typical day at work is very demanding.  Staff is limited so we don't have time to take a lunch.  Each person wears multiple hats.  The co-workers we used to have were great to work with.  The hardest part of the job is never having enough time in the day to get everything done that is expected of you.
good,"IT was very hard job but the people are very nice. you was on the phone alot, but training staff are wonderful and you can move up"
good,Manager team have favortism .Lunch's are only 30mins. Hr department never there or helpful. People get to come to work and not do their jobs.
good,"If you want to sit on your bum all day."
good,"The atmosphere is a great place, work is rewarding helping others with disputes, enrollments and information about their health care coverage. We have a great team of agents helping our customers, Medicare beneficiaries and callers with general questions. I've been educated in the health care system for retirees and how the SSA  department work together to provide benefits to our disabled and retirees. The most difficult thing experienced is listening to the elders and disabled individuals with real life difficult situations and following policies and procedures where the end result isn't in favor of the customer. The rewarding aspect of my position is that I was able to help someone in a difficult situation where the customer greatly appreciated the assistance and hearing the their voice with praise with the end result."
good,Typical work day consisted of being on the phone 90% of the time.  Ability to sit long periods of time while being able to find information quickly.  Management was somewhat unstructured and co-workers had nonchalant attitudes about the job task.  Hardest part of the job was being able to locate information material quickly as well as meet quality control standards.  Most enjoyable part of the job were the benefits associated with meeting bonus requirements.
good,A good source of diverse job opportunities for technical staff.The level of professionalism at General Dynamics is far beyond what I was accustomed to.
good,Management/Supervisor could be more understanding when employees need to miss work. Policy could be adjusted to allow for emergencies that happen with family. Being sick should not count against you when your under doctor's order not to work.
good,"Managed a shop of IT installers,at DIA. Long hours and a lot of attitudes when it came to get work done. Had to make sure teams did their assigned tasks, had to handle the ordering of replacement materials and equipment need to preform the installation of fiber  cabling."
good,General Dynamics is a big company and has many things to offer but i prefer a smaller company will grow. And I'm done with dealing with the Navy.
good,"Worked at GD on a 1 year design engineering contract. I had the opportunity to expose myself to design and development so I liked the fact that the experience catered to my interests. Given the type of employment and me being a recent grad. I was quite happy with the pay and the employees are exceptionally friendly. "
good,Work life Balance depends on area you work in.  I enjoyed the people and personalities I interacted with every day.  Little responsibility given to the individual (not as advertised).
good,You have good listening skills and understand what important health plan consumer want. have to follow by very strict guidelines.
good,"Contract military work."
good,"work for  DOD  and  at the naval base, also on the road. I did like working with co-worker, they were friendly, kind and, gave back to the community in charity."
good,"Flexible hours enjoyed co-workers. Hardest part was assisting elderly who had to choose between eating, paying bills or medication Enjoyed talking to callers on a personal level,their life history etc."
good,"The hardest part of my job would be dealing with difficult customers. once I am able to soothe the customers needs, things go by way smoother."
good,"My work day consists of logging into a intranet database and answering calls to assist the callers and provide solutions to a problem, answer any inquiries and provide excellent customer service. The hardest part of the job is to be the bearer of bad news and not being able to assist the caller. The most enjoyable part of my job is that it isn't too strenuous."
good,"This is a great company to work for. But if you are a female with an overseas assignment, the men did not treat you very well. Went into work one day and was told you are going home without a reason. The security officer did not even know that I was leaving until I went up to check out with him. I still to this day have not been given a reason except that I was disrespectful to a civilian. We were there to support the Army and they had no problems with me. I did not socialize with the men after work. Went home and rested, the longs hours that you put in where 12 to 14 hours days and sometimes longer. So you were ready to  to get some rest.  I would love to work for the company again. But, they will not even speak to me."
good,Not a bad place to work. Offers decent hours. Hours do vary depending on business need. Layoffs up to twice a year. Notice given isnt always reasonable. Attendance policy is great.
good,A great opportunity to build character and development of other leaders.  Giving individuals assistance in strategizing and building growth development plans.
good,"I worked for GDIT for 8 years in a variety of positions. The specific company I worked for started as NCS, then NCS Pearson. I started when it was still part of Pearson. Then it separated from Pearson and became Vangent. GDIT purchased Vangent around 2011. Because of these changes in who owns the company, the work environment changed a lot since I started with the company. The company has gained contracts in the Medicare and Marketplace websites. It has also lost a Dept. of ED contract. "
good,The hours were flexible and the compensation was fair but the work tended to be repetitive and I never got the feel of company inclusion because I was stationed on site with nothing but government employees.
good,"24 X 7 operations center"
good,"Calls are always back to back, but it is a very easy job."
good,Was a contractor with no benefits. Typical GD. Good learning experience. Received Exposure to new Equipment & Technologies.
good,Well this place is not a place to work if you want job stability they have a high turn over rate.
good,"hard work rain or shine"
good,"Overall General Dynamics-IT (GDIT) is a good company to work at. They offer 5 paid holidays a year and any other holidays that are not company holidays, you'll receive overtime pay. They also offer great incentives to keep you motivated such as cash giveaways, prizes, and contests and during high volume periods some of the overtime will actually be double pay instead of a time and a half. Now, for the bad. GDIT is not good at keeping their word or communicating through the different levels of the company. There's a lot of misinformation and if you are in the lower levels/entry level position in the company, then alot of times you're just left in the dark as to what is actually going on. It gets extremely frustrating at times. It's a pretty good company though."
good,Fast paced call center / Inbound calls/working with Americans that are looking to apply for The Affordable Care Act (aka=OBAMA Care)
good,It's a good paying job if you are willing to work on Saturdays and Sundays.
good,"very positive place to work , we have a lot of training classes , to stay up to date on new things and software I love my coworkers , the hardest part of the job is not being able to help ever one"
good,The typical day is 8 hrs one 30 min lunch break and two 15 mon breaks. your work on a team lead by a supervisor
good,Overall company has good benefits and training opportunities.
good,"When I first started there I was asked what my primary goal was and I stated to be a trainer. "
good,"Excellent place to learn and grow, able to learn all aspects of the company as you apply yourself"
good,"- Very innovative unlike most Defense contractors"
good,"learned how to trial assemble completed job's, to insure everything was done correctly."
good,I come in log in on the phones and start taking calls. Assist callers on information and guide them to the correct departments.
good,Good place to work as far as benefits. Salary can be a little low.
good,After 26 years with this company I can tell you they were a complex company to work for.
good,Consumers are 90% irate. Very irratating and stressful job.
good,Very Isolated areas to work. Management was helpful. Break room is too crowded during the winter. Some employees are underpaid
good,"Mi valoración es positiva ,hasta el día en que fuí despedido"
good,it was ok and benefits were great but managment is not with it. Managment is old school and does not want to change the fact they sweep things under the rug for some but not others if your not a yes man they will get rid of you some how.
good,"Going to work was always enjoyable because everyone got along for the most part, i learned other areas of logistics that i didn't use in the army so it was alot of fun, wasn't really nothing hard about the job honestly because the time flew by, and working with retired vets and other vets was a blast because everyone shared their stories so it made time go by fast."
good,"Overview for the operation of the technical support required at a site doing intelligent work for the Defense Intelligence Agency. The site was remote to the agency which caused some connecting loss with the company and more an allegiance to the customer with the contract as the guide. "
good,"Offers good training and advancement opportunities, requires a large amount of mandatory overtime usually with short notice."
good,"I am enjoying working there. However, I don't see any career growth in this particular facility."
good,A typical day at work consists of assisting customers with personnel issues.   The most enjoyable part of the job is making a difference in the lives of the customers I serve.
good,"Back to back calls all day long, callers vary from friendly, to crazy, to rude. Calls cover a wide range of topics and it takes 2 to 4 months before you will be comfortable on the phones and feel like you know what your doing. You get two 15 min breaks and one half hour lunch a day. Fairly lenient regarding time off. "
good,"A typical day at Vangent consisted of logging in on the phone,  Protecting private health information while answering Medicare Beneficiaries,care takers, or relatives question in regards to the Medicare coverage or premium payments. Reviewing Claims information for services beneficiaries have had. During Enrollment periods, helping a beneficiary input their prescription drug information in to our plan finder tool and comparing prescription drug plans or Medicare advantage plans with them answering questions to better help them decide which direction would best suit their needs. Attending Quality Assurance monitors. Completing various trainings such as HIPPA certification among others. I learned a lot about insurances, coverage, claims billing codes and how to interpret them. How other insurance work either before as the primary payer or after as the secondary payer. And how to explain the differences between a Medicare Prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan. My co workers were very knowledgeable and helpful in answering questions that I may have had, or how to query for certain topics in within our database. The hardest part of the job was helping Beneficiaries that may have had a recent loss, such as a spouse or child, and making  sure they understood what options they had and what information would be needed to help them close out drug plans or advantage plans of a deceased beneficiary. What I enjoyed most was helping people and giving them the information they needed for resubmitting claims that may have been denied or not filed properly, helping find more cost"
good,"Well compensated, good engineers, flexible hours"
good,"Benefits are very limited and costly for someone with a family. The original company was acquired by a very large organization that has specific processes that create timelags and that are difficult to follow. There are advantages such as casul attire, great work/life balance, and the ability to work from home."
good,"The job kept me on my toes, always needed to be 3 steps ahead in my thinking. I learned the value of time management, how to deal with unhappy customers. The hardest part of my job was having upper management realize the needs of the warehouse. Once it was realized it was to late. Worked with a diverse group of people who were willing to teach and share training."
good,On my contract I worked at the client site so it felt more like I worked for the government than I did for General Dynamics. I felt very disjointed from the company itself.
good,Registered users for access to various systems.
good,"The co-worker were very nice people, we all came into the position relying on eachother for assistance and the management was very kind"
good,We have a 5min start-up meeting at the beginning of our shift. The supervisor tells us if their were any problems from the previous shift. We go to our stations and check op books to see where the other shift left off.
good,Answering in bound calls from Students or parents trying to navagate federal student aid applications.
good,"Due to having government contracts, strict rules are in place for doing business."
good,"Provides many services to the Military, works with the customer to insure quality products. Works with the TACOM Program Management Team."
good,answering inbound calls regarding thier healthcare insurance plans
good,The job at Vangent is not hard but the management is hard to get used to. Since Vangent has many different government contracts they are very strict in everything they do. There is very little sway in any rules even when there is a strong need.
good,work was great really liked working for GD.wish i could transfer to another division . I am a painter/ robotics specialist
good,"Help individual to attain insurance needed for to maintain life and well-being. Hard to work at place lots of rules and most are not keep by your supervisor, favoritism among employee"
good,the call ceneter provided a relaxed and friendly work environment overall the management and training will give you the tools you need to be a successful csr
good,Provided opportunity for growth. The encourage internal hiring. They are growing and have been awarded large long term contracts that appeal to a large skillset.
good,Ensure that you take this type of position only after asking how much of the contract term remains. The position ended quickly once another defense contractor was awarded the contract.
good,"This job required me to really be on top of my game as managing teams of 13 to 20 with a high turnover rate was quite challenging.  I learned the differences of generations as my employees aged from 18 to 70."
good,"As a Financial Analyst you are required to manage multiple contracts in a performance driven corporate environment. The company is so huge that it's difficult to find points of contact within the company. Loyalty among co-workers depends on your physical office location. If you work at a small/remote office or from home, you are basically on your own for support in getting things done. I had three different managers in four years and none of them had time to help or support me with my concerns. Compensation is better than average but be sure to negotiate your starting pay carefully because annual raises are typically <2%. I ultimately quit after 4.5 years because I could not keep up with the fast pace, long hours and lack of support from management."
good,"Great place to work, great people, nice atmosphere.  Challenging experiences with work assigned and completion time very reasonable.  Overall team effort is a plus."
good,"I've been tossed around from department to department due to my skill set being so vast so I always have stuff to do, however nothing I've done as really challenged or excited me. Its too soon to make a solid assessment but so far I'm not very enthused or intrigued by what I've done here."
good,"it was a call center, why is this review required to have 150 characters"
good,The job was good. I would recommend it to others. They pay good and have good benifits.. They also care and they are very understanding to you needs and problems.
good,The job was temporary and went thru employees like crazy was not enough work for everyone to stay and work most people left early due to lack of calls
good,Enjoyed assisting customers with their questions and solving problems.  Did not like utilizing scripting as it was so robotical and not friendly.  The training was good.  All calls were monitored.
good,"They rant and rave about promoting within, but I've applied to several jobs that I know I am qualified for, but have not been considered. Basically if you are not kissing up to someone or higher up then they really don't really care, you are just a body in a chair."
good,"Productive environment in general but learning opportunities and growth opportunities declined each year."
good,"Although GDIT is a great place to develop, you have to come in with the basic IT skills. That will get you far withing the company.  Hardest part of the job was the commute for me.  The most enjoyable part was learning new managing styles."
good,"Rarely if ever was asked to work beyond 9-5. Compensation was low, especially for the area. Benefits were passable. There were almost 0 opportunities for advancement. Any job change will be lateral. Standard level of competence from management"
good,GDIT was a good company to work for. They gave me the opportunity to learn about investigative work. I would still be working for this company if the contarct had not folded.
good,I enjoy working for Maximus Federal very much .I just hate that there is no real room for growth and pay increase and the hour commute there and again back is getting to be to much .
good,"The job is challenging, but that's what I like about it. You can learn a lot. Depends on how much you're willing to learn. And how much effort you willing to put forth."
good,"This is a great place to work for a fast pace. Poor training, the job was to learn from your teacher in a week many different scripts in a 5 days to research and take an open book test for the job.  (150 questions). You miss 5 you fail. Hardest part of job was the training, the rules and information taught in the beginning change continued as you to work  and more is added to it. The management is there to help but if you don't learn in the time they think you should, then you are written-up. There are no room for mistakes and corrections.The breaks are not long enough (3 breaks-15 minutes-30 minutes-15 minutes). I learned professionalism and to think quick while taking time with each call..Most enjoyable was the days you can have time to think. Slow calls day like Saturdays and Sundays. These are days you study. I made number 2 in my sight before leaving. awesome."
good,Not a bad place to work.  Good if you like to work on a variety of different things.  Make sure you always try to network for your next job in the firm.
good,No surprises if you've worked in government contracting.  plusses and minuses and its not for everyone.  Just remember that the cient is always right.
good,General Dynamics was a great place to work awesome benefits. Good pay and great hours. I learned a lot working for the company. Overall it was a great experience.
good,While I was working for General Dynamics I enjoy it performing the requirements for Marketplace my mistake was going into Medicare it is more fast-paced and stressful dealing with Medicare
good,"GDIT is a contracting agency, and one of the largest, as such, it is work with a large company and they operate as such. Nothing to really write home about this company. It's stable work as long as the contract you work on is stable."
good,It was a good job good pay just it was all out of order i was told we didnt get payed correct and that befire the building closed we were supposed to get a raise or something .
good,At first this was a great place to work but they do lay offs often and sometimes it is with out notice. When they do lay off they do give you a 2 week working notice
good,"decent job to work at if you like call center work. I myself was not a fan of the strict schedule, and policies. 8 hour work days with very low pay. I feel the pay could be  greater with it being a government contract."
good,Loved the environment and the people just didn't like being stuck to a phone all day. Management was great with working with you and doing there best to make the place a good work environment
good,"I got the job with the company shortly after I had my first child in order to find stable work outside of the service industry.  This company was very stressful to work for, and although I grew and learned from the company i was glad to leave."
good,"General Dynamics is in the midst of the acquisition of another company.  The organizational processes are not mature, but provides a good career challenge."
good,"The job is very repetitive, but you develop relationships with your co workers pretty fast if you work 2nd or 3rd shift. There's a lot of down time after 7pm."
good,"I faltered in performing my InfoSec role at General Dynamics. I was not prepared to perform at my high Information Assurance job level. "
good,Very busy call center environment with a lot of regulations difficult work schedules with very minimal flexibility.  Team assignments changed every 4-6 weeks with a new team and the schedule you worked changed at same time and the schedule would be based on a team score.
good,My typical workday was watching over several severs within the data center and assisting with and moves that needed to take place. I often would have to create tickets to have work performed
good,"Good place to work, working for the client was enjoyable and if I had the chance I would do it again. Salary was ok but I could not get a pay raise at all."
good,"This company is good if you are interested in learning something about Medicare that will help you in future career choices. I would say it's more of a stepping stone, not a permanent placement."
good,Great place to work many opportunities to work globally and throughout the U.S.   Great benefits with flexible hours to work even as a contractor work.
good,Working for this company was eventful. I learned a lot about Medicaid/Medicare policies. I enjoyed assisting the callers through education and product information.
good,GD is a large company with many subsidiaries and one main focus. I enjoyed working for General Dynamics because they provided a level of assurance and growth.
good,"Job was slow paced but stressful supervision was great training was great,but the policy And calls were stressful,calls were long and it was somewhat difficult to understand the work"
good,Benefits were good while working there. Management was faulty as far as guiding new workers as well as being on time and consistent. There was a lot of days that workers were sent home from lack of work.
good,"I liked the job overall.  It was difficult in the sense that it was difficult to tell a consumer who had cancer that we could not find an insurance provider for them, or a person with health issues and limited income that the premiums for their insurance was more than they could afford.  It was often emotional.  The company itself I felt that they did not care about their employees and were deceptive."
good,"Need more information given to the customers,  process takes a long time, question every call, management was overwhelmed. Mandatory over time, was a hassle"
good,It's a decent job...helps get the bills paid...can be stressful...the point system sucks...some management are great......musf have reliable transportation
good,Hardest part of the job is having difficult customers and the lack of proper training to handle those type of situations not enough hands on training ;
good,Ok place to work.  I cannot believe that I am having to write something out here.  They have the incorrect company name so this  is all irrelevant.   Oh well.
good,"This was a fast pace work place, had to be on top of your time, picking up the phones quick not having the customers wait too long.  It was a good job overall."
good,There were to many people doing the same job.  The site is overstaffed for the mission.  Only certain people performed the tasks while others were left out of the planning and mission process.
good,"The background investigation program has begun to seem more like a corporate office. However, GDIT has offered many opportunities to excel for those who are positioned to benefit from them. They also offer a very nice education program for those seeking higher education while working there."
good,"Very stressful job, very moderate paced, job was a call center environment, very strict rules that have to be followed at all times. I felt like there was no opportunity to advance in the company."
good,"I do not have a review of this company they treated me fairly and I have not worked for them for about 10 years, I hope this is a help thank you for your time"
good,"- Our contract ended no job to replace yet "
good,he company is well set. But it really depends upon whom you work with and your team. SOme teams are good and some teams are clueless. So have choose your team carefully
good,It was an ok job. They had some down falls but they also had so good things about them as well. One thing was for sure you were going to get paid cause they always had OT.
good,The job is very stressful you would be on the phone countless of hours because of the calls you would take required much information from the customers.
good,Nice place to work. Medicare is super busy all the time. Trainers are great. Most of the supervisors are cool. Cool things do happen like snack carts and free food.
good,Good place to work.Good environment and great co workers. Everyone on he project gets along pretty well. Good working hrs. There is no parking for contractors at facility.
good,General Dynamics was great at providing training and education resources for employees who could take the courses online through their ilearn system.  Valuable to improve your internal mobility.
good,"Working for CSRA for 27 years, work was enjoyable and stable company was acquired by GDIT in April and our department was abolish thus I was separated and not much to tell about the new company since we are still in transition."
good,I learned a lot because it was my first csr job so it helped me out a lot. but the environment was very not me because you never know who the boss and they did so much
good,This company offers great benefits and growth potential if you are on the right project. There are a lot of people in the company you can reach out to for advice and consultation.
good,"The last training class I went through was a total joke! The instructor had no control, it was more like a bunch of obnoxious high school kids, the younger people ignored the instructor, talked while he was talking, they were openly on their cell phones and there were several young men that slept in class."
good,"GDIT Acquired our company and boasted a reputation of taking care of its employees. In reality, our personnel from the legacy company are neglected and often overlooked."
good,I would have stayed with General Dynamics. If they had been able to keep up the flow of interesting new tasks. I am always interested in new technology and figuring out how to use it to help the user community.
good,You stay busy but are micromanaged. This is a decent place to work although in my opinion they could definitely pay more. Laid back dress code so you can wear jeans and sneakers if you choose to and they also give personal time off that you accrue as long as you work the 40 hours a week which adds up quickly.
good,"The company may be a good company if you work directly for them. However, I am contractor and contracts are only good for their length of term. After the contract is over, it may or may not be renewed causing employees to wonder whether they will continue employment or seek employment elsewhere. Sometimes you will have to reapply for your job position despite the amount of years you have been performing them. If another company win the bid on the contract, it is not guaranteed that you will have employment despite your years of service on the job. Each employee have their own interpretation of what they want and need, so years in this case helps, but does not guarantee you a position."
good,"General Dynamics did a wonderful job of taking care of their employees. "
good,"I like there was a planned schedule for the day; however, some of the supervisors and managers were not productive with the co-workers.  I believe that it was not organized and the CSRs were not treated fairly by authoritative figures."
good,the work is very simple as they give you all the resources needed to preform your job on a daily basis.  Laid back work environment as well.  The stress of the job however can be high and you dont have much room for advancement since everything is based on tenure not qualification.  Lack of communication though they are trying to improve that.
good,Very good about training and making sure that job description and training were one of the same. I would love to go back it was a exceptionally great place to work with major benefits.
good,"Just like any other call center.  Follow script, dress appropriately, solve every customers problems.  Sometimes can be boring sitting in one spot all day."
good,"A typical day at work includes"
good,A fairly challenging role that requires a very steady 9-5 day.  While the workplace culture can be challenging to navigate at times the work itself is perfect for an individual to start a career in IT.
good,"I worked in a DHS location on a client site.  I did not have much interaction with my GDIT manager except admin stuff.  My work was with the government customer.  I did great work for them.  When the contract ended, I was unable to find work in GDIT because of the slow HR.  By the time HR called me for the numerous jobs in which I applied, I was starting a new job some where else."
good,Even thought you have a very quiet work space the job can be very stressful when you are constantly on the phone back to back or if you have computer issues throughout a call.
good,"The company had over 17,000 employees at the time of my employment.  This was obvious in the policies and overall feel of the workplace.  Having previously been part of a company of less than 100 people, the differences were significant."
good,"The General Dynamics management I worked with were from out of state and didn't understand the local market or the local Nextel management, which caused a lot of turmoil and animosity between the two working groups."
good,I enjoyed working at this job at first but then we I started seeing how the health care was effecting people I couldn't do the job any longer. It wasn't something I believed in
good,"I worked for GD in Fort Worth when GD was in the military aviation industry."
good,"It was an ok job , I don’t think I would go back. Since I have left they have raised the pay rate to 12.03 long hours sitting down at an desk it not a problem at all job was ok"
good,Typical day of work would consist of speaking with the elderly about prescription drug plans and enrolling in which plan better suits their needs. I learned how adapt to changing environments based on calls. I loved talking to the elderly.
good,This is a call center that deals with healthcare. It can get kind of stressful and constantly changing. There are time where policies make your job difficult to help customers. Like I had stated I am not a call center person.
good,Knowledge is the key factor on how you could tackle the tasks to be performed in the timely manner. Quality is always at the utmost this is the key elements that I've learn which help me on my career.
good,I worked for a Government Contractor called Vangent who sold the company to General Dynamics. I left shortly after for a better paying job so not much I can say regarding this company.
good,"Working as a software engineer at a large contractor like General Dynamics isn't a great career move. Contracts come and go, and employees get lost in the shuffle. There isn't any emphasis on quality code, other than to make sure it works, and that it is done on time for the contract,."
good,work life balance was anything but balanced. Management was always pitting employees to police each other. Constant layoffs placed employees in fear and stressed them to the point it affected them in our personal lives.
good,"The work at General Dynamics is very stressful. You need to put in a lot of hours and have to deal with pushy people that don't take ""wait"" for an answer. That is the nature of the Submarine business."
good,I was there for 5 years and did a variety of roles through a professional development rotation program.  This is a good place for a young engineer to cut their teeth and learn the 'right' way to go about complex design.  I took what I learned here and was able to develop more simple processes in later companies that had structure but were not so overbearing they crippled progress.
good,I loved speaking with the customers. There was some issues with the policy aspect of the job when it came down to it. I would recommend that you make sure you put what you want to get out if the job the job.
good,A typical day at work includes sitting in a cubical all day taking calls with very few and short breaks. Very micro managed. Calls can be very far apart or back to back.
good,Contract Employee and Support Rep.for the Federal Student Aid Information Center. Assist customers to submit and complete Federal Financial Aid.Answering incoming calls in less than 240 seconds.Responsible for submitting time reports for hours worked daily and bi-weekly pay through Deltek Systems.
good,i don't have anything bad to say about them i just would not recommend the job to anyone mainly because of the  toll it takes on ones emotions outside of work.
good,"Management had low tolerance for people who don't perform or are knowledgeable in their job field.  Some mandatory weekends, but everyone was required to work, not just those who needed to."
good,In the process of getting to know the company culture and goals. Heard that this company really takes good care of its employees so I am hopeful about that.
good,"You get on the phone until your first break, (15 min); then after that break you get back on the phone. Next break is (30 min) or lunch. then you get back on the phone and your last break is 15 min; the you get back on phone until you go home. They frown upon unscheduled bathroom breaks. and are very strict."
good,"A typical day consists of, monitoring my team at all times, taking over difficult calls, reviewing quality monitors, one on one coachings, call listenings, attending required trainings/meetings."
good,"I worked at gdit as a seasonal csr and my time there was wonderful. I had so much fun and got to talk to a lot of different people. The team leader was always their when you needed them, they made me feel very comfortable."
good,"I would go back because of the money that I was making, that the only reason I would go back. the caller is rude and disrespectful and so is some of the staff. there is no outlet for the way you are treated on both ends"
good,"GDIT, was a good company to work for, it gave you a chance to learn different things. Even though i did customer Service before, you learning different information that can help you better with the job you are doing."
good,General Dynamics is a Great company to work with. I enjoyed al the local people I worked with in the Englewood office. The General Manager in charge of the Colorado area was not focused on pleasing the customer (AT &T) and they lost the contract and had to lay many of the employees off in that office. I being one of them.
good,Things have changed a lot since my time with GDIT. I don't think upper management was always aware of what was going on with the people doing day to day operations.
good,"Don't really have much of an opinion yet as GDIT recently acquired my company. So far, our benefits have stayed the same and our culture and climate are untouched. Future will tell."
good,It was oki job it just payed badly in my opinion  at least for degree i have.But staff were good and my coworkers was enjoyable.But dealing with health insurance with people wasn't the most relaxed job it was stress full at times.
good,"The management is poor and selection process for advancement is biased.  There is no room for advancement.  The pro is a set schedule and benefits. It makes it easier to have a schedule outside of work, other than that there are not any pros."
good,It wasn't so bad at general dynamics. There was set hours and after 7 your pay goes up. they included breaks and lunch. They were very strict and any outside technology that entered the premises.
good,During my time with GDIT I learned the ins and outs of being an ISSO within an IC agency.  The training was sufficient for the day and time.  It has led me to be successful in other positions along my career.
good,This was my first job out of Active Duty Army. I was not with company enough time to provide an honest review. Once I came across another opportunity I went on to another career.
good,things change w/ every company.  some for the better some not.  Great co workers. Our unit gets along great. great supervisor.  I wish it were closer to where I live.
good,productive workplace。 you are always get enough work to do here every day. you supervisor may not like you by your personality instead how your job is done. 
good,"Upper management is to naive to realize that good help is hard to come by.They see no issue in laying people off, they almost act like they're doing you a favor. Everyday feels like your last."
good,"Centralized contact point for all communications, problems and administrative inquiries posed"
good,"I do no have a review about this company, they has steady hours, strict rules, and strict attendance, Good company to work for and all benefits start up right away"
good,"Although I really enjoyed the clients that I assisted in this role, the work itself was stressful and demanding. Overtime was required at certain times, and shifts were not always based on your first choice. I handled several very stressful phone calls, and ensured the clients were ok before the call ended, but it was hard to witness the kind of stress some of them were under, due to the requirements of the calls. This was not a bad place to work, and the management staff were very friendly and helpful in most circumstances, but it is not the kind of environment I choose to be in for a long period of time. I am glad for the job I had, and I worked my full year contract, but I would not go back."
good,"This is an ok place to work.  The pay is good .  The benifits are ok,  The people are very good.  The work can be very stressfull at at times overall it is nut a bad place to work"
good,"* Great when busy with actual training work"
good,"Made some great friends, good money and got to talk to people all over the U.S.A. I would work here again but I don't have too. Loved the down time which we had a lot of."
good,"Outside General Dynamics poor middle management leadership, it was not a bad company to work for. The culture was laid back and for the most part people truly got along with each other."
good,Need to understand the workload and what is expected of you before you take on something like BRAC.  Once you do you can make it happen.  Stress yes but look at the end results.
good,I will preface by saying I did not work in a typical General Dynamics environment. I was looking for something intense with new technology and a sense of urgency and I could not find it.
good,"The work requires you to be detail-oriented and very accurate. Your time is highly micromanaged. Your performance is based on the job reliability, content accuracy, average handle time  and politeness. Shifts are based on job performance. Content changes and continual training is required."
good,"Fast paced, never the same thing twice from day to day.  I learned a lot about high level aerospace work there.  I miss the people i worked with more than the job.  There are some great guys and gals in Cullman AL."
good,"The work was fine, but what I feel made it not so inviting is the supervisors and managers.  They seemed to have their ""favorites"" when it came to employees. Meaning that if one of their favorites was having daily attendance and adherence issues, they would ""Look the other way,"" but if someone else did, they would get IMMEDIATE corrective action, up to and including termination, sometimes even if first offense.  They have a good cafeteria with a chef and cook staff that are very friendly that cook a variety of different dishes. Pricey but good."
good,"Work hours are a straight 8/40, leaving a nice work/life balance. Employees and managers are great to get along with. Advancement is minimal and salary/merit increases are based on how much ""money in the pool"" and not how well you perform in your role."
good,I really liked working for General Dynamics and I can't wait for the Next Open enrollment period so I can go back to work there next year. I hope the new sign on bonus is better next year since I am eligible for rehire
good,Hard work for welders and shipfitters but its the life of the shipyard any shipyard if you ask me but it builds you in your career it a great place to learn
good,"At General Dynamics you are assisting people around the country in receiving health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.  It can be very stressful at times, due to the website not functioning correctly."
good,I did an 8 week logistics internship one summer for college. It was very informative and pretty relaxed. They had good management and it was a fun experience.
good,The job is convenient to where I live. It's not a bad company to work but only as a stepping stone to your next career. The company need to offer more pay raise. I've been there 10yrs and I've  only seen 1 raise. New employees make the same pay as tenured employees. I feel I'm ready to try something new! Appreciate
good,"I worked for GCI Inc, a subsidiary of GDIT.  GCI was awesome.  I worked closely with many people in GDIT.  They were a typical IT company staffing government jobs.  They bid low, placed barely qualified people, did run-of-the-mill IT work, nothing innovative or special, and were on par with technology and processes 10 years behind the times."
good,So far so good I don't have any complaints I am adjusting to new environment people and job function.  I like that have a former co-worker in the company with me.
good,"I work at GDIT because they are easy to get a job quick from and the work is generally easy. The pay could be and should be better without question given the knowledge we acquire and utilize,"
good,helped them file for the affordable care act  walked some consumers through the steps on how to fill out the form. talked to many different people every day and some in different languages
good,"You will meet lots of people . Interestng material to learn , dependent upon department . Everyone is hired initially as seasonal so not much job security ."
good,"It has a good environment, most of the time there is people there to assist you. I have learn a lot about customer service and how to help consumers to the best extent and find other options for them."
good,Its pretty alright if you have the patience for customer service. many people can not handle the job because customers get sometimes really heated over the phone. I had no problem
good,GDIT provided a contract vehicle to support various positions at the Pax River NAS. They were the prime contract holders for the NAVAIR Web Teams and work supported those activities. The job was interesting.
good,"GDIT assist members of medicare, medicaid and market place with enrollment of Part D plan which is the drug plan which assist on the drug purchases with company in network or out of network,  depending on the type of coverage the member desires. Answers question about how the plan works, what is included in the coverage package, how medicare works, different prevention visit that the plan will cover, when the prevention plans is recommend for the member."
good,working at general dynamics had heavy call volume. it was a medicare / medicaid third party call center. the good thing is holidays we got paid double. t
good,This company had an exciting career trap until the government shut down.  This forced all contractor to end their assignment(s).  I had to locate a new opportunity.
good,Handle irate students along with the assistance of other team members in which it was mostly women and few men. The hardest part of the job was Different languages and poor IT systems. The hours was the most enjoyable part of the job.  .
good,"Greeting everyone in the morning, Taking inbound calls, researching claims, and providing solutions to questions or concern as well as educate the customers. Being proactive while providing excellent customer service as well as assisting and motivating other employees. I really enjoy being a part of the Focus Group, a Peer Mentor then moving on to overseeing the Peer Mentors. Being a Supervisor was challenging but one the most enjoyable and learning experiences I had at GDIT."
good,I can honestly say this job had competitive pay.   It was a job where  learning was essential and advancement was possible. I personally enjoyed  working for this company.
good,"it's okay; average"
good,"No complaints working for this company, no room for growth career opportunity growth, location was far from my house which made it  a bit expensive for me to travel."
good,"-a typical day is flexible in start/end/break times"

good,General Dynamics Information Technology is a very nice place to work. I enjoyed the training process and hands on nesting. The benefits were also great.

good,"Stressful job, fast paced environment. Must be able to handle difficult callers while at the same time being able to complete their applications correctly"
good,It was a godd place to work in London.  I had some situational issues come up.  I needed more flexibility and I was too new to get it.  I would recommend to work there.
good,General Dynamics is a very fast paced and demanding work environment. Work is not hard physically but can be mentally and emotionally challenging in some situations.
good,The job is not hard but it can be stressful. They don't pay us enough for what we put up with. Things are always changing would be the hardest part of the job in my opinion.
good,"I worked as a contract technical editor at General Dynamics. The position gave me a chance to learn new software applications and meet very helpful engineers. I liked the team I worked with very much, too. I only left because of a better job opportunity."
good,"It is satisfying to assist individuals and families apply for Federal Government programs. The training is paid. There was almost always a cue of callers, so you stay busy during sign up periods."
good,productive place to work. fun people to work with. the day goes by quickly with all of the work to do. people make it fun to work there. the quarterly bonuses are a huge plus and the pay is very good.
good,"Answer phone inquiries from consumer and assist in filling out applications and any problems or issues with the insurance companies."
good,Typical customer service role so you are sitting and looking at a computer screen for entire shift. The people are great to work with but the advancement opportunity is not ideal.
good,"en général, il y avait une bonne ambiance de travail, dans un environnement sécuritaire!"
good,"Interesting work, decent management, opportunity for advancements.  Work environment was typical of an aerospace/defense contractor.  Neither the best or worst in this category."
good,"Decent compensation and talented staff make this a nice workplace. Hours can get long, especially close to deadlines. Strategy is clearly defined which helps keep folks on same page"
good,"Responsible for mechanical team oversight, including: team meetings, personnel reviews and salary planning. Oversaw all product designs in reviews and proposals."
good,"excellent place to work.    some members of management are just not people persons.    they can do their job but cannot explain it"
good,"Great people to work with.Though they follow a waterfall model, there is huge scope of working in several projects at the same time.Manager is very good in handling issues."
good,"nice job, with positive out going people. The location was far for me to travel too. I had a friendly kind supervisor. They provide you with great training. I got laid off due to the fact it was a temp job."
good,"The position is a contract job. they can strict about bathroom breaks and that calls can be a little overpowering. For the work done, I would like more pay."
good,"This role is a contracted position, and now that I am married I need a role that is more permanent in nature. Contractor roles were fine when I was single but now that I have dependents I need something that is more dependable"
good,"The hardest part of the job was a lack of ingenuity and creativity in solving problems.  Also, there was no push to do things better or use newer versions of software to improve service."
good,"General Dynamics was a fair place to work. If you did your job you were kept around, if you didn't you were not kept around for too long. It was a reasonable place to work."

The rewards of the job are very good with excellent compensation, a co-operative work team and and an extremely enjoyable product to participate in working on."
good,good company although dealing with unions is very overwhelming most times and sometimes creates a hostile work environment. There are a lot of different departments if you can find something you're interested in it could be a job for life.
good,Great place to work.A bit stressful. Managers are good.friendly staff.A good lunch room .Parking is fine.People are friendly to work with .Many different department to work for.Machine shop environment is clean and kept up .Room for advancement.Over all good hours and fair amount of over time.
good,"in charge of warehouse and all inventory. made sure cycle counts were done daily, supervised 15 employees. followed all company policies. shipped vehicles to different areas."
good,"Good pay, good benefits, good hours. Management too concerned with making every individual person happy even if it means going against the regulations set in place by the government side. Will fire you for doing your job and turning people away according to the government regulations without a second thought if someone writes up a bad ICE comment on you. And don't count on the government to back you up either when the time comes, because they won't. May not be so bad outside the government contract side."
good,"GD is a good place to work, It's difficult to advance to a higher position. There are great benefits and compensation. However, the management has a high turnover and a bias."
good,"Prepare and deliver presentations, employee on-boarding, track employee performance, deliver up-training as program changes. Maintain relationships between all departments."
good,"It was a stressful place to work."
good,"A typical day is receiving calls from people needing assistance in completing their Free Application for Federal Student Aid. This can range from basic answers to having to help complete the entire application. Callers are generally cordial with the occasional angry caller. The expectations for having around 3 minute calls on average is ridiculous and is essentially encouraging the employee to rush the caller through who will likely have to call back. This combined with the insistence that you help them get their PIN no matter what means that at best you have 2 minutes to help with their issue."
good,The company was a good environment to work for. Everyone smiles and help one another. Working here for me was a good learning experience. I was glad to have work there.
good,"The job was fairly simple, and didn't offer much room for advancement.  The health care package was too expensive.  This was a factory that makes military equipment, so it is very dependent on military contracts"
good,Worked in a high level fast paced call center that consist of assisting customers in applying for health care through the government sponsored Healthcare Marketplace and/or applying for Medicare.
good,I'm just not a customer service type of person.  The job isnt bad...not that great either.  It pays the bills. They work with school schedules.  A good job if you have patience with people with attitudes.
good,I cannot accurately review this workplace because I did not ever actually work in this organization. Not sure why the interface is assuming that I worked here because it's not the case.
good,It is a ok place to work. Not a permanent job. I enjoyed my time there. I met some great people there. I felt like I could have advanced more in my position and offered a full time position.
good,"When i first started working at GDIT i liked it but once open enrollment started it gets very stressful and hectic. You have to be able to handle back to back phone calls and people cussing at you. It can be rewarding job when you are actually able to help someone out. As far as the way the job treats you, it was okay but when i had to have an emergency surgery and was out for two weeks i came back into work and found out they had let me go and never even let me know they were going to do so."
good,"Working at General Dynamics is a stressful job being that the callers are rude especially when they know you are reading scripted information when all their question needs is a yes or no. You have Quality rating calls and they are always changing up guidelines. You are told one thing in training then when you get out on the floor and start doing what you learned in training you start getting deemed down. Majority of the things you are told does not add up. One day you are told to do this then after you do it and you are deemed down for it you are told you should be doing another thing. Everything should be on the same page. The hardest part of the job is to remain calm when you are on the phone with a caller who uses name calling and profanity when they are upset at their situation. When you do work hard and do get 5 star customer satisfaction ratings, you do not get anything for that. So your hard work is not shown appreciated."
good,Stressful job. Too many angry callers. Not the companys fault but still very stressful. My manager was nice and laid back. Knew how hard the job was..
good,Assisted customers over the phone with general information regarding Healthcare coverage. Tight security and not much of a 'fun atmosphere'. High turn over rate as well.
good,"A typical day consist of back to back phone calls and providing excellent customer service to our clients. We receive phone calls for the entire 8 hours with the exception of the breaks and lunch. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be dealing with the different personalities of the clients, but I do my best to make them feel at ease by showing them that I am attentive to their needs by providing empathy, apology, and even sympathy where needed. Honestly the most enjoyable part of the day is when I have helped resolve an issue that the client is calling in about and receiving a sincerely grateful thank you afterwards,"
good,My first call representative job. The pay was pretty good but the energy of the workplace wasn't always there. Overall I thought it was a good experience.
good,"Okay. I just started there. Nothing more to say yet. I will not rate this company until I have been there for at least a year."
good,Worked with this agency off and on for a few years. Gained many connections and work experience. Adecco was great at providing work opportunities when I needed them most.
good,This call center has its pros and cons just as any does but the professionalism takes a bit of a toll. They have little to no dress code and the relationships/friendships between coworkers is highly unprofessional. There is always some type of drama.
good,"Good company to work for with steady work, good crew, and good management. However, when material was needed to complete a job, weeks, sometimes months would go by without correct parts. Also, tools were hard to come by as the job progressed."
good,A nice place to work. Layoffs are hard on family! If you can get in a department that's not trying to downsize. It's a great opportunity. Management has zero backbone! The hardest part of the job was wondering if you was going to have a job the next week!!!
good,"Great enineering work with General Dynamics Land Systems in Sterling heights, MI. "
good,"a good job to re enter the work field; however it was hard not to over empathize with consumers and their problems, as I provided insurance information and help with coverage dates etc."
good,"This was a scripted job, that paid well. Getting overtime was easy and job didn't require you to use a lot of self thinking. Easy to get along with others and team members."
good,"Like I said in the review summary, everyone has a different prospective.  I loved the job, but struggled to appreciate the management styles of our leaders.  Management styles contributed to lowered moral."
good,"This company needs to increase diversity. The radome sector is strong compared to other sectors. I have worked for 8 years, which is a long time. People are cooperative, but not all of them.The company arranges some activities like golf, family day etc which is nice.I don't want to comments about management.A lot of management changes occurred during my 8 years.Some of them good some of them are not"
good,Good place to learn and grow and dog eat dog world! Political upper management it not what you know but whom and how well you can lie. Overall Manager know there game and how to use other employees skills.
good,Typical day is very busy as the calls can come in one after the other   with no time to breathe.  I have learned a lot working there claims drug plans  and I was also Market Place  trained.  The environment has   changed first it was fun now it is more like we are on a slave ship it seemed like we were just a number and not a person there. The hardest part of the job is when  I cannot assist beneficiary because that is  certain  situations  that are not handled by us but  with Social Security Administration and Medicaid
good,Typical day at work was fine. I learned alot of information regarding health Insurance. Job is stressful at times. My supervisor does an outstanding job.
good,I worked 8 years at this call center. I would more than likely still be there if they would of paid me more for all the responsibilities they kept giving me.
good,"Answering phones and typing, training over all good work environment other than it being temp. hardest part of the workday was when caller would call and say they was going to hurt themselfs or thy would want to argue."

good,"General Dynamics is an OK place to work but as a dual agent, you'll get single pay for the job of 2.  Fights and arguments constantly occurs among the employees.  High turnover, lots of stress with no job security.  Here today and gone tomorrow.  Not enough income to pay bills and eat.  That's just how it is."
good,"The role that I filled consisted of sitting at a computer and grading, then lunch, then more sitting at a computer and grading. I had full-time, good-paying work, but it was temporary. I learned that I would like to have a job where at least some physical activity is involved. Management was easy to talk to and work with. For me, the atmosphere was less than ideal. The job itself was easy enough, but it could be hard in another way to sit at a desk call-center style for 40 hours a week doing a repetitive task."
good,"Challenging Work, Growing Company, many chances provided to excel and succeed.  Senior Management is changing culture for the better and instilling a sense of ownership."
good,The jobs isnt stressful but the people you work with in management makes it stressful lack of training due to there isnt enough hands on training quality scaling is opinionated

good,"Good management, great work place and enjoy most of the part of the job time. A lot to learn very challeging job, Great workplce culture."
good,"We take phone calls all day everyday. Sometimes I wonder about the common sense of the people that own this company. It's very spuratic all the time, everything is always changing, nothing is consistence. HR is very pick and choosy, they will approve certain things for some people but then turn around not approve the same thing for another person."
good,Enjoy working with the other associates. Great processes and ability to get out reliable product. Communication between management and employees could be strengthened to make a better team. Salary does not reflect the workmanship and hours.
good,"Everything depends on which contract you're on and who you support. Can't carry-over hours like other contracts, can't really make-up hours if needed."
good,"The most rewarding part of this job was working with my colleagues.  "
good,"Way too much stress. I did not like it at the end. The company has made alot of changes, most of which aren't for the better."
good,Took forever to get calls cause there was a lot of employees. Every one helped each other if needed and very sweet people.
good,Good place to begin a career or continue to grow your skills and upgrade your level of knowledge and clearance for advancement within the company given the opportunity.
good,"contract job only, well ran stayed busy.  good management and good benefits. couldn't keep enough contracts to stay busy though.  ended up letting staff go with no work."
good,"Overall, this is not a forever type of job. It is more of a job that you take to pay the bills untill something better comes along or you actually start you ideal career. I enjoy working with different people daily ranging from young to old, disabled, etc. I just love the fact I can help at least one person everyday at work; even if that means being the bearer of bad news. I liked the challenges the work brought. I'm up for changes as long as it is delivered in a manner that doesn't cause chaos in the workplace and it seemed like GDIT did a terrible job of presenting changes...very unorganized. The good employees are overshadowed by the bad ones."
good,"Fun, positive environment, Always ways to learn new things. The company always provide coaching to help employees improve and that's what I loved about being a customer service representative at general dynamics"

good,"It was an okay place to work."
good,"Usual large defense contracting company. Overall had a great experience due to management. "
good,"Opportunity to learn different things. Things unique to shipbuilding but skills that can be universally applied. People are great to work with once they understand that you are willing to work with them. There may be a little mistrust at first because of the so many different people who you interact with. Don't try to rush things but just do your job and always be respectful and instead of mistrust, you'll have many friends who are fun to work with."
good,"Needs more extensive training, great staff though! They have good schedules, and are very accommodating. Also, need to work on the HR communications with the employees."
good,"They hire and lay off a lot other than that however the work environment is okay, great starter call center for beginners."

good,I really dont have much to say. I wish i didnt have to write this statement but you gotta do what you gotta do

good,"take hands on approach to resolving every issue. Solid, comprehensive work experience in a fast paced call center environment"

good,"I recently was let go of GDIT because of low funding. The correct terminology would be ""furloughed"" and they were aware of this when they hired me however left it out during my interview and when i signed my contract. My supervisor is more than helpful finding me a new position in  new department. It it an inconvenience that I have to go through unemployment benefits etc."
good,"GDIT has good benefits and compensation.  They have many different opportunities.  However, I am currently unhappy in my position and have been unsuccessful in moving to other projects"

good,It was a long time ago but good place for someone straight out of college and looking to get their foot in the door.  The company was good to the workers and provided decent training every year.  You did kind of feel like a number there though and have to say the raises there were next to nothing.

good,"A typical day working at General Dynamics was productive. I learned and grew in my people skills. The management was well, and understood what they were doing. My co-workers were great people to work with. I think the hardest part of this job, like most call centers, was taking phone calls repeatedly without a pause, but it was an overall enjoyable learning experience."

The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. The office started to get crowded as the company grew"
good,I learned how to deal with Customers that have life events that are very over whelming do to situation with health insurance. When dealing with life sustaining situation with not be able to get the medication do to errors in the insurance.

When going from one year to the next year to make sure that all consumers don't loose their health insurance.

There is always something new to learn when dealing with the different consumers and their issues.The co-workers are decent people as well. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the irate consumers who are not understanding what is being told to them. It is a difficult process and once they become irate it takes a while to bring hem back down. The most enjoyable part of the job is when someone says I helped them so much. It feels good to know you helped someone who could be going through and now because of you the have one less thing to worry about."

good,8 hour shifts! A place centered around customer service via telephone! Helps people choose health insurance that fits their needs!
good,"In A typical day at work, I would take dozens of inbound phone calls from Medicare patients asking questions from general information to why a claim was not paid. The management was not good, they often told employees what we wanted to here in order to placate us, but seldom followed through on any promises. My co-workers at Vangent weren't the best either, the job requirements were pretty much a pulse, read and speak english. The hardest part of the job was trying to help people who just wanted someone to scream at and not hanging up on them. There really wasn't anything enjoyable about that job"

It is easy to grow in this company if they see you do your best. They are always looking to hire supervisors. The hardest part of the job was the down-time.

As the majority of the CSRs are temporary, my supervisors and I need to keep their CSRs motivated to be at work on time per their schedule.  The biggest challenge is getting the CSRs to adhere to their schedules and strive to meet the metrics.  I have learned, as a manager, I need to make myself available for the CSRs and let them know how important they are to achieving the goals of the organization.  The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the CSRs and supervisors to help them change behaviors as needed and challenge them to succeed.  I find great pleasure in helping someone realize their potential to be successful, change their behaviors and then see them succeed.  The management team is great in that we help each other achieve the goals of the organization."

I have learned the importance of working to perfect team efficiency, and strategies necessary to provide the best service for our customer at the lowest cost. I've had the opportunity to travel to many exotic locations throughout the world. Though many were hostile, all were rewarding. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part of the job.

good,"GDAIS is a very busy, innovative company that taught me to look at things on a more global level."
good,A typical day at work I find myself assisting with various IT issues and going to customer meetings.
good,"GDIT is a company that is growing, but not in the customer service area."
good,A typical day begins at 5:30 and ends around 5:30.  No two days are ever the same.  I love my coworkers and my boss.
good,Because of the nature of the contracts taken by GDC the workplace is very structured and has many polices and procedures in place that can be a bit taxing.
good,"I had the best co-workers any one could have asked for, there were also some good supervisors, and some managers. "
good,"Design integration."
good,"General Dynamics used to provide an environment for growth and interesting work. They have changed drastically over last 4 years."
good,"The work place is good (old building, new furnisher) and maintained. I enjoyed working with the many great employees. One of the best things about AIS was the 9-80 work schedule, having every other Friday off is fantastic . . . free coffee is pretty good also."
good,Enjoyed helping the consumer. Lots of scripts to read but easy to catch on to.
good,General Dynamics was a great start for me but shipyard work is dangerous and you work very hard.
good,"A typical day would have a couple hours of reviews, meetings, some consultation with Leads about how plans oprogress, etc."
good,"Fiber optics training."
good,"At GDLS, I managed to learn a career-length worth of experience in just 10 years."
good,Work is copy and paste.  Government spending dictates livelihood.
good,Focused on quality telephone customer service. Focused on meeting quality numbers. People where easily to approach regarding feedback and performance.
good,"I had many good experiences at GD Armament and Technical Products in Vermont, including working with various people and projects, several of whom are truly outstanding in their level of knowledge and expertise.  Professional development was stressed, and I had many good experiences with regard to travel."
good,Interesting place to work.  I think my experience with GD is too limited to this geographical location to comment on such a large company.
good,"helpful weekly refresher training, fast pace, back to back inbound calls, great opportunity for growth"
good,"Company provided many perks for the employees, allowed for a balanced work / home life."
good,"typical day at work is very fast paced, your getting inbound calls one after another with only a few seconds in between, you learn more about health insurance plans. Management is good here they'll work with you on some instances, hardest part of the job is actually locating the right information for the beneficiary,most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you help people."
good,Call center enviroment. Very informative on the services for what we worked on student loans and the proces. Structure place to work for.  Short time employed by the company.  Other position available.  Decent starting pay.  Not sure of continual pay rate.
good,"Typically I think of big corporations as being totally and completely disconnected or unconcerned with it's employees. However, this wasn't my experience with GDIT. Whether it was due to keen management or simply the unique assignments I was given, I can't say. Perhaps a little of both."
good,GD is a solid company but relies too much on reputation and should put more time into their people and what it is that makes people more satisfied with their jobs.
good,"General Dynamics AIS is a good company to work for, in that they are loyal to the productive workers. However, they are slow to adapt to changing times and markets. Doing government contracting makes most of the work stuck 10 years behind current technologies and practices."
good,GD Canada is a great place to work for junior to senior employees.They are very flexible when it comes to work/life balance.
good,"customer service representative, i would answer calls, enroll in medical plans and deal with personal information."
good,"Assign personnel for installation tasks"
good,great place to work. not a ton of job security but thats to be expected in defense contracting.
good,"Small and supportive team with effective leadership."
good,My experiences were overall good. There were times when things where more productive than others.
good,"General Dynamics is a big company with it's headquarters in North America.  It has various sites around the UK that offer different opportunities."
good,The mangement team did not seem to care for their employees very much.
good,"Its a workplace that requires a lot of training, empathy, and dedication. It has helped also in how I relate to people in general"
good,The hardest part is  Vangent Canada is no longer in the business anymore.
good,Same as Knight Networking although I worked as a Computer Operator.
good,Great opportunity for hands-on learning as well as online professional development.
good,detailing and setting up new and used cars for sale. a lot of time and hard work very fast pased at times. not a ton of managers everywhere your working with sales mostly.
good,"This organization produces a wide variety of work and is ISO-certified, so that production processes are efficient."
good,A great learning experience and enjoyed my co-workers. This was a atmosphere of positive people of being successful. 
good,"A typical day begins with me reviewing each e-mail thread from the prior day.  The project managers work in different parts of the country and will continue dialog via e-mail at various times of the night.  Next, I review all expenditures in a program called MPM, the homegrown budgeting tool used to satisfy the FAR.  Next, I export the data into an excel format and begin variance analysis for reporting to project managers.  Next, I will report any overruns & under-runs to the VP of accounting with forecasting suggestions.  The hardest part of the job was working with both the planning and accrual tools which did not talk to each other."
good,Take calls from Medicare beneficiaries about their Medicare health insurance. I have learned a great deal of patience while working for this company. They have an excellent management team. I would say the hardest part of my job is giving someone information they don't want to hear about their coverage or claim. The most enjoyable part is that I'm providing peace of mind to beneficiaries letting them know 1-800-Medicare is here to help them.
good,"GDIT is a large division of General Dynamics that bids for US government contracts to conduct information technology tasks for classified government programs."
good,Good place to work to start experience in insurance. Not a great place to stay tho.
good,"I do lots of work each day and meet with many people each week. The management isnt bad, but that depends per manager. Hardest part is a lot of work with low compensation and not much recognition."
good,Good Compensation and Benefits. Good learning experience
good,tranfer parts from plant to plant
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to help others in need in a timely fashion.
good,Very demanding and fast paced environment. Able to multitask very well.
good,Fair Good salary You have to do everything from Satcom down to desk top and phone to provide services for the customer
good,"typical day entails going in, sitting in a cubicle and working. management provides no support and does not open theirs ears to subordenents. chances for advancement only occur if you are located at headquarters. co-workers are the best part of the job. we all still make work somehow enjoyable and are all friendly and open. the hardest part of the job is working with management."
good,This job is like any other government contractor providing a service to the US Military. This job is high paced with very little room for error.
good,"I learned allot while there and the work was challenging. I was ready for a change of scenery, had an offer I could not refuse and moved south to a beach community."
good,I work with over 200 foreign and domestic offices on a daily basis in an effort to maintain the classified equipment located in these offices. I meet great people and form lasting relationships.
good,"I would say this job is not as professional. Its suppose to be a government job but it is not the best thing out here. They do have pretty good pay but the things that you have to put up with as far as not knowing what is next, how management is and the actual job its not worth it. I mean if you are really desperate for the job then it would be a good fit but I wouldn't say this is something you want to make a career out of."
good,"While this was a Temporary porject, I was able to build many professional relationships in my field and loved the experience"
good,The most enjoyable part of this job is talking on the phone to callers. Going home knowing that you were at least able to help one person that day.
good,Works as a Department of Defense government contract employee in alliance with Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) providing support with engineering services to assure altered and installed shipboard systems meet the United States Navy current and future fleet operational requirements.
good,"Good company. Nice people, professional..Good benefits."
good,"Not too challanging, days tend to be long. I've learned web based applications. Management and co-workers are relaxed and is sort of a free for all atmosphere with little or no supervision. Everyone works as a team and gets the job done but there are slow periods in between projects and if you're a contractor it's hard to get permanant employee status with benefits."
good,"working with engineers, government bodies and sub-contractors"
good,"Definitely learned to deal with difficult customers. Helping people with their healthcare plans and discussed health issues, claims and covered services. It was hard to tell people life threatening medications were not covered. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to the people andhelp them with very difficult issues."
good,"Dealt with some severe management at this company. Things are/have turned around, but slowly..."
good,"answering calls and questions for the customer, assisting them with whatever information I had available"
good,"Not many recent graduates, very segmented and fragmented in terms of workplace cohesion."
good,People are great to talk to and work with. Management is a tad bit lost. I have had 7 managers in 2 years and they lack proper leadership. No forward progression at Santa Clara.
good,"As with many larger companies, your experience is largely determined by who your manager is. The cutlure they bring to the the work environment shapes your experience."
good,Communication between management and employees was hindered due to offsite location of employees and management. The HR department was prone to making mistakes and eventually getting around to addressing your concerns. Not very prompt.
good,Minimal human comforts and only competitive pay for good benefits
good,"Budgeting, forecasting burn rate analysis and variance analysis"
good,I loved the job but because of the work load I was not able to stay.
good,There are interesting projects to work on and quality engineers who are talented and willing to mentor. It is a large company so dealing with the management bureaucracy can be difficult at times.
good,"Trabajo bajo presion con mucha gente derechohabientes manejo de equipos de computo, impresoras, pads, scanners. Buen ambiente de trabajo trabajo en equipo, revison de documentacion personal federal."
good,I feel like one of the last men standing 36 years great place to work until the last few years disappointing watch them downsize after downsize. I watched many very good people be downsized I felt like I lost a member of my family. That was the hardest part. But I learned and learned each and every day.
good,"After a recent acquisition, the Civil and Health division is now under the acquired company's leadership, so it is hard to tell where things will end up."
good,"Good place to work. Learned how to help effectively. Management was adequate. The most difficult obstacle is maintaining composure when a person is being aggresive but, what your reward is solving the problem with gratitude given by those who turn agressive."
good,Vangent era una exelente empresa lastima que haya desaparecido
good,Received calls for the U.S. 2010 census. Addressed concerns as well as checked information given.
good,"A typical day at work may have me doing anything from shipping and receiving to placing an order for materials,equipment, hazmat or services to be preformed on equipment. I am also in charge of the DRMO (disposal) for the office. The hardest part of the job is the constant change in different jobs and tasks and having to continuously refocus my attention on something different from what I was working on. The management leaves something to be desired, it is very uninvolved, very rarely if ever gives recognition and never gives bonuses or pay incentives. Much of this has to do with the way the contract is written and what is allowed in the way of funding but the company is large enough to independently compensate it's individuals for work well done. The best part of the job is the work environment and the crew that I get to work with."
good,Take a high volume of calls about student loans billing and general information. Co-workers for the most part are friendly but turn over rate is extremely high.
good,Outstand standing group of people to work with mainly because we all were formal military.
good,Good management team. Structure of its business focus is undergoing some change.
good,"Vangent is unique in that it deals strictly with customer service; no sales, collectiions, etc. That in itself makes the job lower stress and more enjoyable. Depending on what contract you work on management is a little skewed and its difficult to find a straight forward chain of command but over all they do value their employees and attempt to support them to the best of their ability. However, there is a over focus on finances and it cost cutting does effect the lower level staff."
good,Continual layoffs tiring. There is some drama on the project I work which causes a great deal of problems relating to the quality and the efficiency of the software development process.
good,"As long as there is a strong Government contract, this is a great place to work."
good,"Challanges, problem solving everyday. Flex Hours, Benefits, Learned new supply chain management processes. Meeting a large diverse of people."
good,Good place to work. Good benefits and have to work some weekends.
good,Being a part of General Dynamics allows for growth. There are numerous opportunities if you would not mind relocating.
good,My only complaint is serious. Some of the supervisors were HORRIBLE and their supervisors and HR did NOT care. I loved the work and did my job right but it was clear all they card about was length of calls. Who cares if it was right it not? Mostly not supervisors.
good,Worldwide company with locations everywhere. Classified materials are all over so discretion is extremely important. No social media or posting anything about the company. Several departments and several functions from Human Resources to Manufacturing.
good,"I enjoyed my fellow co workers and my supervisors. As for the company owners, i never met them. They seemed to not be around. Long as the numbers came back good they didn't care. However i didn't enjoy sitting around all day taking phone calls."
good,This is a great place to start your career in Customer Service. Great stepping stones for learning and leadership. Flexible hours for students and persons with families
good,"The job is easy. It was mostly enrolling people in heathcare plans and discussing benefits. The workplace is very restrictive and not very fun. The employees are rude and will claim racism if they are corrected on deficiencies. They are not receptive to constructive criticism or action plans and will call Ethics Hotline anytime they are coached. The only way for a person to conduct business in that environment is to ignore them and just keep your head down. This is why most reviews will say ""rude employees"". Because they are allowed to get away with anything and will be quick to claim racism, even in unfounded situations. It makes the supervisor back away and become fearful of reprisal."
good,"It’s a stable job , call centers are stressful that’s all really everything else was good. Everyone was nice, management was okay. there was a lack of people who could help out when you were stuck on a call, but they tried their best. I liked their benefits, besides their insurance that sucked!"
good,"Good place to work. Workplace culture is based on time served, instead of being performance based. Not much as far as career development. Parking situation is bad."
good,Some of the managers were very unprofessional. The grading system for the calls was too harsh. It is a stressful job and that should have been taken into consideration.
good,It was a contracted position.  You have to be a self managed person but the remote work and freedom to create your own schedule was great! Direct supervision was great!
good,Very relaxed work environment with Healthcare.gov starting in 2014. It was a growing experience to grow with the company. The training was extensive and ongoing and the company cared about their employees
good,Started at Interactive Media which was bought by Anteon which was bought by General Dynamics. The workplace culture became more cold with each buy out and medical benefits receded. My project was small and consisted of a small group of developers. The personal interaction and team environment made work enjoyable.
good,Would arrive to the work site and just start my day.  Management did not always have to come around to check on your work progress unless you gave them a reason to.  Kept us informed on what was going on with the contract to the best of their abilities.
good,Good place to develop career. Opportunities to move around within. Encourage job hopping within company. Many older developed employees who are a good resource.
good,"Good place for someone who like a call center environment. Opportunities to work from home. Stressful, repetitious, and robotic feel. Highly structured. Lack of freedom on the floor. If you work last shift you get off at 45 minutes past your scheduled time off. More pay if insurance is not accepted."
good,"Fast pace teaching environment that is constantly changing. YOU have to STUDY, study, study. A very competitive place to work in. Benefits are great! LUCK"
good,Ok place to work. Friendly people and flex schedule with remote opportunities. TDY opportunities and team mentorship. Advancement opportunities based on your individual performance
good,"This is a wonderful place to work. The staff is amazing and so are the customers. I love working here, there is never a dull moment. I have learned so much."
good,"Culture is not applicable as I work remote."
good,"I found this position on indeed and the interview process was nice and quick. Benefits are really good and there is a work life balance. Only issue is they were not completely honest about the job and its duration. They specified the contract was for 2 years and that was the time I was expecting, but my project on the contract was less than 1 year which they did not explain fully. They do try to find you other positions, but many of them are in Maryland, DC, or Virginia since that is where they are located. If you are not trying to move to those locations you will really have a hard time finding other positions in the company. I live in Texas and do not wish to move back east and there aren't many remote work positions available as well. Also the company requires that you already have some form of security clearance. Many contracts they have will require you to have one which sucks because I assumed the company was going to help you get clearance so you can work those contracts."
good,would be nice if we were offered 2-3 day shifts rather than 4 hours every day.  2X10 would be awesome.Some of us would like to work weekends only as we have full time shifts during the week.
good,Unbound calls are mad. Lots of calls all the time to keep you busy. No time to get bored. Multicultural environment with fun activities to enhance it.
good,Very interesting work and some good people.  Also very distant from other companies and industries.  The culture is very strong with pride in the work and also some very negative sentiments.  EB is undergoing a massive change that is needed.  The management is pushing organizational change but managing that change to not hurt production.  No shortage of growth potential here for motivated intelligent people.  However the challenges from a slow moving and stubborn operation are very real.
good,Overall a good company to work for.  There is a lot of restructuring taking place at the organization. More of the positions available are outside of the Coralville area.
good,"The work place is very stressful environment, they would be so hard on the employees, the job itself was stressful dealing with consumers then the employer had you on a ticking time bomb stress stress stress"
good,"There are good days and bad days. Consumers can be very rude at times."
good,"Bad pay, they keep hiring bad people, and never got a pay increase not even cost of living. I fact we where told that we would never see a pay increase. How ever the management did work with you when it came to family situations, and sick leave."
good,"Great place for flexible/remote work and for meeting smart people; a few different locations; engaged leadership. "
good,I would recommend GDIT for someone just starting out within a call center environment. This job will equip an individual in the knowledge and experience in how the a call center environment is like.
good,I've been working for this company for 9 years .I enjoy working with new people through the year. I enjoy the incentives during Open Enrollment Period as well as the different activities. There is room to grow if you that advantage of the opportunities. I participate in focus groups with upper leadership to get a better understanding of their job. The hardest thing about this job as well as any job when you get a rapport with you agents and you have to end the employment or if they fail you feel like you not doing enough.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to do remote work.  The flexibility adds much to the work/ home life balance many companies are seeking in today's work environments.
good,depending on what supervisor and/or team you get will depend on how your attitude will be at work. paid vacay is two weeks and you get it after you make a year really didn't pay attention to the benefits because I'm young with no kids so all i care about is the money
good,"General Dynamics is a middle of the road kind of company.  They're medical insurance is not that great, but it appears a lot of bigger companies are moving towards only offering high deductible plans.  Their dental is decent.  For starting off, their vacation/sick pay is decent.  You get 40 hours in your account immediately, that has to be used by the end of the year, and you accrue another 2 weeks and 3 days over the year, on top of standard holidays.  Their systems are outdated/slow, which is frustrating when you sit in front of a computer all day.  They don't seem to be interested in process improvement.  If you're looking for a job where you can work 40 hours and be done, with middle of the road pay, then this is for you."
good,"This General dynamics site is filled with lots of friendly people who generally care about their position. Starting off your typical work day includes badging in, logging into a stations and preparing your desk top for the first call, logging out of breaks and badging out at the end of the day."
good,Many times there was not any orders from customers. So I would help in the warehouse kitting parts. I would help the shipping department too when I was free.
good,"Management was fine, but employee morale seemed to be low on the priority list. A lot of emphasis on numbers, not enough (in my opinion) on the people that made those numbers happen."
good,"trains new employees and existing employees with new skills, meeting my SLA, and making sure that I help all the bilinguals so they performed in a good way."
good,"You have to take tests and pass it with a 80 average. if you don't you are out of there, they don't care if you were the earliest or most respectful. They don't care if you didn't cheat like everyone else.. "
good,"It was a good place to work, worked with many people who had a lot of knowledge and I learned a lot of things."
good,"Enjoyed working for my company but the company's loyalty was not the same as my loyalty to company.  After 23 years of employment, company did not find support once contract expired."
good,Working with people in healthcare you heard a lot of horror stories that would break your heart. Pay was good if you could handle the stories you heard of people not being able to get medication or services they needed
good,"In the world of process improvement, it is very difficult to make changes.  That is no reflection on GD but more on the process.  I much prefer the commercial world!"
good,Had to park a mile away and took a shuttle in to the workplace due to parking issue at Groton Campus.  Culture of the workplace was stressful due to high workload.  Most of the work was paper-pusher that provided little career growth in the long term.  Had to work the days between Christmas and New Year while other defense companies paid this time off.  Had to clock in the hours daily using a timecard machine for both hourly and salary.  Below average benefit package.
good,"Its always busy, no cellular devices are permitted. Hardest part is requesting time off. This would be a good job if you're starting off as a Customer service rep."
good,Good place to work if you like to travel and stay away from home for extended periods of time. They like to keep you on the road all the time they just don't value family.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of reviewing work orders for the day, assuring product schedule for shipping is completed by 3:00pm and address any non-conforming product that made it to final inspection."
good,"It was ok at first but since everything is scripted we all sounded like robots, there was not any room to personalize. We all had to say the exact same thing"
good,Durning my employment there I did enjoy the work as well as the people . We had on site training which was very interesting lasted about 3 and a half weeks. Being that this was a contracted job with uncertainty of how long it would last it showed and taught me that I was capable of handling stress in the work place as well as balancing the time I've put there and my family. The hardest part of the job was when we had to deal with website issues due to it crashing on a daily from enrolling new members into insurance plans. Besides that I enjoyed my job and the difference I made with making sure families that didn't have much money find affordable insurance. I wish the contract didn't have to end due to the the company moving out of Texas but it has taught me a very valuable lesson that I tend to take with me to the next employer that decides to hire me.
good,"Vendors would come and sell lunch, usually good food and variety. People who were promoted were usually promoted through favoritism or who they knew before others. Adherence to your schedule is stressed."
good,"Overall great place to work.  Political views stopped upper management from making correct decisions to allow growth in Waco, Texas area 60% of the employees deserved the chance to grow."
good,The occupation of an inbound customer service representative demanded fast paced learning while attaining knowledge involving The Affordable Care Act and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
good,This is a really good job. Competitive pay. Good environment. Very strict on time constraints and no flexibility. Must stay put for 8 hrs a day and sometimes very boring with someone always looking over your shoulder.
good,"Everyday was definately hard work but at the same time even when we worked hard, none of the work we did was actually very hard just tedious. Talking to customers and getting cursed out on a regular basis while also being graded on how we assess the situation keeps you busy"
good,"When I first took the job with GDIT, I didn't know what to expect. After several months, I realized that it was from the end user database that I was working with. It was a typical day at work."
good,Back to back calls during busy season. Slow and boring during the rest of the time. Strict adherence and short lunch breaks. You don't get paid if you take time out to go to the bathroom. Not flexible. Not enough paid time off.
good,"Good benefits. The environment could have been better. Rules should be followed by all management, so that everyone is on the same page. The best part of the job was training new hires and seeing them exceed."
good,"Assisting customer and management, creating SOP's, training new team members. Set up VTC for customers and create accounts. Monitor the queue, answer phones update tickets in remedy,"
good,"Call center just is not an ideal place for certain people. I am one of those, I need to feel like I have earned my pay check. If you don't mind sitting all 8-9  hour of your day then maybe this is the place for you."
good,I learned about quality management. Learning to carefully review my work output. The hardest part of the job was to learn about lack job promotion within the company.
good,"Whatever you do, do not work in Webchat. I used to like my job until they moved me to Webchat, after that, my performance went down. I have never seen management so eager to fire their employees."
good,i liked the job i just didn't like the way my schedule was set up. and i didnt like the way manegment ran the day to day operations. but overall it was a decent job
good,"They give you good benefits, they also have a good attendance policies. They also give you bonuses for getting good CSATs, coming to work during OEP days and having a good scorecard."
good,"General Dynamics is a good company to work for, but there are too many cooks in the kitchen. The rules change from one moment to the next, if they are followed at all. There is a very negative atmosphere, making it an almost hostile environment to work."
good,"As with most publicly held company the shareholders profit is the driving factor in business. This, along with political correctness, made working there a drag sometimes. Pay and benefits were okay but both were stagnant or declining.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the hands off approach from management. In my area of expertise I was able to learn a lot."
good,this is a very good paying job but it takes time from family depending on the shift you work but it also has good benefits for the employees
good,"The environment is very depressing at times, the days drag on. However have great health benefits. They don't really do much for the employees."
good,"Good pay, high deductible insurance plans only, only get 2 weeks PTO per year,you want more vacation you can ""BUY A WEEK"" and they will actually take it out of your paycheck. "
good,To be honest i can't stand this job there's favoritism no one helps you its all about that paycheck. When i quit i did OT and they split my check making me not get all the OT pay i worked for! but this job is for the young 18 yr olds that need to make 12/13$ an hour fast you have to teach yourself unless you truly have a good trainer for those 6 weeks
good,I enjoy my position as a payroll specialist. This company has given me the opportunity to enjoy a wonderful career that I have chosen for a life time.
good,"As with any corporation there are communication barriers between entry level workers and management. My only complaint is that the standard CSR's are held to is quite astringent, i.e.: any quality score below 90/100 is unacceptable and more than two calls below this threshold within 30 days results in disciplinary action as opposed to furthering the training knowledge of the offending CSR. The process means well, but leaves far too little room for improvement while information, resources, and procedures continue being updated."
good,The company is a great company. The management is kind and very helpful. The atmosphere is fun and fast paced. I really enjoyed my job when I was able to help people.
good,"I loved working with GDIT other than the lack of stability for long term growth. The employees never knew month to month when the Bogalusa, La location was going to be closed down."
good,A department of defense company that is a great place to work. The management in my department micro-managed. That was their leadership style. The company kepy you informed as much as possible .
good,"Electric boat was a long commute, early mornings, which resulted in long days with little rest. As a union job, i felt as though i had an important role on a team making parts for our military."
good,"Marketplace customer service for healthcare plans, 1095 forms, and appeals. 24 hours inbound call center with opportunity to grow in different areas of marketplace, medicare, supervisor, and escalations. Good place for young individuals coming out of high school and are in College. For more experienced individuals it would be good for upper management."
good,Worked as a customer service rep in marketplace during open enrollment period very high call volume signing people up for insurance through the affordable health care act
good,The only reason I didn't care for the job is because of the people I had to deal with on the phone. You get yelled at a lot for things that aren't your fault and also for things that you have no way of fixing.
good,good benefits and retirement 401k. allowed to get a lot of work hours. weekend work was optional. labor union had your back.
good,great work place friendly co-workers good hours great location lots of travel good managers no hard work all around nice place to work
good,Travel a lot different daily challenge's from upper Commanders to Mechanics. Always on the go to keep the equipment up for the soldier and having to write reports and give presentations about what's the status of the equipment.
good,Fun place to work and great management staff  how ever there was not a big opportunity for growth in our division and I am looking for more stability and security.
good,"Good place to work, with a great set of people to work with. Education benefits to get required certification. Good work schedule."
good,"General Dynamics was located offsite, an estimated 6 miles from the Joint Program Office and therefore, was not always abreast of the daily atmosphere at the JPO.  For management and leadership contractors were under the direction of government employees.  I had no coworkers because my manpower budget was consistently too small.  The hardest part of my job was obtainng timely completions on financial, logistics or program requirements from other workcenters. The most enjoyable part of my job was the camaraderie between vendors, analyst and engineers."
good,"limited room for advancement which leads to bad office politics"
good,I learned how to use different programs while assisting customers with their concerns. The most enjoyable part of my job is to deliver great service and help the customers with their issues at hand.
good,Full day was answering phone calls. Helping consumers choose the best insurance plan for them. Also assisting them with the choosing process from their own computers.
good,"I have been employed by General Dynamics as a csr for almost four months. I have been in training almost two of these months. I enjoy assisting consumers by researching information to answer their questions. The work is gratifying."
good,"General Dynamics is a good company to work for if someone is seeking advancement or not.  There are many opportunities to climb the ladder and if someone just would like to keep their current position, they may do so indefinitely.  The rules are hard to get used to at first, but after time, one gets used to them.  I have learned a great deal about Medicare and the insurance process and I am glad to have the experience."
good,"I learned to deal with multiple personalities , be responsible for others personal information. ive always liked working with others. I think the hardest part of the job would be not having all the answers to provide to them"
good,This is a challenging environment.  Co-workers and teammates work to get the job done and on time.!  There was strong team cohesion in the office I worked.  It  may the job good to come  to.
good,"Due to the size of General Dynamics it would be impossible to get a good idea of all the possible environments one could work at there. Mine was originally a smaller company bought by a larger one, then bought by General Dynamics. We probably did not work the same as other sites."
good,I always had longer calls than most. Which makes my daily scores low. I had to figure out how to get the people off the phone call in a quick manner. I would rather work and be accurate and knowledable to the consumer. Than to rush them through for points...
good,"My typical day at work is either super busy or incredibly slow. However for the most part you are expected to take care of yourself. They do keep track of everything you do with an electronic big brother system, but there is no one standing over your shoulder. They do provide excellent support for the staff and decent training to make sure you are never at a loss to know how to handle a situation. Little interaction between co-workers since you are set up into cubicles and on the phone most of the time. The hardest part of the job is managing difficult consumers and the downtime. When it is slow, it is really slow. Since it is a secure work environment you aren't allowed to take anything with you and your not supposed to memorize work reference material because it changes too often, so you are left with hours of nothing to do but stare at the clock."
good,Valuble internship for an engineer early in their carrer. I was fun going down to the ship yard on 32nd street and doing walk throughs on the ships.
good,Fast paced inbound call center where one had to be knowledgeable about computer and what you were selling. The most enjoyable part of the  job was hearing satisfaction in the consumers voice at the end of the call. The work environment was nice and so were the co-workers.
good,"Nice first internship experience"
good,"Beginning early morning 6am to 2:45pm I was in charge of shadowing over the hot worker (welder/electrician) to prevent possible fire. I had to carry a CO2 or water tank into tight spaces either on or below the ships. The job consisted of hard mostly men who did labor work. I enjoyed learning and memorizing how to find spaces of the boats. I learned different traits such as welding, pipe fitting, painting and ship cleaning. The hardest part about this  job was conquering my fear of heights and being in tight spaces."
good,take calls from consumers that request assistance completing applications for health insurance. answer questions about health ins.
good,"Great office job, great benefits. A typical day is a 8 hour shift managing a high volume of calls. What I have learned from this company is how to understand people better and how to provide peace of mind and also provide a good service. The most enjoyable when you first come in and take that first call the second part of the day is lunch."
good,Management was great. I enjoyed working with everyone in different fields. Work environment was great and I enjoyed working overtime.
good,"I learned a lot with this company. My co-workers were all very friendly, but very gossipy. Management was not very good or consistent. Our team got worked around a lot and we never knew who to actually report to. The hardest part of the job was working for the Obama care because a lot of very angry and mean people called in all the time. Another very hard thing was the software provided. It often stopped working and we would end up having to things 5 or 6 time before it would actually went through, with angry people on the other line it was very difficult and very time consuming. They should fix their software so it is easier on the employee and consumer. And the most enjoyable part were the paychecks"
good,My typical day at work included helping people with their health insurance. I learned many things about the NGD which is the program they use. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help people when they was in serious need.
good,Great company with lots of potential for career development and advancement. There are flexible hours/days. There is constant change. Any individuals who can handle constant change and a fast paced call center environment should enjoy working here.
good,"It's an ok place to work, no structure from a management standpoint."
good,"I worked with a small but friendly team in HR. My main responsibilities were to follow up on making sure all forms for new hires, existing employees of our SBU, and terminated employees were completed and signed by the right folks within relevant periods of time. I learned about formal processes and procedures for proper HR and time keeping systems. I enjoyed working for the boss I had as she provided positive reinforcement and showed appreciation whenever I could make her day a little easier. The hardest part of the position would be tracking down signatures from managers on new hire forms when a new large contract came in. But I enjoyed the consistent nature of most of the day-to-day that still allowed for personal growth and recognition."
good,It was a good paying job but it was only temporary. It didn't give you time to advance.
good,"Good place to work sold to General Dynamics, co workers were always very friendly. Assisted callers with health insurance information."
good,The company is nice and the work is good but the benefits aren't that great. The people are pretty nice as well.
good,"On a typical day at work, I am expected to be punctual. I use direct method to assist the consumer in gaining health insurance. I learned to deal with unhappy consumer by being optimistic."
good,I loved the technical engineering project to I was about to work on. The company has retained very smart engineers and has enjoyed a legacy of great products and systems.
good,"It could be more room for advancement, and the pay could be better for the amount of time spent with the company."
good,I love working there I didnt like my site I was at but overall this is a great and wonderfull company
good,A typical day as a quality specialist is come in get everything loaded and listen and grade calls. It's really a fun job and I have alot of support from my leads and managment.
good,"Bonne horaire de travail,peu d`opportunités de travail."
good,"Great place to work over all, good pay, professional environment. Unknown job security, such as unannounced lay-offs. Non-negotiable schedules. Very mentally tiring job."
good,A typical day at General Dynamics is half exciting and half boring. I have gained a lot of patience by working with this company. My co-workers are awesome. The hardest part of the job is informing people they do not qualify for a subsidy for health insurance. The most enjoyable part of the job is communication with different people everyday.
good,"I really like this company, but as with any company that deals with government contracts employment can be a revolving door."
good,"As a Quality Specialist, I monitored and coached Customer Service Representatives on the information that they provided to the consumer as well as their customer service. My co-workers are more like family; we are still a team even though our work is set individually. The most enjoyable part about work is working with the people and knowing that your job is to help others succeed."
good,"This company has the right mindset, but does not keep its employees in the loop. The company is paper free, so I hope you aren't a writer. There are no raises given, yet you can advance to a different job title. Management may not always look out for the employees best interest if it conflicts with there own job, but they may be able to point you into the right directions."
good,"A typical day at work began by walking my area and greeting my team members. Then checking their schedules and tracking their attendance. Then checking timecards for the previous day to ensure accuracy and making sure everybody entered their time for that day. During the day, there are meetings with managers and calibrations for calls that were taken. Trainings are a done each week. My co-workers are very professional and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was firing or terminating employment when necessary. The most enjoyable part of the job was coaching and developing my subordinates and watching them thrive and succeed in their jobs and moving up within the company."
good,General Dynamics Information Technology is a large company with many employees. They have  different departments ranging from Homeland Security to Health and Civilian Services. There is opportunity to apply for any job within the company with a wide variety of locations thus making it easy to move up or better oneself. A typical day at work is involves diverse job functions. I have learned how to be a positive and effective manager and leader in the time that I have been employed with the company. The hardest part of the job is having to terminate employment of an employee. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling accomplished when one of my CSRs succeeds in their job and being a part of their success.
good,Ran support for the USAF force and logestic warehousing.  Good people to work with but contract was not stable.
good,nice place to work didn't know what was going on from one day to the next
good,"Great people, bad timing.  The industry is very cyclical and is heading down right now due to defense cuts.  I recommed the employer when the market is good but not at this time.  Compensation is good with the company overall, although the Texas location is lower than average.  The ability to advance depends on who you know but that's similar to many companies.  It's a large company so advancement can take time and patience."
good,"The pay was good here, and the benefits, but the people were a little snobby and not very kind at all."
good,General Dynamics was the first post-military employer I worked for. The overall experience was a positive one. I would work with GD again in the future.
good,Great place to meet new people and learn about healthcare. An eight hour day of answering phone and providing medicare beneficiaries with important information.
good,GDIT offers competitive starting salaries. The task I worked on was extremely busy.  This is do mostly to government cuts forcing more work on individuals.
good,Worked in a satelite group in Pittsburgh where the main group was in Westminster.  Good challenging wirk.  Good people to work with.
good,There are lots of knowledeable coworkers and various projects that allow one to learn many different things if one is allowed to transfer between the projects.
good,co-workers are great and management is great...no job security and very little chance for advancement
good,"They pay for your health insurance and have standard business hours. Just keep to yourself and its all good. Oh and hope u have a car u can leave ur cellphone in. They want to lure u into becoming a claims rep citing its a pathway to a raise. Dont get it twisted, until that position is offered, u get no raise. U cannot take that training to another company."
good,"Good pay and benefits, I would still be there but our contract came to an end and there were no other jobs available at the time."
good,I enjoyed going to work each day. The hardest part was listening to some of the Medicare beneficiaries life stories and not being able to help.
good,"General Dynamics is a great company to work for. Not immune to difficulties of the defense industry, there are some hard times ahead."
good,Early meeting to ensure everyone remembers to be safe and work as a team. Well known by co-workes and willing to work together and completing a job assigment.
good,General Dynamics just needs to be a little more forthcoming when and transparent when it comes to hiring of contractors.
good,"I enjoy working for Vangent/GDIT. The only concern I have is job security. It seems the company has many different ways to ensure a short term position, no matter what. If the temo-contract and the micro managing were gone the comany would be awesome to work for and I don't think i would ever miss a day of work."
good,You get to interact with people on a daily basis. Co-workers are friendly and management. There is always something to do.
good,"General Dynamics was a people orientated company, where they treated the employees first. My job was a 3rd shift position monitoring a NOC system. There basically no one to interact with except my partner (he was great), but the job interfered with mine and my wife's personal lives."
good,The company is large and somewhat impersonal but does well for its size.
good,"Management did not discuss, promote, or offer any type of advancement, raises, etc. Management lacked communication skills to make the job rewarding or challenging."
good,"A typical day at work was essentially 8 hours of the phone, receiving back to back phone calls from callers age 65 and up, six seconds apart."
good,"During my tenure with this organization,most of the individuals that I had to opportunity to work with were highly knowledgeable in their areas of expertise. The benefits at General Dynamics were second to none. Given the modern day complexities regarding benefits at that time during my career, General Dynamics benefits program (s) were among one of the best in the industry."
good,"General Dynamics was a good learning experience for me. Economically,  however, I found other companies willing to pay me more for the same work, so I made the best decision for me."
good,"My site project manager was fantastic; always responsive to questions and suggestions (even if he didn't go with it). "
good,"The experience i’ve had with general dynamics was quite challenging, but in the end all worth it. Although, there may be a few problems with the environment"
good,Working there is a great learning curve but the balance between life and work is hard especially with the security and the policies. If you don’t have a dependable support system and never really miss work working there can be hard.
good,GD Pittsfield is really in need of change management. The supervisor of recruiting shows evidence of completing the Lou Grant School of Business. Old school approach and the team always felt under the gun.
good,"Was a good place to work, then company relocated. This location now only makes the larger physical antennas, and the movable satellite dish controllers for the military, which is also soon to be moved to AZ."
good,"This was a great company to work for as a single mother, being able to work from home.  The pay was very competitive, and had a very flexible schedule.  Great bonuses and great management."
good,"I had two jobs while working at GDIT. I took 1-800-Medicare calls and then took I.T. calls.They both had their idiosyncrasies good and bad. "
good,"Great people to work with. Pay and benefits were worth it. Tons of different work schedules. there were some managers who were not the nicest but as long as you did you work it was fine,"
good,Starting out this job was more relaxing. I'm trained in both Marketplace and Medicare. This job has made me more social and professional. It has great benefits as well as discounts. Overall its a great experience.
good,"You come in, clock in and immediately get to work. You have two 15 minute breaks and a half hour lunch. They expect you not to have issues when someone is calling you names and making fun of you while working. I have PTSD when I get yelled at and the only two people who cared about it was my supervisor and her manager. No one in HR understood. When I get too upset I get sick, they did not care. I had to be there and if I missed a certain amount of time I would be fired."
good,"The job is easy, paid training, as much time off or overtime as you want (within business parameters), paid holidays, paid time off."
good,Working here has not been Awesome.  I don't even feel like an employee.  I feel like I'm employed by the contract and GDIT is merely the one who gives me a check.  Not very rewarding or challenging...
good,"Fast-paced project with equipment supplier being the customer. A lot of time spent ""scrubbing"" sites and dates. Numerous obstacle to over-come in order to complete project."
good,General Dynamics is a great place to work if you have good customer service and communication skills.  You talk on the phone and assist consumers with their issues regarding their health insurance. You get three breaks a day (One 30 min lunch & two 15 min breaks). The job can be stressful because you get tired of sitting at a desk all day talking on the phone and most of the time the consumers are rude with a few nice people on the calls. I would recommend moving to an off the phone position not long after starting employment there.  Staying on the phone will take it's toll on you everyday overtime.
good,Was a good place to work but it was to hot and fast paced on the weld line and they had quotas for each day that were hard to get if you had a problem on line.
good,"If you can handle the un-professional people that work there, it's a good job. Do your job and go home and you'll be okay. Training is long and boring but it's paid so that is a +."
good,The personnel at the facility in Pittsfield provided outstanding leadership at the Section Manager level. The Section Manager allowed for cross-functional training.
good,Contracts are not always stable.  Can be dropped (laid off) while waiting for clearance leading to effective loss of clearance.  Very little advancement opportunity and very little outside training.
good,"job was very friendly and comfortable to work in,  call at times were constant and at other times very slow. During peak times there is no room for anything but the phones and constant calls"
good,"JOKE! It’s actually a fun and easy job! However management is a total joke who cares about NO ONE but themselves and how THEY can get ahead, not you. They do not care about your advancements in the work place, only theirs! You’re basically told when you can and can not go to restroom! You also have one 30 minute lunch and two fifteen minute breaks"
good,I worked at General Dynamics for less than a year as a parts inspector.  There was a strong union environment and I didn't want to belong to a union. I found that I did not like the work environment of a factory assembly line and left when I got the opportunity to go to work for the FAA.
good,"The job at general Dynamics was great pay, but they didn't want to be flexible enough to change my schedule around and that was reason for leaving. They paid $11.39 and hour so the pay was good and acceptable. It was very unfortunate that they couldn't work with me to change my schedule."
good,"Overall a good place to work, management and moral has been declining over the years. It was very team orientated. Very results driven, so everyone knew what they needed to achieve everyday."
good,"Its quite, you may fall asleep. You set to yourself not close to anyone making phone calls it gets very tiring, not a job for a fatigue mommy to be thats for sure."
good,Enjoyable place of employment with excellent benefits.  Many options to enhance job knowledge. Many team players involved on multiple projects. Opportunities to learn about defense
good,"A typical workday at General Dynamics consisted of taking inbound phone calls each day to help consumers with the enrollment of health insurance and or answering any general health insurance questions that they may have. I can say have learned so much while working with General Dynamics. I've learned patience , sharpened up my communication skills, I've learned how to process situations so that if need be if there is a problem I can handle it sufficiently on my own while making sure the caller is comfortable and help build a rapport with the caller. The workplace culture At General Dynamics is very diverse. You will see a mix of different people from all over  some mainly from surrounding areas. There is no shortage of people to see and interact with while working at GDIT. One of the hardest parts of the job would be Open Enrollment season. this is because there is a substantial increase of phone calls that we receive during this time.This is because that is the only time of year that consumers are allowed to enroll into health coverage, make changes to plans, and report any changes to their household. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction that you felt after your successfully able to assist and help a caller to the fullest extent possible. Knowing that you helped someone who calls is such a gratifying feeling."
good,If your use to always moving around and being active on a job then this job isn’t for you. It’s hours of sitting and listening to people complain about their health insurance.
good,Very fast pace. Limited mobility. Sometimes stressful. I learned a lot about reading and finding scripts to help customer. Management was okay. Work culture very diversified. Hardest part of job is keeping your cool when dealing with angry customers. Most enjoyable part is when a customer is satisfied.
good,"Nothing too special for IT contracting. It depends on the DOD unit and the location that you are working for through GDIT. Some people like it, other people do not."
good,I worked here shorter than I anticipated  but overall it was a really good job. It was easy with the set days and set amount of hours to miss. Mondays are the worst days but after that the week is easy breezy.
good,"Though I was interested in working with the company for it's prestigious environment. It was only a very short contract and located in a very poor location. Had I had an opportunity in Virginia or another state, I'm sure my experience would have been greater. I was used to making more per hour."
good,"The company has unlimited potential and a lot of great people.  However, upper (corporate) management is more focused on internal customers than the external customers.  Processes are stagnant and are not agile enough in today's competitive business landscape."
good,"Inbound call center with Government Contract. You can work as many hours as you like, and they offer many options for time off as needed. Upper management is only concerned about meeting Government obligations and could care less about the skill level of the personnel they hire.  Turnover is high as expected from the job pool they pull from.  The job is not hard, but can be stressful at times. The best part of the job is when you successfully meet the needs of the customer and they are satisfied and happy with the results. The worst part of the job is the constant changing of teams and team leaders and supervisors. Constant moves from one team to another every few months."
good,"Extremely professional team-level leadership. Wonderful technical support from the company for creating and editing our deliverables to the customer.  i really enjoyed the relatively relaxed work environment.  Minus the stresses that come from the contracting environment, the company itself is quite pleasant and helpful.  I would recommend this company to anyone seeking a solid career as a contractor in support of a myriad of DOD clients."
good,"I liked the the position and the opportunity I was given. I was pushed hard to learn several new skills to meet the job requirements. They were great for my career however, there were more outside issues and overall company infrastructure issues at the time that led to my departure. The impending election and the companies involved in the contract made the climate suspenseful and frustrating."
good,fun and exciting place to work at. I just don't like that u have to change shifts every 6 months so to me it is some what inconstant. Other than that it is a good place to work
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and had good supervisor. I liked helping people and felt good about resolving their problems. Also liked the different trainings that are given to help employees reach their goals.
good,"General Dynamics provided me with my first job which was a great first professional opportunity. While working there, I got to gain an understanding of the Defense Contracting Industry alongside seasoned professionals. For someone who is looking to work in a younger more technological sound environment, this would not be the place for you."
good,They didn't want me to succeed. They knew I was enrolled in college and the changed my work schedule to evening shift and knowing I was attending night classes and was my last term. Pretty much told me to quit school and still have a job or stay in school and will not be employed with them anymore.
good,Can be stressful meeting budget requirements with little support from upper management.  OSHA safety regulations often slow down production but still expected to perform to company standard.
good,"Position isn't bad, but the company has an issue with just hiring anyone with a pulse, meaning the levels of quality shift from one agent to another, one supervisor to another ."
good,This company hires to meet government contract requirements and sometimes we ended up working with people who had no work experience. They only care about meeting numbers to keep the contract.
good,"Great company to work for, friendly environment, Great benefits. Its a great place to work for and gain experience. A lot of opportunities and there is room to grow."
good,"Answering calls to make sure everyone's health insurance is okay. Searching through the consumers profile to find out what is actually wrong with the insurance. Having to deal with angry consumers at times, but also calming them down to help and to get a better understanding"
good,"A typical day begins once you login to your work station. I view both calendars, trackers and email to see what work needs to be completed from the day before or what new work was assigned for the day. Once all work is complete I ask if any of my peers need assistance completing their work. I have learned a lot about healthcare and what it means to people that cant get it who really need it. I really like my manager but the hardest part of the job is getting a case to work and just not having the right tools to assist the consumer because we have to brainstorm and think of ways to try and resolve the issue. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually being able to assist a consumer with correcting their issue after its been messed up and hearing the consumer thank me for my help. I feel like I have accomplish my goal when the consumers are appreciative with the help I have provided."
good,"I loved working in the department that I worked in. My manager was the reason I enjoyed my work. He was fair, gave constructive criticism, and was an overall wonderful person to work with. Other departments that did not have a manager such as mine, the employees did not seem to be as happy as I was to work there."
good,"Workload is very questionable i have been layed off twice from there"
good,GD is a very solid company to work for. Very stable and strict environment. Good pay. Room for growth. Decent pay. Varies hours. I really enjoyed working for government contracts
good,The job was a great place to work at some of the people were fun some of them weren't also they're sick policy was not great when I got sick I could not work but I still needed to be hospitalized for 3 days for them to count it as a absent that was excusable
good,As a consultant.  I had to figure everything out for myself.  The problem is I still don't know what I don't know.  So every so often I find that I don't something I need.
good,Bath Iron Works was a great company to work for before they cut flex time and implemented a salary wage freeze. Before then it was a more relaxed work place where you could get your work done early if you needed to leave for an appointment. Now it is very strict with their core hours. You must be at work from 7-3:30 everyday or use your vacation time if you need to leave early one day no matter how much you have worked that week.
good,The turn over rate is very high. Management need more training to be able to manage properly. They need to be more people friendly to be able to retain employees.
good,"enjoyed the benefits and the people who I worked with, the pay is okay but you can always move up by training into other department, you also learn a lot about medical procedures."
good,No physical labor so was able to relax work at my own pace at times. If I choose I could take half the day off or if I needed to take the day off I could do so
good,Ok place to work benefits are goo but not all managers and people in higher position are always on the same page. There are to many shift bids and alot of people have children and changing schedules is not good.
good,A typical day at work was listening to coworkers picking on or talking about other coworkers or management. I learned that call centers are the messiest place to work and work will be un-enjoyable unless you have a strong sense of ignoring your surroundings. Management is NEVER around. When you need manager assistance prepare to wait a while for a response. Hardest part of the job was dealing with all the drama that is in that building. Only enjoyable part of the employment was the pay check.
good,"Fast paced, many responsibilities. Have to be able to multi-task and always be ready for changes. Must be able to keep up with policies and be able to adjust to change."
good,Gets very boring and there are countless ways to  get terminated. Training is great but doesn't allow hands on until you pass the test and if you fail 2 calls in one month then you could be fired
good,This work place allow me to learn more about medicare. Management was OK no to many accommodations. I was able to help a lot of the Medicare beneficiaries.
good,"The work can be hard, and much is expected of the individual but at the same time the satisfaction in being part of the complex creation  from nothing to reality is worth it."
good,"conception sur solidwork"
good,"Great place to work. Great trainers. Excellent benefits. Set schedules to take guess work out of planning. I loved helping customers with whatever issues they were calling about whether it be their plan was cancelled and wanted to know why or just had a baby and wanted to add them to their policy, or wanted to cancel benefits."
good,"The overall work and pay was good, however the supervisors and management were not, Whenever you might need help with something such as a technical difficulty with your computer or phone, you are never guarunteed that a supervisor or manager will be around to help you. In fact, it seems as though all of the supervisors are either sitting and doing nothing in the break room, or they are just walking all around the building. Management is getting paid a lot more, for a lot less work. However, the health insurance benefits were nice & the human resources team was very helpful when needed."
good,"Employees were available to wear ,clothing items such as sweat pants and tshirts,,  witnessing this allowed me to make a simple decision..."
good,"inbound call center for medicare handling customer accounts and researching claims contacting medicare contractors, and also assisting customers will billing and coverage inquiry."
good,"GDIT was a great, fun place to work, except for the fact that you are always ignored. Example: You would come to work, feel at home with your co-workers, and then whenever you encountered a system error, or you had an idea for improvement, you would not be listened to. "
good,"The benefits are not great but at least there are health, eye and dental coverage which is more than a lot of companies provide now days. Compensation isn't particularly competitive but the opportunities to learn and gain knowledge make working for this company worth it. Certain departments and teams have a great reputation and continue to win work. There is a lot of turn over and growth but employees that don't ask for/seek out recognition continuously are often lost in the shuffle. "
good,I worked 8 hrs daily taking incoming calls assisting customers with information regarding their health insureance. Some of the management was ok. The hardest part of my job was not being able to assist customer with other agency infomation. Talking on the phone to customers.
good,This is a good place to work as long as you work hard. You get what you give. This company is stable and a union shop with an aging work force.
good,"8 hour shift min"
good,"Structured work; manager good to work for; Company so large it was difficult to obtain required decisions."
good,Waiting for customer to call in service request. I've learned to be flexible due to ever changing policies and procedures.  Enjoy my co-workers. Hardest things about the job is the lack of work at times.  I enjoy my job the most when a unit representives are so happy that I have repair their equipment.
good,"A typical day at work would usually began by going in a little early and logging on to the computer, so I could have all of my important sites up that I would need during the calls I would be taking, including my email so if there was any updates that came threw while on the phone. I would also see if I had any scheduled training that I would need to do that day. I would then begin logging on to the phone, followed by going available. Usually I would receive my first call in less then 30 seconds.I would take calls for roughly 2 hours then I would have my first 15 minute break. Unless I had scheduled training's during that time. After break I would go available to take the next phone call that was routed to me. roughly 2 hours later I would get a 30 minute lunch break. After lunch I would go available for another roughly 2 hours. Then I would have my last 15 minute break. I enjoy having scheduled training and also the email so if we have extremely important messages that need reviewed immediately."
good,Great place for first time call center experience. Have to have patience to assist the elderly with accounts on a daily basis.
good,Place of employment didn't have competitive wages but nice people to work around. Would say that their was room for advancement also.
good,"Good company, with room to grow.  The work in fairly routine and typical call center supervisor duties, but very unorganized as a company."
good,"Some co workers are the reason to come into work, they are very loyal.  Hardest part of the job is the physical demand, and weather conditions mixed with certain work environments.  Management needs an upgrade as far as foremans and leadmen go.  Benefits are great if you have a family.  Advancement is hard to get within certain shops, because some supervisors base it off of how much they like you individually rather then basing it off of your work.  Job security is there and will always be there as long as contracts keep rolling in."
good,I was trained on how to communicate with consumer's on the phone as far as handling their situations about there health coverage.
good,"A typical day at work is, being at work on time and keeping up with your timed breaks and lunches. Answer phone calls back to back and provide basic helpful information that is already scripted for us to say while always being courteous and polite. The Hardest part of the job is keeping your phone calls under 7 minutes. Providing great customer service and resolving issues sometimes takes a little more than 7 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job is, knowing that you have helped someone with their worries or problems."
good,"I provided in depth troubleshooting for DOD networks and satellite communication links. The worst part of the job was the extensive travel to meet the government needs with little compensation in return. "
good,I watch schedule adherence as well as attendance. I help train my team to be the best they can be.
good,A supervisor who says they never thought you would make it far; then getting write ups when they know what’s happening. I loved the job and the people all around me I just didn’t need the main person that’s job was to show me and support me to down grade me any chance they had.
good,The staff was really nice and helpful. I enjoyed helping the consumers with their problems and finding solutions. The thing that I did not like was that the company did not stay with the contract that ended up with me without a job.
good,The insurance benefits for salaried employees are inadequate and very expensive.
good,"You are learning in a fast pace environment where you have to facilitate conversations positively. The position is sales without the pressure of trying to make commission. You have to know the products that the medicare advantage plan offers and keep the conversation moving forward toward getting someone to speak with a licensed representative. The hardest part is having to discuss many of our products to people who are not trusting of others. Callers can be very difficult at times and would prefer to be left alone. At this point, you would have to evaluate your strategy to just get the call completed before they reject any offer you may have."
good,"A typical day at work involves consumers calling in because they are unsure of a insurance selection, My job is to inform consumers about the insurance industry and provide knowledge that individuals are unaware of. I have learned to work in all kinds of situations, from handling upset or angry callers, To handling individuals that may just be calling discuss a problem they have came across with their coverage. I have learned that nobody can help you better than you can help yourself. I strive to provide my Co-workers with information that they may be unsure of and ALWAYS get along with Co-workers at all times. The hardest part of my job is to calm a consumer down that may be at their breaking point and convincing a consumer why it is important to have confidence and understanding of problems that occur with everything that may go on. Also, The most enjoyable part to my job has to be putting a smile on somebodies face that has ran out of patience."
good,"Learned that goverment work is very volatile. On an average wars are fought about every 10 yrs, so you need to plan for the drought when it happens."
good,I am a field Technician so when I get to work I check my emails and  with my lead to see what the work load will be for the day and then prioritize my work day from there. The hardest part of the job is the slow days finding things to do to stay busy. The thing I enjoy most is the team environment attitude we have here. we all accomplish more when that is the approach.

good,"Instructed counterintelligence investigations"
good,"Working for this company was an exerience that i have fund to enjoy. I loved to work with computers, and was able to learn the different types of approval ratings throughout the company. The hardest part was leaving the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being in a business/ casual setting. "
good,"Management is a little under trained to manage, but serving the medicare population can be extremely rewarding when solving their needs."

good,Provided Customer Service
good,This was a very good job. The pay was good and benefits were too. Got along with all of the employees and everyone was friendly. I learned manage my customer service skills because this was by far the most customer driven job I've had. The only downfall was having to talk to very distraught and sad customers on a daily basis. A lot of time people would call with questions and I would have to give them bad news about there medicare. It wasn't the funnest part of my job.
good,Day to day work is consistent and My supervisor was great. As I team lead I got to know majority of my co-workers. I enjoyed the team activities and competitions.
good,-Work was easy to understand
good,"GDIT is a great company with excellent pay, but the grind is never ending (which can be both good and bad) and there is never really any downtime.    The program that I am on does not get the same amount of leeway as some of the other programs that are under the same umbrella as ours. There are a lot of changes going on within the company; some good, some bad. The pay is excellent, but expect to work really hard in sometimes less than fair conditions."
good,"The hardest part of this job initially is adapting to the unusual shift schedule which is 7 days on, 4 days off, 7 days on, 3 days off. The schedule generally provides one actual weekend off per month."
good,"GDIT is a large company and is a successful company.  They have intelligent leadership and they are able to understand what is working and what isn't.  For this reason, my time was limited there.  Within a couple months of being hired to work on a government contract project, the company's leadership decided this was not a viable contract to continue forward with and ended the contract.  They don't drag out their decision making on these financial areas.  It's pretty black and white.  If your contract isn't performing as they expected, be prepared to look for another position because they are quick to stop the financial leaks in the business.   I respected their decision and was sad to leave this great company.  Unfortunately, I don't live in an area where there were many opportunities to work remotely or have a reasonable commute to transfer within the company."
good,"During the off times of the season the job was easy, however it was very stressful, during enrollment. Nighttime shift was easy and slower. It was harder to work during mornings it was back to back."
good,I have been with GDIT for almost a year now and I can honestly say that since day one our site lead has definitely fought for us the whole time. Day to day operations the atmosphere is fairly friendly. Anytime I may have a question she is either forthcoming with the answer or if she does not know the answer she will always point you in the direction of the person who may know.
good,"The training is 3 weeks(2 weeks of classroom, 1 week phones) I think training needs to be longer, maybe 3 weeks of classroom and 2 weeks on the phones."
good,A day at work was fun and challenging at the same time.  Days varied from very busy to slow at times. Overall a great place to work. Team work was great.
good,Relax call center that can be stressful and nerve wrecking dealing with the different emotions from customers. There's low call volume and a typical call last around an hour.
good,"It is a good company with many opportunnities. The supervisor are good, the coworkers are nice and helpful. There are many schedule options for morning, afternoon, and night shifters."
good,"GDIT seems like a good company but my pay and job responsibilities were dictated by the government customer. I find that GDIT tries to find ways to advance their contractors but are not as willing to fight for their employees as other companies. On the other hand, it is very easy to move around within GDIT once employed by the company, if you are able to do so."
good,"This is a good company to work for and offer flexible hours and benefits. A typical day is supervising trained Customer service representative and provide support throughout their day. I assist in helping them meet deadlines, coaching sessions, daily reports, and team meetings."
good,"I love working for the government customer and team but the management and knowledge of the admin field from my Program Manager could be a lot better. Also the leave accrual could be more. Being a 1st timer with the company, but having 10+ years experience in my job field, I wish I was given more days off a year then what I have now."
good,"The company was really a great place to work, they helped promote independence as well as task orientated skills, the management team was very hands on and well informed."
good,"best part about this job was earning sick paid leave, approved time off, earned time off, and holiday pay. every week that you don't have unapproved time off you earn time to take off and still get paid. its not that bad of a place to work, its pretty easy actually. you just help people apply for insurance and help them understand their insurance and any issues they may be having."
good,"Strict but fair policies due to the sensitivity of the material being handled. "
good,Work off site at a government facility so no real experience with the actual company atmosphere. The job is what you make of it. It's difficult to work at a gov't customer facility because the GDIT management doesn't see what you accomplish on a daily/weekly basis.
good,"Its a good job but the management needs work. Its a quick passed job, but it's manageable. As long as you do your job and have good attendance you will be ok."
good,Stringent requirements for time was a must.  Competition was encouraged and rewarded monetarily. Benefits were provided but not mandatory. The hardest part of the job was working with some of the more frustrated customers.
good,"My time at GDIT was enjoyable I was able to directly bring my hobby experience with wargaming, history, and model building, my experience as an Army officer, curiosity, and previous defense and entertainment industry modeling and simulation skills to bear on develop algorithms and tools used to provide faster than real time combat adjudication for large formations in the Joint Community."
good,"if you are looking to work for a company with good benefits, GDIT offers many, including 401k, sick leave, vacations are paid, life insurance. PTO hours"

good,"I love working and helping consumers over the phone, I do not like that we are very limited in area. Sedentary position and not able to walk around. I loved working there but very strict on adherence."

good,"The Benefits package is nice.  My co-workers are great to work with.  However, if you are not on a long term contract, it may not be the best location to work"
good,"The Army was interesting. I do apologize, but there isn't much I have to say about the organization. If I had a chance to do it all over again, I would only want to go to a different duty station"
good,"GDIT is a great place to work. However, it would be an even better place to work if the other employees would keep it professional."
good,I learned how to provide constructive criticism when monitoring the call center employees. The redundancy of the job position was difficult due to the lack of challenges it provided. I absolutely loved the people I worked with.
good,I assisted with the obama care marketplace under general dynamics information technology. The call center was very demanding with little to no options for majority of families who called for insurance.
good,"Very lenient and great place to work. It would help if more advancements would come about. Calls aren't always bad, some days they are better and some days they are worse. Co-workers helps you get through the day."
good,"a typical consist of taking calls, helping customers sign up and enroll in health care. management was more supervisory and coaching driven. we worked on a secure call center floor so conversation was limited, you didn't get to know your co workers."
good,I worked 40 hours per week. I learned everything you wanted to know about the Affordable Care Act. The hardest part of the job was that it was only temporary.
good,"I would take calls to enroll customers in Obama Care. I dealt with a whole variety of customers. The hardest part of the job was that I felt bad for some of the customers who would be crying because they couldn't make the monthly insurance payments. My coworkers were alright, the only think I didn't like was how most people only lasted a few weeks, I like to get to know my co-workers. "
good,"If you are looking for a fast paced environment and continually changing processes and procedures, You will enjoy this job."
good,"A typical day at general dynamics, I answer phones calls about Medicare , Medicare claims and Rx plans,"
good,"A typical day at work, I would speak to at least twenty five consumers. Approximately half of them would be able to enroll in coverage, and the other half would be calling about complaints or complications that needed to be resolved. I learned that communication is key, and in order to be a good communicator you have to know how to listen well to others in order to address the situation at hand in the  correct manner. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry consumers that were provided with incorrect or misleading information. I felt that the management was highly ineffective in carrying out certain tasks and procedures. I loved being around my co-workers, I was blessed with a great and friendly team. They were ultimately the most enjoyable part of my working experience at GDIT."
good,"Work day was repetitious, good co-workers, easy and enjoyable job."

good,"GDRS is a great company that is facing difficult times."
good,"As an illustrator a typical day was constantly jumping from one section to the other for the Stryker and Abrams tank technical manuals using Autotrol (TI), Photoshop and Vis Mockup programs. What I was able to take away from this opportunity was that I was able to enhance my Photoshop and VisMockup skills and knowledge to where I am no longer timid to work on these programs. I was able to do this with help from my co-workers whom never made you feel incompetent. They were always willing to help. Being an illustrator at times was pretty cut and dry, but the hardest part was remembering all the military standards that were changing on a daily basis which kept you on your toes."
good,"Pay was decent, benefits were excellent. The NET manager was a little off but he was eventually removed. "
good,"Big company that allows for a good benefits package and training."

good,"They were up to date on training, but seem to wait till bad habits were in place and then tackled or tried to. I had questions but at the beginning did not get much help from the Supervisors."
good,"You get 2 breaks for 15mins and 1 lunch break for 30mins. Scheduled and breaks times are inconstant for each day. People are very polite, nice to be around. Though working can be very draining as you are require to focus on finishing a call within 15 mins. Also dealing with 100's possibly more different issues that could come up."
good,"Supportive managers. Job can be stressful during certain periods of the year. Feel like some of the regulations are uncalled for, specifically the no paper at desk."
good,"Working for GD brought me into the healthcare lane. I learned about medical billing, medical claims, Medicare knowledge, and helped me better myself in the customer service part."
good,"To review GDIT would be like reviewing the US based on your experience in one town. The pay, atmosphere, hours, management is very localized so my experience does not carry much weight unless you are in the same office."
good,A solid company to work for with opportunity to grow. If you want a secure and upwardly mobile work environment then GDIT may be the the company for you.
good,"GDIT is a good place but you are not allowed to do anything when you are not taking calls but sit there ans stare at your computer or talk to people around you if there is any. Very strict place but the hours and pay is fair as well as the benefits. Would not personally recommend anyone to work here,"
good,"I liked working at general dynamics because I have always loved helping people and hearing the sound of happy medicare recipients made me feel even better, The hardest part about the job is hearing the sad stories that the elderly people was going through and I wasn't able to help them."

good,"GDIT has a wide range of positions and contracts making them a trusted and strong company to work for. However, raises, bonuses,overtime, and advancements are hard to come by."
good,nothing bad to say about the company I just wish it was more ways to move up in the company instead them choosing whom they want in the position they need to change that..And the way they talk to people
good,This job was awesome when I started 4 years ago. As time passed Management changed and so did the expectations of the job. All you could do was basically come to work and do your job you had no perks to look forward to and no room for advancement but a short time.
good,"It was a good job. Sit at a desk and answer calls about Medicare, but it wasn't for me. You'd get backaches, and some of the management/supervisors aren't great at the job. You hardly socialize with coworkers, and there's a dress code. The hardest part of the job is telling the men who have just lost their wives that you cant help them pay their partners old medical bills. The most enjoyable part would be the training at the very beginning."
good,Its a good job during training they make sure that you are prepared to take phone calls and assist consumers. The hours are really flexible. even though its a temporary position I would still recommend anyone to go there. you also have the opportunity to become permanent.

My co Workers are also great, Enjoyable part of the job and getting to talk to people in other states and meeting new people. I learned how Insurance works and how to use a computer more than i already knew."
good,Was a good place to work. I would have liked to remain their except federal budget cut would not allow it.
good,my co-worker where very nice and the job was ok i learned how to improve my communication skills and my customer service.
good,"a day in Vangent you would come in greet co workers in your team area and surrounding co workers. Start up our systems and check any company emails. Take phone calls for Medicare beneficiaries for any inqiures. Occasional group trainings and team meetings weekly. The hardest part I would say is not having all the information needed to solve a problem, and having some one having to call them back at alater date."
good,The job itself is not bad. I was not offered many hours because I worked part-time which I only had 4 hours a day. Good thing was I was off for 2 days.
good,Good starting point for recent college graduates wanting to gain actual work experience. The business model seems to be built on no employee retention and management upholds that model. There is not motivation to stay with this company after the first year. Employee recognition is non existent as well as performance based merits.
good,I loved working there it was a fast paste work flow but time would go by faster you get to help costumers on their personal needs such as health plans and what would be more convinient for them
good,General dynamics is a fun and exciting to place to work at and also create good opportunity for advancement growth and knowledge.  It has it's ups and down but overall a good company
good,Working at general dynamics honestly was a different job for me...at general dynamics you sit and answer calls and help customers out with insurance...honestly im more of a person that likes to move around on my job ...i like to stay busy physically...great pay and good benefits though with great hrs

good,"General Dynamics has a couple of good things and a few bad things to say about it . Like any job but overall the people there make the experience fun! The work place can be very strict ! But you have a few supervisors that will help you out and let you pass on certain things !. They biggest con , is the pay rate . For everything that we deal with I think the pay could be better"
good,I loved working here it was a government job so i always felt important going to work.  I liked talking to different people from all over the world calling about their financial aid status.
good,"I was working during open enrollment period so our call volume was very high, not even 5 seconds in between calls. You get some easy calls and some hard ones. But it was the same thing pretty much every day."
good,"no thank you,id rather not talk about my previous employers,all places are different.some places are more complex atmosphere's than other's its all about earning a decent living"
good,"they alright they need to better pick employees because anybody can walk in here, they need to work better with schedule and not allowing people to have their phones is just ove the top"
good,My supervisor is good with helping his team with advancing their skills and how to work through problems they may have. The callers can be nice or mean just like any where else. It is nice to have federal holidays off with pay.
good,"I didn't like not being able to interact with customers even a little. But great job for customer service experience. Some days are bust, especially during OPEN ENROLLMENT periods. Hardest part was the consumers getting upset because some things we couldn't do for them but did the BEST we could to make them happy or at least a better mood. Most enjoyable part, was learning the health insurance area a little more then I did before I started."
good,"Answering fast-paced calls to enroll consumers into a healthcare plan. Constantly answering calls, busy call center."
good,"Answer phone calls and questions about insurance, do applications and esculate issues that consumer's have with their insurance. Managers are never on the same page, there is constant changes but the people that work there are willing to help."

good,Working at General Dynamic allowed me to gain skill and knowlege in the medical filed .The company allowed me to grain knowlege with insurance inrollment process .
good,Enjoyed helping consumers.Benefits really great. Fun co-workers
good,I learned to assisted the disabled and the elderly with help finding the right health coverage.  My co-workers were the best group of people.  I enjoyed giving  my clients a piece of mind.
good,Local management is great and the job was pretty easy going but upper management is clueless and the contracts are horribly written.
good,i learned how to work with customers in a great professional friendly manor. my co-workers and supervisors were all great and friendly and were there with great support. the most enjoyable part of my job was that everyone there treated each as family so didnt feel like a job felt like home away from home. I dont think i had any hard times at work due to all the help that my team provided
good,Throughout my time at gd the over all experience was good perfessional and efficient. The typically under pay they employees. Lots of travel and great benefits.
good,"Overall General Dynamics was a great company to work for. Being able to provide and help the consumers was even better. Knowing after almost every call you'd helped someone's life a lot easier, was worth the experience."
good,A typical day at General Dynamics would be coming in to accepting phone calls at the phone center to help people get set up for insurance online. I gained a great customer service by working with General dynamics. The workplace culture was okay the hardest part of the job was not being to leave your seat as you please. Also dealing with very rude customers and while your trying your best to help them.
good,"I have been able to start at the entry level and work my way through nearly all lines of business, up to Training Dept. I love what I do, and I know I make a difference."
good,They are terrible at keeping up with certain things and will fire you for the stupidest stuff. They lost my paperwork excusing me from work and are horrible at communicating with their csr's

good,"They are very strict on Quality Assurance , you get scored every other week.The pay is great the hours are great.They did not offer us a shift change like they said they would .I worked on weekends and you'll probably get 2-3 calls that are 2 minutes long the whole day.Very Boring...Very Stressful"
good,Answering inbound calls pertaining to Medicare. Explaining benefits and premiums for medicare.  Record medicines and compare drug plans for clients.  Look up claims. Hardest part of the job explaining to someone how they have lost their benefits.

I definitely recommend going there roolee employment process they are very easy-going they are tremendously gracious with their salary you can definitely move up in the company if you're in Lawrence Kansas I definitely suggest you give GDIT a call
good,As a engineer/team lead I had the stressful task of leading a team of 6 individuals.  I was responsible for the intelligence of varying systems.  I learned that you should never feel that you intimidate someone because the task at hand requires an agile minded person.  Management was very cooperative and listened and mentored;  a skill we lack these days.  The culture was high stressed due to the type of work performed.  The hardest part of my job was letting the client down.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the training incentives.
good,I liked working at this job because it had a lot of benefits and it had good supervisors. it had good hours and paid holidays were great. down side some of the customers cussed you and made you feel upset a lot even when you did your best to help them.
good,was extremely  slow paced and incredibly strict. wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you are into slow paced boring jobs with a never ending list of rules.. new rules everyday
good,the only thing that i really do not like about working here is that everybody tells you something different regarding policy and how things are actually suppose to be done or even what is done if an employee does something
good,Very stressful job at the time I worked at the company they were implimenting many different changes.  I felt like this by far was the most stressful job I had.  The managment was great and did what they could to help though.
good,I really liked the place of work. Great people! What I did NOT like was having to lie to people and read from a script! ACA needs to be more personal!
good,"I loved management and,  co-workers, but they didn't teach you a thing about signing people up for the insurance. you were only taught how to use the technology."
good,"Log in to computer and phone. If your late call the line, or send an exception to Sup. I learned how the Government runs things. The Management is alright. The diversity is good. The hardest part of the job is boredom and lining up with their clock system. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the consumers."
good,"General Dynamics was not a bad experience , but the positions were mostly temporary. "
good,"management don't really care about your personal, don't pay enough to deal with the rude consumers or even the time that you have to spend assisting them."
good,It was ok but then management was bad they wasn’t organized they would have training set up and then everyone that came for training would have to wait cause no one was there to do it
good,I Answered anywhere from 168 to 200 calls a day for people with Medicare enrolling them into prescription drug plans and answering regular general questions for them. I learned a lot from the job about insurance. Management was great always nice and willing to help. most people were really nice and easy to get along with. the hardest part of my job was telling a beneficiary that I could not help them. I loved helping people and resolving the problems that they had
good,"Inbound and outbound calling, customer service and information provided on a number of contracts such as medicare, student loans and credit counseling."
good,"excellent environment to learn"
good,Receive and service inbound calls from Medicare recipients. Educate clients on their benefits coverage. Deliver a good customer service experience to each caller by providing efficient and effective information.
good,13 years with General Dynamics taught me a lot.
good,It was a good experience but it has its cons at times currently looking for something different. Change is always good . The overtime and the benefits were decent.
good,"General Dynamics is growing by leaps and bounds, new structure, lots of opportunities. This is a large company with many sites globally, one could make their career with this GD."
good,"I wish upper management were better managers.  They hardly talk to the employees who are actually doing the work, but feel the need to make decisions like they are the ones completing the work.  It makes it hard to want to give you best when you're not noticed."
good,Supervisors are a hit and miss. Work was not that hard once you got the hang of it. Sometimes it could be overwhelming. Coworkers are also a hit and miss just depends on where your location is in the building. Benefits were ok. However they are NO raises.
good,there was no organization within the workplace. management and supervisors were never on the same page and it is nearly impossible to get any type of questions answered!!
good,"This is a defense company which will give a new worker great responsibility if found to be competent.  If you are technical, you will need to qualify for at least Secret clearance, or else your career is over before its starts.   You will likely find yourself unable to talk to anyone about what you are working on, and the stress level of such an environment can get to some.  It is a great place to start and work for a few years in order to get fantastic technical experience."
good,Each position I've held has offered new offerings for being a successful employee. I feel grateful for what I've learned at the companies I've worked for.
good,Spherion was able to provide me with quick placement to another job once one contract ended.
good,Unfortunately only one person in what should be a three man IT team.
good,"The job was temporary for the 2010 census, pay was good, and they offered alot of overtime when neccessary."
good,"The work was good in that we were helping people with a necessary government service. The training was good, but once out on the floor we received contradictory information and often didn't know where we stood.  The pay was not enough to get by on and I had no choice but to seek a better paying job.  The work is not hard, but it is fast-paced and there is a lot of information to remember.  I recommend this job to those who are calm, collected and always polite - no matter what is being said to them.  If the income is a supplement to someone elses good paying job - go for it.  If you want to be able to pay rent, keep the power on and by food - it depends on what all of that costs in your area."
good,The expectations of the position is not equal to the pay. There are no raises or increases in benefits. If you are fresh out of college and need experience would be the only pro.
good,"Gdit was high-demand and fast paced, the management staff was not as accomodating and supportive as the could have been. The environment was one that left very little to be desired."
good,"Though the company is good to work for, the culture in the Hattiesburg site leaves a lot to be desired.  Company would do well to restructure starting at the top."
good,General Dynmics has a fun & a productive workplace but they're Slow & out of order on things. The pay is Good. They're very professional but also some of the supervisors weren't good enough to be supervisors.
good,"Answered calls all day"
good,"The NASSCO Bremerton location is very lean. The job title I held required me to work 12+ hours a day and I was still behind on work.  I was the only material buyer.  A buyer for the NASSCO Norfolk location was required to a lot less than me at the NASSCO Bremerton locaton.  My supervisor didn't offer help, my coworkers with less to do didn't offer help,  "
good,"You could walk in and change the company from a poor company rated 76 office in the nation , to 1 in the nation. Turning around their close out packages to the best . Yet no signs towards aprectiation to the people who made it happen."
good,"Very good training and good hearted people, less than professional atmosphere and organization as a company. Feast or Famine paychecks, Not family friendly."
good,"Great company but the management team was horrible.  Working there would have been much better if the management team would have been different.  There was so much change needed with the management team that I don't necessarily want to elaborate at this time. "
good,"Overall GDIT is a great place to work.  Lots of learning and innovation and opportunity to further your professional development.  However, you have to be on the right team and have a good manager that respects and appreciates your work ethic; if you don't have a good manager, it's hard to advance or be recognized for the work effort you put forth."
good,"In the heat of the battles in engineering during a program you have many years of ship design to lean upon, its a great place to get the exposure to ship design."
good,Good Place - with growing pains during merger with CSRA leaves the existing staff feeling very apprehensive about job security. Otherwise it has been an exceptional work environment (for me at least.)
good,Typical 'Beltway Bandit' professional services firm.  Your are valued as long as either a contract is in place (for employees under contract) and the company generates ample revenues (for overhead employees).
good,Ok place to work. Lots of out of town jobs. But the pay is not that great. The people are great to work with. Somtimes the supervisors have a hard time understanding life outside of work
good,"General Dynamics was a good experience working at the shipyard. I was able to learn a lot. I just don't care for the fact that temps were not able to participate in employee activities, such as attend health fairs, use the employee gym, participate in company holiday parties and cookouts, etc..."
good,"When I arrive at work I log into my pc and phone and wait for a call, while I'm waiting on a call I have to check my emails and calls that have been graded, to insure that I'm doing my job properly and efficiently. Then I make sure that the day before adherence is what it should be. By the time I make sure all that is taken care of a call comes in. The hardest part of my job is when consumers call in and the systems are down and I'm am unable to assist my consumer. The most enjoyable part of my job is when a consumer calls in and they have called in several times and I was the only one that provided accurate information and resolved there issue to the fullest extent possible.. and they are satisfied with my customer service."
good,"•	Responsible for the assisting consumer with receiving health coverage through the Affordable Care Act"
good,Very stressful work enviorment. Co workers normally don't talk to you except the few that actually go through training with you.
good,General Dynamics is supposed to be a professional work environment. It is totally opposite. Supervisors are very unprofessional. I personally did not like it and would not recommend.
good,"Fantastic product to work with, and the best customers to maintain a working dialogue with.  Like everything else there are opportunities, and having an optimistic viewpoint with the ability to see the ""diamond in the rough"" is always a great thing."
good,Gulfstream is a great company but the management is terrible. They promise sunshine and rainbows but all you get is thunderstorms. Still a good old boy company.
good,Run daily reports on inventory cycle daily and weekly. Investigate shortages from production. We also have daily meetings in the mornings. I am also flexible interchangeable between departments in the office.
good,"Hard work was well rewarded"
good,During my time with Vangent I learned about confidentiality in the work place.  There were many rules and regulations so it was a learning experience in accuracy and quality customer service.
good,"Being an instructor at the 35F10 course was the most rewarding job I've ever had. I loved the job but, it was also the most stressful work environment I have ever had to work in."
good,"A great company to work for.  Currently transforming into a major maritime facility in the Hampton Roads area.  I spend most of my time writing and editting new safety programs.  I also coordinate the flow of information throughout the company as it relates to Occupational Safety.  I also conduct a lot of statistical analysis."
good,A typical day at work consists of answering phone calls from consumers about the new affordable care act insurance and how to sign up.
good,"Day to day support of the USCG NSC technology refresh program. Detailed logistics support for the Technology Demonstration program. Proof of concept for the USCG to upgrade the remaining hulls with the suite of equipment included in the TD program."
good,Too many chiefs not enough Indians. Only 4 people do all the necessary technical work
good,Too many employees there do their jobs poorly & aren't reprimanded. This was disheartening.
good,"Very stressful.  Unequal pay and not good supervision. Very unfair with promotions."
good,"I really do not want to leave any comments, but it will not let me advance. The turnover where I was at was high, but mainly due to the leadership at that location."
good,During the end of my employment at general dynamics I found a discrepancy with my attendance record. I personally feel once the contract ended I wasn't reassigned
good,"great local office in frederick, projects were driven on a sales based approach. Jobs may be dependent on whether we deliver and sell current versions of the software"
good,Over all my experience with Gdit for the last 6 years has been positive. We however went thru some major changes how ever on this contract which has caused our relation ship to sour with the current state of things.
good,During parts of the year it can be very hectic. It can be a very stressful place to work but also give you the satisfaction of knowning you truly have helped someone at times. They are not very lenient on absence even if you are really sick with doctor excuses. I do not believe that the pay is quite high enough for how stressful it can be.
good,Good overall company but had limited advancement when I was there. Todays union is challenged. Todays low level leadership was yesterdays retail manager at the mall. Supervisors today are under compensated and driven to work extended hours.
good,My experience at NASSCO was a pleasant one however due to the work load being unstable you are always uneasy about dedicating your time there fully. The company is being reconstructed and in the future may have room to grow but at the time I was there it was limited positions.
good,"Call center work is all the same. Answer the phones, follow your call flow, in this case the script, and try not to miss any time. The work is consistent and routine. You don't get sent home without your consent. Optional overtime is offered during peak season. The management is preoccupied with whatever else is going on to care about the team members. The systems are/were not in the best conditions and many times agents were held responsible for the delay caused by said systems. That is normal with any call center. The 30 minute lunch break is a joke, especially considering the facility is tucked away in the woods from any place to get any food. There are food trucks that come around, but they get so backed up that you might as well not go. The facility is lovely, however. With a smoke spot set away from the main entrance."
good,"The environment is casual, and the work itsef is not hard at all. Policies are a little tight and schedule changes every 6 months are a little inconvenient because you are never guaranteed a schedule to fit your life schedule. Its either make it work, or lose your job."
good,"My experience was mixed. Even though we planned meetings for veterans and the Department of Defense, there was not enough work and I was downsized from my position."
good,"I have worked at GDIT for 17 years. I LOVE my job but unfortunately during a contract renewal bid, we lost our contract.I was completely devastated. I hope to find another job that pays around what I make currently and something that I will love."
good,General dynamics is a great place to get a start up job and get your career going if you are looking to get  customer service  experience. Also you truly can help people and make their day better.
good,Very relaxed place to work but the management was VERY poor and lacked a LOT of different skills that a manager would need and SHOULD have.  The workbut really was fast paced but not so much that you get overwhelmed.  The pay was decent but there wasn't any room for growth or advancement.
good,"Relaxed but productive environment, great people to work with."
good,"I believe that the only down fall was shift bid. I dislike GDIT because I was new to the area with no family or friends to watch my young child. So when shift bid came around, I lost my 8-5 shift and was moved to 12-9 shift. I did not like that at all so I decided to leave the job for ther opportunities."
good,"Mostly medium call volume. Traning is easy and you lean more hands on. Attendace policy is strict, praformace is graded on a high level of exalentcey."
good,"It's very relaxed but way to strict on the hours you can miss, it's really hard to get unexpected life events approved as an excused absence and way to hard to get your schedule changed"
good,"Great"
good,This was definitely a big learning experience learning and working for a call center and basically how call centers operate.
good,"Well my manager he is ok I really don't talk to him much he's always in his office, my supervisor is also ok she's mostly do your work and I wont bother you type of supervisor, I think that sometimes it would be nice to know we are doing a great job and they appreciate that. Co workers are nice and friendly people. The hardest part of my job would be doing a consumers application and them not qualifying for a tax credit or they don't qualify for a special enrollment period its heart breaking sometimes, but its policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part is when you get a consumer that has went thru so much and you can finally assist them and help them resolve any issues they are having. I love when the older people call in and cant work computers because they appreciate the time you spend helping them with all their questions"
good,"They have a point system for attendance, but it seems like they just hand out points whenever they see fit, whether the points fit the rules/guidelines or not."
good,"* Typical day is extremely busy."
good,"Team Player assigned to several position, always willing to help out, easy learner , communicates well speaks clearly. percise and with confidence."
good,"I worked in Phoenix, AZ. A typical day involves taking back to back phone calls regarding student financial aid for college or U.S. passport application inquiries. (depending on which dept. you work for) When the day is slow, the scheduling dept. will offer approved time off w/o pay which is a nice option. You have to be okay with repetitiveness and following a script/call format 8-10 hrs./day. The computers are SLOW. "
good,Assisting consumers with Medicare or marketplace calls. I am dual trained so I don't know until I get there which area I will cover. Its constant training and I enjoy when a beneficiary tells me thank you for helping me with a concern.
good,"No complaints awesome place to work and grow. Great benefits, paid holidays, great training and ever learning."
good,"Good pay"
good,Was on a traveling team that was in Florida to work on Navy ships. I learned a lot about hard work and what it takes to stand out and be motivated in the real working world not just on cruise control.
good,The job was easy and you helped people. You would have to find out or yourself.
good,Fast paced and intense work environment. Good location. People are friendly.
good,"Typical Day: Is never the same with each consumer"
good,It has been an interesting experience to be involved with the new Affordable Care Act.  I have seen several aspects of this new law and how it can benefit the lives of Americans throughout the United States.  We have been required to be flexible to work to accommodate federal deadlines to assist consumers with information about health insurance.
good,this is a very good place to work. Management is good. Usually can
good,"Not much guidance or idea of the future with the company. A week after I was hired my boss retired and not replaced. A couple months later my boss's boss retired. 8 months later, an employee with a lifetime at the company with tons of knowledge retired. I was managed by someone miles away that rarely consulted with."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is speaking with the customers and helping them understand their benefits. My typical work day is coming to work signing in my phone system and start recieving calls. the hardest part of my job is not being able to have my cell phone with me incase of an emergency with my daughter. I learn different things every day about medicare benefits.
good,"Overall It was a very good learning experience, this job taught me valuable skills that are benefical on other jobs."
good,A work day consist of coming in & doing your job. Very relatable to high school. On a good note I've ljob.earned to deal and interact with customers on a consistent basis through telecommunication. The hardest part of the job is too maintain a positive attitude while being sometimes criticized by customers or even co-workers. The most enjoyable part is getting paid and finding useful information to complete my
good,Working for GDIT was a great experience. Working with excellent people and equipment. Another great learning experience in my A/V career.
good,This Job was really a temp but i the work was data entry and it was pretty easy. I enjoyed the time i was there.
good,Some co-workers were rude. Job does not provide enough empathy when it comes to personal life factors.
good,"Great company to work for. Good work environments, but only thing that makes for a downside is that most work is based on conctracts, deployements, and short notice of job status."
good,call center life isnt for everyone but vangent is a nice job with lots of benefits for u and your family
good,An enjoyable office where everyone would help each other..The engineers  would all help the newbies as each had various levels of expertise. The project prints had many disciplines to be verified for correctness..
good,Great place to work when defense spending is strong. When defense spending stopped the layoffs were brutal. Great technology and fun work supporting our military.
good,the opportunity is good. the more you know about your job the easier the job will be. the environment was quite unproffesional at times. they allowed drama.
good,"Good place to work at but if you wanna advance or want a challenging job that’s different each day I’d go somewhere else. Hours are good, and you get off at a decent time."
good,"Professional environment, great place to learn and practice engineering skills. A typical day consisted of reviewing maintenance tasks and writing maintenance procedures for the various tasks. I learned about the technical manual development process. Management was okay, some more direct guidance to junior staff would be better."
good,General Dynamics have give me an opportunity to come in and learn a new application that I've never worked with before. I was also able to work on the migration to the VMware cloud environment.
good,"Overall good place to work, they dont give many raises nor do they accommodate employees with kids but overall nice. They have shift bids that disrupt schedules we get used to and we are left to scramble to make changes or lose job"
good,It is a stressful at times but you can deal with it. You can work with the consumers because they (general Dynamics ) trains you and gives you help all the time with different consumers problems and they have a great support team.
good,"GDIT enforces a strict policy prohibiting employees from using cell phones on the premises and has a very relaxed policy for attendance making it difficult to meet their service agreement. It is possible to advance your career, but it must be done on your time and with little to no help from Human resources."
good,Really enjoyed working there until they merged with Earl Industries.  Then the management team was difficult to work with and the culture changed.  Would have stayed longer but didn't agree with management and new structure.
good,"The job is pretty easy, the most annoying thing that you may not like is the management and job culture. If you stay to yourself the job culture may not bother you as much."
good,Fast paced call center. Answer phone calls about the ACA.  Answer questions and health and dental plans. Enroll consumers in to health care plans. Management is good.
good,"After 2 years less than 10% of hiring class were still employed. No vacation had to use for personal as most employees in lower postitions had to also. Standard 1st year not given any vacation hours. Never offered a raise based on one low level negative occurance per 13 week rollover period. An example is being late back from break or forgetting (neglecting) to speak or write one aspect of a typical CSR workload task or just could be based solely on the opinion of whomever may be evaluating the employee that particular day. This calculates to failing less than 0.05% of calls on top of all other aspects of the job every 3 months.   "
good,Typical day consist of sitting at a desk 8 hours taking incoming phones calls back to back. The hardest part about the job is dealing with frustrating callers.
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers and the pay and benefits of GD. The management was the worst I've ever experienced, micromanaged every little thing to the point it HURT efficiency. Very dirty environment and not always the safest place to work."
good,Jobs not too bad pay is kind of low and the customers you deal with are awful but it's a pretty easy job i would definitely recommend it to someone else and have in the past to my friends.
good,"health insurance coverage "
good,"A typical day at work started with bringing myself up to speed with any new information. Usually the information needed to be updated in my opinion . there were always questions that couldn't be answered which made the job more stressful than it needed to be. the culture was to do what you were told or what the processses called for but didn't seem to account for exceptional circumstances. i learned a great deal about research and documentation.  management was fine in most instances. i have nothing to really say of them. the most enjoyable part of the job were the co workers i came to know. especially those who asked as many questions as i did to better assist the consumers, and who fought to be apart of any meeting or focus group that could impliment change for the better."
good,"I enjoyed working here, I only left due to having a second baby. I would love to be working here again. The pay is amazing, and everyone is very nice."
good,Great job experience! You could make as much overtime as you wanted the pay was great just to answer phone and set up customer accounts. Sometimes you had harsh customers but overall great job.
good,"I didn't really have a problem with the job itself, I just eventually stopped being able to handle people verbally abusing me all day. If you have a thick skin and have no problem separating yourself from their comments, this is a good place to be."
good,Signing in to system and helping consumers with questions and enrolling in Health Care in their state.  Good Benefits and caring for the employees. We worked 8 hour shifts with breaks every 2 hours and lunch for 30 minutes.
good,"Work life balance is good and salary is decent. The travel can be a pain and I question if the culture is a natural fit. "
good,"A typical day at work would include needing your badge for everything! leaving your cellphone at home or in your car, not in your pocket or locker or anywhere in or even near the front doors of the building. You do receive awesome training and learn quite a bit about healthcare. The good thing is the majority of managers are awesome! you have a few rude ones but the good outweighs the bad on that part. The hardest part of the job is finding a way to calm down a consumer who is either very angry or very emotional! but it can be done."
good,Very warm environment with few breaks in between. Management didn't talk to us much unless something was wrong. The most difficult part of the job is finding material from shipment.
good,"This is a great company to work for if you can find assignment that's not located in a poverty strickend area.  unfortunately the pay is based on location, whereas another GDIT location approximately 1 1/2 hours away will have cleaner facilities and more pay.  The moral is better when you're not working in a call center that treats you like a slave with lo pay."
good,"The job has a great deal of stress.  No phones, paper or pens allowed at desk.  Very restrictive.  The supervisors are very helpful but the job itself has a great deal of stress and expectations."
good,"I was a csr, who providing medicare info to individuals who called in. I was able to help people everyday, so that was wonderful. there were times I couldn't help people, but I always tried my best"
good,High inbound calls taking care of customers helping customers pick plans. This was a job that passed the time also had a great supervisor and helpful people within the company
good,"I take calls and help customers to get the best policy that fits their needs. Customer service is most of my job. Softwar Application and using a multi phone line. The most difficult part of my job is that most of the calls I take, the customers are already irritated to the point that it makes it hard to calm them down enough to achieve their and my goals with the phone call."
good,"Defense jobs are going away it seems. They are harder and harder to come by and GD is one of those companies holding on to contracts by a string. The pay and work environment are not bad, but work gets slow and you might fear for a layoff as I was laid off."
good,Overall a good place to work. Not stable and did not see much room for advancement. Unfortunately company lacked training of employees. Information was not always available to perform our job.
good,the best part of the job was creating a new forecast and reporting process from scratch. And they were good about a work life balance
good,Large global commercial outsourcing experience focused on revenue growth and new business expansion.  Best part of the job is recognizing a problem and developing a solution which is beneficial to both the client and our business objectives.
good,"A good place to work for a short period of time. It was hard to move up and a lot of supervisors were not helpful at all, I don't know how they got that position."
good,"Succinctly, I value and respect my employment, and the contract I had through an unnamed subcontractor for GDIT and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. However, the subcontractor had poor management at the site level and very little oversight or accountability. Many of the supervisors did not do their job and kept a minimum of program knowledge. Advancement ladders were next to non-existent, accompanied by false promises of ""career pathing"" assistance from upper management and corporate."
good,Overall it isn't a horrible place to work. Very lenient attendance policy for employees..
good,"* Ensure Problem Reports are being addressed by IPT groups and responses are posted for CM overview"
good,Great hrs with overtime being available. I learned a lot about medicare and Medicaid.
good,"I was lucky....I had a great section manager, and department manager.  Beyond that I only saw knuckleheads who were ""yes"" men that felt they deserved, deserved, deserved.  Sprinkled within that mix were some who tried to make a difference.  If they rocked to boat too much, they were targeted for layoff.  The 9/80 workweek is nice, but when they froze pensions it basically said, ""we won't get the best talent; we just need for them to rely on their patriotism"" to accept a job here.  With the cuts, thanks to Washington, the lack of program contracts has sent shivers through most.  They now look over their shoulder to watch their back.  The people ""in the trenches"" were the best.  Made some great friends.  Company, as of 6/12/14 is still too top heavy.  They keep cutting the workers and keeping the people who plan projects, who manage (not lead...big difference), and who charge indirect (aka overhead).  Funny, they got rid of people who, (1) know the product, (2) actually EARN their keep, and (3) care about the product, which is more than a paycheck, its protecting the soldiers who protect......US."
good,"It is very busy, I learned how to do Applications for Medical Coverage. Managment could have been better, was always switching supervisors, which made it confusing. I had very helpful co-workers. Staying on one call for alon period of time, and working through all the glitches of the system to be able to do my job right. Is helping people better their life in some way and being able to do have the knowledge to help."
good,"GDIT was difficult to work with. Starting as a Temporary Full Time employee with no guarantee that you continue working after high productivity periods was stressful. Typically an 8 hour day with a lot of overtime available during high productivity times. Co-workers were friendly enough, but with very few Regular Full Time positions and advancement opportunities work relationships could be tenuous at best. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated. The most enjoyable was helping the clients that called."
good,"do your job stay, show up , and stay on the phone for healthcare.gov"
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of greeting my team upon arrival and then working on sending out daily statistics. Typically, within the first hour that I arrive, supervisors get called to the phones. That means that I have to stop whatever I'm doing and take calls. I do not mind getting on the phone to answer calls from Medicare beneficiaries; however, it becomes stressful when I have so many other expectations to meet. I have learned so much information about Medicare and other health insurance companies. Overall, management is friendly and has an open door policy which allows people to feel comfortable approaching them with concerns. My co-workers are usually what allow me to get through the day. After working with the company for over 5 years, I have met a lot of unique individuals. I will be sad to leave them once I find a new job. I can honestly say that my co-workers are the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"The folks at GD were all contractors. They worked well as a team. Unfortunately the company lost the contract to factors beyond their control and the whole office shut down in July of 2013."
good,Work environment can be hectic but there is plenty of room to advance if you are driven and engaged in the shipbuilding industry.
good,"Good benefits and salary."
good,They make it really hard to balance personal life and work life
good,Strong Management support which makes work easier. Bench is strong which enables to compete in the market
good,"As part of a team, we would place IUID tags on all military assets. But the job was not to last forever due to the fact that this was to assist the Marines with better tracking their gear. "
good,"There were times when you did not know whether you were a supply clerk or an Field Service Technician. Most of the FSTs were always engaged in supply activities especially after moving from Iraq to Kuwait. We lost a bit of our incentive pay that we were getting in Iraq and me personally was in Iraq for a total of 10 days the reassigned to Kuwait. I personally installed every upgrade of equipment in that tank. From the driver's station to the turret with the New AAC kit installation. That was the air conditioning kit for each of the 4 stations. Driver, Commander, Gunner and Loader had their own air hose to plug into their NBC suit in order to remain cool during middle of the day missions. The work was steady until the end of the contract and then that's when everything began to change. I liked the work that I was assigned, but did not like all of the hostility. From my viewpoint, there seemed to be much favoritism. Certain people could do whatever they wanted and that comprised most of the complaints. Some never worked at all. For me that was the hardest part of the job. I don't really have much to say about the management except they fired the good one that should've been kept. The most enjoyable part was being able to do your job and not be interrupted for any reason. I learned that you have to be totally impervious to any differences and indifferent behavior. You just have to act like it doesn't exist and be responsible for your actions always. "
good,"El trabajo es rutinario en un taller electrico,con el tiempo se aprende nuevas cosas,buenos gefes,buen ambiente,lo mas dificil la rutina diaria y lo que mas me gusto el compañerismo"
good,there was no advancement opportunities it was purely seasonal
good,"Normal day included working Live Help, or chat assisting customers with there FAFSA needs. Handling multiple accounts and pulling multiple files at a time. Working environment was good and had no issues with any co-workers. Reasonable breaks but timing policy was not very great. Layoff procedures were very mistrud and last minute."
good,I leared alot about this job and it was great place to work at
good,"My standard day included working on Build of Materials, designing parts in NX, creating progress reports, and working with other engineers to integrate our designs."
good,This is a job that is dealing with all different kinds of people. This is a job of professionalism and patience. You have some calm customers and you have some upset ones. You have to know how to stay professional and be respectful.
good,helped consumers to get health insurance. filled out applications and provided guidance on what may be the best health plan for their family. then helped them to enroll
good,Great place to work if you are in a crunch for a job. Great people and the hours are pretty awesome. Work load can be a little heavy depending on the economy and government contracts
good,"The only thing I didn't like was call handle time. If a person calls to enroll in a prescription drug plan, that significantly increases a CSR's overall call handle time. You feel like you are in a race to get calls in and out as fast as possible with very little empathy for a customer's situation."
good,Good job to have. I miss my coworkers and friends that I built relationships with over the years. The company itself is ok. Alot of miscommunication but overall it's a job
good,"Very relax environment and open door philosophy "
good,I like what I do. The environment is very friendly. The employee engagement is the most important factor of the job. The Senior Leadership focus on the customer service reps the most.
good,One of the Managers verbally abused me when he didn't like when I was helping him out at my desk instead of his admins desk. (I took a few minutes and went to my desk for info). I was helping him out and he attacked me verbally...he told my manager and she never called me to get my story and just believed him. So unfair to me. So they blackballed me when I applied for an admin job their years later ..
good,The clients I worked for were enjoyable and always looked forward to each of the days experiences. At some of the work sites we were part of the team as government support not just contractors.
good,it was an easy job just a lot of drama in the workplace. the management team is very poor with communication. the pay is good for a call center with full benefits.
good,Good company. Gives full training and help employees in time of hardship. I have a good experience as a Planner with this company because there's a lot the company can offer when it comes to improving your career.
good,General dynamics gave people the platform to begin a customer service experience while at the same time also giving you the tools and resources to grow
good,I was satisfied with the job and staff. They never gave us any raises but there was opportunity for advancement. The crew that we worked with was good to get along with.
good,"Extremely efficient and streamlined processes.  Clearly written process controls and procedure.  "
good,The job itself is simple once you understand what you do if you can handle sitting still for hours and talking all day the management there was good organized some of the floor supervisors seemed to be sexist or show a lot of favoritism towards friends within the company when it came to opportunity there my supervisor personally was non biased and had earned her seat and was very knowledgeable
good,This was a very fun work place. The hours were great. The management was enthusiastic and positive. The atmosphere was calm and productive. Employees were always happy.
good,I live in ogden and it was a way far commute but overall it was not that hard of a job at all if you just followed the script.  The qa was very strict and would always find a way to doc you even with a qa person on the phone with you.
good,"a typical work day at General Dynamics is busy, calls are rolling in back to back. I learned about insurance while working there. the workplace culture is laid back and very organized. the best about this job is being able to connect with people from all over."
good,Definitely a great place to develop your communication skills also has a lot of overtime hours if you want it but also allows people to work part-time and split shifts
good,General Dynamics is a fun call center to work at where you can make a decent money. It does start off off as temporary but there is room to become a staff member if they decide to keep you.
good,"Busy, hectic environment; was able to cross train in various roles in the company to gain invaluable experience; day to day job was very hectic with stringent deadlines; flexible work schedule with availability to work from home"
good,one of the best desk jobs Ive ever had. I helped people get health insurance and if they already have it i would help them find a better affordable insurance plan
good,I was Windows Server Engineer with decent hours and good enough pay with a Secret level clearance for the company for government work.  Never near the company but worked for Stennnis Space Center location for a good while.
good,"company was ok to work for. pay was low, hours were difficult to get change if you need them to. trying to get time off for a doctors visit was problematic."
good,"They're not a horrible place to work, as they know how to recognize good people when they appear. You're surrounded by talented people who can work together."
good,"Normally 8 hours a day in office.  No telework.  Night/weekend work is on a need basis and telework is allowed.  Technology used is up to date.  Manager is fair.  Workplace is OK.  Sometimes, multiple tasks may due at the same time and you will need to work extra hours to complete them."
good,They have great benefits and perks for employees. Can be laid back but fast past paced when needed. All the staff is really friendly I would definitely recommend working here.
good,"if your supervisor was relaxed, then, it was an awesome place to work, if the supervisor did not like you, you were doomed. The co workers were generally great, helpful."
good,GDIT is supportive of its personnel and treats them as professionals. Leadership reaches out and listens to their employees. Benefits are good but not outstanding.
good,"I enjoyed my time at GDIT, it is a good company that does its best to be a partner for Government agencies. I had the opportunity to work with very knowledgeable people and learn from them. "
good,"Call center with two companies in one building, obama care, health insurance, training was the best part of the job. no room for advancement, favortism is a huge fsctor"
good,"Answering the phone.  Helping customers choose the best health care plan to fit their needs.  If their were problems,  i would try to fix the issue and if not send to a manager"
good,"One of the Directors not qualified for their position. Should be removed, and replaced with qualified person. Project went from bad to worse under their supervision."
good,At the moment this work in progress as the company is going through a merger.  As a result HR processes are not totally in place.  Future benefits are unknown.   Managemnt is just being restructured.
good,"It is an exciting and rewarding place to work. If you like to be competitive and do well there is all kinds of room for advancement all the time. For the most part, if you want to improve yourself everyone from the people on your team to management will help you acquire the skills and tools needed to be successful! I was very lucky at GDIT, I only had one bad supervisor. However, when I began my career there I had quite possibly one of the best supervisors ever. Now by lucky I need to tell you about the one problem at GDIT. About half the supervisors and upper management don’t have the slightest bit of emotional intelligence. As leaders it’s probably one of the most important attributes in order to be successful. Again, I was lucky I only had one of these and I had already established myself so when it got bad I didn’t have to quit, I was able to reach out and be moved to another team(this is very hard to do if you don’t know the right people). The lack of emotional intelligence in leadership is the reason for the astronomical turn over rate. Overall, I liked GDIT and was able to be very successful and accomplish all of my goals."
good,Great place to start as a CSR. Pay could be better for the level of stress you will endure. Otherwise a great learning experience. As long as you don't have any write ups then you can advance anywhere temporarily.
good,Great benefits great people great place to work. I've learned a lot. Great internal mobility.  Excellent place to work. I prefer this over my other jobs.
good,The team is great.  Pay is low for this level of work. Benefits are comparable to most government contracting companies.   I am still on the fence about leaving depending on how the work travel increases in the next few months.
good,"The work environment is fast-paced and can be stressful during the enrollment period however the company does do a lot of things to help offset that by providing food trucks, free pizza, pajamas day, etc."
good,If you can type and listen then its not too bad. The hardest thing to do other than show up to work on time is dealing with difficult callers who have real life issues
good,"There is opportunity for advancement, if you work the right way. "
good,"Good place to make money and get proper experience in trades. Would not recommend union, it's weak. Personally would recommend keeping an eye out for other jobs once you have experience, you can make more money and get better bennies elsewhere."
good,Providing incoming call support for Medicare subscribers.  The call center operates 24 hours per day Monday through Sunday.  Employees shift bid for quarterly schedules according to seniority.  Calls are monitored by supervisors for accuracy and customer service ratings.  Scripting is used to provide information.  The pace is hectic during open enrollment time.  Training is provided prior to  going on the floor and each custormer service representative must be certified before taking calls.  Nice work environment and you meet a lot of new friends.
good,"The BCRC program at GDIT's Las Cruces campus is relatively chill, but the work itself requires you to pay attention, understand rules and regulations, and be able to pass along that information to beneficiaries who often do not understand the Medicare program."
good,"intelligent, smart, hardworking, integrity, motivating, teamwork, communication, cooperation, culture, diversity, training, education, balance, global"
good,"Provide accurate information about student loans in a professional manner to the borrowers. Assist borrowers with filling out the correct and complete forms including discharge paperwork, and financial disclosures.  Aid borrowers with understanding their student loans and how to get out of default. Provide help to borrowers navigating myeddebt.ed.gov. Provide reference numbers to assist the borrower in calling the right agency or servicer for their needs"
good,"Which ultimately means there is no real job security and there is no real chance for promotion because the position is based on a contract that has a set end date. Once that contract ends you are off looking for another job, this has been my life for 17+ years."
good,A company that truly cares about making a difference for it's customers.  Builds strategic alliances with other companies to bring the right solution to the mission.  The company is patriotic and supports those that have defended our nation and those still doing it today.
good,GD State college is a good place to work on most days. Advancement and salary increases are little to none however. I have been with the company for 10+ years and have not had a significant raise in over 6 years. I am one of only two people on a manufacturing line that should have at minimum 4 people. The work can be stressful with little to no payoff.
good,General Dynamics is a great place to work and the work performed change lives. The environment is very high paced.  The job is very satisfying and the most enjoyable part is making a difference in someone life.
good,It was a great learning experience and when my position ended they found another position for me within the company and I also received training.  Very nice place to work.
good,Lots of chances to grow and move up within the company. There is not much after work opportunities but they do offer really good benefits to employees.
good,"● Manage telephone and web chat customer service and technical support for 100+"
good,I was allowed the chance to work on many varied projects outside of my Drafting position.  The management culture at the time was to create contacts at the NUWC facility and foster working relations with them to assist the project they were in charge of.  This of course resulted in many chances to work in various areas of Nava vessels.
good,"Every morning I would turn on the computer and sign into the phone, so they would connect. When a call come through the head set, I would answer the call and assist the customer with any and all issues they had with their health insurance.  Most on the times I would help the customers with signing up for health insurance.  I enjoyed assisting the customers with their issues. The hardest thing about the job is when you want to help a customer and there isn't anything you can do, I feel helpless when I can't help the customers. Understanding is the key to the job but sometime you don't get the understanding you need.  They don't review all the policies about what a CSR or CCO can and cannot do to assist the customers.  Such as how many times do you suppose to do someone's application, do you send out paper copies applications, how to find the right scripting for the right situation."
good,"fast pace "
good,"Large organization with limited opportunities for advancement. Senior Leadership in some areas was supportive.  Good group of workers, respectful, professional, personable."
good,"Had the ability to work remotely.  Positive work environment, and good rapport with colleagues.  Overall solid work experience.  Not too many opportunities for professional growth."
good,"A job for active listeners, with good people skills.  There is a high turn-over rate, as call volume can be back to back for long periods of time (entire shift).  There can be a lot of stress that many cannot deal with at the pace and intensity of the calls."
good,"I enjoyed my experience and additional skills I learned while working with this company. the trainers that have are excellent. It’s a lot of work to learn, and the trainers make the environment fun while still keeping it professional."
good,The management was very combative and not engaged with workers during project implementation. The only time management engaged was if projects might slip on a date. Yelling and screaming seemed to be the only way supervisors would attempt to communicate.
good,Its intense and stressful.  For instance you can be on time everyday and follow every rule but can be let go if custom service isnt TOP notch or even if customer feedback isn't glowingly approving.
good,Help enroll customers in health insurance. I also helped them retrieve their tax documents and also gave a full detailed explanation of the different insurance plan that were offered
good,Had a good time learning the new job being that I've never worked for a call center until now. Had 2 great teachers for the 4 week class you have to take for training.
good,Federal regulations change depending on Administration. We provided top-notch information and customer service. There was never a dull moment working under Angelina Bridges. She was amazing.
good,"It's whatever you make it. As long as you show up and do what you have to do,  it's not that complicated. If you have good body language and the caller can tell you will l love it."
good,"I had to sign individuals up for health insurance during the open enrollment period.  This was a seasonal position.  Some calls were stressful, others were fine, overal it was a good learning experience.  Holidays were paid even in the beginning."
good,I enjoyed the workplace culture the best. The core group of people I worked with and for had been a part of the team the entire time I worked for this company. Many were like family. Others were good friends. That made for an easy working environment.
good,The pay is really decent its also an establishment that provides a lot of assistance for I learned a lot from the job its an excellent workplace to get experience from.
good,The company was  a nice place to work. The environment was a little frighten at time. But the over all nice place to work. People is pretty friendly management ok
good,"Active Manager Resolution, Remote assisting Customer Service Agents with Admin Server Access to monitor and control procedures."
good,"business casual at work."
good,"After a month of training, you are assigned a desk with a computer and phone. I took calls for the Affordable Care Act, answering questions from Healthcare.gov . I had prepared scripts to share with callers. Sadly, this was at a time when Healthcare.gov didn't work.  My requests for patience with the website were plastered all over the Republican National Party's news letters and I soon didn't have a job.      A team is a collection of individual working together to make YOU look good. I had great training, a solid support staff, and managers all intent on helping me succeed."
good,Company has great insurance. Dayily work was extensive but keeps you busy. Learned how to work with a lot of people and provide great customer service.
good,Everything is what you expect out of a major Defense contracting Company.  No surprises.  Can be lost in a sea of employees.  If you are looking for camaraderie you won't find much of it here.
good,"Everyone is nice and try to help you out with whatever it is that can be difficult, also some managers take the time out to really focus on what it is that you like to do."
good,The job is a good job with excellent benefits. Every call was different and allowed me to wow them with my personality and my skills. It allowed me the opportunity to learn new things. It was pretty hard when I could not help the customer because they did not make enough money to qualify for the insurance and the state had not expanded their Medicaid so there was nothing to offer the customer except and apology.
good,Company is very union based. It makes unions look bad. I was hired as part of a large hiring spree. Most people believed it was for the union contract votes. Most people hired had little to no skill in their hired field. Made the environment pretty negative.
good,great work environment  fast pace uild great relationship with beneficiary's hardest par of job will shift difference great day awesome day at work keep moving fast pace stay postive
good,"Shift bids occur twice per year. Front line management is overwhelmed by the quantity of tasks required, resulting in poor communication with front line workers. Middle management is better equipped to resolve issues. Fast-paced work with frequent updates to procedure result in KPI goalposts being moved several times per year."
good,"In my opinion a typical day at work would be coming in with coffee ready to work. I think management should welcome the employees into work for the day, I would get everything prepred for me to begin work before work began so that i could start on time. The workplace culture should be relaxed and open. I would make sure my work was all up and then go to lunch. An hour is always best but 30 minutes is also great.. I would work and complete all of my tasks without being told to. The hardest part of the job would be not going to the restroom alot. The most enjoyable part of work would be the environment and the atmosphere."
good,"I enjoyed working for General Dynamics I didnt approve of the Management that they had, I would have chosen more qualified leaders for such an important company."
good,"Helpful people all around,and friendly environment. I would recommend this job to others. I liked the job and I think others would too."
good,"going in and doing what is expected of me, when I am expected to be there, always learning new things and how to do them, being flexible and open to sudden changes in things, I adapt easily I am fast paced and get along well with others."
good,"I'm glad I was blessed with good work crew and managers! there's no reason in this world to have a job you hate and are miserable!! Ruins everything! So therefore, when you have good people surrounding you at your job, whether it's the worst day of work EVER at least you can turn around and be stress free with your friends!"
good,"Great job, with fulfilling duties. However, due to a poor management culture, the work environment is sub par. The benefits are great and start immediately after training."
good,Very helpful management team. Plenty of opportunity for advancement. Lots of training and encouragement from the training staff. Great benefits. Would recommend this job to anyone looking for   gainful employment.
good,"Basic call center job, eight hours of inbound calls filling out applications and trouble shooting computer programs. Dealing with irritated customers and explaining in details the insurance application."
good,Great place to work with open job opportunities through out the company to move up in positions in little as 6 months. Very friendly and loving workplace
good,"I enjoy helping others including colleagues, clients in the job task necessary. If I cannot help in my position alone I would research any resources I could find. Able to work fast or any pace as needed. Also, available when needed outside regular hours."
good,I really feel that given the right individual this is a great place to work! I can say that I have enjoyed the job! i enjoy most of the consumers that call in!
good,This place employs so many people. The building is big and so is the parking lot. I had a lot  of fun working here and met a lot of great people. Definitely one of my favorite jobs.
good,IT's a good place to work. centrally located. high paced environment. It's not for everyone but I enjoy it. Wish they observed more holidays so I could spend time with my family
good,"This was a great place to work if you need benefits.  The pay was not bad to start, but it is fairly easy to move up.  I would suggest this to anyone who has had a hard time finding a good job."
good,The organization is very large which allows for a lot of advancement opportunities. The biggest issue with a large organize is that you eventually become just a number.
good,General Dynamics is a well paying job that is very structured and a good company to work for. They have good benefits. The hardest part is working the overnight shift and having a family. I have learned so much about insurance and customer service.
good,"I've been employed with GDIT for over 4 years and I do enjoy the work, benefits and the schedule is why I'm still there. Management needs some work, supervisors are lazy"
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed working with GDIT and GDMS employee's we have work days that are not all serious while still maintaining a steady work flow.
good,This job is great because it offers incentives to do things you should already be doing; like coming to work. I am currently being surprise laid off by them because of the lack of calls we are receiving. Our branch is being shut down but they gave us two months notice so I guess that is nice. Not much else negative to say.
good,Good job to be employed with. Great benefits for both full and part time employees. Strict work environment. Great sups and managers to work under. Often high call volume
good,I believe the work that is done at General Dynamics is very important to the medicare industry and to the individuals that have questions about their medicare plans.
good,"Good place to work.  9/80 work schedule is nice.  Can be sometimes volatile due to Government defense funding."
good,"GDIT likes to switch up their teams almost twice a year which can be a good or a bad thing.  I was lucky enough to get onto a super team / great leader / easy going; however a few months later had to switch supervisors, and the job just wasn't the same."
good,"In some ways really great, but they very dishonest on the out come of the current project and after assuring the team there was no need to worry, began lay-offs."
good,a typical day at work was very smooth environment and call flow management was pretty good. hardest part of the job was dealing with disappointed consumers but the most enjoyable part was pleasing the consumers.
good,"I have spent my entire 30 year professional career at General Dynamics. I have learned invaluable management tools, have had a myriad of opportunities and consider them to be one of the best in the industry of defense contracting."
good,Working for General Dynamics was an extremely easy job. They are not willing to work with any sort of schedule though so only apply if you don't have anything else to work around.
good,"Enjoyed working there."
good,"Every day I would go to work on time, sign in my computer, check emails for any update on the information and get myself ready to take calls form consumers. I have learned how to analyze, document , and resolve issues during each phone calls. My supervisor was very helpful and friendly. My co-workers were fun to spend breaks with and play games during our slow call time. Hardest part of the job was to calm the consumers down when they were having some issues with their health plans and they wanted me to solve it right away. They most enjoyable part of my job was to be polite and talk professionally to the consumers and automatically they would calm down."
good,I literally just went to work and did my job and left. The location in Sumner was managed by unprofessional people. The environment was more like a High School Building and the Drama that comes with it.
good,"Purpose driven environment that can be a bit disfunctional.  Always supportive of employee needs, but will take advantage if employee doesn't speak up."
good,"I enjoyed having my breaks there. very relaxing"
good,"Drafted new IT networking for Air Force Bases through out the world."
good,"Enjoyed working for the company and working hand in hand with the USAF, great to see project come to completion and the communication update for the whole base."
good,A typical day at work go to my desk login to my computer pre pare for the work day speak to your desk buddy and proceed with providing excellent customer service to those on medicare
good,"Help member fill out application , transfer over to supervisors when they did not want to speak with me . submit application and provide them good customer service skills."
good,"GDIT supports it's employees, provides fair benefits and fosters a pretty supportive atmosphere. Team unity is a big deal and it seems to promote a good work life balance."
good,This company was a very powerful company on the waterfront. Working in this company gives individuals the opportunity to learn and grow in their field.  the downside to this company is that it is a major corporation and looks out for the company as a hole and I feel that it has lost site of the value in each of its employees as individuals.
good,Service Desk and NOC located at the site helped to keep the teams working together.  Great team of people worked there during the time I was there.
good,"The contract was successful in developing, installing and supporting many IT systems and applications. Descent pay, good benefits, and a good working environment."
good,Busy environment and good work place to help people in need of Health insurance both private and Medicare. Great training and room for advancement if you want it. Feels good to answer and help people with their problems daily.
good,Mostly managed myself and kept the AFC policies.  Cancelling consumers or not enrolling the poor was the hardest part.  Nice food kitchen and employee potlucks.
good,"Days go by fast always something to."
good,Good company advancement opportunities are out of reach.  Alot of great people that work here.  Hardest part of the job is not knowing.
good,"GDIT, is a great place to work. Benefits are awesome, and having a 401k is the best. I do wish that the supervisors were nicer in answering questions. but, overall good place to work at,."
good,I did like this job it was fun it felt good to help people over the phone the work/life balance should be considered and the management might need to be re done but for the most part good job
good,"Great job with great benefits. Always helping consumers on a day to day basics. A very rewarding job, and nice and friendly staff and coworkers."
good,great place to work great people as well as amazing management really enjoyed the environment as well as the work I did here
good,"open friendly atmoshpere"
good,"performed security duties"
good,"I would go in sign get to my locker pick up my headset. I would then log into about 15 different systems. Go available for inbound Affordable Care Act customer service. Calls would be me either advising the customer that the website wasn't working correctly and filing a paper application for them. Or, I would instead attempt as many times as I can on the website to get them through the application. I would answer any questions about the new law. Either ending with getting the customer applied and approved or customer would have to wait to recieve approval through the mail. I learned a lot about managing customer complaints. I also learned a lot of empathy and how to handle a very upset."
good,"I enjoyed working for general dynamics. Everyone was extremely helpful and would assist if you were in need of room for improvement. They also had great food vendors that came to the site. General dynamics is very flexible with your shift and understand if ""life happens""."
good,Got to meet a lot of new people. Enjoyed teaching what I know. Hardest part is what you make it. Great experience. Give you the option to stay involved with making changes to learning material
good,GDIT provided a stable foundation for me to begin my career in IT. I started as a shift lead and quickly advanced to system administrator. GDIT had the resources and tools to effectively teach me the knowledge I would carry with me into my future jobs and career.
good,This was my first call center job which lead to me becoming a Acting Supervisor. I learned a lot about the health insurance field as well as communicating with insurance companies and their agents. Some of my co-workers and supervisors in the call center are very positive.
good,Great job. CSR at a call center answering inbound call and signing customers up for health ins. Supervisors were helpful.
good,GD is a great company to work for. The company likes for one to be involved with management and work as a team. My co-workers are amazing and helpful.
good,"teilweise unstruktiriert"
good,This is where I learned most of my customer service skills. Supervisors and leaders would help as much as possible to be successful at our jobs.
good,"Not much oportunities, and the schedule is not very accomodating. The breaks are lunches are to early and it feels like a very long day."
good,Good company to work for....fun team of individuals working together to make a difference.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers we support.
good,"Management has some work to do. Direct manager is not well-prepared for the position, however, the project manager that I support is as sharp as they come."
good,High volume accounts payable on an Oracle platform.  AP department for three divisions consisting of roughly 20 people.
good,"great bnefits,great pay,decent training. very bust center with support froem sups and co workers.friendly job setting and nice inncntives for the employees"
good,General Dynamics was a high stress fast paced call center environment. Typical day was solving consumers and fellow Co-workers issues and ending every call with a solution geared toward the consumers needs.
good,"By the nature of its business and reputation, the company has a highly conservative and risk averse culture. It tends to hire highly talented individuals for both technical and management functions."
good,"Good Pay, they offer good benefits. Management is responsive to employees inquiries and demands. You start as seasonal employee, but if you do what you have to do, you can become permanent."
good,"Worked as a CSR under the Affordable Care Act answering questions about the new law, assisting consumes with questions and signing them up for health insurance."
good,Job was great. Loved the JOB TASKS. But the thing was with this job that I didnt like was The points They limited the points available to receive before termination and that was very low and they didn't work with you if it was an emergency.
good,GD is an outstanding company with great communication and great benefits. I would love to work with GD anytime. They are one of the most leading IT Firms.
good,"A typical call center job. You will meet new phone, make new friendship, but also learn how to be great in customer service."
good,"I spent my work day on the phones in an in-bound call center in a Customer Service capacity. I acquired more skill in Customer Service and learned what it was like to work with a Government contractor."
good,I enjoy the work done there.  I get a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment when I am able to help people.  My co-workers are an awesome group of people.  Very diversified.
good,"All that is good but work is work and it could be fun and at the same time productive.  Its up to us, management and the crew.  It about hiring the kind of people that belongs in the kind of work.  Then set up a training program conducive to the type of customers we need.  Another word there should be a training program caters toward developing a CULTURE that will focuses on all aspects of the operation."
good,This company was a very good company to work for.  I gained a lot of knowledge working with this team and was able to grow internally with them.
good,It's not a horrible place to work. The dress code is casual/business casual and my co-workers were great. Upper management could use some improvement but no place is perfect.
good,"Hardest part of the job is that if you work for the Marketplace, there is very limited information to relay to the customer since it's still relatively new. There are plenty of scripts to read verbatim to the consumer but there are a lot of questions I couldn't answer for them, especially if they were having complex issues with their insurance company. I also hated being stuck to a cubicle and not having enough time to go outside AND eat, or at least see outside. It's also impossible to interact with coworkers unless the call volume is slow, but that really wasn't a huge problem. The benefits and pay were great and plenty of opportunities for overtime. There were also many opportunities to up-train or dual-train in order to qualify for higher CSR positions."
good,"working customer service sometime can be a hard job but for this company it was very easy , you have help every where and your helping the beneficiary s with anything"
good,I enjoyed my time at Vangent.  Good management and decent benefits.  My only complaint was the lack of job security.  They have recently went under a name change and I cannot speak of how things are now.
good,its a pretty good place to work I has its flaws like others may but it is good pay and good benefits I would probably recommend it
good,"Its a friendly atmosphere, but things don't always work how they need to and information given is not always accurate or up to date."
good,The hardest part of the job was having to know 100% of each federal healthcare program when everyone else including supervisors only had to know one.
good,"Typical day at work, we would hold a morning meeting, and we get our work assignments and go to work. Learned to communicate to effectively get the job done in a timely manner. Management was non communicative at times. co workers were good. ive learned a lot from them. highly motivated individuals. the hardest part of the job was assignments. most of them were time consuming. some were a huge tasking with a short amount time to complete the tasking. Most enjoyable thing was learning different equipment on various types of navy vessels."
good,"I only worked here for a few months, (I was a contractor). I realy liked working here. Worked with a bunch of realy talented people."
good,"The moral within the company was pretty low throughout my department. The job itself was an easy task to perform on a day to day basis. Due to new management leading my team , as well as some new policies set in place that lead me to pursue employment else where. I am very thankful for the opportunities and quick promotions that General Dynamics offered me. Thanks to the training I received and the highly intelligent individuals I worked with in my department I was molded into a model CSR and for that I am great full. Thank you General Dynamics for the tools you equipped me with that will make me truly successful in the customer service environment"
good,My main employer has been GDIT where I began working as a customer service representative beginning in August of 2013. I have since then been promoted to a Quality Specialist. I have enjoyed working in both departments.
good,"Very busy for 6 months of the year, then expect to lose your contract due to workload dropoff. Management is constantly changing and quality is a joke."
good,Great Company. Coworkers are great people. Management is fair and personable. Location is an inconvenience for me but overall GDIT is a great compnay to work for.
good,"not much to say. have had some good moments there, but it's time to try something else. for the most part, a positive experience. learned a lot."
good,They could give compliments were they are do. But this place is so busy and big that it is so unorganized. I would have liked to be able to work from home b/c it's answering phones and the supervisors could even work from home. It would be that easy for this company.
good,"co-workers were very friendly and help full, learned more on questioning,management good,hardest part nothing really enjoyable part the people."
good,"La journée type est de voir ce qui ces fait avant et de s'assurer que pour votre quart il y est le personnel voulu pour comblé la production."
good,I was working for GD as an Emenu consultant. They did some innovative stuff with Rose RT. Treated their consultants pretty well except for some specific people.
good,I enjoyed working for this company but I knew it wasn't something I would like to continue to do or something I wanted to make a career out of.
good,A typical day at work was either handling calls for the Health Insurance Marketplace or Medicare calls. I learned about how to plan and compare drug and health plans. The purpose of the Health Insurance Portability And Accountability Act.I would log in and check my email to make sure what type of calls I would handle for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job is no matter how frustrated the callers' are when the call began they hang up satisfied because you made every attempt to help and provided them with the information they were looking for.
good,General Dynamics is a solid organization with a great reputation in defense contracting.  I appreciate the opportunity and I am proud to have been a part of such a dynamic organization.
good,"I like working here because I got to help people enroll in great health insurance plans,"
good,Took calls for health insurance. help people enroll. Did application for people.
good,"This is a good company because of its global presence and one can travel from one part of the world to another if their project required it. The benefits are great but just like other companies out there, there are still some bad apples set to corrupt the vine."
good,Opportunities for diverse careers with strong focus on engineering and government contracts.
good,"Duties included answering inbound calls and assisting customer with any questions they may have dealing with, but not limited to, Customer Retention. it was wonderful & fun as can be. to bad its a seasonal gig."
good,"I would answer calls for Medicare and help beneficiaries with various problems and different situations. After passing disclosure to make sure your not giving out information to the wrong person, I would then proceed to ask probing questions and restate the original question back to the caller to confirm their particular question. Once I identified what the problem was I would make sure to acknowledge and if applicable apologize to the beneficiary while gathering accurate information and then providing an easy to understand solution. This job allowed me to use and strengthen my communication skills substantially. It was a very rewarding job because you actually got to help out so many people with their Medicare benefits which can possibly improve their quality of life."
good,"You start here in 2 weeks of training. Which is expected. However, the trainers were not even employees of the company, so they had very limited knowledge of the company and on the floor situations. When we got out on the floor, we didnt have our own supervisor until about 3 or four weeks after training ended. Very hectic. Most employees work monday through friday, however i had split days off. Thursdays and Sundays.  But, at the end of the day they pay you more than enough to put up with the inconveniences you have to put up with. Once we had our supervisors things went much better."
good,Work 8 to 12 hour shifts 5 to 7 days a week to meet a fielding dead line of a new Army vehicle during a time of war.  The Team Chief was a normal retired maintenance sergeant attitude blunt and no nonsense which I was use to.  Dealt with it and paid a good wage.

good,I enjoyed the fast pace of the company. Planning the construction of Navy Vessels was very challenging and rewarding.

good,"This company takes care with their employees. We have good benefits , enjoy working for GD."
good,High call volume call center with friendly customer service reps
good,"This position was both fun and challenging, it was my first time in a very long time, learning a completely new vehicle, and system. Management was similar to BAE, prior service, so communication suffered. My co workers were helpful in insisting me in my efforts to learn a new system. I enjoyed this job most for the learning experience."
good,GDIT provides a great leadership support team which assists its employees.
good,Very complex business.  Provided equipment for UG Govt. agencies to their tight specs.

good,People are nice. The building are outdated but the commute are great. The products are good. The work flow and work load are excellent.
good,"entering data for kash for klunkers program"
good,"Enjoyed working for the company.  Great benefits.  Some days were slower than others, more than I cared for there to be.  That made the day go by slower.  Overall, management were very helpful in getting issues resolved.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with slow days."
good,"In this position, I lead 52 agents in the coordination of benefits for Federal Retirees. As a contracted employee for the United States Office of Personnel, I assisted retirees join health plans, find plans that suited their medical needs, and opt out of Medical Coverage to join plans such as Medicaid, Medicare, and commerical health plans. This was a temporary assignment."
good,"I answered about 300 phone calls a day, and within them calls I learned how hard and difficult it is for the elder to get assistance with medical needs."
good,Good pay and benifits but layoffs do happen. I advanced quickly and had the oppertunity to use  various skills
good,Typical day at work assisting consumers and providing excellent customer service.
good,"Fast paced call center"

good,"-A typical day of work consisted of accepting customer calls, creating customer applications, and following their appications through to enrollment in various Healthcare plans."
good,Working for the census is a very different environment to work for....
good,Really easy place to work as long as you are familiar with computer and can take people cussing at you.
good,"Not a bad company, you will learn a lot about computers and your comunication skills will get better but they do lay offs often."
good,I enjoyed my time working for General Dynamics and was given many opportunities to learn new skills.
good,Effective and efficient policies.  Best practice standards followed.
good,"National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, commonly referred to as NASSCO, is an American shipbuilding company with two shipyards located in San Diego, California and Norfolk, Virginia. It is a division of General Dynamics. The San Diego shipyard specializes in constructing commercial cargo ships and auxiliary vessels for the US Navy and Military Sealift Command; it is the only new-construction shipyard on the West Coast of the United States.[1] The Virginia shipyard primarily performs ship repairs and conversions for the U.S. Navy."
good,I learned how to work and provide a vital service in a high-paced high demand environment.
good,Company was known as Anteon Corporation at the time. Was great to be introduced into the military contract career. Enjoyed visiting and working on several posts in Southern CA.
good,"Check for updates or changes to the training for Affordable Healthcare. Train Customer Service Representative on information about the Affordable Healthcare Act, how to fill or assist consumers with filling out an application the explain their options clearly."
good,This job was really good and you get paid good. The only problem was that it's extremely stressful working with healthcare especially these days and some co-workers should have been drug tested more and background checks. Management is really good most of the time so great job if you can deal with stress and immature people.
good,Managed sites all across the United States.  I enjoyed support military service members and civilians.
good,Helped deploy new laptops.  These upgraded users from Windows XP to Windows 7.
good,Classified environment. Worked with data and customers in retrieval.
good,"I answered MEDICARE calls from seniors or persons with disabilities from all across the continental US. I assisted the clients with crossovers, fraud alerts, claims information, and coverage information. Many agents were not very knowledgeable about insurance and that frustrated many MEDICARE callers. I helped to the best of my ability and was often given 'Kudos' on many calls. I actually learned the intrinsic details of insurance and never rushed a caller off the phone. Still, I maintained the 90% quality rating which is the company standard. The hardest part of the job was many clients called when they had a problem or concern. I never lost my temper with a caller and I am great at calming someone down while providing a emphatic ear. The most rewarding part was seeing someone g from crying on the phone to laughing after 10-15 minutes."
good,"Corporation seems dedicated to supporting military and federal clients. The particular contract I worked for was managed by a  corporate office in another state, which still provided strong administrative support to employees like myself at remote offices."
good,"The job was not hard but working for the people in management was stressful. There is not a lot of chances to advance. The job is more of ""not what you know but who you know""."
good,Have learned a lot and would recommend this company to individuals seeking employment.
good,"You take phone calls from consumers with issues/questions. You handle them in a timely manner, making sure to log all your scripts and what actions you took. The people are pretty good that you work with. But due to the jobs being government contracts, your pay can not increase unless you become a supervisor or move to a different department, which may have a better contract."
good,Typical day started at 5 am and could it by 3 or 4 pm and there were many mandatory work day on Saturday. Getting accurate and consistent stream of information was difficult for many reasons and the mission could change within a matter of hours. The hardest part was that I had little or no time available for myself or my family. The most enjoyable part was the opportunity to do research.
good,"GD has a very can-do personna.  Most work involves tweeking existing products, or squeezing out performance from existing product lines."
good,I enjoyed the projects that we worked on during my tenure with Vangent.  I did not like that end of the year and government budgets had such a stopping effect on the project.
good,Nice place to work but required me to be away from home too much.
good,"a typical day at work – a typical day at work is very difficult to describe, I would never know what work could be coming in the door and so on normal days i had to make sure that i stayed on top on my maintenance schedules and routine work in order that in peak times i could deal with the additional demands.  My role was self managed on a daily basis and so i needed to make sure that i had organised myself for current and future activities.  I needed to liaise with third parties, customers and ensure that equipment was all available for any future bookings and so good communication and planning was essential. "
good,"Good company while the contract was active but the internal CAP program is a waste of time.  GDIT has no idea how to utilize the people they have on staff.  Once its over, its over"
good,This is a great place to work. Most employees do not work on site. There are many opportunities.
good,"Working overseas could be quite challenging due to the fact that you have a much longer work day along with more working days within the week then a job that you would find in the United States. A typical work day would range from reviewing resumes for any candidate who was interested in working for the company, interviewing candidates over the phone,setting up files for new employees, managing existing files of all of the company's employees, working directly with management pertaining to the interviewing and hiring process of new candidates, counseling employees for whatever discrepancies that they may have within their department, and managing employee benefits. My job believed in cross-training and tried to get all the employees to help out with as many aspects of HR as possible. "
good,"I get to work about 20 minutes early everyday. I get logged in and bring up everything I'll need for work. I am a technical lead as well as an account manager. I create, delete, transfer, suspend accounts as well as deal with permissions for users. I am also there as a reference so the techs have someone to ask questions if they don't know the answers/resolution. My management is out East so when I hear from them it's normally in email; mostly to the masses. I have wonderful coworkers and being around them is probably the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"Took an internship not in my field of study, but enjoyed the people I worked with and even was given a scholarship for an essay written on leadership experiences."
good,this company don't really care about the employees its good pay but its really not to much to say about it

good,"Developing/training, coaching, motivating, retaining and evaluating qualified staff. "
good,"I only worked at GD for a short time due to lay-offs. I enjoyed working there, it was a good work environment with flexibility and excellent pay and benefits."
good,When I was training soldiersl it was a good day.Been in the motor pool with the soldiers was a great feeling.
good,It was excellent assisting Medicare Beneficiaries over the phone with their insurance coverage.
good,Some really great employees.  But you get laid off alot.  The work is very fulfilling.
good,"Technical Writer for one DoD contract.  This job was where I learned the basics of technical writing and enhanced my skills dramatically, providing the opportunity to increase my salary and position in the years to come. I only left GDIT (then Anteon Corp) because the contract was taken over by Lockheed, so I followed the contract."
good,"I manage a team of four technical writers and one training specialist.  We work on multiple contracts for our DoD customers. I learn new things everyday!  The contracting world is very complex, and I enjoy the challenge.  The hardest part is the occasional public speaking that is asked of me - do not enjoy the spotlight in large groups! I am a very outgoing, self-confident person, however, and my superiors assume this makes me an orator.  NO. :) The most enjoyable part of my job is the people here at GDIT. My employees and coworkers are hard-working, friendly and professional, which makes the atmosphere a very pleasant one."
good,I worked independently with various levels of senior management.
good,"•	Co-coordinate and book  travel (Domestic & International)"

good,"Respond to telephone inquiries within the set departmental staffing and time parameters."
good,"With over 3,000 employee you learn a lot of how to manage different personalities. Learned how to make training fun. Company made sure all management was trained on all HR and State policies and laws. This was a temp job that no one wanted to be over."
good,Sign in to computer and phone get settled in start workflow answer phone calls ...Always on the phone no cut back time i talked to elderly people sometimes rude people but Productive
good,Everything about it was fun and enjoyable. The only flaw was that this was a contracted position. Plus the contractors worked more efficiently then the full time workers.
good,A typical day is pretty standard with reports and day to day affairs.  The hardest part of the job is addressing emplouees compliance to established managerial standards.  The management and coworkers are political and at times can be immature.  The most enjoyable part of the job is travel and flex schedule.
good,"Employees are great, trainers are great and the weight it has on a resume is a plus. Very professional company though it has a big brother feel to it. There is a lot of understanding for the rules that are made, but some go to far. No coffee machines, nothing at your desk. It feels like an extremely strict catholic private school."
good,Very exciting place to work.  Exposure to advanced technology hardware.
good,Working environment is pleasant and up lifting.  I look forward to engage with new challenges everyday.
good,First company I worked that was will to pay their employees what they were worth.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering calss for 1-800-MEDICARE. Providing callers with information about their claims, MEDICARE eligibility, services that are covered under MEDICARE."
good,"typical day is answering incoming calls for borrowers of the department of education, explain accts and help with getting pymts lowered. Management really doesn't interfere much, really only there it seems to make sure people are there on time and keep track of status. most coworkers don't really like the job, only because of the angry borrowers. the hardest part of the job is not being able to show the borrowers face to face what we are talking about, showing them on paper."
good,Working at this functional area of GDLS was challenging and stimulating as we attempted to get connectivity to our deployed and other remote sites. I now fully grasp that no matter how well you test things someone will find a way to make it fail. I worked with the service organization staff to bring support and security updates to our users computers as well as working directly with our users. Our department stood as a team to accomplish the tasks set before the IT department. The hardest part of the job was testing the intended upgrades and solutions in the field so that we knew what to expect as issues with our users. I have enjoyed working in this organization as both the support side and the customer side.
good,A typical day at work was taking calls for Medicare and helping customers with their coverage. The management is always there to help you out when you have questions.
good,Work constantly until first break then everybody sit down and have breakfast. Everything we did was almost always together as a group.
good,"A typical day at GD includes managing maintenance and engineering projects. Supervising hourly skilled trades employees and maintenance management supervisors. I also plan the daily/weekly maintenance activities. While being at GD I have learned how to work with many types of employees and how to manage a variety of different skilled trades groups and a variety of different types of projects. The management workforce at GD is mostly senior employees with 30 years of seniority. Their manufacturing experience is limited because they all spent their entire careers at GD. My co-workers are hard working, fun, and they all have a certain skill that helps our maintenance team succeed. The hardest part of the job is balancing all the different projects and activities. The satisfaction of completing projects successfully makes my job enjoyable. My co-workers also make it enjoyable."
good,"Over the nine and a half years of working with the company, a lot was leaned. There was a high turnover rate of employees but for those of us that stayed until the end, it was mentally stimulating. We all cross-trained and could accomplish almost any task in the absence of another."
good,Nice company to work for. Many people would enjoy working for the company.
good,"all my fitting skills, learn and practice, i own it to the company"
good,Nice work environment and good benefits and office equipment.
good,"A typical day for me starts off with a very fast paced and unpredictable environment. I've learned patience, empathy, and whats its like to walk in others shoes. My co-workers are the best! I get along with pretty much everyone. We all support each other and do our best to assist our patients with the highest Customer Service skills. The hardest part of my job is not being able to see the patients because I work in a call center. My patients are very fragile, some are upset because of disabilities, limited income, and deadly illnesses. Although they go through alot, and it is very disturbing at times, I have a passion for assisting people."
good,"No paper zone. Unable to use your desk, and Management does not care about their employees. If you choose to work here. Only use it as a temporary status until something better comes around. You are not aloow to have your electronic devices in the buiilding, i.e cell phone or ipods."
good,"• Managing major aircraft maintenance, modification projects through directly reporting airframe technicians as well as coordinating support from the back shops."
good,Customers have always been happy with our performance. Never a dull moment in the workplace. Made many friends from the customers we served.
good,Work with internal and external customers to ensure GD's supply chain requirements are being met.
good,I answered phones continually to give people information on how to obtain their passport. I had a siystem that we looked up many different scenerios. It is not cut and dry. Many people were at the airport or border and did not have their passports. It is not easy to get passports in those situations and I had to come up with the best possible solution. Other people did not have the documents to obtain a passport and I had to expain what possible ways they may be able to obtain a passport.
good,I was a Buyer for General Dynamics with customers within the U.S NAVY.
good,"Do administration, Manage Employees, Write reports for my supervisor."
good,"Part of three-man mobile team responsible for maintaining all aspects of security management including technical, physical, and administrative methods of protecting IUID information and systems i.e. assessing unit inventory, equipment request, equipment installation and closeout reports."
good,Great place to work. I had great lower level managers. I learned a lot about the manufacturing and design interface and the problem solving skills required.
good,Direct general insurance was a great place. You can work with many customers and make sure that the have what they need.
good,Working at vangente gave me experience in telephone customer service.
good,My direct sup did not know I was laid off untill I was walking out the door
good,I liked the hours i worked.
good,good benefits
good,Excellent company to work for. I would be more than happy to work there again.
good,It's a fast pace call center for Medicare. The people are friendly and fun.
good,"The overall contractor experience has been positive but some of the internal workings are not to the standards expected. The lines of communcation from management to workforce are weak and not well defined. Some very talented resources with a true ""serve the customer"" attitude."
good,"In my position, I work mainly alone traveling for long term assignments with little supervision. Hardly ever see or work with other GD employees. Management and co-workers are very supportive when needed but do not try to micro manage your time or assignment. Best part of my job is the traveling, but that is also the worst part as most assignments are long term (ie 6 months to 1 year or more)."
good,"Good example of a grate place to work with good enviromental, nice clean restrooms."
good,"Sporst like, soccer basebal, good recycle program"
good,It was my first job experience and I liked it a lot. People and the company were wonderful.
good,Excellent company (for a big firm). They are conservative and have a lot of processes. Not a place for entrepreneurs.
good,"Productive and great place to work, great benefits and good people to work with"
good,lots of hours offered in a fast-paced physical environment offering opportunities to work lots of hours and overtime with very good benefits.
good,Management o.k. / Engineers: Great bunch to work with. Wide range of projects to work on.
good,Gen. Dynamics is a great place to gain talent and enhance your skills. They want and encourage to you continue to get the training hrough there online sources or in other learning venues.
good,"One of our civilian supervisors was out of touch with our cadre of instructors, personal issues away from the job. When students were in session, most of the group pulled together and maintained the curriculum and training standards. A small group within  our larger cadre drove away some good personnel with office politics and differences of getting tasks cvomplished."
good,Good place for employment.  Great opportunities for growth.  Training/ certifications are encouraged.  Good management. Can  be a fast paced environment.
good,"- busy environment "
good,Improvement is needed to maintain employees and to assist in their quality of life. Contracts are key to their success and contractors are underpaid for the services each contract provides.
good,"Women were under scrutiny at all times ( this was after a new boss came in)"
good,I am doing alright here but you get pigeon holed in a job and your stuck there. Your pay advances but you get bored w the same old same old a lot of people here will not reach their full potential because employees are held in their team like property. For the good of the company they should be allowed to advance. I really have no reason to gripe I have a good job w/ good pay. But since u  u
good,"I enjoyed my time at GDIT, and I think anyone who is comfortable with the call center setting would also. The wages seemed fair for the work, management was reasonable, and I had an overall positive experience."
good,Great company depending on what contract you work and your location. Not alot of room to advance. Pay raise is few and far between. Management at the London location was wonderful so long as you do your job.
good,"no thank you, I enjoyed working for GDIT but there was a cut back on the contract and lost my slot. I would happily go back to work for GDIT if given the opportunity."
good,"As a federal contractor, your experience will largely depend on the government agency project you are assigned to than by GDIT. Almost all aspects of your job will be dictated by the client agency. If you don't like the project you're on, they can help move you to another."
good,I love working for this company but there is not alot of room for advancement. The benefits are great. 2 weeks vacation after 2 years and free Health Insurance.
good,It's sometimes challenging being out here on the client site but I'm surrounded by other talented people producing quality software for the federal gov't in a great area of DC.
good,The one in Hattiesburg is now maximus it was miserable after the takeover. No one trained us their new systems it was the blind leading the blind. I loved grit I wish it would have stayed the same.
good,Typical Day was pouring over my students submitted material and grading their performance on papers and such. Taking phone calls when students had questions on assignments and helping shape young US Army soldier. A lot of great retired NCO's to work with.
good,"Training Sailor's to improve fleet performance, i learned the latest information in order to keep the sailor's up to date.  Most enjoyableis knowing what you teach  will improve the Fleet."
good,General Dynamics is where I gained my first real experience of call center performance. It opened me up to a whole new world of Customer Service and I loved it.
good,"All our team present by 9 am, and start our work as per our user stories. Our stand up at 11:00 and we talk about our tasks and blockers in our stand up. And weekly we have Release meeting, User story grooming and Code review meetings."
good,"I loved the challenge troubleshooting and repairing RF circuits and other electronic equipment provided. What disappointed me, is they stopped caring about the employees and cared about the bottom line more. Went from Christmas gatherings and monthly celebrations; to NOTHING for anyone who wasn't a ""degreed"" manager."
good,"Too much work for the pay but the pay was good."
good,Good company going through a lot of changes due to their new acquisition. Employees either stay for many years or have moved on within  a year. The opportunities to grow and small.
good,"Flexible schedule, friendly employees.  Fair PTO accrual, paid holidays, health/dental/vision marketplace with many options.  Complex purchasing system"
good,Not as supportive when family issues requires my absence.  Did not support the use of telework to allow me to be productive while taking car if family issues.  Would not recommend this company to anyone that has family issues that requires constant attention.
good,"I was here for 13 years but was made redundant."
good,"Show up, do your job, go home. It's pretty low-key, management is juvenile overall, and the organizational structure and opportunities for advancement are not great, but if you want a decent pay and decent hours with opportunity for seasonal OT, it is as good of a job as any."
good,I enjoyed working for the FSAIC campaign when I first started. The CFPB campaign was not as enjoyable. The management was not good and the job extremely stressful.
good,"Most of management are great to work with.  If you are tech savvy, you would be considered an asset on the work floor.  The opportunity to show leadership is available."
good,I enjoyed a lot of people that I worked with and even some managers but they seem to favor certain people and don’t hold them to the same standard as other people. It’s not a hard job if you pay attention to the training but it can be very stressful dealing with unhappy customers and I have worked in other call centers so I was used to that but these were the rudest customers that I’ve ever encountered. You have to have a lot of patience to work here.
good,"Positive:  No worries about the work not coming in, place offered extensive work for its employees."
good,Great work experience security was very well active at all times job was well at keeping everyone's info secure shift was mandatory lunch breaks were short overall a good career place
good,It's an okay to be but you need to know who to talk too and when to talk. You can run across some unprofessional supervisor and messy as well. Basically the same for CSR.
good,9 hr days and 4 hr day on Friday. able to buy time off . hardest part is being perfect all the time. good benefits though. I have no problems with working there
good,"At first I was scared to take on calls to help the consumers, because i was scared I couldn't remember which scripts to use or how to use the system, but in due time with guidance i picked up pretty quickly and I wasn't scared to get a call."
good,The day started when you turned on your computer. You typically had about 5 minutes to read all emails before going to work. Sometimes you had to have additional training before you started to take calls.
good,Its a nice job but there really isnt much room for growth in the company. Not one of the best call centers to be at but the pay is ok. Great place to start at the very least.
good,"On-site government contractor, worked with civilian government employees and with military personnel. Day to Day contact and office culture was on a military base."
good,"good place to work not bad work with your schedule sometimes"
good,Technically challenging environment. Work comes at different times often unexpected. Must maintain broad knowledge and awareness of many products and technologies.
good,"Fast paced work environment, a lot of sitting, talking on the phones and typing. I learned time management. The management in the company is friendly. The hardest part about the job is sitting for long periods of times. I enjoyed the diverse environment while I work there."
good,"Working for GDIT, has been a good experience for me. They certify you to become customer service representative, and the pay is nice. With them being a federal based job, there our lots of discounts and incentives one could qualify for."
good,"Typical day--to work early, relaxed atmosphere though you had work to be done ASAP"
good,"I would listen to calls taken by CSR's and review them to ensure they"
good,"Management care about employees and keep culture of family first. mid level management is super good. I worked there as a business analyst for about one year, all together it was a good experience."
good,As I was promoted I found that my benefits were actually lowering and not increasing.  I lost health coverage that I had before I was management.  It would seem like you would receive more benefits as you moved into senior management roles.
good,"Keep records of assigned cases, and prepare required reports."
good,"Easy work, quick training, friendly staff, day goes by fast, easy money, always someone there to help you. Human Resources is not on the same page with each other so if you have an issue, you need to do it the same day and get it resolved no matter what"
good,"Pretty good job if you like helping people, The job was enjoyable and laid back, and the management didn't tend to micromanage a lot as long as you were job oriented and didn't require the additional supervision. All my experience with management for the most part were acceptable the only issue I found was many time there was gross misinformation given about company policy depending on who you were speaking with, they needed to be on the same page more often. the hardest part of the job was trying not to associate yourself to much with the beneficiaries while still trying to help them as much as you job permitted."
good,Hard to excel and work in a team. Nice Management but didnt inform me properly of whats ahead. Would also be sitting in meetings and people would be throwing arguments at one another where management had to correct it.
good,i left the company because  the A/P department was moved to  Needham MA. Genera Dynamics  purchased the company Anteon Corp oration where i fist employeed.
good,"This company had it's advantages and disadvantages.  Steady work environment but had it's mishaps and downfalls.  A great stepping stone but sometimes stressful and exhausting hours.  Being employed here was challenging, but highly appreciated."
good,"I liked where I worked.  The people in my team were fantastic.  However, even within the Security Team as a whole, it was a dog-eat-dog world.  That and lack of cross training and pay advancement made me leave.  However, if offered a job there again, I would come back."
good,"Leader in technological advancement, land systems development including the m1a1 tank platform and stryker vehicles."
good,"GDIT is an okay place to work, but it would help morale and reduce turnover if the contract were renegotiated to allow raises to be given for performance and tenure.  Adding vacation time for years of service would also help keep people motivated to stay."
good,The job itself was easy to do because everything was already in a script. The hardest part was finding a faster way to get to the script you needed at the time of the call. Management/Immediate Supervisors need more training on retention of employees rather than waiting until it is too late to help or warn them that if certain behavior patterns are not corrected actions would have to be taken including termination.  Keep the English and Spanish speaking reps separated and make certain the supervisor can speak both languages.
good,"General Dynamics has a good reputation in the defense contracting industry. They are very competitive and therefore some of the employee perks of the old days are diminishing however that seems to be true for all large defense contractors at this time. "
good,"•	Providing Exceptional customer service through telephone/ computer communication systems"
good,"Call center work.  Lots of information needed to perform job but information was all easily found and available, other employees a good resource for information as well."
good,Nice working place.... They need to learn new way of winning Government contracts. They lost CMS Infrastructural contracts cheaply to another smaller company.
good,"This is a good job and has good pay, rather relaxed pace with great people to work with, like any job it can have stressful days but for the most part its just a steady work flow, its a job i would go back to"
good,"Overall a good place to work to gain experience for entry level applicants. Decent pay, Attendance and quality assurance is a big factor.  Job site is closing permanently"
good,"long work hrs ,and lots of work only downtime was to wait for parts. But other work could be found to do . got a chance to work on many different types of tanks and army armor."
good,"Great people to work with on the shop floor -- different story in office area."
good,"This was a position that I had never performed in my work experience.  It was a call center, which I didn't know if I would actually like it or not, however, I didn't enjoy the actual culture of this workplace because to me it wasn't about how well you did the job that you were hired to do, which was take calls and assist the many people around the country seeking healthcare through the Affordable Care Act, it was more like you really were pretty invisible unless you brown-nosed with the managers and supervisors.  However, it gave me great pleasure to help people to the best of my ability and to make sure that they were satisfied with the Insurance that they ended up with."
good,"It was a great place to work at , really relaxed , and good hours. My manager was really rude though never dealt with anybody like that in my life ..,"
good,"I don't want to write a review on this company. You will have to experience it yourself to determine if its a good fit for you. The pay can be more. But overall, its a place to work."
good,"A typical day at work is answering inbound phone calls, answering questions about health insurance plans and policies,and provided peace of mind. I've learned to be more patient and empathetic and learns policies.  Management was inconsistent but over all professional. The hardest part of my job was learning to keep calm, and the most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to enjoy my time with my co-workers."
good,its was a great career to work for them I had a baby and didn't go back so now that I had my baby I wont to go back or find a job so that I can provide for my family....
good,I enjoy the atmosphere and the coworkers are nice. I also enjoy speaking with the consumers and helping them apply for health insurance. I also enjoy being able to assist the consumers with their needs and talking with them.
good,"I worked as a contractor for about 2 years."
good,"It was a good company far as getting experience and taking it with you to your next journey . The company was not ran smoothly, the supervisors was not on the same page . When"
good,Great place to start in the insurance industry. The skills I learned from there helped me in the position I'm in now. I also met some great people there.
good,Overall I enjoy working with my co-workers. It is also nice to know I am a part of the first people to be asked for help. Management supports education goals.
good,This job was very in demand for customer service.It was the face of Medicare and the beneficiaries was mostly senior citizens that wanted to understand their plan and to be enrolled in a plan to cover their Rx.
good,Advancement with GD is difficult in the contracting arena because you are billable to the customer the company often doesn't want you to change positions.
good,"the company it's self is a good place to work, But when it comes to upper management there never on the same page with the supervisors."
good,"This job was great, except its temporary goals for employees. This company picks up a load of new hires to use them for a couple months then drop them. You can advance if you go through the ringer of training."
good,"It was a great place to work at, the pay was great. Although it would get tough when the customer wasn't satisfied with thier outcome but we managed to get through it."
good,"GDIT is just as good as all the other top tier defense contractors. Benefit package was great until Obamacare ruined it for everyone. Compensation is on the higher side compared to other like companies. Work environment is decent, but as always, there is at least one person who tries to ruin it for everyone else, so that makes it typical. Hours are good, leadership is very hands-off, which is both good and bad depending on the situation. career advancement is great for new and intermediate professionals and becomes much more competitive as you go up. Over all, it's a good company to work for with great pay, but terrible benefits and also is lacking in the time-off department."
good,"There’s no down time it’s always a busy day so the day will go by very quickly; the work environment is good and the facilities offer cafeteria, star bucks food services and a Gym.  The hardest part of the job is its never enough hours in a day to get the job done the good thing about sitting on site, if you have a problem/question about a project assignment the person that can assist may be in the next cubicle or down the hallway preventing a delay in completing your assignment."
good,Calls were regarding insurance coverage for themselves and family members and additional questions relevant to the marketplace.
good,General Dynamics is a wonderful place to be employed. You have an opportunity to grown with the right guidance. Great Benefits.
good,"General Dynamics NASSCO is a premier shipyard and the only full service shipyard on the west coast of the United States. It offers a competent water front training school that does well at training people with little to no experience in shipboard machinery and equipment. "
good,"Co-workers and agents were a lot of fun to work with and made several life long friends."
good,"My experience at General Dynamics was good, although certain things were pretty alarming e.g. The center had bed bugs, twice, but insisted on letting us work despite the situation. Overall, I liked my job because I gained free health insurance, the pay was decent, and most importantly, I was actually helping senior citizens."
good,During my time at general dynamics information technology(GDIT) i enjoyed helping customers in well suited environment fit for anyone with the knowledge an skills to obtain such a responsiblity.
good,This is a contract job and we never know when it is going to end. The co workers are great but working for the government takes it's toil on a person.
good,"Tasks are distributed every morning, learned to operate different machines, also obtained my Forklift certificate. organized projects and delivered those to there specific shops for manufacture"
good,"I found it to have great job security. The company looks out for his employees, as long as you are a worker.. Lots of locations to work at, so it is possible for you to transfer to another location."
good,"I get along with co-workers, everyone is willing to help each other out, very good environment, from the managers to the workers.  Also willing to share knowledge to get the job done."
good,"GDIT is a government contractor so as long as there is a contract to work on, you will have job security. It can get frustrating working with the government on occasion."
good,"GDIT provides a god backbone for learning opportunities and a good variety of employee benefits. Communications are good and often, but generally employees working on Government sites do not benefit from the company culture and are disconnected to the company- they live the customer culture."
good,"If you like call centers, you will like this job. Various shifts available, benefits, small chance to advance. Must be on prompt, eye for detail and good speaking voice. Ability to read a must."
good,"Great production atmosphere that pays very well, one the top paying production companies. Management is pretty flexibe but like all production compaines job sercurity is anything but."
good,I enjoyed assisting the callers with their issues. Management  had an open door policy. They listened to your concerns and provided feedback to your concerns before the end of the business day.
good,"Nothing unusual, normal military contracting politics, decent pay.  Maybe not the best environment for women due to some minor misogynistic tendencies inherent in the field."
good,Hard work day with a fair team effort. communication seemed to be an issue between supervisor and employees. I enjoy job completion; being apart of a finish product.
good,".General Dynamics is a pretty good company to work for if you’re starting out with a work history.  It is also good for people who have had other careers and are semi-retired or want a change for a while. A typical day is answering phones all day. Management has an open door policy which is great.  It allows you to go to your supervisor or a manager if you have a problem, without having to worry about a chain of command.  Overall my co-workers are great.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when you have a difficult caller or an angry one, and you’re able to help them resolve an issue they have struggled with.  The hard part is, at times you just cannot help people, which leaves you feeling helpless"
good,I enjoyed most of the travel and places that I was able to see and enjoy during my employment. Met a lot of friends who will be friends for life.
good,"exciting place to work, meet new people. Help assist elderly people with their medicare needs. Certification for centers for medicaid and medicare."
good,"excellent work schedules, caring HR department. management was above the norm in every category. excellent parking but did have a high theft rate on street parking."
good,I was happy to enhance my career working at General Dynamics Land Systems. I worked with some wonderful people. The most enjoyable part of my job was protecting the environment.
good,"Difficult to review GD, because we provide onsite support to a DoD agency and work onsite in a peer-peer environment there.  I find my GD managers/co-workers to be capable and pleasant, and the benefits are in line with (if not slightly better than) other similar companies; however, my overall job satisfaction is driven in large part by conditions in the DoD agency, which are largely unsatisfactory."
good,"This is a good company to work for. The pay is good and you get pretty decent benefits. However, you start off as temporary. So employment is not guaranteed. Advancement is also hard."
good,The position I was in was very stressful. We were a team of ISG. Internal Support Group. We took supervisor calls. I truly enjoyed working there.
good,"the money is ok, but supervisors and management are TERRIBLE!!! How do they GDIT expect you to respect someone that doesn't respect you and confidentiality does not exist in that building at all majority of the supervisors and management there(Chester, VA) act like they are still in high school. The only time they in force the rules is when CMS or guest from another country come. It's so sad; it's bad when you go to HR to let them know someone threatened your life and the response is, 'there's nothing we can do; the cameras in the back don't work'......REALLY"
good,small office setting with good group of people; understands work / life balance; ability to complete work without being micro-managed
good,"This was a very easy job. The only issue I has was with management, coming from a background of management I believe a leader is only as good as their team. A lot of Supervisors did nothing for their teams, if you needed help or assistance you were better off asking the person next to you."
good,"I am in charge of 26 agents who work for government insurance. In reaching our goals, I try to make it more interesting and fun for all of us through competitions and team-building exercises. "
good,High call volumes without a second in between.  Great management team and co-workers.
good,"To get into, as long as you are the type to ""make friends"" instead of doing more work, or work harder, you will make it a lot further from what I have seen.  There are some diamonds in the ruff when it comes to management, I would say that some are for you, and some are against you, and it is sad to have a manager who to your face is ""friendly"" and for helping you, but when it really comes down to it, they stab you in the back.  I do like the idea that they have with employing military people, but I would like them to take more consideration into those who are ""just here for a paycheck"""
good,"GDIT is a great environment people-wise but there is stagnation of ideas within the management. There is a tendency of management to be blinded to incompetence while being dazzled by BS. In other words, a person who can create great spreadsheets is placed in a position much higher than his, or her, level of ISD competence should allow while people who are great leaders are left to languish in mid-level roles."
good,I would be willing to return if offered a different position with better pay.
good,Spend 8 hours taking back to back phone calls. I learned I do not want to be a phone representative for any company. We did get breaks through 15 minutes every 2 hours worked and a 30 minute lunch. Lots of overtime opportunities during the main season
good,"Family atmosphere with peers.  Close-knit relationships. Recognition of accomplishments is lacking. Praise is minimal, rebuke is not. Project manager is driven by annual bonuses which comes from end-of-year profits. Keeps most of profits for self and very little flows down to the backbone."
good,"Medium Company with room to grow, able to acquire new skills by taking classes provided by the company through third party. Able to move into another position with ease."
good,"Decent job, pretty much 9-5 but hours are usually flexible depending on test system availability.  Co-workers are well experienced and professional, generally working together as a team to complete major testing events.  Individual responsibilities include familiarity with MS Office Suite, creating and editing test procedures and formal reports, creating and briefing technical presentations and interfacing with technical and government persons to communicate satisfactory completion of stated system requirements under test.  The hardest part of the job is usually uncertainty of direction from the customer as interpreted by management resulting in confusion of tasking at the worker level.  Management is usually not as engaged with the day-to-day functioning of the testing which results crisis management or duplication of efforts.  I have learned how to work more efficiently with complex requirements, translate them into actionable tasks and apply pass/fail criteria to them to assess their completion."
good,"Never boring - always something new and exciting to work on."
good,"Typical day would be I show up at the office at 0720, 0740 safety meeting begins. At 0800 drive your personal vehicle over to the service bay start unpacking a connex into the bay. Move vehicles into the bay and start servicing them. At 1200 take lunch, 1300 go back to to work until vehicles are complete or 1530, whichever one comes first. 1600 start doing time-cards on KIOSKS (2 laptops, 10 people).  1630 leave the work site for the house."
good,"The culture of General Dynamics is goal-oriented. Customer service is a high priority and nothing short of that is acceptable. The hardest part of my job is the demand of knowing how to identify the sensitivity of information being processed and the cause and effect if the information was to be made public. I enjoy my day to day interaction with my co-workers and would hate to leave working with them but of course, family comes first. What I enjoy most about the job is the work schedule, 6 am to 2:30 pm. I've grown attached to this work schedule since it gives me flexibility to do personal things when leaving work while having most of my day available."
good,Very stable company to work for.  Good pay/benefits. People work for this company for a long time which makes it hard to get a promotion.
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"GDIT is a good call center. Management is very helpful in assisting with reviewing your work and knowing where you need to improve. All positions are on a temporary basis and your shift could change at anytime.The wages and benefits are really good and depending on what department you work, in certain times of the year you could end up with as much overtime as you want."
good,Believes in ensuring that you know the company standards and policies.
good,Easy job to work but a lot of nonsense that has nothing to do with the job.
good,GDIT is a good company with opportunities for growth and development.
good,"Working for this Company was a very good experience."
good,"I work off site from main GD offices, but from what I see the organization is great."
good,"GDIT is a great company to work for.  It's a very fast paced environment and that makes the day fly by.  The people are great and they have no problems helping one another out.  Hours are flexible, making balancing job life and home life very easy."
good,"Install labels on different systems on different ships. I learned about different systems on ships and how they function independently and how they interact with other systems. Management tries to make you feel good. Coworkers are for the most part cooperative. The job becomes hard when the information you get are erroneous. "
good,"In-Bound Call Center for health Insurance, I love the work that I did and enjoyed being able to assist people."
good,"I worked at General Dynamics full-time for a year. – I work for an good management team and great coworkers. GDIT has a very good job culture, job work / life balance,  & good compensation."
good,I would just go to the site and walk around the building looking at the infrastructure for telecommunications being installed.
good,"Good hours, Learned a lot about management and control sofwares, I was working in a contract position so my co-workers were not employed by GDIT. Good management. Hardest part of the job was communicating with outside vendors. Best part was the hours and the environment."
good,"Typically answered questions about Affordable Care Act, helped enroll consumers, and dealt with irate callers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with healthcare.gov. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers."
good,Great company to work for. Many retirees and civilians make it enjoyable coming to work.
good,"General dynamics is a very repetitive job, not necessarily a bad thing though. My job consisted of answer telephone calls from consumers from all across the USA with all different types of backgrounds and accents. I would take the consumers information such as social security numbers, names, addresses, telephone numbers, ect. I would inform the consumer about the affordable care act. I would walk them through the sign-up process and finally pick a healthcare plan with them. The hardest part of my job was explaining to some of the consumers that they do not qualify for a subsidy. The most enjoyable part is having a very low to no income consumer, qualify for a very high subsidy and their healthcare come out to be very cheap. To experience that type of excitement with a complete stranger is beautiful."
good,"fun place to work if you like to work,good friendly atmosphere,parts are heavy and hot out of the production machines"
good,"•       Primarily for Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) Army and DoD funded projects, evaluate new exempt, minimal risk and greater than minimal risk human research protocols, consent forms and supporting documents; Note deficiencies and make recommendations to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and protection of human subjects in DOD-supported research."
good,"I loved working for this company, only problem I would say was that management and a few co workers relationship was a unethical."
good,Typical day at work would be to review documents check for accuracy to approve clients for Junk for Cars programs and file confidential information as well as monitor.
good,Every thing goes in cycles and there are years it is the best place to work.
good,"Very good company. I worked on a project that was managed in Calgary but located in Ontario. With Government budget cuts my position was cancelled. Excellent benefits, good salary and outstanding support from Staff managing travel, benefits, pay etc. Would love to work for GD again some day. Alot of special people."
good,Working for General Dynamics Land Systems is like working for any of the other big defense firms.
good,"General Dynamics is a great place to work with great benefits, tuition assistance and encourage a strong work/life balance."
good,"General Dynamics an acceptable place for employment.  Most of the senior management appeared ok, but lower level management left little to be desired."
good,"a typical day of work was usually not to stressful, and there was plenty of work until early 2013 when the federal government cut back drastically on their orders causing several lay offs.. Management treated all employees courteously, and respectively, and co workers usually all worked together as a team. Hardest part of the job was the heat in the building during the summer months. The part of the job that was most enjoyable was I was in the back by myself and was never pressured"
good,I loved my job here! I had a great boss and worked with a fun and driven group of people!
good,My daily activities consist of supervising material handlers and making sure parts are delivered to the prodcution line in a timely manner. My direct supervisor has helped me improve my leadership skills tremendously. I also get along with all my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is to get every individual I supervised to perform their job at the highest level. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity I have been given to work in different buildings and learned different functions. Overall my experience has been good.
good,Management is bottom line oriented and nothing else. Typical data a as government contractor consists of doing what the client wants with little input as to the task that are appropriate.
good,"This job was easy but could be complex at times which was ok. Learning to work well with the other sections was a challenge at the beginning but it all worked out. The different teams all worked well together, at least from my area. We had fun even when we deployed together, which brought some of us closer together sense we only had each other to depend on in that environment. The hardest part for me was the 20 months away from my family preparing and being deployment out of 24 months. Leaders mostly came from Ft Lewis so they would only put personnel from there in leadership positions, even if some didn't deserve them."
good,A good work environment with lots of things to learn. A typical day includes the monitoring and troublshooting of a network. The hardest part of the job is the clients who demand results in so little time. Most enjoyable is the the people i work with.
good,"not much job security, mostly seasonal and temporary work. i learned alot about the medicare program. a lot of different types of people who worked there. some times supervisors made big deals about little things such as putting your feet on the amall garbage cans under the desks or standing up or even jackets"
good,"A typical day of work after you travel to the job location, wherever it may be in the world, consists of installing racks with computers and hardware; installing and instrumenting the worksite with cameras, targets, speakers, etc.; And terminating 90% of the cables that go to all of the devices."
good,"You will get calls from rude customers, that refuse to payback their student loans."
good,"I enjoyed working at GD because of my co-workers and the work was interesting, cutting edge. However, the benefits were being cut way back. They started the practice of letting go senior experienced people while trying to hire junior less experienced people. No loyalty to people who had been there for a long time."
good,"The overtime work was usually available if you wanted the hours to make extra money. For me, one draw back was it was a long commute each way daily on a swing shift."
good,Lots of training for the different jobs I did there--friendly people.
good,Great alternative work schedule and benefits.
good,"GD BIW, is a stable work environment with good benefits, very dynamic, rarely a dull moment. With such a large, older worth workforce there is little room or opportunity for career &/or wage advancement."
good,"Being able to create your own work schedule was amazing. Management was very professional and always supplied great resources. The contract side of things were difficult, which caused job security to be the company downfall. Overall I enjoyed my position, colleagues, and experience."
good,"Productive and fun workplace, but no room for advancement.  Contracts are never completely stable for the long term.  Some contracts have much to be desired."
good,"General Dynamics was a good place to work if you enjoy intense hard work at a very fast pace.  I was well paid but worked very hard at real estate acquisition, permitting and construction supervision."
good,"For the most part working as a GDIT contractor at USPS was a very good experience.  But the ever looming fiscal year end is always a contractor's nightmare, you just never know if you'll be continued or cut.  Regardless of your performance rating - mine was a consistent four out of a possible five through my five years at the location.  I developed many solid friendships, both postal and contractor, and leaving them was probably the most difficult aspect of my November discontinuance."
good,"At the call center we would help customers learn about the medicare services they had, make changes, or answer questions about coverage. The hardest part of the job was if you failed a call or couldn't resolve an issue with a customer that was beyond procedures. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers and team reward parties for meeting goals."
good,In 2013 Everyone from managers supervisors and trainers where very helpful and knowledgeable it was easy to get help cause these people had done the job. In 2017 lot different managment and supervisor they had never done the job of CSR.
good,"Company is not bad at all and would recommend working there, as long as you are able to travel. I really enjoyed working there and the benefits were not bad at all."
good,"Have worked here over 5 years with some of the best and brightest. Hardworking, knowledgeable, they never lose their cool and are always professional in the conduct of their duties."
good,The job was very multifaceted with great challenges. I enjoyed going to work an a daily basis. The people from GDIT were professional and reasonable. Great job!
good,GDIT is  a day where you can receive up to  50-80 calls  a day giving  peak season.  These  call can range  from  current  medicare  customers  or  to brand  new  customers.   Its  your job  to give  them   correct  advise  on  their  choices  for prescription  drug plans  as well as  health  care benefits .
good,A typical day at GDIT consist of answering incoming call pertaining to health insurance. I learned a lot about coverage with several Insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of the job was the my coworkers.
good,"The individuals were good to work with, however no direction from management. The company was good, but management of projects varied. Would work with them again."
good,Great place to work with okay benefits. The health insurance needs an overall change for affordability. The high deductible plan is not very good for working families.
good,"This company has many career options. The hardest part of working for this company is that because they are a contracting company, there is no guarantee you will have a long time career."
good,The uncertainty of getting laid of due to a abrupted policy with no granted substantial assistance was the worse loss ever of a well humble effort. Why was I challenged to quick after a recent promotion.
good,Fast paced enviorment that requires you to sit for long periods of time without getting to leave your office space. Breakes are not to exceed time given and you must be available for your shift hours
good,"Great company,excellent benefits! Supervisors are great! Management is a MESS! Unprofessional basically “hoodrats with a title”. Management made everything more complicated than needed"
good,Great place to work but very stressful. When I worked there a lady shot another lady in the parking lot. When your at your cubicle doing your work answering phones it's great
good,"Working on the most advanced Naval war craft in the world was both challenging and rewarding."
good,"Good place to work,good pay and benefits, the people are good to work with and everything is fairly modern. I enjoyed going to work there as the work was creative and enjoyable."
good,"Great Company, I have enjoyed my time there. Great training, and opportunities to learn in the company. The company is very well diversified providing a plethora of opportunity within."
good,"I spend most of my day interfacing with clients and project teams, either via phone, email, virtual meetings or in person.  Managing training projects is always interesting, something new is always on the horizon.  No two clients are the same, being creative and flexible is key to succeeding. The hardest part of being a PM in my eyes is asking a client for more funding to complete a project.  Developing relationships and trust are very important to defuse those tough situations."
good,"Gives you a lot of freedom to make decisions, good managers, very nice working atmostphere overall. Lot of training provided that are reimbursable. Many career tracks and locations to choose from"
good,Enjoyed working at GD. The work is come and go. Benefits are great and the match 11% of 401k. Tjere are many employee discounts available also. Great atmosphere!
good,Good company to work for. Being a background investigator however requires more time than the company realizes in order to meet production goals. Too much focus on minutia from OPM as opposed to real issues that could effect national security.
good,Wonderful atasphere to work great pay with great hours. The staff are great Co workers and very professional place to work they have great benefits as well.
good,I've worked for GDIT for almost 10 years and they as well as I have been loyal.  I take great pride is working for such an awesome company.  Having to change contract several times they have never failed to ensure that I find employment in the company.
good,Very good company to work for with the exception of some of the past Management  very clean work areas well laid out with the 5 s and push pull practices
good,"GDIT has a very strict attendance policy and requires you to be punctual everyday.  The overall work can be stressful, fast paced, and confusing sometimes.  I was able to strive in these situations because I used the information and tools that were given to me to gain more knowledge and be better prepared for all situations"
good,It is definitely a fast paced environment. Two 15 min breaks and one 30 min break and they clock you to the minute of break. No leeway to be late without taking sick time or PTO. Does offer great benefits.
good,I feel it was a good place to work.  Some of the managers were more fair than others and as far as the company they could have done better in the wages and how often a pay raise was given.
good,Manages/direct the overall work to enhance achievement of the goals and objectives. Worked with teams to accomplish the mission. Was provided several opportunities.
good,Very fast paced and stressful. Must be prepared to answer questions and deal with upset customers.  Question answers are available to be looked up.  Supervisors are available to help  with difficult customers.
good,"productive and on the phone with consumers all day handling insurance issues, E.I. loss of insurance, gaining insurance, cancelling insurance, making requests on the consumers behalf, and keeping them informed if we needed any additional information from them."
good,There is work and life balance and good compensation and benefits package. Need to provide more job security for employees and advancement for professional development. The management needs to improve the relationship with employees and company culture.
good,"I worked 8 hours a day Mon-Fri. My supervisor was great, most management was okay. You had to be a fast learner, the job was individual work. I liked the job."
good,"I had love the job when i was working there, it is a laid back job and also quick paced. The job is easy to catch on with what’s going on. Great schedule"
good,Worked remote. Worked in GD office very seldom. Work with same customer for two and half years. Variety of different projects. Call center environment.
good,It’s an ok place to work like all jobs you have pro n cons. So with that being said you take this job and do your best you will succeed in any department you go to.
good,They worked hard to teach each person the ins and outs of the job and how to do it. And there was a lot of practice prior to actually putting it into use.
good,"General Dynamics was a great place to work, if you enjoy a fast pace job with back to back calls then this is the job for you. I had a good experience working there."
good,"I enjoy working at GDIT.  GDIT does provide ways to advance/move around within the company.  Manager is very accommodating and flexible.  Good place to work.  Benefits include health, vision, dental, 401k, compressed work schedule, ability to wear jeans on Friday, paid time off, paid sick leave, etc."
good,"A typical day at General Dynamics involve answering calls, assisting consumers to enroll in Healthcare through the Marketplace.  Consumers call with various questions and you must be able to research information and respond with appropriate scripts."
good,a typical day at GDIT is reviewing insurance eligibility for Medicare program or completing and updating applications for marketplace. its very laid back there and they don't micromanage which I love but the company does have mandatory OT during the Open Enrollment and unlimited OT outside of OEP. I would say this position would be great for entry level people that are getting their feet wet in customer service or just getting out of school. I've been with the company 2; came back as a rehire because I couldn't find employment fast enough but its honestly just a job to make money with no real room for advancements. yes there's other positions like ISG or Claims that you can be cross trained in but that's about it and the pay increase is just a dollar and change which isn't much. you get 40 hours of paid vacation after a year of being with the company and 2-3 years you can to buy an additional 40 hours of paid vacation and for sick pay you incur .37minutes of sick pay every pay period.
good,Excellent management. Plenty opportunities for growth and personal development. The pay is always good and always new opportunities arise according to new projects and assignments or specific needs per contract. Opportunities acquire new skills and enhance knowledge and training in areas that will increase personal skills sets and over all market value. It is and excellent team and collaborative culture conducive to develop good relationships and make you feel  that you are valuable and part of something that is giving better opportunities to others less fortunates.
good,For what little time I worked for General Dynamics (GD) the work environment was pleasant. Enjoyed the opportunity to work as a instructor for what little time I was working for GD.
good,Was interviewed as dot net developer but position required working knowledge of SSRS which i didn't have sufficient experience with. A variety of technologies were used including Content Management software.
good,"It was a good place to work that paid well, had guaranteed full time 40 hours a week to work.  It paid $12.95/hr starting off, and had benefits.  You go to your work cubicle and sign in on the computer and phone, get the computer up with specific software open, respond to emails, and then start answering calls.  I learned to help as best as I could with the skills and information I had to help that customer to solve the issue they had, as timely as  possible.  Management wasn't the best, and it's a big company that has thousands of employees, and it feels like you are just a login number and not a human being with feelings.  Most of the workers and some management were very open, non-judgmental, and helped anyone that needed help with something.  Hardest part was telling people that didn't qualify for insurance premium tax credits that they made too much money for their states Medicaid system to insure them, but didn't make enough money to buy a discounted plan that was affordable for their family.  The best part was that if you wanted to work you had a stable shift schedule with available hours to work."
good,"Don’t recognize your accomplishments very well. "
good,"What really will make or break your experience is the customer that you work for. I personally feel that I work in one of the best locations and with the best customer on the GD books. So I personally love what I do every day. When this contract recompetes I will probably stay in the position with whoever the new company is. This is why I gave GD mediocre reviews because, aside from the fact that they deposit money into my account every 2 weeks, they don't do much else. What they do provide - pay, benefits, PTO, etc. - is just ok. Not the worst, but not the best either."
good,"They hire in large batches for seasonal, just before november, and again just before april. Past that, they lay off over half the CSR workforce, every year. But if you show up every day, and do your job the way they tell you to, you have a significant chance of being kept on permanent."
good,"GD understands work-life balance. If only GD would offer better compensation, employee retention would increase. GD was a comfortable job and was great if you do not plan to move up in the company. Although they offered tools to grow, opportunities were slim."
good,Came in and did my job - learned on a daily basis the ins and outs of medicare coverage options and drug plans service options - Management isn't the best but some management is great with great knowledge - workplace culture is what will keep you around - hardest part of the job is adhering to 15 minute breaks when it takes 5 min. to get out of and in the building - helping medicare customers with vital medical insurance options and drug plan options can be the most rewarding part of the job.
good,"Had a set schedule every day, know overtime and no weekends unless needed."
good,This job opportunity was very stressing and quick passed but very rewarding. Everyone worked as a time to support one another and sharing their knowledge with each other.
good,A typical day at work as a supervisor would include greeting the team which would allow me to develop a leadership relationship with a team of 20 customer service reps.  Check the team performance on how well they follow their schedule according to their work day for the previous day. Update the attendance tracker to track unapproved hours missed from work. Coach any csr that is not performing or meeting the company expectation when it come to performance. Review several different reports as it relates to the team performance. Discuss company policy for any violators. Create an environment that is pleasant.
good,Most of the stress was last minute items that really weren't that urgent.  Getting status updates from engineers is like herding cats.  The work is interesting.
good,when its busy its really busy when its slow its a laid back easy going place the people are fun to talk to and allow you to take the time to do your job right
good,This job was one of the better call centers that I have worked at. The hardest part of the job is hearing stories about people with Medicare financial and health related. The training program is one of the best I have ever been through.
good,"TA Leaders encourage creativity and process improvement suggestions. They are inclusive, offering opportunities to take on projects the member is passionate about."
good,GDIT is a strong company but a little slow to adapt to a changing marketplace and behind the curve on the ways it chooses to adapt.  It is reactive rather than proactive in adapting to a dynamic economic and market environment.
good,"It's a unique place to work. Very stressful, but rewarding. I don't think I'd recommend it highly, but the pay is amazing and if you like the military it's a good place."
good,"The Office Culture could use a little more morale. Employees tend to have better ideas when they have incentives and/or fun environment at work. General Dynamics has been great to me, I have no major complaints."
good,"I find my job rewarding within itself but, yes its challenging, yes the consumers can get under your skin and yell and cuss at you when none of their problem is your fault BUT for me, i accept every challenge and 9 out of 10 times my consumers are laughing, happy and are well satisfied with the help and stress relief of me helping them solve their issues.  The good always has out weighed the bad and I love being a customer service representative."
good,I worked with Medicare beneficiaries and assist them in any way that I could. That would mainly consist of the elderly 65 and up  or the disabled. It was a great working environment.
good,"Good place to work - not too stressful. Competitive, flexible work schedule, nice environment, good benefits, always something new to learn or experience."
good,Great job if you are a peoples person.  A typical day you'd go in answer about 7 calls a day and go home.  But right now it is open enrollment and calls are back to back.
good,This was a nice job and i did not want to leave but had to since it was only temporary. I also wish they paid more since we had to deal with a lot in this job.
good,"A typical day would include answering phone calls, completing and filing I 9 and W-4 paperwork as well as termination paperwork effectively under deadlines.  Meet new people everyday as they were interviewed and hired for new positions."
good,"Laid back good work environment. A good stepping stone in the beginning of a career. There is definitely a feel good team environment at the location I worked at,"
good,Great pay for the area; Not much time off for salaried employees; Little to no notice for cancelling vacation time; Excessive work loads for salaried employees.
good,"very good culture"

good,"A typical day starts around 7am.  I go through my email and put out small fires that might have occurred over night.  Then take a coffee break and engage co-workers.  Then work on the days projects, with day to day user issues mixed in.  Go to lunch with co-workers and resume working until its time to go home."
good,shifts change every 3 months and are set schedules. you can have exceptions for specific reasons like school or medical reason but its really hard to get a schedule you need. night shifts are relaxed and chill. they have alot of benefits. 10% increase if your bilingual (base pay is 12.53 in AZ) 10% increase if you work afer 7pm. overall really good environment.
good,Gerneral Dynamics is a good entry level position for somebody who is interested in customer service work.  They have a good starting wage and have benefits.
good,"Not enough experience with GD management since I was at the customer site for most of my career.  As a result, I did not have regular contact with my GD managers."
good,Due to the line of business the positions can be stressful but rewarding.  Your altitude is determined by your ability to learn the expectations of your role and to consistently follow them
good,"great job to learn about health insurance and how you can help people understand their rights and benefits. you come in do your job, come in on time and job will be easy and peaceful."
good,It was a nice place to work to help individuals better understand their insurance coverage. The job could get overwhelming during the open enrollment period.
good,"Everyone comes into work and does their job. And on breaks and meal breaks we can just talk and enjoy each others company. Management was ok, they were nice and helped  us with our job when needed."
good,The workplace is a great environment you feel at home. There are negatives are the management. The management don't check up on you. The co-workers are great
good,Work was busy for the most part and if overtime was available I worked it. Management was kind and helpful. Walking from the parking lot was a while away.

good,Should hold more meeting for groups of contractors particularly perform service for at customer sites which will help better function as resources can be locate or identify with ease
good,The working environment was pleasant with great support if needed. We supported the  Corp of Engineers here in the Afghanistan Theater. Making sure their network connectivity was optimal.
good,Good company but lays people off who choose not to travel. Very diverse group of employees. Some times it's hard to advance as a lot of these people have been employed for a large number of years.
good,"Fast past, and lot of talent to share knowledge and experience. A vast collection of disciplines and a great place to learn new technology and for advancement. Very helpful customers also."
good,"I really enjoy working here.  It is challenging, fast paced and  a great place to work.  Management is always looking for ways to improve and work really well together."
good,"Good pay , good people. Nice management , my friend got fired on the spot for bringing her phone through the turnstile and then I had to quit for maternal reasons."
good,General Dynamics Information Technologies is a leader in the Industry. A Fortune 500 Company that specializes in fulfilling the service and product demands of the Federal Government and its many agencies.
good,A typical day is taking calls from consumers needing health insurance and providing information pertaining to options available to them via Healthcare.gov. while providing peace of mind to consumers and maintaining privacy at all times regarding the consumer's personal information. All calls are recorded and scored for accuracy and professionalism. Sometimes consumers aren't happy with the outcome which makes it hard to console their concerns. When a consumer is happy with the outcome its a wonderful feeling to be able to help them.
good,Typically on a daily basis as a CSR the main concern is that customers receive a great customer service experience and adequate assistance with their issues. The hardest part to this job would be to sit in a small cubicle for long periods of time and repeat scripts constantly. The most enjoyable part of the job would be that it was not at all strenuous physical labor and you were able to dress professional everyday without the risk of getting dirty.
good,"A typical day at work could sometime be stressful and it also could also be great. The most enjoyable part about the job was being able to help those in dying need of affordable coverage be able to access good healthcare at a reasonable rate. The hardest part was not being able to help a sick, elderly, or even angry person with the affordable healthcare they needed."
good,The facility is ran unprofessionally. The training course and trainers are very thorough. The hardest part of the job in trying to manage your ATH. But the overall job itself is a great experience and would love to work at another GDIT call center in another state.
good,General Dynamics IT operates is a highly competitive market with rather tight margins and as a result positions tend to be tough to fill. The people one encounters are typically ethical and passionate.
good,"GDIT is a great place to work for. Working as a government contractor there is no job security. Great task lead and program manager on my last assignment. Compensation is based on your background and experience - this will vary based on the government contract requirements. The benefits are normal industry standards, two weeks leave, 10 paid holidays, 401K, tuition reimbursement, three levels of medical options with CIGA, dental/vision benefits."
good,"Can be a very hectic environment to work for both contracts that are mainly given for both CMS centers for medicare and Medicaid services , medicare and health insurance marketplace contracts"
good,My job was answering phone calls and providing help on difficult question on today’s insurance market with the new health care laws. I fill out applications and enroll consumers with the best insurance plan for them. I work hand in hand with insurance companies to resolve issues between the systems transmitting information. I also have a government clearance level which requires me to keep information private with the new healthcare laws.
good,"clock in work, speak with consumers you help them to the best of your abilities and you move on to the next consumer, a process that begins over and over each case can be different or same."
good,General Dynamics was one of my more enjoyable call center experiences because of the people. A very diverse community of people make up for a fun and open minded culture of people.
good,"My supervisor and manager created an environment that festered negativity. The management team while accommodating, informative and open to showing appreciation, they also showed favoritism and directly caused uncomfortable environment with inappropriate interactions. I learned a lot about insurance procedures, policies and companies. Medicare and Medicaid as well as how health Care works as whole for the bulk of America. My peers were the greatest thing about working there. a typical work day included interacting with them and helping them problem solve and vise versa. The hardest part of my job was delivering bad news to my consumers. explaining to them why they couldn't get health insurance, how they may have fallen through the cracks of the system. On the other hand it was most enjoyable when I was able to help my consumer obtain health insurance, or help them understand health insurance and its intricacies when they were so misunderstood before. When consumers called me so full of stress and by end of the call they were so relieved of stress, that was most enjoyable."
good,"Great place to work, Easy job to do, They have a great & thorough training process, the pay is good, they are very good with working with you on any accommodations you may need."
good,"I've worked in numerous call center environments and  when I got hired at GDIT I knew what to expect. "
good,"I enjoyed working with and helping all people from all areas of the world. It is nice to hear someone tell you thanks for helping them.  I enjoyed it, I am a people person and I am very good at customer service and talking to people."
good,love my coworkers and the job once things are put into order we had a great and awesome great place to work love the free food and that if you have a problem they will do their best to solve it
good,"General Dynamics has been a rewarding place to work. I have learned a lot from my time there. If you are not a motivated person you will not do well in the company. There is a place for skilled, motivated people there."
good,Typical call center supervisor duties. Management does their best to be involved and support their sups. Hardest part of working there would be with acting positions and seasonal employees.
good,"typical work day was ok "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping consumers find the answers they need to resolve the issues they have been experiencing.
good,Working for this company was pretty much a breeze. The job was pretty much easy but dealing with angry customers constantly does take its toll on a  person. The management wasn't the greatest and unfortunately because you're constantly taking calls I didn't get to speak too often to coworkers.
good,I really enjoyed the people that I worked with on a daily basis here. I also enjoyed being able to make critical decisions that were needed with very little supervision.
good,"The General Dynamics Information Technology workplace culture is professional and collegial. On a typical work day, I would begin editing stories early in the morning and work until I had met my deadlines. My managers supported my work and that of my co-workers and provided training. Overall rating three stars"
good,"Majority of the workforce seems to be Mexican or at least they're the ones always in the break rooms. I'm not impressed with the supervisor, I told her the guy behind me is always sleeping and she told me I have her permission to wake him up. Overall, its a great company to work for just not sure about our direct management. They have excellent security and a relaxed work environment. I enjoy having a parking garage as well."
good,"Lot of opportunities for advancement, but you need to actively pursue them. Managers are good, some of the VPs are. Work life balance can be achieved if you are not a Manager or above."
good,This company is very reputable... Compensation is good and Career advancement is quick and good as well. I would recommend anyone if they like the call center environment to work here.
good,"Typical 5 day a week schedule, usually over 40 hrs a week depending on your position. "
good,"acquired security clearance, got to work on cool cutting edge projects, management made sure I got to experience multiple projects within the company."
good,"This is about working on contracts. Once you are a part of this company, there is growth within the institution. you can learn and advance. Since this is contract work, it completely  depends on your ability to move on different contracts. I have learnt and improved in my area. So overall this is a good place to work. I would recommend working for this company."
good,"A typical day at work involved at least four to five different systems to access information to assist medicare beneficiaries with the coordination of their benefits within medicare or assisting them with reimbursing payments that were made by medicare on they're behalf that should have been covered due to accident or some such similar circumstance. "
good,"Great place to work with great benefits and an awesome attendance policy. Some great people with great attitudes, IF they were all the same. Dealing with HR is a pain, but is sometimes necessary. Dealing with second shift hours leaves no time for a home or cultured lifestyle. But second shift offers a shift differential pay."
good,GDIT is a good company.  More vision and leadership is needed.  I would recommend caution on positions applied for and make sure you know exactly what your role will be.
good,Touch all elements of Program Management from inception through Close Out. Very challenging environment. Comprised heavily in US Government contracts actions which induce a significant amount of restrictions and requirements.
good,"-Answering inbound calls "
good,Boss was very well organized in his career field couldn't have been a better place to work. Great environment and had friendly co workers great place to be and very inviting wish I did not have to leave.
good,Here is where I have been able to take what I've learned from previous positions and apply them to become a more efficient database developer.  Your task is your task and you do not have to worry about working on an application or software that's not in your description.  This is an opportunity to enhance your skills to become a subject matter expert (SME)
good,"Great Management, always looking out for their employees. Great place to work around other and have opportunities to move around and learn other stills."
good,This is a good place to work for someone who is more benefits focused than advancement focused. The health benefits are great even though the salary isn't. The jobs can vary widely because this is such a big company. Overall I enjoyed working with GDIT. They were very flexible with my school schedule and there were lots of chances to work from home.
good,"Call center, typical environment."
good,Here I received calls from Medicare recipients and read ready made responses. I learned a lot about Medicare do's and don'ts. Coworker are cliquish but pleasant. The hardest part is finding the correct response for the customer.
good,"There is no opportunity to advance in this contract unless you are willing to relocate.  It is a great place to work, for someone who is looking for simple, steady employment."
good,"Focused and hard working staff.  Teamwork and individual goal setting environment.  Internal advancement opportunities.  Good benefit package. "
good,"I am able to flex my time to adjust hours as needed for appointments, etc.  I have learned how to use their fraud detection application - Starts Informant and Sentinel.  Management is quite lenient and lets you do your work without much oversight.  The co-workers are easy to get along with.  Everyone is happy to help in anyway.  The hardest part of the job is training- since this is minimal at this job.  the most enjoyable part is finding the fruadulent providers abusing the insurance companies."
good,"This was not time consuming, but it was not organized at all. New company so it was understandable for a while. I liked the job, but overall I will not return unless I know some things have changed."
good,On a typical day I support Tier 1 and Tier 2 CSR's w/ locating job information to assist/support our clients. I transfer calls to the appropriate department or entity to support their issue. I have a great  and highly knowledgeable team that I work with that provide support and answers to me as well. The hardest part of my day is providing peace of mind to irate and angry clients.
good,I have been with this company for a total of four years. Throughout my employment we have changed contractors which have changed the way our business is conducted. I would have to say overall I am grateful that I have a place of employment where I am able to help others. On the opposite side of this pro I have a strong con with my company that puts you in a position sometimes where you cannot control what Line of Business you will be placed over. I would rather have the proper training prior to being placed in the position where I am required to be the leader.
good,Servicing the U.S military with Supply Chain consultation and services was a worthwhile and fulfilling job. I fielded a great team of logisticians that did phenomenal work for the customer.
good,"In a typical day, I answered from 60-80 calls from consumers interested in applying for the ""Obamacare"" insurance. Taking care of these consumers consisted of educating them with clear information about the insurance: length, price, and options available. Management was knowledge about the products and services as well as the employees. Things changed on a day to day basis and my job as a certified representative was to keep up with the changes and introduce them to the consumers."
good,answer questions about consumers medicare. High pace and call volume work place. Co-worker and management work well with each other.Being able to resolve consumer concerns. Not having the amount of time  need to resolve concern and it being held aginst you
good,"A typical day as a General Medicare CSR is simple but strict. The material that you have to learn is fairly simple, and all the information is expected to be read from scripts. The toughest part of the job is maintaining adherence to company policies including attendance, adherence to schedule, and average handle times for calls. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers and supervisors who are always friendly and helpful. Overall a nice and simple entry level job that requires little to no experience in healthcare."
good,"Flexible working hour, good benefit, and great people to be around. Company have plenty of activities for their employees (e.g sports event, family get together, and volunteer work for employees"
good,"Company has multiple governmet contracts to provide opportunity for various areas of expertise,  Health and dental benefits options are available along with other options for an employee with a family."
good,This job required logging into a phone and answering incoming calls for 8 hours.  It also required dealing with irrate callers and sometimes being the bearer of bad news about health insurance. The hardest part is getting cursed out for something that you have no control over.  Also dealing with management that doesn't treat each employee the same.
good,I have been with this employer for about 3 months and my feelings on it change daily. The nature of the job means that each day is different because you never know what kind of consumers will be calling you that day.
good,"General Dynamics was a learning environment for me about working  a large IDIQ.  I prepared new task order proposals and negotiated price awards, I also coordinated, organized and executed task order closeouts on the more than 1000 task orders against the IDIQ.  Management was fair and comfortable with promoting and allowing the employees to take on new tasks."
good,This is a good job to get call center experience. The shifts can vary from morning to night time which is good. The management is ok. The job can get repetitive. The breaks feel short but the pay is good
good,Daily routine is fairly standard for an IT job.  The hardest part of the job is due to the contract I work on the requires deploying to combat zones for 6-12 months each year.  The best part is the camaraderie.
good,"Great job if you like to travel, you can see many different places. You work on military equipment. The work environment is clean, and your tools are provided. You get to work on all types of systems, electrical, fuel, pneumatic, exhaust, and suspension systems. All trouble shooting and parts ordering are done with the use of a computer."
good,General Dynamics is an excellent company overall. After 10 years the benefits and pay raises have steadily decreased and things are not quite as comfortable as they once were.
good,I really liked this work we did here. I had a chance to help as if I would if I worked in the medical field. General dynamics is a government organization that took on the contract of enrolling America into the affordable care act. I was a customer service representative that made and received inbound and outbound calls also web chat mostly at the same time. My job was to not only to enroll but to educate as well. With mostly every call or chat I had to educate my fellow American about what they are signing up for and why it was important to do so.
good,"There is a great work/life balance at GDIT, often one can work extra hours early in the week and take off early on Friday, some assignments actually have every other Friday off. The work is challenging and a great learning opportunity. Coworkers are enthusiastic, competent and fun-loving. The problem is that when a contract ends, often times management hasn't lined up further opportunity for employees and lay-offs ensue. Overall, this was one of the best places I've worked, I spend 5 years there and would go back in  heartbeat."
good,For 3 years I enjoyed this position however it ended when GDIT lost 2 contracts I was a lead on and 2 others went into maintenance phase.
good,Benefits/pay good. Work/life balance very good. Not much support from day-to-day.
good,"During a typical day I might put together all necessary data for a given project and submit it for review in order to close out said project. If there was work to be done at an actual site I would go out and perform testing where needed."
good,"Existía un buen equipo y ambiente de trabajo, solo qué era un empleo por proyecto, y duro aproximadamente dos años, fué una empresa qué no supo liquidarnos a lo qué corresponde la ley."
good,This company is very versatile in the contracts it holds. The pay was good based off the location that its at. I personally had issues with some of the changes that interfered with what I called my normal day. However my co workers and management in the main program I worked for were amazing and I loved them a lot. They made me laugh and I was able to get close to a few of them but it don't work for everyone. I'm pretty lucky cause I'm a hard worker. Don't get me wrong there are other things that I liked as well like the people that I talked to. Some of them were great and others were what you would expect to be calling based on the program I worked in. There are pros and cons to every job so just focus on the good apples and not the bad ones.
good,"General Dynamics isn't like any job I have ever done before.  Its very structured, they have a lot of rules and are expected to be followed.  This job is perfect for those who pay attention to detail and don't mind being very busy and in some cases having to find ways to entertain yourself."
good,"Fast- paced call center environment. Loved assisting consumer with application process and enrollment in the Healthcare Exchange Marketplace. Unfortunately, the company downsized due to low call volume."
good,"A typical work day is mostly quiet, we work well with each other and help others when needed. They hardest part of the job is explaining to the caller that they do not qualify for assistance at this time. The enjoyable part is knowing you assisted someone to the best of your capability and they are really grateful for the help."
good,Vangent was a very cultured and diverse place of employment. I would recommend to anyone searching for a temporary full-time position.
good,I received great support while working here. I would highly recommend them to others.
good,"Very hectic environment, great reward in being a part of making history in the Affordable Care Act call center.  We had an awesome management team.  The hardest part of the job was managing people who really did not want to work, but managing the ones who did enjoy their job was a pleasure.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the process of the Affordable Care Act and the friends I met while employed there.  It was a great opportunity."
good,"they laid me off"
good,"A typical day at work begins with a verification of labor charging of direct charge personnel from the previous day, meetings spread throughout the day, and constant communication of problems and solutions via phone call, text, and email.  The biggest challenge of the job is clarification by the contracting customer of their expectations, and ensuring these desires are properly incorporated into contractual documents."
good,"Answer phone calls, learn more about different health insurance, I enjoyed helping consumers enroll into health care, hard part of the job is dealing with irrate consumers one call after another through out the day."
good,"We would have to log into the phones and computer. The wait for a call to come in the answer the phones per scrips. My suppervisor was a easy person to work for but there were others that were not that nice."
good,"General Dynamics is a strong company with a very diverse background."
good,The work at GDLS has been interesting and challenging. With program terminations and cancelations it has been difficult to see the work to fruition.
good,Great place to work. Nice work schedule.  Enjoy opportunity to work with other functions in the business.
good,"The hardest part of the job was the customer base itself.  The contract we worked for was enrolling consumers into a health insurance plan established by the government program.  Despite not having to sell anything to consumers, the job was difficult in that we had to work with a large volume of consumers who were irate because their online applications were not processed properly, could not be processed, or their accounts did not function properly."
good,G.D.I.T. is not a bad company to work for. I've worked for the Panama City site since it has opened to it's expected lay off in May of 2014.
good,"The contract that I am currently on is new and has some ups and downs. Its always changing rules and protocol. Management did not communicate job tasks very well and often after it had already been made obvious to the employees on a hands on learn as you go terms. "
good,"No time clock punching.  Employees are expected to accomplish tasks and responsibilities without oversight."
good,A typical day at work was fast paced. Most days there were back to back calls from people who wanted to learn about Obamacare and people who wanted to get enrolled in the healthcare program. The hardest part of the job was the constant calls with no breaks in between.
good,"Upon arrival checking what were the new tasks, taking assignments from your designated lead, and turning them into the lead for the next task. Many times the technical illustration department needed to clarify what was requested on an input. Many co-workers had a lot of experience and were willing to share ""tips"" from their experience.  The reason this was necessary is the best pictorial rendering may require a detail so no one viewing the drawing could misunderstand it."
good,managers easy to get along with;great bunch of people to work with;hardest part of the job was dealing with the know it alls and I have to it done NOW people.
good,Fair company. They reward smart and hard workers. Tend to not support their workers if the government is not happy.
good,"Just like any other job, you have good days and bad. This company has a productive work environment with good people to work with. A typical day at work varies on work load. Meaning that a typical day work load depends on bids for contracts for ship repair. "
good,A typical work day is preparing for classroom instructions to better assist the customer in their needs. Management ensures we are kept informed. All co-workers work well together. The hardest part that the customer keeping informed of changes. I enjoy teaching the system I instructs on
good,"Typical work day is coming in checking all the systems. Looking to see if there is any work orders and taking care of them. "
good,Vangent was a very good place to work. There was issues upon start up as to call volume. It was for a brand new government agency and their anticipated call volume was extremely low. They did end up doing a mass lay off.
good,"Every month on my team at work we decided that we will have an potluck, which an potluck when everyone on the team participate and bring in a dish. Two weeks before time we will all decide what kind of potluck we will have either breakfast or lunch, having potlucks with my team each time we have one I am able to interact more with coworkers talking about the different dishes we brought and things. Management always able to stop and just make everyone is doing right by making sure no one takes food on the floor and our conversations work-related and not so loud. The hardest part of the days when we have potlucks are geting full and going back to our calls all stuffed, but those be the times when we get the most precious calls from callers so we are able to assist. Helping out my callers make me happy and help me get through my day very smooth and time goes by fast because before you know it's your time to get off."
good,"EB is a great place to make your career. There are many benefits including a flexible work schedule and benefits, however working with the government can be quite frustrating."
good,"Great employees, along with good management, really make work fun and familiar."
good,The office I worked at closed and they did not offer to move the employees to different area if you were not in management.
good,taking inbound calls from consumer with claims issues. I learned alot about health insurance. I really enjoyed working at General Dynamics? I enjoyed probelm solving
good,"The work day begins with a sign in time  into your phone, between 10 - 15 minutes before your shift begins, so that you are able to go the company's main website to review any changes to policy or what new ventures the company is offering to the employees. I learned how to assist the callers in understanding their health benefits, policies and procedures of the Medicare system along with many other health related issues such as, changing physicians, medical facliities, and referrals to medians outside of Medicare to assist the beneficiary.Management was very helpful whether in the work in environment or with personal issues, everyone was very personable with we are all one time attitude. The employees also have a ""Team"" attitude and always willind to assit another, whether with answering questions for a inexperienced representative or keeping up team moral with fun games that not only were a stress relief but a learning aid as well. The hardest thing within the job is mantaining the satisfaction of the beneficiary, by trying to keep them calm with certain situations of their health, benefits , and also their rights as a receipiant of  Medicare. The best thing about this place of business is the benefits, pay, flexible schedules, but above all the satisfaction of helping someone else feel at peace, with their benefits of health."
good,I have been working with this company for over two years as a Material Handler. This job requires 75% travel to various places in the U.S year round. With that I have been able to work with all different kinds of people. On a daily basis I am constantly maintaining large amounts of inventory and managing equipment. The hardest part of my job is keeping everyone on the team equipped with the tools and supplies needed to complete their tasks.  The most enjoyable part of my job is supplying the soldiers in our great military with functional and reliable equipment for them to be safe out on the battle field.
good,"Pretty darn good. Pay is decent. The uncertainty of having a job at the end of the fiscal year is no fun, though."
good,"Daily production review meetings, very effective to monitor timelines and keep projects on track."
good,"productive and fun workplace at this time,it is a new facility that has just opened in our area"
good,Traveled to different military bases to repair weapons. My work team and supervisor were great. I had a lot of fun while also getting a lot accomplished in the day. Workload could get pretty heavy but it was well worth it.
good,"Trabajo a turnos rotativos, trabajando en ocasiones en equipo y otras individual. La jornada se hace muy amena, manejo de maquinas para la realizacion de municion de varios calibres para las fuerzas armadas. Muy buenos compañeros."
good,Excellent first opportunity for contracting. Enjoyed the NET Fielding aspect of the work and the travel
good,"Good basics, excellent management for me personally, learned that I am a good proof reader and got along well with upper management and co-workers who seemed to help each other out. Too much micromanagement since I had done work with contracts in the mortgage industry but over all very good interaction.  "
good,"Government contracting is a unique sphere. Even though GD is not a government entity, it is strongly regulated by the governmental entities for whom it works. Therefore, pay and advancement are not based on merit or talent, but upon seniority. The good news is, it's hard to get fired. But if you have ambition to excel and advance up the ladder, you'll have to leave. That's what I did. I left for a lot more money after I was turned down for a promotion and asked to train my new boss whose only qualification for the position was 30 years at the company."
good,"Manufacturing engineers at General Dynamics, Tallahassee, work on a wide range of electronic and optical, products. A typical day involves work on solving problems and improving processes in a hands-on production environment. Projects range from short-term, intermediate, and long range supplier issue resolution, to production improvement. The Tallahassee plant recently completed a Lean Six-Sigma Culture transformation in which measurable improvements are being experienced. The most challenging part of the job is to manage all of these incentives while keeping production going and quality high. It is a rewarding position because impact of your efforts can be experienced in a short period of time."
good,"General Dynamics is a great company as far as benefits, however I believe their pay could be better. Unfortunately, they are forced by Tobyhanna Army Depot to lay off many people, hand out pay cuts, and then freeze our pay rates for the unforeseeable future. The job is not very demanding but morale has gotten very low."
good,Good management. Very nice and inviting co-workers. Learned alot about running day to day operations of business. Very quiet office environment.
good,"Very nice place to work, but there was never any job security. Even though when I was hired I knew it was a temp. position."
good,"General Dynamics IT is an enjoyable work environment and the benefits are very good. I worked in a small office far away from the corporate headquarters so my experience might not reflect on the company as a whole, but the people I worked with made the experience there enjoyable. Working in the Defense Contractor field means that job security is something that is always in the back of your mind, but I was lucky to be on a stable contract for the first several years of employment and they try to assist you in finding other positions if your position loses funding. Overall it is a good company to work for."
good,GDIT has many pros - lots of contracts and coverage avaiable. Cons- cheap on health benifits - high deductables - seems like that's the trend these days
good,"Typical project development and deployment required my applying various skill sets to complete the job. Electro-mechanical design, test software development, CAD design, cabinet/test system layout, construction material selection, construction, debug and deployment."
good,Tasked with the integration of mechanical and servo system design. This division was comprised of a small group of engineers working closely to produce a mechanism with unique requirements.
good,All personnel within the company had outstanding ethics and values. Highly recommend to potential employees.
good,"Vangent is really a wonderful place to work if you can manage to get on full time. Sure, there are the occasional upset beneficiaries to put up with, but a gentle tone and a firm hold on the phone call will help get them off the phone and their problem will be solved. The only bad part of the job was that it can weigh on the mind. You cannot let them push you around."
good,A company that is willing to take risk in their hiring process. Good to veterans
good,I worked with GD for 9 years. We had very long work days and the company was dedicated to producing the finest quality equipment for the costumer.
good,"A typical work day consist of a lot of reading, writing and research."
good,"A day at work is either feast or famine. Working with C4 Systems on the WIN-T systems you work on the ARMY schedule. If you were prior service this is the ultimate position for you. The compensation is great, the hours are hard at times, but when it is slow, it is slow. You have to be a progressive learner, self motivator, and willing to further you education to move foward in the company. I personally enjoyed working for the company and it have few down falls. I would say work for this company if you have the chance."
good,Good benefits...good training...very good quality...good atmosphere
good,"I first signed onto this contract in 2008, and had admin right to perform as a network administrator, able to perform most functions, with the new contract we have been reclassed as hardware techs and lost most all rights, I don't mind being desktop support, but not just desktop support"
good,Your Review
good,"As far as giving Customer services time to conduct training and just off phones time to handle company business this company is excellent in that balance and understands that a Representative needs this time instead of being on the phone from beginning to end of shift,"
good,"Every day is different and interesting, managing the facility and conference rooms at my site. Early in tenure here, became involved in justification of office space for lease renewal. I was able to review office space alternatives with Corporate Real Estate and evaluate those for our use. Use of space has changed since I began with GDIT, and we are now attempting to reduce square footage per employee. An interesting challenge. Co-workers are pretty supportive."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in at 6 A.M putting on your smock, heal straps and ESD lotion. Looking up work plans to see what's hot and what needs to be worked. Management is always making sure you have work, or something to do. Co-workers are very friendly and always there to help you out. The hardest part of the job is working on flight hard ware, just know that many lives are counting on your hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job is you know your saving lives and making a difference in this world."
good,Great place to work. learned alot peers were great. hardest part would have been difficult custermers but that comes with the job and you kill meaness with kindness.
good,"Las labores se realizan en modulos que se instalaron dentro de las unidades medicas del IMSS, se trabaja de acuerdo a las reglas de negocio implementadas a nivel central, las funciones a realizar es credencializar a los derechohabientes del instituto mediante un trato amable y cordial, el enlace con soporte tecnico, operativo y representates delegaciones es por via celular."
good,"Very well trained people on my crew,we looked out for each other like family. The days flew by like there was not enough time in a day. I was fortunate to have a great team'"
good,The environment is good in that you are surrounded by very talented and knowledgable people. A typical day is atypical as you are always dealing with new issues and finding ways to mitigate them on a program.
good,production agressive team orrinated enviroment stressful envoriment. sucessfully rewarding.
good,"Excellent support, new design tools, good training, much overtime"
good,General Dynamics - IT was a very challenging but rewarding job. It allowed me to excell and improve my management skills.
good,"I work independantly managing programs for the United States Navy.  There is no room for growth, I am at the top of my game in my position.  Salaries have not kept up with the cost of living."
good,"I worked for GDIT as a contractor under an DoD contract on an Air Force base. I had one other colleague in my office working for GDIT and our supervisor was about 7 hours away in Atlanta, GA. We only had to contact the head office when there were conference calls or when our supervisor needed to speak with us over the phone. We were given autonomy with managing our workload onsite. Compensation was decent, but not very comparable with similar positions that were in the area."
good,Was a very repetitive position but overall it was decent Management was really nice and I felt good like i matter and was not a number.  Wish they would of been more flexible
good,Great place to work; however they lack the salary increase/raise potential and the work environment isn't close (no Holiday Party or other functions).
good,"Good people, but has since been sold to another servicer.  Entry level pay is not exceptional, but if the candidate is willing to stand out and make themselves available, effort is rewarded."
good,"Nice job should have better pay that’s Just About It . Everything Else Is Fine . Well Better Food In The Cafeteria Would Help Out A lot Too Other Than That , Cool."
good,best when in a centrally located facility away from big corporation as greed seems to have gotten the better part of them from what I have saw with most recent contracts re-competes
good,"It has been a good experience. Most everyone there is really nice and work hard to deliver the best at what they do. My managers did want us to have a good Work/Life balance. The hardest part of the job is working under government contracts, which are not guarantees of steady work. You can work hard, do your best, be recognized for good work—but if a contract is not renewed and you're lowest in seniority, you put your resume on Indeed. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you were supporting our troops."
good,Great people to work with.  Very friendly and very compassionate manager.  Teamwork and customer service was a vital aspect of the company policy. Recommendable company for any person seeking employment with a fun charismatic team.
good,self service computer training sessions  to assist employees advance in their careers. Company encourages employees to participate in free health programs and the fitness facility on site.
good,"There are many opportunities at GD for those who are willing to seek them out. Great benefits, good work life balance, many opportunities to learn and expand knowledge base."
good,"GDIT was a pretty good place to work. The management team on site was excellent. The Federal contracting job environment can be a bit mundane, though. If you are good with working in a cube farm 8 hours a day, then this is the job for you."
good,"I was former military with 10 years, so I looked for a compatible job, which GDIT sufficed.  For 75% of my  time, we filled digital forms in an old mobile trailer. Later came a brick/mortar office.  We were sent on 6 mo deployments into hazard areas, so the work conditions were supposed to simulate those conditions, minus the imminent danger.  HR provided support when needed."
good,"This company can be a great company, but management has rto have some major improvements. There is not any room for advancement within your position.The company has been a okay place to work, otherwise."
good,"This call center was big on quality. We handled contracts for Medicare and other government programs from time to time. Your calls are monitored and every week you are evaluated by a qualified specialist. Their main goal is one call resolutions, where the caller only needs to call once, and talk to one person to have their issue resolved."
good,"Really don't  want to know my view. That's what cost me my job. My foreman, shop foreman, and other welders and workers were good to work with. The job was close to where I lived"
good,"Laid back environment. Co-workers were great. Management was out of touch at times. Lots of flexibility when life situations arose. Overall, it was a great place. Just wish it paid more."
good,"This was a great job for me, the position and atmosphere is what I look for when I work. The only thing I saw that needed to be addressed was the training when they put u on the floor during training. They don’t explain how to do certain things and you really are training yourself as you go."
good,"GDIT is a great company, and pays very well for the Job location. "
good,"I enjoyed working at GDIT. My supervisor was strick but she wanted me to be the best CSR, I could be. The environment was casual and this company provided a good work/life balance."
good,"I've learned how to manage employees and day-to-day operations of the company and specific departments, as well gained knowledge of multiple operating programs and computer systems."
good,"General Dynamics was some of the best years of my life.The company sent me on travel to do work in Hawaii and in Germany."
good,"I liked working for this company and would refer other to apply. The pay isn’t the best but it’s a cool start. Typical call center hours, typical call center"
good,"Great company for flexible scheduling, independent duty and work from home. Great for those interested in working with people and those who like interacting with others."
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked for General Dynamics. The work environment was good. All of the co- workers got along really good, and assisted one another with issues that they couldn't handle themselves. Management was supportive of the workers, and did all they could for us."
good,"It was the first time that I would wake up and wanted to go to work. I enjoyed the quietness, calm professional personnel I worked with. There was no micro-management which made working incredibly easy and productive. I did not feel pressured and that feeling made me work harder. "
good,"The cmpany and the job are good, but working on the NBIB contract leads to stress due the constant changes. If you do it long enough you will get used to the changes"
good,"General Dynamics, in my opinion was a great place to work. Although the company was larger than what I was used to everyone was helpful.  I learned a lot about privacy of others but always willing to help.  The company offered incentives to complete all work in a timely matter.  Always felt the process was fair and during the slower times met a lot of new people.  Their training kept all employees up to date on any changes in procedure.  A super group of people!"
good,"It has to be understood that all jobs provided by GDIT are under a federal contract, therefore all pay structures are based on the contract and selected states cost of living. Working there for over two years only bonuses were provided per additional language or evening/night shift."
good,"Every day is typically fast paced, usually no breaks between calls. You interact with all kinds of people and learn to deal with many different situations. The best part is being able to help people get the insurance coverage they need, giving them hope to what many feel like is a hopeless situation. It can be difficult to keep people on track, especially when they are upset or confused but with a little patience you can usually get things done in a timely manner. There is not a lot of time for socializing in the workplace, usually breaks and lunches are scheduled to not overlap so you can sometimes feel like strangers to people on your same team."
good,"For the time I did work there, it was a relaxed fun environment. Everybody was friendly. Job was easy. Managers were cool. I cant complain. They do layoffs a lot."
good,At General Dynamics there are several positions that a person can move to. Your raise in wages is based on the position you decide to take after a minimum of six months in each position. They do promote from within so there are opportunities.
good,General Dynamics is a great fortune 500.  I have enjoyed the work environment and experiences over the past 12 years.  Includes a diverse group of employees
good,"Learned a lot as an intern. Assumed a lot of responsibility very quickly.  Highly recommend to any students in the PM/CM, Interior Design, Architecture field/major."
good,"Many managers retalliate. Many managers are homophobic. The client (the federal government) does not pay well. The training abd support given overall, is exceptional. You are given a great deal of off-phones time for training purposes. Benefits are great. Systems are great, except they pull data off of many different government servers, causing lags or system crashes. Working on the Obamacare project, you receive a lot of abuse from consumers, which can be difficult to stomach."
good,Good company to work for. There are limited opportunities for advancement between a supervisor and higher up. Supervisors have wonderful opportunities to help improve job performance.
good,It's a great job that allows you to encounter all kinds of people. Coworkers and management are great. It's a very demanding job. You'll take calls from the time your shift starts till you clock out. There are two fifteen minute breaks and a thirty minute lunch to help break up the constant calls.
good,"A typical day includes answering calls, attending a briefing with team members or supervisor.  I learned about healthcare plans, and management was generally on hand to oversee production needs.  The workplace culture was diverse in age and ethnicity.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with callers who were rude or discourteous.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the helping customers who appreciated the provided assistance."
good,"Management is decent, environment is not stressful, and hours are very flexible. Many opportunities for growth and since the company is steadily growing there are plenty of career options"
good,"I have worked at General Dynamics IT for 8 years and I am very happy.  Pros: Direction from Senior management, compensation, benefits, stability. Cons: Other than executives, there is little opportunity to earn bonuses or company ownership."
good,It was a  good place to work I differently learned  a lot about being a people person the staff were huge I met people from all over the US and enjoyed learning about people
good,General Dynamics is a large company with competitive salary and benefits.  Individuals assigned to government contracts will not feel like they have a permanent place with General Dynamics but this is true of many companies biding government contracts.
good,"Adequate training. More than enough support personnel to get you through rough times with clients, nice people to work with, good sick time policy; poor upper mgmt."
good,"I worked in a customer R&D facility that was a good, collaborative environment.  I worked hard and learned new skills and my work was appreciated by the customer."
good,"Company, Co-worker and the job where great. Many benefits and pluses to further your career. You could learn a lot and training was provided. My manager was the worst."
good,"I've only been with GDIT for less than a month, as they acquired CSRA. They seem like a carbon copy of every other Contracting company. Same HR stuff, same positions, same requirements. I'm in a field office and not the headquarters office. I can only speak for our area. Management is not great, very slow with information, very slow to get anything done at all really. The pay is decent, but there are several different sites with the same ""positions"", but they all have several different pay scales. Definitely not ok."
good,"Great work life balance, benefits on par with industry standards, your experience is based on the contract you are on.  I like working for the company, but the contract I am on does not allow for career growth."
good,If you need a job fast then this is the job for you. The pay is okay for how long they use you for. If the company was run by different people then it would've been a better place to be. If you like to gossip or if you loved high school then this is your spot. When I worked there I just stayed to myself. If you do that then they still talked about you. A typical day at work would be to log in by 7:00 am and take calls about insurance until my shift was over. I learned you have to be patient when it comes to helping people. The hardest part of my job was when people were already upset when they called in. Why were you yelling at me when I wasn't the one who made you upset. The most enjoyable part of my job was when someone called frustrated and I could hear the relief in their voice when I finished my call.
good,General dynamics information technology is a good place to work and a good learning experience for people who haven't worked with insurance before....
good,Good place to work. Pace of work is usually relaxed. Workplace culture is friendly. Flexible time off and supervisor was easy to get along with.                     .
good,I started off on on the phones answering Medicare questions for callers.  Later on a position opened up for the Advanced Resolution Center so I applied and got the position.
good,"I liked working for General Dynamics because of the people and providing a great customer service for the people of America, in enrolling into the Affordable Care Act also known as the ACA. Which helps people find affordable health coverage in their area of state. I think there doing a great job at assisting and providing a great service"
good,"Call center job; I really can't say too much about this employer, but I have gotten to know a few new friends here through training class. Might recommend."
good,"GDIT is a good company to work for. The pay is great and offers good benefits. If you are not use to a high volume call center, this job could be a little stressful. The job has different positions, depending on when you apply. The downfall is that majority of the time you are hired it is seasonal and depending on how well you do you can be hired permanent."
good,Good place to work on. The group is very knowledgeable. the hardest part was keeping up with reviewing and doing your invoices and finding time for both.
good,"Closest job worth the money I could find. Pretty much guaranteed work if interviewed. As a seasonal employee benefits are ok. Not a fan of policies for jackets, hats.  Very small cubicles.  Parking is a nightmare depending on your shift. Very easy to get fired."
good,"the people made this job for me, I enjoyed working with folks who not only knew their jobs but had fun doing it.  the work was challenging and rewarding."
good,Great benefits. Fixed schedules. Paid training. No absences. Must stay true to schedule or they might write you up for it. Calls aren't too hard if you know your way around the operating system. Will learn more on the floor than you do in training.
good,"In-bound phone calls from student loan borrowers whose loans had gone into default. Update borrower's information in account, provide accurate information and alternatives for getting loans out of default, set up payment plans, assist borrowers in finding their lenders through National Student Loan Data System."
good,"Good atmosphere from co-workers, but strict on how to perform job duties. Supportive suppervisors. Work can be stressful. Good benefits and decent pay."
good,"Was in a hard place doing a career shift, GDIT was the only company that gave me a chance.  They had great medical, 401k (3.5% match), dental, vison as well as HSA(control on how its invested)."
good,On a day to day basis I coach my CSRs and provide feeback baout their calls. I work with them individually to develop and assist them to move up in to company. I've been with the company for seven years and have learned a lot such as improving my communication skills.
good,We made tiles and installed them at General Dynamics in the electric boat. The skill I learned helped me to use it in my own home. I felt relaxed and not pressured while working at GD.
good,Dgit is good job to work at the managers are very helpful and understanding. they teach you the basics of a customer service job. the Hardest Part of the job is just keeping up with the volume of calls coming in.
good,"A typical day at General Dynamics was a very relaxed environment most of the time. I learned how to be patient and communicate with consumers if they were having a bad day, The hardest part of the job would have to be balancing out the calls. I enjoyed the environment that i worked in it really was never to muuch going on and it was peace most fo the time."
good,Great company to work for. Would have loved to haved been selected to stay and make a career out of it. Great pay and great coworkers. Fast paced but safe environment. Always practiced safety first by any means.
good,GD's employees are hard working and dedicated to their jobs.  The employees are professional and treat one another with respect.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and still keep in contact with some of them.  There is opportunity for advancement and always felt challenged in the jobs I held.  They have great benefits.
good,It was nice because we had a lot of freedom to get the job in a way that best suited us as individuals and kept our roles simple and steady so we didn't teeter away from the task at hand.
good,Was provided several training opportunities.  Mentoring was a strong asset promoting learning in several different areas of the job.  Opportunities were also provided to collaborate with many other employees.
good,It's a  great place if you like call center... Very easy. able to work with others. calls are always back to back so your day will go by quickly. Always great to help others
good,"Still a good company to work for, while moving at the speed of a carrier. The company is very automated and if you don't pay attention to your career, you can get eaten up."
good,I worked there under contract and for a very short time. My benefits were provided by the company that contracted me for General Dynamics.Pay could have been a little better.
good,"Had to report to work by 7:15 a.m. daily to attend production meeting and left work at 4:00 p.m. usually. Work place is clean but definitely a manufacturing environment. "
good,This was one of the best jobs that ive ever experienced....really loved the pay and team i worked on the benefits were wonderful... i wish they would have never closed us.
good,"We were in the middle of Solaris 10 to Solaris 11.2 Migration.  A typical day started with leftover CRs (Change Requests for migration of File Systems from either VXFS or UFS to ZFS (because Solaris 11.2 uses only ZFS), part of the day was used for routine work modifying user securities/removing user logins of relieved uses, because project budget was reduced."
good,"Pay was generous and regular. Hours were usually regular, but handsome overtime compensation,"
good,"Long work days. Management, culture, and benefits were ok. Job security was at the mercy of defense budget cuts. Learned a lot about system design and integration."
good,"During the off season work and home life are easy to coincide. Majority of Supervisors will help you with any questions or worries. Has a friendly environment, and great team working."
good,"different cultures. flexible hours.   room for advancement  you are graded on the quality of your calls which is understandable, however the process can be overwhelming at times. there are people who will help to guide you."
good,Risvy  can drive any vehicle im 18 i have good education no working experience but ill do my best for my cumpany hoping soon i request to give a chance
good,"If you have the patience and willingness to help the customer, they'll train you for just about any situation. "
good,For me this location is a great place to work. It's challenging and I'm always learning. I get to work with different types of servers used by DOD and the civilian population.
good,I had many wonderful years at Flinchbaugh operations. It became a family atmosphere. Many opportunities to move to different jobs. I took advantage of the wonderful on site Penn State courses in business management that were offered.
good,The workplace environment is great. The consumers do tend to be really hard to work with. Sometimes they are really rude towrds you when trying to provide excellent care for them.
good,Working for GDIT you got excellent manager coach experience and good benefits from the employer. A typical day at the job involves a lot of multi-tasking.
good,I did not mind at all working for this company.  I did find some of the management that I did not care for but it didn't affect my view on the company itself.  There were few other management people on a different systems that I did very much enjoyed for their kindness and compassion for people and their personal lives.
good,GDIT was a great place to work. they really cared about their employees. the benefits were amazing. however certain managers should not be employed there. i witnessed a specific manager work to get people fired as she did not like them and did not want them working there. i personally left as i felt attacked by her after a year and six months of tolerating her management techniques.
good,GDIT is a contractor that provides contact center and information technology services for many Federal agencies.  There are a variety of opportunities available at GDIT.
good,"This was my first full time job.  As a secretary I did general office work.  Typing, phone, filing, ordering office supplies.  The management was excellent and knew how to motivate their employees.  I learned how to multitask and get myself to think in an organized fashion since I had so much work to accomplish in one day.  It was a pleasant place to work with high demands but the benefits were great.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of accomplishment at the end of the day knowing I did the best I could.  The hardest part are the demands that are put on the employees to get the job done on time."
good,"My typical work day consisted of speaking with patients, authorized family members of patients, pharmacy techs and doctors in regards to patients enrolled in the Medicare system.  Generally all questions could be answered by providing a scripted response and or reviewing the information requested and providing an answer.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the QA department constantly saying there was another script you could have used.  I did enjoy the team and team members I worked with."
good,My time spent at GDIT was enjoyable as well as profitable. There was a wide and pleasant variety of people in all tiers of the company. The company benefits exceeded most of its competitors.
good,working with some of the smartest people in the word.  worked along side some of the most dictated sailors in the US Navy.   Seen places that Most people don't get to see
good,"Great company to work for, exciting and challenging."
good,I had to take back calls until break  because the went off scorecards and every Wednesday they review our scorecards and mines was always perfect and they always rewarded me..
good,"Poor management skills, things were constantly stolen, always kept busy, it was good and easy pay. There were three breaks per 8hrs day. You had your own cubicle. They worked with your health issues getting approved time off for doctors appointments, etc."
good,This was my first job that I really started to learn the ins and outs of insurance companies. Dealing with beneficiaries and different insurance companies really taught me things that help me to where I want to be today
good,Strong company prior to being purchased by Chemring.  9/80 work schedule.  Limited employee cross training.  Good benefits and paid employees well. Gave back to the community.  Business development was very weak.
good,"A great place to grow needed office, managment, and professional skills."
good,"Government contractor. Worked on customer site almost exclusively. Very little contact with management. Salary was okay but, not fantastic. Still, I can't complain. They never paid me late."
good,"GDIT was an interesting place to work. Despite my title (Shipping and Receiving Clerk), I was given the opportunity to manage projects and people, work in a supervisory role over people, and learn many new and interesting skills that weren't linked directly to the type of work that I had originally been hired for. All in all, it was one of the most interesting work experiences I have ever had and I would suggest working there to anyone who can get in."
good,I had a pleasant working experience at GDIT.  I managed the company's largest contract and was responsible for the re-compete proposal.  Management was supportive.
good,"N/a,   I am uncomfortable  giving out information about the company,   it  pays the bills, it is a call center, I live  close to work"
good,"A typical day in GDIT starts by logging in into the system and starting to assist Marketplace consumers with their health insurance needs."
good,"It is a Job... Benefits were better than having none. I have nothing else to say, so I am filling space in this field... Seriously, I do not have a lot to say about this job. It was easy to understand, especially if you have any previous CSR experience, WhatSoEver. Michael Riedman is a very rude manager, and I recoment demanding to switch to a team that he does not manage. CoWorkers were fine."
good,"It's a good company to work for. It is close to home, easy to get to. The over time is good when it is available. It does take some time and hard work to become a full journeyman."
good,The hardest part about my job was not being able to help everyone due to system limitations that prevented us form getting everyone enrolled for coverage.
good,"Although the task are very easy it is very repetitive, as is most call centers. Call volume at its peak can make you feel overwhelmed but at least it makes the day go by faster. Great benefits package with decent salary."
good,I loved the job and pay. And it has a set work schedule. Offers loads of overtime. If you choose to work here you can pick part time or full time and you will get exactly those hours. Training was very easy as well.
good,pay compensation good based on market area  Training for my position was lacking because they were processing to phase out some positions
good,"The  break room was always stocked with coffee and great snacks to purchase. Getting to work on time and punctuality was key to adherence and following the call flow provided a smooth work experience. Although sometimes finding a solution for unpredictable situations could be frustrating for the consumer, ensuring my persistence and experience with coworkers is a nice challenge."
good,"-I enjoyed my job because I could work at my pace and take time to really look into tickets and customer issues"
good,"GDIT where I worked was a call center taking Medicare and Affordable Care Act calls. Calls could be back to back for several hours of the day,"
good,"I like the people I work with and the management tries to be aware and involved with the floor. Unfortunately they are not as in touch with the floor as they could be which has resulted in many issues between managing workers, solving technical issues and morale. Still, it's not a bad place to work."
good,Opportunities to work different programs and projects. Teams work great together to accomplish customer requirements and achieve high customer satisfaction. Great to work with co-workers and section manager.
good,"Bilingual Medicare Customer Service Representative"
good,"A typical day at GDIT involves solving issues and complaints for tenants and leaseholders who are living in Lambeth, Helping members of staff and coaching new members of staff, Taking manager calls and dealing with complaints"
good,"Very great job to work at , management is great and the are is well respected , the co workers are very hard working , I don't like that sometimes during the month of January the job is all over the place due to open enrollment where millions of consumers are signing up for new insurance or renewing insurance"
good,Electric Boat is a great place to work and fine tune your skills.  Management has a hands off approach and trusts their employees with their work load.
good,It's an great place to work and grow into outstanding opportunities. The co-workers are very helpful and always showing me the correct way to do things around here.
good,Really easy going work place. The company supports its employees with engineering and manufacturing skills as well as leadership quality and personal development.
good,"Plus:"
good,"I have worked for General Dynamics for almost 15 years and am happy with my pay benefits and vacation time (21+ days)."
good,Great pay and benefits with plenty of overtime. High turnovers but have great trainers. Calls can be nonstop on a good day and slow on the weekends. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the business casual dresscode.
good,"Good place  to work."
good,"General Dynamics is an excellent organization and I am thankful for the time I have spent and continue to spend there. I have grown immensely as a professional and have learned a tremendous amount.  "
good,thrill to be around so many types of people with diffrent skills really understood alot . most of the time the test were challenging.
good,"The local management does a good job of taking care of the employees.  Although this office is small, it still feels like part of the GDIT family."
good,"Working as an analyst I enjoy review of statistics and metrics, as well as processing process initiative improvements, giving briefs on area site implementation groups as well as supporting all trades within Repair departmentally and Repair as a whole organizationally."
good,"General Dynamics is what you make of it. Like most large companies there's a political element as well as who you know, but not everyone is this way. Find your place (proverbial area of the lunch room) and avoid the drama."
good,I liked the people and how they handled their workers. it was always fun and never a duel moment. they pay was good and the people were better.
good,"There are plenty of opportunities for growth once you join this company, pending you are proactive to seek them out.  Highly technical company with many technical jobs to develop your skills.  However, you have to take your career in your own hands and ensure that you are developing yourself outside of company resources pending there are no resources to speak of, to ensure that you are in a position to pursue those jobs."
good,"A typical day at work means answering multiple calls pertaining to health insurance. I have learned so much about the deductibles and different plans and coverage's companies have to offer. During my time of employment, I did not have much communication with the management team. Some of my co-workers weren't the best employees, but they eventually got the job done. The hardest part of my job is the disappoint I get when the person on the receiving end of the phone get bad news. The most enjoyable part of my job was hearing the joy the person on the phone got when they realized they could be helped and qualified for coverage."
good,"It is a great company to work for entitling you to work for the Federal Government as a contractor.  They seem to take care of there personnel and management works well with you.  Every employer has it's ups and downs, but I have been here for 16 years, so that says a lot about this company."
good,"An average day in diagnostics at GDLS-C involves searching through source data and reviewing vehicle designs to write troubleshooting documents for their vehicles. You learn a lot about the mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic, and communication systems that go into each vehicle and get to dig into some really complex technologies. While reading through all of the technical data may not be everyone's cup of tea, using your problem solving skills to identify failure modes and create troubleshooting procedures for these vehicles is definitely my favorite part."
good,"they say great place to work it is....Some leadership have their clicks that make it hard to fit in. I not sure how much more I can or want to say about the company like most there was good and bad."
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  They made my job both challenging and rewarding. It was a pleasure working with them all.
good,Hard working company and shows support for employees. Work long hours but also management allows employees to get the job done without micro management.
good,Best job I ever had then it became the worst job I ever had. The company could not be trusted. There was cronyism in promotions and promotions are base on what rank you held in the military usually.
good,GDIT is a stable workplace but has its flaws when it comes to the quality of personnel thats being hired. I have had some good and bad times within the last 5 years at GDIT.
good,"Bath Iron Works is a good place to work and you can advance quickly if you're willing to work. Sadly, the union, Local 6 which represents the mechanics at the shipyard, is driving production and cost savings down. The management is good as long as you're willing to follow the rules of the bargaining agreement. It's a good place to work, however, I'm not sure you can make a career out of it."
good,I love working with my team as a team to acheive the number one goal and that's to provide great customer service and also privacy to all customers.
good,"General Dynamics offered the challenge of a fast paced work environment added to the demands that are already present in the telecommunications industry.  A typical day was spent part time designing the sites, reviewing bids and assigning a GC for the job.  After that I would be out in the field supervising and documenting the construction activities as well as coordinating with the utility companies for service and with the independent cities for approval of the schedule and the design.  Then it was the punch walks and close out packages."
good,Pays well for the area. Paid Holidays. Room for advancement. Set schedule. Lots of calls come in and you have to deal with alot of angry sad and normal people. The hardest part is when people cry on the phone the most enjoyable part is when someone is angry and calls but you help them and they no long are rude and thank you.
good,"I love being able to interact with customers and help them in any way I can, the only down fall to this job is it is only seasonal and I need something more reliable."
good,"First thing; reviewed new updates in email messages and in our daily schedule. Logged into computer to take calls with head set.  Answered questions that callers have about the program and how to apply for insurance.  Filled out applications.  Checked consumer accounts for messages and  solved any issues consumer may be having.  Looked up scripting to insure updated accurate information is given.  Paid close attention to scheduled adherence for compliance with meetings, training's and breaks. Transferred call when appropriate. Connected call with interpreter if needed. Explained how the insurance companies work and what is required of the consumer. Educated consumers about different types of insurance and what the insurance companies language meant in layman's terms. Enrolled consumers in different types of medical insurance. Answered calls and used dialogue as instructed for each situation. End of day: account for every minute on or off the phone and fill out time card with the proper codes for each activity completed that day.  Everything based on the the statistics of: Quality, Average handle time, consumer response to survey etc."
good,The work environment could be a little more organized and some of the management is helpful.There are times when it should be more focused on the beneficiaries as opposed to the employees socializing.
good,"A typical day starts with head sets on and following empower answering incoming calls day, no social time with coworkers and the most enjoyable part of the job is off phones segments."
good,I was only with this company for a short time and it was bought out from another contractor.  The time i worked with them was pleasurable and a great experience.
good,"A day consisted of collecting the required ingredients to make a specified recipe according to SOPs, and then delivering the finished batch to a storage cell.  I learned proper handling techniques of hazardous materials, and how to prevent dangerous situations from occurring.  The management was fine, neither too overbearing or too lax.  We had a ""just-in-time"" process that required us to move swiftly through batches of product.  My coworkers were amicable, I never had a problem with them, and it made the night shifts more bearable.  The most difficult part of the job was the shift changes, sometime working nights, and sometimes days.  The best part of the job was the overtime, when available."
good,the employer is very good and has a professional environment. I was happy to work there. I learned about medical IT. I traveled a lot but didn't mind.
good,"A typical work day consisted of arriving at work on time, signing on to your computers and taking call right away.  Every customer is different but most inquiries were the same.  The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking with different customers with different attitudes and assisting and educating them on what the best plan to fit their needs. The hardest part was telling customers that they did not qualify for any of the plans available."
good,Working here was a great learning experience. Its a place where you have the great ability to advance in the company. The knowledge gained here can be applied to daily life and the lives of other people around you.
good,"•	Take calls and assist the callers and beneficiaries providing a solution to their concerns."
good,"Peaceful environment, friendly people, great management, and great place to work."
good,"Allows you to improve on your customer service skills. Great for learning how to use databases and they offer little self paced courses so you can become more tech savvy. Plus there's multiple shifts and as long as you are doing good, you get the shifts you want/need for balancing family with work."
good,The work environment is good. The management and team is good to be with. The work timings are flexible. I enjoy working on my projects. To me the job doesn't look stressful.
good,The people that I work with makes the job easier. That's why I've been staying for 11 years. GD provides could provide us with the cutting edge technology but the client makes this purpose harder.
good,"General Dynamics is a great place to work, Its a call center that deals with inbound calls. You have to be ready to take back to back calls and depending on the tier you are in and what contract you are under determines the calls you will receive. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet."
good,"we had lots of training with great trainers, they made sure we were ready to get on the phones before letting us get on. great internal support and supervisors."
good,"The environment is somewhat ok, but you can learn a lot from this job. The training cold be better, and also how they choose supervisors."
good,"A regular 8 hour day at General Dynamics Information Technology is very full of daily requirements and regulations.You have to know how to assist callers within a minimum amount of time. The environment was very busy, like a bee-hive. The inbound calls can be very stressful but you learn something new during every call. The hardest part of the job is that every mistake is monitored, so you're pressed to be the best at what you do. Most enjoyable part of my day is when the way you interact with your fun co-workers. Supervisors included, the management is very strict but orderly."
good,"Answering fast-paced calls to enroll consumers into a healthcare plan. Constantly answering calls, busy call center."
good,GDIT was a great experience for myself. Worked with amazing people to make history.
good,"I have the pleasure of working with an amazing group of people. They are extremely helpful and understanding when it comes to taking on new projects and achieving deadlines. The management at GDIT is also full of intelligent, hard working individuals who make the workplace environment less stressful through their feedback and management style."
good,"A day at this job went by pretty smoothly when you just do your job, i learned good communication and computer skills here at this job, the management wasnt very good but it was ok, i got along with the coworkers there but they were mostly women, the hardest part of my job was talking all day almost non stop, the enjoyable part was that it was a chill relaxing sit down job"
good,"The work itself is rather mentally exhausting. Provides good benefits and is flexible with attendance. Not a very stable position, constantly doing lay offs and rehires, doesn't really matter if you are full time or not."
good,Working at a call center is a very busy and productive work volume all day.
good,"With the company relocating the development programs at Ladson, SC to Sterling Heights MI, the remaining staff and repositioned GD staff were very supportive.  My knowledge of product design and of PTC Creo 2 supported the need to finalize designs and to support the need to generate documentation.  The reward to have senior management recognize my efforts and to assign difficult tasks which were time constrained showed my talent and versatility. My involvement lead to the redesign of the support structure for the control systems which managed a key new product feature and to design and integrate the interior armor protective shell.  "
good,"I was always kept busy and enjoyed that, however I was only there on a maternity leave contract, which the woman retuned from."
good,"A tpypical day a work would start by reading email updates to see if there were any changes in program, It was very important that I look through them due to claases that we may have to take that day. I then went online and answered incoming call nearly 100 a day. I learned alot about Healthcare plans and how to be a great Customer Care Rep providing peace of mind to thousands. My management  team was Great, I was in the top 2% of the whole company of 10000+ employees. Management ask to to go for supervisor many times. Co-workers many times came by to ask for help on my team as well as off in which I enjoyed helping. The hardest part of my job is when the closed the Company down. The most enjoyable part was that I was able to help millions of American get affordable Health Care. As well as my hours."
good,"GDIT is a nice place to work the employees are all like family and do what they can to help each other as a team. I learned a lot about the different insurance companies and now I have a better understanding of how they work. The job is pretty simple as long as you pay attention during training, but the worst part about it is the system crashes way to much."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working to save people lives.
good,"overall it was a interesting and fun place to work, every call was monitored I preformed technical support for FASFA and also did script reading for Medicare"
good,I enjoyed working for this company because I'm prior military I understand the importance of having working quality equipment.
good,"It was fun to work there, the people that i worked with were amazing and made working there so awesome. We set people up with insurance for Obama care which wasnt always easy but being there for the customers when they were upset made my job better."
good,"Happy to have been a part of the First Open Enrollment Period for H.I.M./ ACA, and learning about Medicare. Lots of structure and room to grow."
good,I was starting to like this job very much. Then I was laid off. I was devastated..
good,"A typical day at work is answering the phone calls.  it is a great place to learn about insurance.  The managers could improve the communication, but really, who couldn't.  Unfortunately, there are favorites, and other people working there that could learn how to act like they want a good reputation."
good,"Good place to work. Relaxed pace, and good people to work with."
good,This position was on a government contract. GDIT management was excellent throughout.
good,General Dynamics is an exemplary company with highly trained employees who have a passion for excellence.
good,I'd love to stay here...sadly it's contract work. C'est la vie
good,It was the same like other IT departments in other companies.
good,I would recommend this position to anyone who loves to provide quality customer service.
good,Typical day is usually back to back calls helping consumers. Learned to have patience and about health insurance. Management seems to help out with any issues or concerns. Co-workers make the day go by fast. THe hardest part of the job is dealing with consumers who are upset. The most enjoyable part of day is being able to feel like you have helped someone when they feel like there is no hope.
good,"Great Co-Workers"
good,Enjoy my co-workers and the activities that we participate in as a team.
good,A great work environment with historic engagement implications.
good,"GD is a good solid company with excellent benefits but be warned it is a government contractor thus subject to rapid changes in funding. A recent discussion with the Program Manager, the company lost 50 positions due to changes in funding and contract size so not a lot of Job Security."
good,I enjoy work for this company it have excellent benefits. Working in a military enviroment the empoyee have the opportunity to lean a different live style that many of us don't know.
good,"Having the opportunity to instruct Army Intelligence and work with young soldiers was both fun and rewarding.  If not for government cutbacks and relatively weak leadership (which I have a hard time faulting them for) I would likely still be working there."
good,Was able to talk to many people on the phone and try to help them with their problems.  Coworks were all ways around if you needed them.
good,"Diversified work environment, opportunities for advancement, pleasant work environment even with demanding schedules."
good,prefer not to comment. General Dynamics was a great company to work for.
good,It a good company but management can be better. They are very flexible with your schedule and General Dynamics keep  you working
good,My managers and co-workers are highly professional. It is by far the most diverse workplace I have ever worked in.
good,"Support DOD AFRICOM with travel to African Nations, most important thing I learned was working with individuals from various cultures and backgrounds, embracing change and networking with Host Nations."
good,"General Dynamics is a good company, no complaints. Hardest part of the job was traveling to and from NYC every day."
good,"Good folks to work with. Frequent reorganizations make for instability, uneasy staff."
good,"Responsible for installation and troubleshooting or multiple electrical,hydraulic and pneumatic systems of centralized reset on military vehicles."
good,I deployed for most of the time and really enjoyed it all. Management was great and I got along with everyone. I worked hard and was compensated for that which made me work that much harder.
good,"As a contractor placed at a secure defense research facility by a division of GD that provided such manpower, I had very little day to day interaction with my manager or administrative support staff.  There was, almost of necessity given the nature of the work I did, limited interactions with the staff at that facility.  We did have some raging debates about how to make the best coffee. Some eye-opening tools for automated translation of ADA to Java were the most memorable technical aspect of the work.  The most gratifying part of the job was being responsible for two actual shipped builds for intermediate versions of our communication satellite software."
good,"It is a very good place to work at, good hrs  if you like working M-F 9:30 am to 6:00 pm, but position is temporary, based on performance to become permanent, if you were to be chosen as permanent  will have to start the hiring process from scratch, and it can take from 6 to 8 months to become permanent IF your score card is good for a period of time.VERY strict with schedule adherence, extreme security no electronics allowed in the building."
good,"Working for a large company such as General Dynamics, much of the typical work day/schedule depends on the client and project management.  As a large federal contracting company, you have the typical upper management that only cares about the company's bottom line and seems disconnected from the employees that deal with the end users/clients.  In the past two years, General Dynamics has cut back on their benefit and compensation offerings, which (in my opinion), makes it a less desireable company to work for.  "
good,"In working for Vangent I learned a lot about the american people and what they consider a breach of their privacy and other things. I also learned computer skills, like office, and their systems as well. I have a healthy respect for officials and for others that go around trying to get the information that we do not want to give up. Vangent was a temporary job, but a very profitable one. It was managed right and we took calls all day long and tried to get the people to respond to our call. The team leaders were given a certain amount of leeway and they were told to get the job done. They did. I was just on the job for a little over a month, but I made good money. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rejections, and the fact that they were almost constant. It gets depressing after a while listening to people tell you you are not any good and to leave them alone. The management had ways to deplete this and to get people past this as well."
good,It was a small warehouse where I worked on the line on different machines. It was good pay and twelve hour shifts. It was a nice comfortable job.
good,"Typical days work was to comply with company policies.  This was strictly enforced.  Privacy and respectful co-workers.  Management was VERY professional and courteous.  Professional feedback.  Flexible hours.  Loved the 4-10 shift.  Sonority by work performance.  I learned to be professional when discussing personal issues with people calling in not knowing there actual race.  Hardest part of the job was traveling out to Sandy, Utah for work every morning.  The most enjoyable part of my job was Management.  They were an AWESOME team!!"
good,"General Dynamics Land Systems has been a great place to work.  I was there for 19 years, there are also many other employees who have remained there for many years.  My job entailed testing electronic assemblies to ensure that they met specifications before being sent to final inspection.  I diagnosed and documented any failures.  I was also my team's environmental health and safety representative.  Unfortunately, the company has to do a lot of downizing due Federal Government budget cuts."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the pride derived in producing the best tank in the world.
good,"Working in this environment allowed for growth, mobility and understanding of how to prioritize customer's needs and to understand a healthy balance of workload under sometimes heavy stress. An enjoyable place to work that allowed a true feeling of accomplishment."
good,Looking for other opportunity. Work is now a supportive role as all the test station are automated and running properly.
good,We supported the TUSK program OCONUS. We supported the military in up-armoring the various styles of Tanks to prevent injury and/or death to our military personnel. The most exciting part of this job was knowing that we were saving lives with the work we were doing.
good,"This job was OK. The thing that really bothered me was that no matter what you did or how hard you worked, it was more on who you knew in the company to move up. That is pretty much the only thing that was bad about this job "
good,Unfortunately the good times are coming to an end... between Sequestration and pressure to reduce Defense Spending the company is falling on hard times. 
good,"I work on-site (WPAFB) as a Java/Oracle developer.  Most contracts are 1 or 2 people contracts with quick turnaround applications (less than a year)."
good,this was a fun job. you get to see new things by working on navy ships. you have the chance to learn alot of different skills
good,It is a good company to work for. It has its politics but by and large it is very good to work for. We work with some cool technology too.
good,They got the hierchy thing down. I have learned to much as I promoted up. The managers that I had are great and fair. Great co-workers; really brilliant and smart folks. 
good,I've learned a lot about warehouse management. My level of responsibility was the highest here. The co-workers were great.
good,Daily tasks can differ in the SNOC since the tasks are split between the Security Operations Center side of the house or on the Network Operations Center side.
good,"Reading customers documents who's applying for CAR rebates. checking the other persons work to make sure, they have enter the customers information into the database correctly. I have learned how the CAR rebate program works...good management team.hardest part. trying to learn so much in a short time.. the enjoyable....communications with the co-workers"
good,"What you learn over there is really what you want to get out of it. People are willing to help, but only to a certain extent."
good,thanks to the opportunity the gave me as a shift leader ive learned a lot ofcomputer skills
good,I was taught by the best Project Managers how to improve my overall skill set while consistantly given next level tasks which challenged my initiative and improved my work ethic. I was very appreciative for the opportunity to fill in as a contractor for this short duration but gained a wealth of knowledge in the process.
good,I really enjoy working on strykers but the military could be difficult to work with sometimes. The military had the keys to all the trucks so it was up to them to bring in trucks for service which wasn't their top priority. I really like how I get to travel with the company. My manager is a great person to work for and always does whats best for the people under him. Some of my coworkers were great and taught me a lot while some liked to do more playing than actual work which caused the rest of us to have to work harder.
good,Allowed for creativity and input to maintain currency with actual operations
good,"Hardworking environment with flexibility and relaxed atmosphere, room for improvident for learning experience and good team work."
good,"Hey have great benefits and you're able to get every other Friday off, which means they have a great system of work/life balance."
good,"Working at general dynamics was a rewarding experience, especially since i was on a retrofit team, it allowed me to travel to many different army posts and marine bases both nation wide & international."
good,I love customer service and making someone's day better. This employer gives you the ability to do so sometimes.
good,"I worked for GD-AIS for almost 6 years. They were always in the hunt for new work, working just about every RFP and winning a lot of proposals, so there was plenty of work to go around most of the time. I had no problems with compensation, as they paid me well. The only problem I had with GD was when I had to find a transfer because of family health problems (father was terminally ill with cancer in Columbia, SC so I had to move to help/support the family). Although GD has many subsidiaries and are world wide, the different groups, (AIS, IT, etc...) will not work with each other as an overall company for the sake of their employees. I actually had to find a new job with a different company to be able to move to Augusta (only an hour away vs 9 hours). GD is prevalent in Augusta, but it's their IT group that's entrenched here, and they just don't play nicely with AIS for some reason. (Department heads fighting among themselves I guess...) Their benefits packages were really good when I was hired, but by the time I left they had been reduced 3 or 4 times, (most likely for the benefit of share holders and CEO/executive bonuses). The only other thing bad I can say about GD was when I put in my 2 weeks notice. Later that day I was escorted out the door... (I found that quite upsetting /distressful, but I have come to learn that in some companies, especially when dealing with security clearance jobs, it is quite common...)"
good,"I loved helping people everyday, I learned alot about myself and different personality types and the benefits were good as well."
good,"Average day would consist of 100+ calls from various beneficiaries about coverage and benefits. Every other week I would be scored on call handle time and overall call. Which I felt was beneficial to become an even better specialist. Management and Co-Workers were average, if you want to move up in any company you don't tell anyone you show them."
good,GD-AIS is a large defense conglomerate in the competitive field of defense electronics. They pay industry standard pay and benefits.
good,I was hired through a staffing agency. Three months after I was hired there was a layoff. I would return to General Dynamics if there was a direct hire opportunity.
good,Vangent Inc. has held the contract for CMS for 4 years. We are 1-800-Medicare Customer Services call center. We have recently changed hands and as of 1/1/2012 our new name is GDIT. We still have the Medicare contract. We work closely with many agencies such as SSA and claims contractors on issues such as premium payments and claims processing.
good,I really enjoyed working here. Everything was great the people I worked with and the schedules. I sadly had to leave due to personal issues but they worked with me until the end. The pay wasn’t the highest but it was still a great experience.
good,"Company is great, really work with you to learn the necessary skills to succeed. Depending on the project work can swing from high stress, fast paced work to slow repetitive tasking."
good,Part-time telecommuting is an option for most positions as well as flexible work schedules.  Culture is relaxed and upbeat.  Tuition assistance is available.
good,"Refreshing Agile work environment and real ""can do"" attitude.  Managers always available to assist when/if needed.  Trust.   I was able to develop my own work product  and take initiative prepare decision points for the Government lead within my project scope.  Managers trusted our level of business acumen and we were able to work independently."
good,GDIT is a good company with a growing global and inclusive culture and emphasizes its strength of the diversity of its people. I enjoy the job because I get to work with people from all walks of life.
good,Excellent place to work with great benefits. The HR department is not fair in their investigations. I was let go for supposedly violating a policy based on false allegations by a co-worker and I was not interviewed in the process to get my side of the story.
good,GDIT is ok to work for because of the contracts and the benefits.  They have a good internal mobility program but I think improvement is needed when trying to move around form contract to contract
good,The management listens to their employees and readily implements suggestions which promotes productivity and/or employee satisfaction.  Career opportunities exist in most major markets world-wide.
good,A seasoned organization that puts its customers first. There is an ingrained philosophy to do the right thing regardless of the profit outlook. GD offers strong leadership opportunities to its employees as well as growth.
good,Its not that bad working for General Dynamics. Throughout my experience I did notice lack of Management but it can be easily resolved once replaced. I would go back in the future to work for them.
good,"I enjoyed working for GDIT, they train you for a few weeks then test you. Once your on the floor you get to shadow other employees. They do record all calls so make sure you stay using the strips!"
good,"Overall good benefits and salary, a lot to learn there as well. Room to always grow as a employee and advancement opportunities come and go over time!"
good,I truly enjoyed my time with this company. But do to the fact that l went through the Strom Michael.  I had to relocate to Columbia SC.  Unfortunately they don't have the same company here in Columbia SC. I would love to be able to still work with this company.
good,Must be willing to learn new skills and be adaptable. Management is wonderful and department managers always listen to feedback. The hardest part of the job is it can be somewhat stressful due to project time restrictions when working for the government. The most enjoyable part is that I get to help protect the United States and feel highly satisfied.
good,"Training very informative and lengthy. It prepared one with pertinent information in order to properly assist clients with insurance questions. Great opportunity for advancement, good benefits. "
good,"Military and Contractors worked together to provide advanced warfare training via classroom and on board ships world wide. Integrated team was professional, consistent and worked well together. Upcoming schedule was always clear with the who, what, when for all topics and events. Best part of the job was the leadership; which made the day to day events less stressful. Integrated work force willingly participated in activities at work as well as off the clock."
good,I was able to work on  other aircrafts that I did not have the experience to work on. Their training was very good and they made sure their employees were trained prior to working on an aircraft. The work environment was very productive and work was planned accordingly. Customers were very happy with the work performed. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting my job done and knowing I had contribute to the business needs and the success of the company.
good,"General Dynamics encourages a culture of teamwork and learning."
good,"It's a great company overall, but after the merger, it's been difficult to know who to turn to, who to learn from and where to grow. There is no transparency and some managers/leads have just given up caring. There is no guidance or motivation left and what was once a place where other employees would love to show up, now, coming in to work is no longer something to look forward to."
good,"A typical work day while employed on a Government contract with GDIT is as follows: "
good,"First industry job out of college with a lot of support during training period.  I was an engineer on the production fabrication floor. Grew in skills as my area of responsibility increased. I was responsible for tooling and equipment support, routing plan, and process improvement. I was the last guy in my department working there when the facility shut down."
good,The good company with good coworkers over all. It had good compensation and salary. Helping hands were everywhere to reach. Good advance opportunity is there.
good,"It's a good job to work at but no advancement. It just always felt like there was no management structure. Also, there's no kind of raises that they offer."
good,"I haven't been with the company long, but so far its been pretty good. The training could be a bit more detailed to have better confidence in starting a new job. I love the flexible schedule and having the freedom to be my own person to execute my job without micromanaging."
good,The company if focused on growing and becoming a better GDIT which gives employees opportunities to grow and gain different experiences.  Many inter-company positions moves are available.
good,General Dynamics is a contractor for  Medicare and ACA. The Meicare job consist of incoming calls from Beneficiaries  who need help in MA enrollment and disenrollment. Allong with any other problems they need solutions for.
good,"This was a very good job. You are paid very well and they have a lot of benefits. You have room for advancement and they try to work with you when you have personal issues. The only bad thing to me is the job environment, a lot of the coworkers are childish and petty but if you stay to yourself you will not have any issues."
good,"The project that I'm on is a very secure project. The client makes a continuous and dedicated effort to minimize unauthorized entry into client systems. The only reason I haven't returned to work is due to a human resources error, even though I am technically still on the project. I myself would typically spend the day working to ensure IT issues got resolved and collaborating with team members. The pay and benefits are very competitive. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting, and promotes the timely implementation of solutions. At times the job is somewhat demanding due to increased work load, and the stress can be overwhelming. But this is minimal, and for the most part this is a quiet workplace where an individual's contributions are noted. When given the opportunity I will return without question"
good,Working at General dynamics has been a fun and educational experience  It's  taught  me a lot about the payment plans when it comes to premium  and  deductibles and also allowed Me to connect with new consumers all around the country
good,I enjoyed my time working in the HR department. You work independently no micro managing.  Remote work is an option once a week and they promote work lifebalance.
good,Good benefits for a company this size. I was caught in a program restructure and a resultant reduction in force and GDIT gave me 90 days notice. Most companies would walk people out the door with max 2 weeks.
good,I heard they went all 'corporate' and aren't what they used to be. Everybody is extremely honest and willing to work until a project task was completed. Very goal oriented. I enjoyed working there right up until we had a bad-apple manager who wasn't an honest person.
good,I loved working for this company...great benefits and you can work overtime if you are able to get the available hours being offered for overtime. The pay is good and it is an awesome opportunity for anyone.
good,"Morning shift starts at 6:30am, First thing in the morning is meeting with the boss then work starts. Work well with others. Works can be hard and stressful. Management is there to help when ever needed. Great company to work for. Benefits and perks are good"
good,"GDIT was a great place to work, I only wish it was permanent rather than temporary. My fellow co-workers were amazing to work with along with the department supervisors"
good,Working at General Dynamics was a great pleasure. I learned a lot throughout my tranning the staff& management were very hepful & very informative. The difficult part is dealing with very old beneficiaries because the calls are little longer. Its a great place to work.
good,"nothing bad to say just loved it. flexibility, advancement opportunities, supervisors were great.health insurance was paid for by company, vacation & sick days"
good,"The customers were great , of course your ging to get angry people at times but for the most part they are great. It can get slow in the off season and that can be a lil annoying cause their isn't much to do."
good,"My review might be a little skewed as I only worked as an intern, but I think that GDIT overall is a great company to work for. The benefits of full-time employees are great, with a good amount of PTO. The work culture is really friendly and collaborative."
good,"It was good overall. I didn’t have many problems, you just couldn’t request off if you needed too. The calls were pretty much easy. You will have some rude people,but I just manage to ignore them and sis my job."
good,A typical day at work is clocking into your computer reading emails and setting up to get ready to take phone calls and helping consumer enroll or help fix there application for health insurance.
good,Trying to get a manager on the phone and talk to them about an issue is really difficult. You can call them multiple times and still nobody will get back to you.
good,"pretty easy job answering phone calls, answering general question about obtaining a US passport. Although it was a pretty easy it was quite competitive as well. The hardest part was when u weren't able to help a customer after opting all options, and of coarse the greatest part was when i was able to help the customer obtain a passport the quickest way possible for their last minute travels."
good,"The work could be hard and the hours were long. But, the compensation was top notch. General Dynamics truly cared about their employees and it showed."
good,It used to be the best paying job at entry level for my area but now fast food restaurants have surpassed the wages. It  can be a rewarding job but is a fast pace work place. This is a call center job so employees must be able to handle fast pace calls for entire shift.
good,"Short term project for US government 2017 test Census. "
good,Decent environment and people to work with. Job can be stressful as it is dealing with insurance. Training is smooth and easy to learn. A lot of over time is available during enrollment periods as well.
good,I don't have any complaints about the job. I do wish that it paid more by the hour but other than that I don't find anything negative to say about the job.
good,"The job is monotonous, which may lead to other employees not caring as much about their title and duties, this tends to put a damper on the rest of the team. Most supervisors seem more committed to making sure their employees stay hired other than the quality of their work. Other than that, great benefits, comprehensive material, great training, great company. They just need to find a way to decrease turnover rate and overall morale."
good,"Overall the people are nice and want to help.  I enjoy the people I work with and the work I do.  The only ""downside"" is the lack of communication on the current project, but this is not typical."
good,"GDIT does a lot of things well. Like any company, it has its challenges, but it also has many opportunities for those that are willing to work for them."
good,A very interesting Company to work for! There was not very much up-ward mobility options available. The work place was relaxed. I had a excellent Program Manager
good,tres bonne usine a part de souvent etre mis a pied reste ok
good,Great place to work. The professional environment is a great place to challenge yourself for higher career achievement. The management is very supportive of career growth.
good,My experience at General Dynamics was most definitely one to remember. Being able to assist consumers to the best of my ability may be one of the best.
good,"GDIT is perfect as an entry level job to hold you over until you find better employment. with their company they offer tons of OT but the turn over rate is high. they don't micro manage their they let you be unless you request help. at the Tampa, FL its very diverse with the kinds of people that work there. the hardest part of the job is dealing with the irate customers that you come across sometimes when things aren't going their way. but a typical day for me was basically completing enrollments for Medicare, answering any questions about why claims were denied and helping them file complaints about their insurance issues."
good,A typical day at work answering phone calls.The hardest part about the job would be learning new updates and procedures on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and the bonuses.
good,Easy place to work for and learn new things. Four week in class training is very engaging to help prepare you for the skills you need to perform job duties. One week nesting program helps for OJT and then production follows.
good,"Quick advancement in the company .Great benefits, Prizes and bonuses given. work environment when it come to employees,can be improved, More professionally hired people would be better for the company."
good,I worked for this company for over 12 years and my management team was wonderful to work with. Most of them are gone but the values instilled will remain.
good,"The inbound phone calls were instantly linked to the computer for fast access. Scripts were provided for most situations.  I answered questions, completed applications and gave detailed examples to help the consumers to understand the process."
good,"Helped people with their applications for health care insurance, for the affordable Care act. We didn't have to call out. We only received calls from people that needed our help. We also did nothing with payments which was nice."
good,"Work around great people. Great incentives to do well at your job. Pretty good pay for the work you do. Opportunity to move up, if you do well, but everyone starts out seasonal."
good,GDIT is a great place to work. The team I am currently on is helpful like no other I've been a part of. I feel the company is an excellent place to start a career.
good,"You'll work half days and half nights alternating from week to week. I've learned all about GMP practice in the lab, as well as working with and trouble shooting GC's and LC's."
good,A lot of meetings at work. A lot of time to learn new technology. People are friendly and the environment is relaxed. Hardest part of the job was dealing with old technology and framework that no one is using anymore. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with friendly people that are motivated to get the work done.
good,"It pays the bills and has good benefits. your shift is up for grabs every 6 months and that is not productive. OK to get by temporarily, but definitely not career material anywhere in this building."
good,GDIT was a very structured environment and had a lot of people in the department. Everyone had their job to do and it was easy to get pigeon holed into that spot.
good,GDLS is a really good place to work that understands life and work balance. Management treats people fair and offers the opportunity to work in the Program Management industry.
good,I love this job because its very informative and it also teaches you much more then just providing insurance to the consumer. It makes you feel good to know that you have gotten the consumer a good coverage provider that is within their budget with a low deductible and out of pocket maximum.
good,"The company is full of veterans. As a veteran, it made it easier to communicate and understand responsibilities as it feels like the same type of environment as being back in the service felt."
good,"8 -10 Hr Workday"
good,"Good company to work at, good experience. I've learned about heath insurance, and I learned how to talk to the consumers over the phone and resolved issues"
good,Worked for 7 years on the same contract. Enjoyed the work and team I worked with. I was sad to see the contract come to an end but am looking forward to new opportunities.
good,"A good work environment that always kept the employees informed."
good,its a very chill environment and you meet a lot of different people. i got trained very well. also i met a lot of great and not so great managers. everyone was cool enough to be my friend though. at least i thought and then i realized i didnt like the environment towards the end and resigned. thanks though appreciate your business.
good,My experience with General Dynamics was short. The work that I did for the previous company was challenging.  The five years that I worked for the company afforded me a nice life.
good,This is an amazing company yo start your call center career. The management could be better but the company its self its great and I couldn't be any more thankful for the opportunity with them.
good,Arrive to work and start your shift to calls back to back to enroll customer during open enrollment for the affordable care act.I was working the night shift so it was easier to focus on the customer needs without being on a rush.
good,General Dynamics is a great place to work for any age group. Perfect for college students who are on a fixed schedule as well as parents who need a simple 9-5 job. Steady income.
good,Good job for my needs at the time.  They worked with my schedule and helped me with all of my needs.  They work environment was very stuctured and was very well managed.
good,I enjoyed working the contract under GDIT.  Working for the company felt professional.  We had a lot of new programs to work from the ground up and it called for many hours of really hard and stressful work.  I had the best manager there which just makes all the difference.  I had a great team that worked really well together.  I learned a lot working on this team.
good,you get your own cube so no one has a chance to start drama with you. sometimes its hard to find your supervisor or amnager so you email them. There's some free time so you can research all of the updates.
good,This is a great place to work. Excellent job security (funded by the US Military). Great staff and the best management I've ever worked with. Very low stress environment.
good,"General Dynamics is good environment to work for. Everything clear from a-z. I'm not a regular employee. I don't have good information about health care, dental or vision."
good,"Would recommend this job to others. Great benefits and plenty of bonuses and incentives offered. I liked the fact we could grow within the company, they would hire within before outside of the company"
good,"answer the phone all day long, help people there records corrected. Getting screamed at at times. Learn to use multiple computer systems. Learned about medicare etc. Most of the managers are cool. culture is pretty crazy. Hardest part of the day is being stuck to the phones day in and day out. Don't forget the getting screamed at. Most enjoyable part was knowing I was helping people, and at times saving someone life just by helping them."
good,Great Company. a typical day at work is very productive. I learned many things from GD. The most enjoyable part o the job always had new challenges and new projects.
good,"Excellent place to grow and develop. Great cultural and philosophical inclusive and diverse  environment. Very family oriented,team building oriented and personal  and professional development."
good,The work was interesting and varied ranging from field engineering work on ships to the  development and execution of a system test program and detailed analyses of experimental results.
good,"GD covered my clearance and allowed me to get my foot in the door in IT. The management cared about the employees and usually provided food and snacks when required to work holidays. Being a place that requires 24-7 availability, it can occasionally be difficult to balance life outside of work around that. The job itself can be fast-paced on busier days, but rarely overwhelming."
good,"A decent home life balance. Shifts alternate per week. 5 days one week 4 days another. Big place to work, and a lot of employees there. Benefit were good and pay was decent."
good,I would definitely recommend General Dynamics Information Technology to anyone looking for a pretty flexible job. The pay is great and you get a lot of benefits and discounts.
good,"I don't know what Indeed wants me to say in this category. I like the company I work for, it's great and I have no complaints and no intention of leaving."
good,Good place however over the 10 years as a manager there was no opportunity to advance for myself or my peers and many leadership positions were consolidated to save money.
good,The work is very easy to learn and the benefits are good. They train you on everything you need know. Its overall a good place to work if you stay out of the drama that goes on.
good,"The Major problem with working with the Healthcare.gov side of GDIT is the the nature of the Job. It is NOT for everyone. It is very stress inducing and takes a lot of patience. If you can handle that type of environment, then go for it! Great people and benefits. I left early due to health problems being made worse due to the stress of the job. (Needed to sort myself out)"
good,GDIT is overall a good place to work and provides a great life/work balance with opportunities for advancement. The compensation/benefits could be better but they are sufficient. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customer service experience. I enjoy assisting customers and colleagues with day to day issues that range from easy to complex. The hardest part of my job is learning to deal with different types of people and different types of opinions about things. The workplace culture makes the experience worth while and I've learned how to work under pressure and in stressful situations.
good,I understand the company has good benefits and is employee friendly. They're willing to go that extra mile to teach you need to know in order to be a good employee.
good,"If you are looking for a job where you are just a number, this is the job for you! If you can keep good attendance, you can keep the job. Pay attention in training. You seriously will be talking to real people on the phone. It's not a joke."
good,"General Dynamics is a great place to work for , if you like talking to others and typing and looking up different aspects of your itinerary. It really helps you become a better person while working there."
good,Get to work log in to my phones and systems. Pretty slow in the mornings but got busier as the hours passed. Learned a lot about the different health insurance companies and dental insurance. Management is professional and laid back. The workplace was professional and organized. Hardest part about working at General Dynamics was when business is slow you get offered ATO (approved time off) which is awesome but not good for your paychecks. The most enjoyable part is the ATO because when you need to get off early on that day your able to bid for ATO and get approved depending on the que of the calls.
good,"During my year at GDIT, as my first time at a call center i have learned alot. From expanding my customer service skills, to peace of mind and handling calls within a time frame and the quality of call. My days start off with a short wait time, to back to back calls throughout my day. I believe the hardest part of my current job was training, just pretty much balancing off all the information taking in. Medicare overall has alot of information we can share, explain, clarify and adjust. Taking the call is the easiest, assisting members and expressing willing to assist comes in naturally. I enjoy my job there, my coworkers, the benefits and the flexibility."
good,I learned a lot with General Dynamics and they took good care of me the 12 years I worked there. Pay increases were limited but I felt secure in my position and enjoyed paid time off and medical benefits.
good,"I really enjoyed working for GDIT. My only issue with the position is that it was contract based, meaning unstable. As a sole provider for my family I could not risk losing my position if the company lost the re-bid for the contract. I only left due to taking a Federal position."
good,its an exceptional working environment but it depends on the employee how to handle the everyday challenges on customer service. no every day is the same alot of challenges are confronted but you have to have the positive and strong will to achive
good,"GDIT expects much from its employees.  In turn, GDIT supports its employees in many ways.  The benefits are good.  Career development opportunities are available.  My management is very accessible."
good,"It was difficult receiving communications advising how corporate wanted things done, but being told to do things differently by site management. Managers want the supervisors to show respect to them as well as to the CSRs -however they do not show that same respect to anyone that is not upper management."
good,"Decent workplace, somewhat of a relaxed atmosphere. They way quality grades your calls though along with your supervisor is a bit ridiculous and can cause a lot of unneeded stress."
good,While working here I had a chance to meet a lot of new people. This job was fairly easy for me because I have CSR experience. I enjoyed all of my customers for the most part. It was an adjustment with how the absentee system worked other than that not too many complaints.
good,Worked12 hour days on panama schedule with great people and learned a lot. During the weekend or holidays we would have a pot luck and a movie marathon.  Close knit group of people who tried to make the best of the long hours we spent at work.
good,"Pretty good place to work, when training they do help you out a lot. Especially when you never have had any experience what so ever in the call center world"
good,"Passionate about my position at this workplace. Was always working on self-development. There was nepotism in my management chain. Workplace culture very professional."
good,The management for general dynamics isn't to bad. The diversity in the company always keeps the work environment fun and exciting. The employees are wonderful and do everything they can to support their team members and try to avoid having any conflicts.
good,Nice place to work provided training and cross trained. Worked as a team. Place for advancfement. Great benefits. Friendly atmosphere. Never under staffed.
good,GD is a well designed company.  the training we received was well structured and allowed us to professionally help each and every student that called in to us.
good,"Productive day ,unless call volume is low, if volume is low it's going to be long day.during open enrollment it's very busy time of the year. Good pay"
good,Benefits are good but some down time with nothing to do. You long for getting on the road to do work. Travel is up to 50% at times during a year and overtime usually accompanies it.
good,working nights was not a hassle at all. The people you work with are very friendly. Taking calls was an easy task and if you knew your things you can take more calls as well.
good,I was an administrative assistant.  Thoroughly enjoyed learning the ins and outs of the company.  Especially enjoyed working for the navy base.  Never a dull moment.  Priorities changed on an hourly basis.
good,"Overall, General Dynamics is a good place to work. The pay is comparable to other companies around and the people are friendly. Management looks out for their people and are willing to listen to what the workers have to say."
good,Your more optional full time option. High strung and very stressful. If you can handle a constantly being on demand then this is the job for you. Answering phone calls and questions all of your shift.
good,"Communication between F3 mgt and Frontline troops could stand considerable improvment."
good,"I absolutely loved this place, apart from having to leave technology at home due, to not having a vehicle. Loved having my own personal cubicle and being able to work on my own without having to be checked up on every 30 mins"
good,Came to work at 8:00 in the morning. Then started Drafting for what project the project would be ether be working on military bases or working on ships or for Google  I was on at that time. then leave around 5:30
good,General Dynamics was a great place to work. The environment was relaxed. There was a lot to learn about the Affordable Care Act. I would definitely work there again.
good,This is a very productive place to work.The work environment is nice and laid back. The pay is especially nice if your trying to work and save money or pay off something.
good,"I love working at GDIT because I know I'm helping people in the most effective way possible for me and you can always tell when you've helped someone, it can really make a world of difference by just that one phone call."
good,A very business oriented environment with excellent compensation and plenty of opportunities for advancement or cross department training. I would definitely recommend it.
good,I took calls of clients that are on Medicare. Helped with Claims and billing. Handled crisis calls. Also contacted durable medical equipment companies.
good,"good for short term positions.  limited future.  Did not staff properly for the amount of work and schedule, which caused some frayed nerves on the project"
good,Very unique work environment. Constantly changing work and location. The relationship between the union and company creates a divide in worker and management relationship. extremely diverse workforce with all levels of competency and attitudes.
good,working there is ok diverse and has a lot to offer.  I like that they push you to do better and contribute.  If you want your college degree they will help
good,General Dynamics is a great company to be employed with. They have awesome benefits for employees and their families. It was the type of position where you could help others fulfill their need for information regarding medical/medicaid information. If a beneficiary needed to know about their benefits then I would be there to give them information about their file once I verified them over the phone.
good,"This is a great seasonal job."
good,The hours were reasonable and pay was good. Very competitive job environment. Hardest part about this job was that it was mostly outdoor work in the Texas summer.
good,"I liked it. Ovetime is offered. You have good benefits, pay raise when you work the weekends and nights. it is fulltime Employment. And im diabetic and i go som a room to take my medication."
good,There are busy times and there are some slow times. Most of the people really want to do a good job.  Most managers are really engaged in their workforce.
good,"If you’re in search of a knowledgeable, polished professional to contribute to the company and your, then take in consideration GDIT."
good,"This company is great for a challenging career I worked with a diverse group of adults and children.  The only thing frustrating is there is no full time permanent positions available. Without FT positions, that means there are no health benefits."
good,"I'm a rehire and I'm very interested in working with the gdit family again,it was a very great experience  , I loved the working environment"
good,Decent work relationships with co-workers and management.  Problems with compensation of travel expenses that became an issue.  Good online educational program.
good,The people I work with along with the projects I manage make me want to come to work each and every day.  I would recommend this company.
good,I had a great experience working for GDIT.  I learned a lot and was treated very well.  I worked remotely (from home) most of the time.
good,Managers are willing to work with schedules.  It is very convenient. Enjoy the people! Government contract  so there aren't any raises.
good,"A typical work day would consist of a handful of work to keep everyone busy. I like to stay busy that way it feels as if the day is going faster. I would like a management team to tell me how I am doing. In other words, constructive criticism. As for my co-workers, I like to work side by side with them. I like to stick together because after all, we are a team. The hardest part of a job for me has to be learning the material. Once that is out of the way, I can overcome any obstacle in my way. In contrast, my favorite part of the job would have to be putting a smile on a customer's face. I tend to build a relationship with everyone I speak with. It makes my job a lot easier."
good,"Call center work taking inbound calls, you must adhere to your schedule, get good call scores and be productive to get a good scorecard. The scorecard is used to help determine your shift."
good,This Where IT all begins building submarines. I was apprentice electrician . Reading blueprints. And measuring to install all equipment . Wiring and troubleshooting if necessary. I had the best team members you could work and learn from . Everyone works together to accomplish our goal.
good,Great company to work for. Learned how to interact on daily bases with upper management. Great training programs. And advancement opportunities.
good,"GDIT is a very dynamic environment. Days are not really typical. Any day may be quiet and productive (but never slow or boring) or extremely hectic with more work than seems possible to accomplish. We work well together and always seems to get things done, even with constant, almost daily changes that need to be adapted to."
good,"GDIT provides a great environment for people just starting out on their careers. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement within the contract, but at a certain point you do reach a plateau. Overall there is a decent balance of work and home life and the benefits and compensation are not the worst, but also not the best. There are some issues regarding growing within the company after a certain point, but to be honest this company is really more for preparing you for your overall career, if not necessarily with this company."
good,"Management is very good, always ready to work with you. "
good,"General is a great place to work, I worked as a CSR and i loved helping people enroll into health care plans. The process to get hired is very simple..Do the application and have a diploma, The security while working is not so great though. They dont do good enough character analyzing before they hire people, It can get pretty ghetto."
good,"Nice place to work at "
good,"good company, mostly seasonal they they lay you off, good benefits and great pay. always get bonuses paid holidays even if you don't work."
good,"very busy, something new to learn every day, fair management, deal with different employee cultures every day,very difficult to work with different management styles; love to work people in the production site."
good,General Dynamics is a great place to work.  I have learned so many things about Healthcare.  The only thing that I do not like is the caliber of people that they hire. I do love being a Supervisor.
good,"The ""extras"" are definitely worth mentioning. A relaxed dress code, flexible work schedules, and ability to work from home when needed. "
good,"This was an interesting place to work.  A very large campus with up to 5, 000 employees working 3 shifts.   Very large scale fabrications assembled into 1,000 foot long liquid natural gas tankers."
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs i have had. "
good,"The people in the contact center do a great job to service the callers and the customer who manages the contract."
good,"I love working for GD, is a very good work environment, and an excellent location, the only bad thing is the salary, Exceptional co=workers, always ready to help lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll"
good,"Everyone is so helpful when asked upon. "
good,"Working for General Dynamics Information Technology was a very interesting journey and I learned ample of valuable of information,"
good,Your sitting all the time and you have to be able to keep up with many different teachings. Its hard to get used to. If you figure out what your doing youll be fine.
good,First call center i ever worked at that didn't have a point system. (get so many points your canned) which i felt was wrong
good,Great place to work. They are very attentive to employee's concerns and problems. They always ask for feedback from us and actually make changes or adjustments to resolve our issues.
good,I have been a security officer for over 25 years.   Knowledge in NISPOM and IC directives.   Work closely with government customers and employee personnel.  Works well with others at every level.  Working knowledge of COMSEC accounts and processing.   Have received excellence awards for Program Performance.
good,Great people to work as a team with. There's not any short cutting. They take the time to do things preciously. They don't rush the machinist and have a billiard table in the break room.
good,"Up till this year I enjoyed working for General Dynamics, the people were nice. But work was too boring.  Unfortunately the company didn't help me do better to get my keystrokes better. "
good,"I enjoyed my employment at General Dynamics Information Technolog Systems .It tought me a lot of information about  insurance , there was always teamwork among my peers and my supervisor was very active and informative to our team.I worked the late shift which I chose because I usaully worked days and nights as there was an abundence amount of overtime offered.the hardest part of my job at General Dynamics was that it ended every year and I was rehired back for open enrollment period."
good,"As an Area Manager of the Field Service Team I was responsible to:"
good,"Very rewarding work, You work on state of the art equipment at a very early stage.  Very flexible with work life balance and great starting salary.  After you gain experience in your engineering field, the compensation and benefits do not advance with your experience.  The wall usually hits around the 5 year mark."
good,"That work pace was Fest to Famine system, first of the month was slow while the end of the months were all you got. Management for the most part good, they promoted from within so most managers were very experienced. They liked to reward the people when important goals were met."
good,"I have learned a lot about how the insurance is set up and functions, I learn how to apply and help people maintain their coverage. I also learn a lot about Medicare and CMS government agency."
good,"AT GDIT there is great work/life balance and job security. Management is understanding, helpful and always willing to help. Great company to work for."
good,Answer general questions about Health Insurance Marketplace and help people complete applications for health insurance. Typical call center with very strict attendance policies and highly regimented breaks and lunches. The hardest part of the job is to remain compliant with assigned schedule because calls can last long enough to make being compliant with the schedule impossible. Any deviation from the schedule must be reported and justified through the supervisor. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to co-workers on breaks and lunches.
good,"Overall, General Dynamics is known mainly as a huge military contractor.  They try very hard to mimic the same pay and leave along with other disirable benefits.  The only downside is that you are away from your family for long periods at one time generally six weeks on; one week off in the tower climbing industry.  "
good,"General Dynamics company gave me  was my first office job.  I really enjoyed the learning, my coe-workers and the work/life balance the company offered."
good,"I supervise a group typically between 12 and 30 employees (CSR). Responsible for day-to-day coordination and administration of tasks by ensuring quality and productivity standards are maintained while meeting client schedules so we would meet the contract. I maintains record of changes in instructions and ensures all team members are informed of changes and make sure everything is in compliance with their times sheet and adherences. I also coach the CSR when they fail calls, have weekly one on one’s/meeting with them about their performance and reviews subordinates’ performance.  I also answer inbound calls when I am needed."
good,Working there was enjoyable up until a period of time where it was getting close to the end of open enrollment. Management stopped caring right after.
good,Worked with a great team.  The managers were supportive and positive.  You learn to work with a lot of different personalities and time management.
good,Overall just a good place to work especially for beginners I work on the pearl harbour it was in repair but the ship stead clean and safety was all ways first priority
good,"I've enjoyed my time with GDIT, but the contract I am on there is a huge disconnect between my supervisors and management. I don't think it's very well structured. The breaks are only 2 15 minute breaks a day and you could not take a 30 minute break straight."
good,"The overall job I had at General Dynamics was very up tempo as far as the workload, We received inbound and sometimes outbound calls about 5 seconds after the last call. Learning the material and how to navigate the computer software to perform our daily tasks was pretty challenging. That kept the job interesting in the beginning but after you learn techniques and ""your own way"" to assist the consumers there was not very much difficulty involved which could make the job seem boring to some. Although, as a Tier 1 Customer Service Representative, I had new trainings and updated reference material to study and apply that to my regular routine at work. I really enjoyed working at General Dynamics and I feel somewhat disappointed that the work contract, that I have been a part of, is coming to an end. Unfortunately there isn't a high enough job demand at my position for the company to extend my employment or to promote me from a part-time employee to full-time. So the only true downside to the job that I have is the job security,"
good,Nice place to work...decent work environment...no complaints. Enjoy the improved communication between departments.  Agents have areas where they can advance depending on experience.

Hardest part of the job was some of the work it self and the most enjoyable part was just being around good people everyday.
good,"I had to pleasure to help millions of consumers get health insurance nationwide. The opportunity to meet people was a plus and I have gained a lot of experience within the company. It is great working with people who are there and willing to help each other grow and learn all the different changes within the company. The hardest part of the job is trying to deal within irate consumers who did not agree with the new health program but the most enjoyable is knowing that I have help many consumers get health insurance and at the end of the day I can go home and smile for a full days work. There is also a lot of overtime workers can sign up for to make extra money, especially around the holidays to get those extra gifts for your family. Management was there to help as much as possible and to make sure that each employee was up to date on all training that is required as an employee."

good,It is a great place to work if you are interested in Customer Service. I learned how to get people enrolled using the Healthcare.gov website and explain their results of whether they qualified for a tax credit or subsidy to help pay for their healthcare. The hardest part of the job was getting my medical needs (i.e. an ergonomic chair) met and being able to schedule doctor appointments. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping consumers get healthcare insurance.
good,"A typical day at work would include arriving and going straight to my desk to begin taking customer service calls. The breaks were moderate, and my coworkers were pleasant people to be around. From this job, I learned how to work with computer database programs and to troubleshoot by using them. I also learned how to perform extensive research so I could weigh out all of the possible outcomes of a problem at hand. "

good,"My work days consist of instructing a class of 1-10 sailors in Surface Ship Torpedo Defense, up-dating/revising curriculum, or reaching out to the Navy to advertise my AN/SLQ-25C class dates. GDIT has a friendly and enjoyable atmosphere. And the management is very approachable and responsive."
good,"Enjoyed working as a team"
good,"Only negative thing about the job is that there is no room for advancement.  While your job is generally secure, they rarely promote from one position to another from what I have seen.  Additionally make sure you negotiate to a salary you are happy with because it will be a very slow climb to a higher salary."

good,"Working for 1-800-MEDICARE is a day of taking calls from beneficiaries and providers. Duties include identifying why claims were denied to finding prescription drug plans. I learned how to use computer systems, how to handle distress calls and how to manage time wisely so that I may help as many customers as I can. Managers often did side-by-side reviews to see how we were doing and what we could do to improve. Coworkers were polite, friendly and focused. Dealing with distress calls proved to be difficult yet rewarding when we were able to get the customer what they needed. I enjoyed knowing that I was able to help the callers with their issues, knowing that was one more thing they didn't have to worry about."

good,"General Dynamics is a large and diverse company that has several programs that can be rigorous and demanding . But from my experience, articulate, comprehensive work and diligence, are rewarded. I have worked my way through my undergraduate and graduate degree at General Dynamics and I am grateful the opportunities this company has afforded me."

good,GDIT was a good place of employment with a lot of room to grow.  Management was very helpful and supportive.  You can learn a lot at this company.  You can travel the world and make a salary. GDIT is great to start a career.
good,i loved working with GDIT due to the management and staff. i had a great team that worked together and got the job done. we had fun and worked hard. love team work.
good,Overall a positive experience and really enjoy the team I support. Both benefits and compensation could be improved. Upward mobility and diversity of minorities can be difficult and this is more evident among the HR staff. Even the inclusion and diversity teams are not representative of the programs/ groups they lead.
good,"The workplace culture was relaxed and enjoyable as long as you got your work done.  "
good,A very flexible culture and team with a super fast push to complete projects.  Allowed me to train a team of people to work the project and drive it to execution.
good,Some travel is required for the jobs in the Chesapeake branch. Mostly worked in Naval shipyard. Workplace had a relaxed atmosphere with efficient workers.
good,"GDIT is a Global wide company that opens many doors within.. when I got hired I was happy, great manager, for the first few weeks I got along with my supporting cast just fine (this quickly changed)... I was hired as a driver with a CDL (A) therefore I was paid more  then the warehouse personnel, which means for the most part my job was somewhat different then the warehouse personnel with some added warehouse responsibilities ..  This didn't sit well with the supervisor and most of my supporting cast.. about a month into this new job I started hating my role and the surrounding cast (not the manger) that I worked with, I felt like the ""black sheep"" I quit after two months because the warehouse supervisor and some other individuals and myself just didn't see eye to eye and started to nit-pick at everything I was doing.."
good,"The days were fast paced and sometimes stressful, but the opportunity to answer customers' questions and help them understand the insurance that they were considering was a great experience. The workplace was very busy, but everyone worked to try to make sure everything ran as smoothly as possible, especially during open enrollment periods. The most enjoyable moments were when I could answer customers' questions and give them a clearer understanding of what they were looking for and their options."
good,Good place to work and earn money. Company is big with lot of employees and divisions. Learn each  day and never stop learning as you move upward in your career.
good,"I was a full time employee working with the Government at Ft. Huachuca, AZ and had a great team and Manager to work with and learn from. Only reason I left was relocation."
good,"Although I worked for GDIT, I was working on a contract for the US Navy.  The hardest part of the job is working under government contracts, which are not guarantees of steady work if the contract is not renewed.  The Management staff I worked with was exceptional and unfortunately when the contract ended those positions ended with everyone that was on the contract."
good,"Company is great, very organized. Great pay and benefits. Flexible schedules. However, there is a shift bid every 6 months I believe it is and if your scorecard is not good then you get a bad schedule but if you're doing good on your score card then you're more than likely going to get a shift you want. Scorecard is based on your attendance and how good you do on your calls."
good,nice job not enough pay for the services.... nice environment and very nice employees ..one the best jobs i worked at .. just not enough pay to pay the bills
good,"Conservatively led and managed as a company "
good,"Medicare Call Center "
good,"I started as a tier 1 CSR, and within a year had been given additional training, compensation, and responsibility. Within 18 months I was a Supervisor. Paid time off was provided, as well as a vacation buy program where you could purchase additional paid time off as well. The culture is one of innovation and forward movement. Highly recommended."
good,Management was horrible. Poor on-site management led to General Dynamics losing the contract. General Dynamics is still a good company to work for. They just need to make sure that the manager is qualified for the task at hand.
good,Work here can be incredibly stressful due to the fast pace and agitated customers. You literally receive calls back to back with only a six second break between calls. They are very fair with compensation however and they are reasonable about being able to stand up for yourself when callers become too irate. The management was also good and accountable for their work.
good,"Interfacing with management and customers."
good,"Great history with government work, though hard-pressed to understand or integrate into civilian-focused work.  Leadership appeared to be very capable; though middle management lacked maturity."
good,"Large cube farm environment with a support structure that begins with an on site GDIT supervisor but will work with and answer to, most often, a Government lead.  Work is diverse, interesting and challenging with some travel required."
good,"During my time with General Dynamics the work environment was excellent.  Management was very approachable, and they legitimately cared about there employees."
good,"I have been with GDIT for 14 years and I don't have many complaints. They look after their employees. We have great benefits, discounts, and leave that increases throughout the years that you don't lose. "
good,"I worked as a Systems Engineer on a 12 year contract. Work was satisfying and challenging. "
good,"I enjoyed the job, the work I did, and the culture.  They didn't seem to know how to balance hiring and staffing needs for the workload, however.  Personnel decisions were poorly made and poorly executed in some areas."
good,"awesome work environment. employers care for employees, but contract life is not always the best route to go. Pay was underbid but still enough to be happy."
good,"It was a time I can never forget. My first growth, it gave me more than I gave it and I appreciate every minute I spent there. It was a time I learnt the basics"
good,"Not much job security. I guess is to be expected since it’s a contracting company, but that’s the only con I can thing of. Management always make themselves available and respond quickly to emails. Lots of remote work with independence to make your own schedule. The pay is decent. Lots of employee incentives. Would recommend, just be aware that your position may not be guaranteed."
good,"Collaborative place to work, but can vary from client to client and place to place and contract size."
good,Incoming and outgoing calls regarding insurance. No additional comments Outstanding place to work if you have the transportation to and from.the job site. You have to pass about 6 weeks of paid training before you actually begin the job.
good,I have learned so much about the Medicare/ Medicaid/ Healthcare system and how they operate together to provide the utmost in individual healthcare choices for everyone.
good,"Company does there best to support, they are large with lots of policy for everything.  They will do what they can to help when there is an issue but the company always comes first."
good,"On a typical day at work, I learned about different lives of all different kinds of people. The culture there was diverse, but mainly african-americans. The hardest part of the job was to decline a customer."
good,"general dynamics was a great job , it wasnt hard at, there wasnt much consumers calling the lines at most times. you get a raise monthly depending on your attendance ,and u get a real  quiet area to work in."
good,"A typical GDIT day are rewarding and productive, getting to know the needs of the consumers and helping them with their many needs. The manger has an open door policy very helpful when one was in need of help or was stuck on an issue."
good,"The work within this company is fast past and under paid. I like assisting others, therefore, it makes this job tolerable. It is not always about the money, for me."
good,Too many politically correct staff members who try to micro manage everything. I think the best thing about working there was the little cafe on campus.
good,you are asking for a review of a company that I have not worked for over twenty years.  Can't see why it even matters.  It should Have a option to opt out.
good,The people you end up working with are so fun and caring. At this job the most enjoyable part of this job was working with other people of different cultures and learning all their different personalities.
good,"Awesome company, great work ethics and great working environment. very organize. good benefits and veteran friendly environment  great benefits and opportunities within the company"
good,In the area I worked in I put together small to medium parts together so they could be placed onto a Stryker. The work environment was good while I worked for the company.
good,"This was an over all relaxed and casual work environment. It was at times slow paced, but the call volume could rise during certain periods of the year. They provide a fair wage for the work being done"
good,"I had really great experience at this job, I had great friends, great supervisor that was very lenient and worked with me very well. This job I will admit is not for everyone but I loved it."
good,"General Dynamics is a good place to work with Great Managers and Staff.  I learned how to use the machines and the processes quickly because my trainer was excellent.  I will miss my ""Family"" there."
good,"Great environment, Temporary position , working with elderly individuals to learning different things about the job. Group activity and meetings and goals to meet."
good,I loved making pretty good money to take care of my family but some customers were just beyond rude and nasty to me.My favorite part about working here was the food vendors cooking in the parking lot!
good,We work all assign tasks and request provided by customer.  We work all change request assign via the customer.  We provide updates to the customer data base when needed.
good,As a NOC technician with GDIT I was provided the tools and assistance to make sure the customer had their needs meet immediately. It was a very relaxed work atmosphere but when the customer needed something it was all hands on deck.
good,"It was a pleasant place to work.  The supervisors are helpful informative and accommodating.  The pay wasn't the greatest, but was sufficient to make ends meet and it is easy to move up the ladder there. They have many departments to work in and multiple shifts for those needing the freedom of choice.  You are however micromanaged in terms of time on phones so be prepared for that."
good,"Love the people I work with. It is a large company and each program varies depending on the person who is running it. Overall, it is a great place to work. However, yo will have to network to get ahead."
good,I would enroll people into affordable health care. I would help them by completing The application online while asking them personal questions over the phone.
good,It’s a fast pace work place. It is scheduled to a T. Your breaks are scheduled and if you don’t come back before your break is over you could possibly be in trouble.
good,"Contracting world is a bit like a roller coaster."
good,"I have worked for General Dynamics since 2015, there has been many times where I was more secure and felt at ease working here. Great people and great job equals a great day."

good,"Good company to work for from many perspectives. But mostly they have a structure of policies and procedures that actually facilitates positive coordination between various functional stake holders that results in meeting quick reaction requirements. Secondly, they put a heavy emphasis on track Ning and education for employees development and ensuring compliance with applicable policies, procedures, Governent regulations"
good,A typical work day was verry routine. Verry easy to acomplish. My manager was ready to help if needed and realy easy to get along with. The hardest part was dealing with agrevated customers and having to have the self control not to lose your patience or temper with them. The most enjoyable part of it was the plesant co-workers and the pay check every two weeks.
good,General Dynamics is a aerospace and manufacturing strong company.  As a matriced organization there is significant exposure which promotes more opportunities (i.e. promoptions).
good,"Excellent and efficient management staff. My contracted position was "

good,I loved the Secure Floor Plan.  I was able to earn 6 Sigma Yellow Belt Certification while working there. The opportunity for overtime pay was helpful in making up for the low hourly pay.
good,"A typical work day is 8 hours, overtime is offered intermittently. I learned from working in Marketplace (ACA) with customer and now working with Medicare customers. Management work with employees, not all are understanding , Workplace is okay, you don't get enough time to enjoy your lunch, everyone has 30 minute lunch, that is what is provided, but in all actuality you only spend about 10 to 15 minutes for lunch. Its hard to go to your locker,eat really fast, go"
good,"I worked here for a short period of time, and it was called Vangent; which was a medicare/medicaid call center.  It was a very professional environment."
good,"Benefits are amazing, the pay is alright, but the job is not justified by the hourly wage(s) and it is a very tedious job with no time to do anything else but work(i.e short breaks and no time during the workday to even send an email)."

I am thankful for being given the chance to enhance my skills, even though I was temporary contractor.I have nothing but high regard for my supervisors and fellow workers. Enjoyed it.

good,"General Dynamics is a good place to work but it takes me about 45 minutes to get there.  I am presently looking for a job that is closer which is why I put in Mesa, AZ.  If it were closer, I probably wouldn't be looking for another job.  I don't drive and it puts a burden on my family."
good,Great place to work. Good travel. Great opportunity to go places. Many places around the globe. Even more pay overseers. Close to six plus figures. And all expenses paid except food during travel

good,"Work days are generally busy. Sometimes overwhelming based on influx. A good opportunity to get experience and use as a stepping stone for career decisions and development. Management is overall good. Environment is also fairly good. The hardest part of the job, like anywhere, dealing with poor performers and picking up slack. The most enjoyable part is a good schedule, fair pay, decent management, and learning experiences."

good,okay job just very repetitive. the hours were okay but you may get stuck with a sucky schedule beacuse they are open 7 days a week and all typs of hours.
good,The work place is good for someone with customer service experience. The job is not hard just talking to different people with different attitude which is the stressful part of the job. Now my job is I am a quality specialist which means I grade the calls now. Which is much more relaxing.

good,"Didnt really do that much, summer internship with the engineering group. Worked drafting and design dept. Good people, good pay, would work for them again"
good,Great job with great benefits while I worked there I had made friends in the work place and they were great. I was a little sad I had to quit due to personal issues. I think the breaks felt a little short but hey the pay and the free healthcare I think is worth it in the end.
good,"It is a nice place to work."
good,I got to help people get insurance through the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare would help them pick a plan and get it started for them. And that's pretty much what I did all day sometimes you would get an angry caller and you'd have to deal with that
good,Overall good company to work for. They hold many prime accounts with the government. They care more about the bottom lines then the employee
good,Great job gets old quick liked the people I worked with but I need something new and a better location. Job was easy but I'm looking for more pay and a better working environment. Work consisted of waiting for calls answering customers questions and giving prices.
good,I feel this is a great place to start if you don't know much call center experience. Place is clean could be cleaner. Learned a lot with both Medicare and Marketplace insurances.
good,enjoyed many days of working as part of a team as well as individually on assigned tasks. allowed to use and build on skills learned and developed in the military

good,I have never had any issues with anybody while working there.  All the staff was very friendly and cooperative.  It was a very good work environment and fun place.
good,"The hours were great, only 40 per week. People were really nice. Management, mostly supervisors, were usually never around when needed. Very stressful. It was a call center job, and sometimes you would get nice people, but most were rude and mean."
good,Great workplace. Great Leadership and incentives for outstanding performance. Continued support from leadership regarding feedback and ongoing training.
good,I would recommend anyone to work here. The training is great especially if you don not have any call center experience. There will always be someone there to be there and support you with anything that you need.
good,Great people to work for competitive benefits and equal pay.  One of the big leaders in information technology and government contracting.
good,I would recommend anyone work here. they are very flexible with their work hours and are very understanding. the co-workers are great people. the hardest part of the job is the first day on the phones.

good,Great place to expand knowledge about health insurance. Very friendly work environment from Managers to Employees everybody wiling to help even though it as a call center people were willing to extend a helping hand. The hardest part about this particular job was the attendance policy. To elaborate on that they had what was called adherence which had to be at a 91.5 percent as far as on time. The problem I found with that is you could not fully control the time length of some particular phone calls and that would affect at times when you would take your break/lunch which would also affect your adherence because you would not go on your exact scheduled time. Although it was the hardest part I was always above on my adherence in the 93 percent and above.
good,"provides great knowledge, great opportunity to move up in company, and multiple schedules to pick from. Provides insurance at great cost"
good,"It Is Very Fast  Paced And Friendly Environment, Not A Lot Of Communication Between Co-Workers Because Of The Constant Phone Calls And Interactions With Customers. Hardest Part Is To Keep Up With The Constant Updates And Only Having 15 Minutes To Learn It All. But I Like That The Day Goes By So Quick You Don't Even Notice It. Also The Over Time Provided Is A Plus."
good,"Always challenging environment, where are always learning new tools to get our job done. challenging jobs keeps interested in staying and have fun."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of dealing with student loans, hardest part of my day would be when customers would curse me out, but the most enjoyable part of my day was when I actually was able to help a student out by giving her the needed information and helping her get to the next step of the process."
good,"Great work place good environment to work in, very fast pace, "
good,"great company, motivated employees, great environment. management consider every employee. I advice people to apply and work for the company."
good,At General Dynamics you are trained to take inbound calls and register people into health insurance. GDIT is a great place to get call center experience I've never had any problems with the company the only thing I would suggest is that they train the floor supervisors and keep them updated on material because most of them aren't on the phone much so they can't really answer any questions in regards to a call or concern.
good,"Answered phone calls, and any inquiries the customer had, I learned to have patience with angry or upset customers, and to just resolve the issue calmly, Management was good as well as my co-workers, the hardest part of the job is remaining calm while an angry customer is ranting, most enjoyable part is making someones day better and resolving their issues"
good,"The position itself is stagnant when it comes to if you want to learn anything new. It is a high pace job with the military/Gov't environment. The people are great no matter who it is, the only complaint I have is the schedule is not consistent at all. Shifts change every 2-3 months, 12 hour shifts. Hard to deal with when you are continuing your education and have three large dogs to take care of."
good,"I enjoyed working at General Dynamics because they were willing to work with me when I had a hard time understanding some of the policies. The management team was very nice, however they were firm with the rules."

good,"it was a great experience working as a health insurance agent , they provided with a lot of information to learn, they also offered lots of incentives and double pay"
good,"Work environment was safe, many different skill aere required to accomplish task. You must pocess the skill to handle any working environment and any challenges that come with it because you may be more experienced than your co-worker or supervisor,"
good,General Dynamics is a great company to work for.  The hours are good and the pay is above average. The total atmosphere was team oriented and safety conscience.
good,"	The CMS customer service representative is responsible for delivering general Marketplace information to callers. The CSRs use basic office equipment and technology such as telephones, email and web browsers to perform their duties. The processes that the CSRs must follow are well defined and documented in standard operating procedures and scripts."
good,At GDIT the work day is simple. You just get on your computer and start answering calls to help the consumers. I have learned a lot of different things in which I am not sure I can discuss out side of the work place. The hardest part is when the consumers are very frustrated and do not want to listen to you. The best part is that you have people around you that understand what is going on if you have a question.
good,I personal think that the workplace at general dynamics was professional. Each day task were reviewed in the mornings for every employee to complete

good,Good overall experience they need to hire more people and grow the business.
good,"the benefits were a plus, in addition the company promoted many various training opportunities and continued educational progarms, i.c. certification and degrees."
good,I loved taking the calls from the medicare beneficiaries and assisting them with their insurance needs. There was always a clear understanding of the job because each employee attended weekly training meetings.
good,"This was my first job, and it was quite the experience because I learned additional communication skills and actually received some real work experience. It was hard to work while attending college, but I made it happen. It is a high security facility so wearing badges was mandatory. The hourly wage was great. The only cons was technology having phone cut offs with the clients involved and maintaining a schedule with the project manager and supervisors."
good,I enjoy working for vangent my only complaint is that I'm still a temporary employee after a year! Its a fun place to work nice staff. The actual job is a call center for medicare.
good,GDIT has their stuff together.  As a contractor I found them to be fair with salaries and the environment was great.  The only reason I left the company was due to the contract not being renewed and they did not have an equivalent contract position for me to fill with my specialty.
good,"a typical day can start from slow to fast, i started as a telecom technician and worked my way to network admin, there is room to advance . work culture is always about safety, hardest part of the job sometimes is the long hours . The most enjoyable part is having a great team to work with"
good,This is probably the best job I worked at good pay and great benefits . It was fast paced yet a relaxed environment pretty simple job . Would still be working there if never closed down .
good,"I, did not agree on changing Supervisors every 2 to 3 months, because of the different managing and abscence of personnel to get assistance with password issues and technical issues. They, acuse the employee of not being there on time and deduct time."
good,GDIT has competitive benefits. Flexible work schedule. They do have plenty of contracts in the D.C. metro area to move around for potential career growth.
good,"Great company to work for.  Work/life balance, great benefits with great compensation.  However many positions are being eliminated due to restructuring due to a recent buy out."
good,If you want to grow they will mold you into what they need.  They care enough that if there is contract loss they are willing to assist in helping place the employee on another contract.
good,"training, check space for safe to work, go to assigned space to begin work, give brief of completed work after lunch then return back to work to complete the assigned task for the day."
good,This area has a lot of call center jobs and this one is probably the easiest and in an environment that made going to work not seem so bad.  The company is great.
good,"Good place to work, offers self-fulfillment because you're able to help families reunite, and live happy, healthy lives in America... legally. It is somewhat stressful due to technological issues and information overload. Pay is considered a living wage including affordable benefits."
good,"Working with the company was great management didn't micromanage. Benefits and pay were excellent, all medical issues recovered. Look forward to working for the company yet of the future"
good,"I liked working at GDIT, though regular CSR's were charged managers much too often. Sometimes you wouldn't even know. The pay was okay, but they taxed your pay so so much you never got as much as you thought. I would have have kept my job is I'd been able to go back to my part time position in time for school (you have to wait 90 days to request a schedule change) and if I didn't live 45 minutes away. It wasn't worth the wear and tear I was putting on my car."
good,I enjoyed my time at GDIT but felt like I couldn't move to a different department.  GDIT provided plenty of programs to help advance my career.  I recommend GDIT as a company to work for.
good,My experience with this company is was that they were a high performance driven company that had a vision of where they were going.  GDIT is a company that is mission driven and lives up to its values.  I really enjoyed working for this company and would take any opportunity to return to its ranks should I find another contract.
good,"I would definitely work here again besides the low wages, the job really wasn’t that bad. I enjoyed clickity clacking on my keyboard and hanging up on rude customers."
good,"This job is great for those who have a passion for customer service. The job security is on the fence, as there are many reasons you can be technically fired."
good,"GDIT is a large company with many opportunities to remain in desired field or branch out  and do something different.  The hardest part is that there is not much interaction with leadership.  However, the job is done and the customer is satisfied.  This is what matters most."
good,If you are looking for somewhere fast paced and fun environment this is the place to be. I loved this place when I worked there. There is room for growth in the company.
good,"Nice place to work as a contractor. Pay is quite competitive, and work is high stress as they are a DoD contractor and have to meet contract guidelines."
good,"Overall great place to work, the pay could be a little better. Management is very reasonable, responsive and helpful. Benefits are good, covers most health care needs to include optional dental and vision and a 401k plan."
good,"Learned alot  about customer service, Inbound center, was very excited to be able to learn so much in such a little time, I would recommend this position to anyone who is in transition, Must be efficient."
good,GDIT strives for excellence in the data analytics field. The management is great and are always looking to push the boundaries. I've learned a tremendous amount from my time here with plenty of the resources provided to me.
good,"The GD culture is about employees. The company is focused on training and development, hires from within and provides a strong work/life balance.  Benefits are competitive."
good,"I enjoyed the training process, the people i meet and the experiences i was able to go through and have for everyday life. The work enviroment was nice was and open. Everyone had a cubicle that they may or may not have had to share with night shift. They usually have food themed days so you would have to leave the job for lunch which was great!"
good,I had a great experience with the management of GDIT in the various roles I held within the company. Smaller contracts offer better pay but fewer opportunities for promotion without transferring to another contract.
good,"The callers are the biggest stressor when you work for General Dynamics in the call center. The hours are consistent and the benefits are competitive. Rules change with the season and you don't always know what's coming next, but generally my experience has been positive."
good,Great company with grear benefits to offer. Environment is great and a lot of flexibility. A lot of room for improvement and great activities. Great shift to chose from
good,"My job title consisted of, operating heavy machinery and mechanical equipment, working and monitoring on a production assembly line, and operating a forklift."
good,it was a time where  i didn't  understand  the concept of answering the phones but  in training  my teacher broke it down  to me to where i can  understand   what i was supposed to do and i got it
good,"You start with 3 weeks (4 weeks if you're in Medicare) of paid training.  There you run over everything you need to know. I really enjoyed working with my trainers, they answered any questions and were very insightful.  Once working on the floor, you build a routine, but everyday is different."
good,"Great opportunity to learn networking and engineering skills and techniques."
good,Never had issues where I thought I would not have a job. Fun people to work with. Management is not the best but it could be worse. Hardest part of the job is not being able to participate in certain things without taking leave
good,"Great place to work.  I learned leadership skills.  It taught me how to be a team player, even with competition. My day to day job duties help me in my personal life."
good,"Nice place to work. Benefits are better coverage than most and offer many other resources for their employees to help them in many ways. From personal finance to domestic abuse they have resources available to help regular people get help with life changing services. Are truly an Equal Opportunity Employer. Very secure building with plenty of parking, and 2 weeks of paid training when you start. Incentives for attendance and working overtime when offered as well."
good,"Excellent Company."
good,"Good company to work for.I recommend to others. I don;t really want to write this review, so i will fill up the minimum with characters devoted to hitting the minimum."
good,"Great agents fun workplace good team interactions. A typical work day was training new hires as well as seasoned representatives, going over materials getting the team ready for their new roles as Medicare/Medicaid agents, Training different cultures as well as learning styles, The hardest part was of this position was building the agents confidence to take calls the enjoyable part was looking into their eyes when the agents realized that they could do the job and do it with world class customer service."
good,"The job is not that difficult and it relaxing to a certain point before and after open enrollment. It's for job advancement and management it good. "
good,GDIT was a good company for me to work because of my full-time job. It is a great part-time job. The schedule was perfect for me. The company also give you opportunities to adjust schedules.
good,"The work is somewhat repetitive, however, there is usually something needing attention, breaking up the same day to day activities. The work is enjoyable when training is being conducted."
good,Provide you with PPE important tools clean environment to work with a good teamwork a lot of overtime good retirement plan Healthcare Dental care and private parking lot
good,"Me parecio una bonita experiencia a pesar del corto tiempo, pero adquiri conocimientos y habilidades"
good,"Answer questions for healthcare.gov"
good,Great company; but internal growth potential is hindered by the continual mergers of companies that push people further down the management chain.  Great benefits including education but if one wants growth you must leave then come back.
good,"Great experience as an intern.  Had the chance to work on many exciting projects and wasn't treated as ""just an intern"".  Great job culture to be apart of."
good,The company is a good company. I enjoy the benefits. The scheduling could be a little better. That's pretty much all I have to say. I'm just looking for more growth.
good,I enjoyed working there.  The people were focused and deliverables were clear. I did not like working in the defense industry or I may still be there.
good,"Our Small Arms Repair Program or SARP team(s) work 9-12 hour days, and traveled many Army Bases Nation wide. Great job until contract ended. After contract ended we all was  furloughed."
good,GDIT has provided me with opportunity to gain invaluable experience by working overseas in a new and challenging environment.  This new environment has given me the opportunity to learn some new skills that I can add to my resume.

good,The card facility keeps a very low turnover so teams are able to know each other and be more successful. Management worked well with the teams and wanted them to succeed.
good,GDIT was a good place to work with many benefits. I enjoyed this being one of my first jobs and would recommend it to those looking for a job as a Customer Service Representative.
good,"GDIT is one of the best companies to work for in the insurance areas. It teaches you the foundation of all types of insurance. Very detailed, many ways to grow in company. The company believes in building their people. Company has many position for growth"
good,"Correction needed:  I did not work for the Information Technology Division of General Dynamics, rather I worked for the Electronic and earlier, the Convair Division of General Dynamics.  See resume."

good,The work flow was well maintained and the people were nice to work with. It was well balanced and structured thoroughly.. The hardest part of the job is knowing the the job description and what it consist of.
good,"Talking all day, looking at a computer screen. Benefits are great, vacation time is nor enough hours, you only get 80 when you make another year. SPL comes every 2 weeks and you have to let it build up."
good,General Dynamics IT is an awesome place to work allowing you the opportunity to grow in experience.  The salary is very good.  Leadership is very hands on and approachable.
good,A typical day consist of 20+ phone calls of answering Medicare related phone calls. Some calls can be more complex than others. Calls are more frequent during peak times and Open enrollment for drug plans.
good,The folks I work with were a true knowledgebase and inspiring.  It was a type of introductory position but interesting.  The culture was almost family but the contract weren't that solid for the long term.  I left for better opportunities at the right time and that Christmas everyone else was dismissed for loss of contracts.
good,The employees are good. Sometimes work with a good team . The volume of calls can be hectic at times but you will learn how to balance in no time. Very good experience there is anyways someone to guide or help you . You will have some good calls and bad calls but that's normal.
good,Industry competitive product line with a strong brand name.  Great culture and management team.  Cross training and reimbursement tuition is available. Strong leadership that offers updates on company direction.
good,"Company provides great opportunities for learning while positioning you for professional advancement within your specific area of expertise."
good,Great place to work if you like to take calls over the phone. The conduct in which one must hold one self if very strict however this is to be expected of a Government Contracted CSR. So if you can handle the strict guidelines set out for you when taking calls then this job is a pretty good bet.
good,Very beneficial and professional fun environment. Very satisfying customer service .Managers and employees at a very good  formal and timely manner performance.
good,I loved working for this company they had a lot of overtime available the con was sometimes they had mandatory days where you had to work. and at times you had upset customers because someone else did not do their jobs correctly.
good,"The day starts opening email and checking for any coaching's or pass/failed  calls. then opening the system we work on to check and update oneself on new updates or changes. the people that work there are definitely not the most professional (tattoos, piercings, hair colors.) the hardest part is being on the phone taking 60 call back to back. on top of that apologizing for every little thing which gets tedious."
good,"The work is very rewarding, it is a fast pace environment. The team work well together. There are a lot of rewards. The hardest part of the job is working shifts."

good,General Dynamics Information Technology was a great company to work for they have really good friendly managers and staff and they give you really good benefits when you work there.
good,Awesome experience fast paced systematically-very challenging the leadership is very thorough and precision. Personnel are very helpful to many situations.
good,"I enjoyed going to work with GDIT, the company cares about the employees and has a great support team of management. Their employees, to me, are top priority. The compensation and benefits are excellent for a call center. A lot of the work is temporary/seasonal, but you have the option to go full time permanent."
good,"Nice company, many opportunities to advance."
good,"Great place to grow many experiences and gain knowledge about Medicare Insurance. Work place was very diverse, which is great! The hardest about the job was meeting quota during peak season. Most enjoyable was the relationships built with coworkers."

good,"I had great experiences working with General Dynamics.  Good leadership, good direction, good salary, great co-workers."
good,"The emphasis of the culture at GDIT is on employee development and professional skills refinement. I have been able to work in a leadership role with a diverse group of co-workers and subordinates that truly represents the local workforce. The most enjoyable aspect of the job has been to train and mentor new employees and lead by example. The lack of advancement opportunities is the only major drawback however, the competitive and selective nature of the promotion process has taught me invaluable lessons and given me greater insight into the business world."
good,Typical day includes answering phones and giving customers satisfactory customer service whether its helping some student get student loans resolved or helping someone with their medical insurance.
good,"Good people and morale!  Excellent work conditions.  The leadership at the local office sincerely cares about people, but because we are contractors, it can be uncertain as to what future employment may be available.  I do think that the company, especially the local office, attempts to mitigate the impacts of a lack of contract work.  I have enjoyed my time at GDIT and would recommend them to anyone seeking a new position."
good,Get to make impact on all IT networking and security. Work with a bunch of talented engineers. Clean safe work environment.Very good benefits package. A good place to work.
good,Promotes education and personal growth. Management is very supportive offering training and growth opportunities.  Learned about company culture and values. Co-workers are supportive and passionate very dedicated.
good,"good benefits and pay, only thing bad about company is the schedule changes every six months and  also some of the hired employees are not very educated it would say, it feels more like a high school campus at times then a work of place."
good,"If you are looking for a stable job this is it. It provides perfect balance. A typical day is taking calls from different consumers needing assistance. I learned so much from this company and I would still be there if  I didn't have to move. My co-workers were AWESOME, very helpful. I was there for 2 years and enjoyed everyday of it, even on days when I would seemingly get all the negative consumers, lol."
good,"Only worked there for 2 months, (was hired as a temporary full time employee) on a call center help desk.  Very structured company, very organized, even as a temp employee, because it was full time I was able to receive full benefits (at no extra charge)."
good,Great place to work. Ran out of site acquisition work. Very nice people and culture. Would recommend.Liked working for market manager very much.
good,"i've worked at General Dynamics for quite awhile, it's an easy job, but can be very frustrating at times, it's not for everyone."
good,GDIT is a great organization to work for.  Given the size of the organization you cant really say how great the management team is because your team will more than likely be different.  Executive management does a outstanding job laying out business goals and directives.  I work with people from a multitude of contracts and business environments so it provides a great connecting experience.  The only con would be that salary typically slightly below market.
good,"i mainly help people to fill out applications for health insurance. "
good,worked in a lab controlled environment as far a particles in the air and wore static discharge bands to help eliminate the risk of short circuit
good,"This facility produces high-precision missile components for government contractors.  The product mix is very diverse, so scheduling daily production is challenging.  It is rewarding to continuously improve the planning process."

good,"I enjoyed going to work, each day was a learning process. I learned to take work as an enjoyable encounter due to the people an overall environment established by all. "
good,"typical day at work is get your pass down from shift before you, and go about your work, supervisor comes by to see if everything is going smooth, and go about your work, then have pass down ready for shift after you."
good,I am happy going to work. I am feeling very good. I thank the job that I did it is not difficult to work. I am OK to do the job. I like to work in General Dynamics Company. I try to do my best for this job.
good,Typical phone call handle time consisted of at least 50-75 calls per day. Peak times required mandatory overtime as well as optional overtime.
good,Consumers call the Marketplace to get health coverage or want to know information about the Affordable Care Act. I help consumers apply for health coverage and help the navigate our website healthcare.gov. I had never worked at a call center before so it was fun and challenging learning how to help someone over a phone. The hardest part of my job is when people loose their health coverage because they didn't send in documents that we were asking for and they loose their tax credit or health coverage all together. My current supervisor is the best one I have ever had. He has helped me become better at my job and my scorecard reflects this. My coworkers are wonderful and I couldn't ask for a better team.
good,"Work environment is very pleasant. Coworkers are very good."
good,"Learned computer skills, how to successfully assist consumers with the application process to get them enrolled in a healthcare plan under the Affordable Healthcare Act. Also answered any questions that the consumer had, or got someone on the phone with them that could help them. My co-workers were easy to get along with and they and our supervisor's were very helpful if we needed help. The hardest part of them job was listening to the consumer's needs and stories some very sad. the most enjoyable thing was knowing that I helped people daily."
good,I work 10 hour work days with  3 day weekends but there are also 8 and 12 hour work days for different shifts and/or roles. The management holds monthly meetings to keep employees informed on departmental direction and company news as well as giving recognition certificates for time in the company and announcing employee of the month. It helps maintain the sense of our data center employees are a team.
good,The job isn't hard at all but it can be a bit stressful when it gets really busy. Most of the time it is really busy. If you know how to click a mouse and use a keyboard this is the perfect job for you.
good,The job itself is not bad it is just some of the rules there are very strict but it is understandable when handling people's information. The management is nice and they really want to see you improve.
good,"Current team has been wonderful to work with.  But for the loss of a contract, I'd definitely stay. For me, one of the better companies I've worked for."
good,"This was one of my best jobs, I just loved the environment and the skills that was acquired working at this place. I learned how to work on a number of att phones learn how to start accounts add or help people with there accounts, I even learned how to do basic trouble shooting skills . The hardest part of the job was knowing that it was going to close down the most enjoyable part was working with so many different people."
good,"Excellent Project Manager"
good,"General Dynamics has been very, very good to me."
good,Throughout open enrollment was on the phone completing application for customer and answering questions about health insurance. Once open enrollment ended calls were slow and there was too much down time. Management were extremely generous while going through tough time in my life and worked very well with me. The hardest part of the job was dealing with agent and brokers that would not inform consumers of all of their health options and they always knew more about the system then we did. The most enjoyable part of the job is enrolling a consumer in an affordable health insurance and helping angry customers and making them happy.
good,"Flexible work hours"
good,"productive work place, friendly enviroment, managers answer all questions. you had your own space and area to work. I learned a lot about the medicare insurance we worked with, I learned some new computer systems i dint know beore, the hardest part of the job would probably be getting a irate customer who you couldnt help, and the best part would be being able to help someone out in a timely manner."
good,"A typical work day consisted of taking calls & remotely configuring hardware & setting up user accounts. It was a very ""family-like"" work environment that was also professional. The hardest part of the job is that it was a 24/7 position & I worked 12-hr shifts that alternated between days & nights."
good,"It was the first time that I had the privilege to experience working on a Stryker and it was exciting. My peers were helpful and welcoming and I feel as I was a valuable asset to the team."
good,This is an overall great company to work for and but the benefits could be much better.
good,Huge company with lots of opportunities for growth. I enjoy my coworkers and boss.
good,"General Dynamics Information Technology has been a very good fit for me. GDIT is a professional organization that has their processes well laid out. The management is generally brought up through the ranks of those that have been there and done that - so management has a pretty good idea how things ought to be done."
good,"Answered inbound calls from Medicare beneficiaries, and callers who had Medicare coverage or had any Medicare related questions. Gave out general information about Medicare to callers who did not pass disclosure. I gave Medicare beneficiaries information about their coverage with Medicare. I went to group meetings to discuss updated scripts updated in the company’s systems. Also completed essential training's at assigned cubicle, computer based. Complied with companies all company break schedule policy."
good,"I worked with a small, hard-working team performing System Analysis. Researching the recent developments in parallel processing and virtualization in a data and graphic-intesive environment has been a great pleasure and learning experience.

good,GDIT project management was wonderful.  I was able to grow and learn in my position.  Great environment to work in while on project site.
good,Depending on which department you are in is if you'll have a good day or not. The only really stressful one is ARC. They have to deal with all the customers that have spoken to a million people before they were directed there. Supervisors get along with you really well as long as their bosses haven't buried them neck deep in work.
good,"Worked on CONUS DoD contracts as well as DoD international contracts with different intelligence agencies.  Working was always challenging, and was given the opportunity to visit many confidants during my tenure with General Dynamics.  My team ember or star were in a 'team playing; mode for most of the time.  Working environment was excellent.  Excelled and enjoyed my assignments in a Leadership role."
good,The job culture was fun yet productive especially when working on a project you could see from start to completion.
good,"Everyday would fly by, and was never worried about not having anything to do. Feedback on calls was great, was able to see where I needed to work more, and become successful."
good,"Like most places, it is what you make of it. There is always work to be done and someone to appease. This is generally a stable workplace as they offer jobs via government contracts."
good,"Travail qui consiste en l'assemblage de pièces sur ligne de montage."
good,Answer personal calls and assist customers with the services needed.

When a product starts going south and it is difficult to get it back up where it needs to be.  The people are the most enjoyable to work with."
good,"we would work in a large warehouse, that had many different departments for taking Census inventory. I worked where we counted the forms that were mailed in, also double checked to make sure the form was filled out properly"
good,"Overall good workplace. Back to back calls, consumers vary from nice to upset. Loved my co-workers and supervisor. Hardest part was changing rules day to day."
good,A great place to work. Job description and expectations are clear. Although worker should receive some type of standard operating procedures. Top level management should keep a closer view on lower level management.
good,"The Calibration Recall System Administrator was a fairly new position that I was able to perform due to the exceptional training of the previous administrator."
good,"General Dynamics is very exciting company , that manufactures military land vehicles for various governments. A typical day at for entails muti tasking anywhere from 3-6 proposals while also performing various financial analysis.

I have learned how to successfully work with teams of people from various organizational functions in order to achieve my desired results."
good,"Shift bids based on performance, Equal Opportunities, Free health care benefits. Team oriented workplace"
good,"I really enjoyed the work that I did at General Dynamics, but too much an ""Old Boy"" culture allowed for promotion of unqualified managers into positions that affected morale and discipline. The work was fun and the people for the most part were great, but it was like firing a government employee when dealing with a discipline problem and management would rather look the other way than deal with an in effective manager because of personal relationship."
good,Like a lot of contract companies pay and benefits can change each time a contract is rebid.
good,"Great work environment each employ is given a duty and task, how we complete it is up to us. The autonomy is the best part being somewhat of your own manager."
good,Overall a good company to work for. Current fiscal climate has impacted job security which is a problem for most companies. Contract ends and they have no way to keep you on overhead until another job comes along.
good,Laid off due to sequestration.Lots of interesting people to work with. Management was good but not very open to new ideas.
good,a normal day at work would be to receive ones work assignment for the day. I had many chances to learn new things in the ship building industry and took every last one and learned quite allot.
good,Typical workday consists of monitoring emails and phone calls from customers needing assistance. Learned how to provide assistance via Help Desk support and through on-site visitations. Also learned a lot of experience by listening and watching how co-workers does their jobs with great professionalism and technicality. Management is very supportive of our task and always accessible for our concerns. Hardest but also most enjoyable part of the job is running across new trouble calls or issues and successfully fixing them and making our customers happy in the process.
good,"It was always changing and something new. We always had the best equipment to do our jobs with. There was a lot of work, but the benefits and pay was very good. It was very hard to leave when I left."
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo y lo que se aprende El respeto hacia las personas, trabajamos en buen ambiente, bastante paciencia con las demás personas que se atienden puesto que cada una viene con sus propias ideas, el trabajo es lo que mas me agrado me gusta mucho la Captura de Datos y fue un placer poder realizar las actividades."
good,"We were hired to enter data into the US Census database. While my work on previous jobs did require some data entry, this was more intense. The need for speed and accuracy was paramount. My co-workers were diverse. Coming from various cultural backgrounds as well as all employment levels we came together to do a job so critical to our nation. There were long periods where we had to wait as more data was made ready for entry. But it was during these times that we were able to form bonds, some of which I will never forget."
good,didn't need supervision if you were trained to do your job right.

good,"Usually a typical day at work is , i go in sandblast , paint , tank painting & interior/extorior work painting. I worked there for 21 years straight and i would like to re-apply for this job . It is a very great workplace , and the hardest part of my job was having to leave."
good,"Vangent was a great company to work for. A typical day consisted of self starting on grading calls and coaching CSR's to help them improve on soft skills and CMS requirements. However, some CSR's were not great at taking the advice of the quality team and the supervisors went great at setting a serious tone for improvement."
good,Vangent is a great place to work. A typical work day is 8 hrs of helping medicare clients. The co-workers are all people friend and everyone is eager to help you out if you need it. The hardest part of the job was hearing the clients in need different situations. And the most enjoyable part of the job was helping others
good,job security was low because it comes and goes with defense contracts
good,"This place was a good place to work, the employees and manager where very friendly and pleasant to work for"
good,"I haven't worked for any other contract or division within GDIT, so much of my personal experiences may not necessarily reflect ""the norm"", but rather ""the exception"". I am under the impression from other GDIT employees throughout the organization that GDIT really is a great company to work for"
good,"Great work environment. Worked with some of the smartest, and dedicated team members in my career. Awesome mid-level and senior leadership who allowed for work/life balance."
good,"I worked at GDIT for almost 10 years. "

good,"Great benefits and work flow. People are great supervisors are willing to listen to any concerns that may rise and offer work accommodation. I would highly recommend this job to anyone who wants to get their foot in the door, great work experience."
good,"Overall, it was a great place to work. A typical work day was answering calls for Medicare and Marketplace beneficiaries in a fast paced environment. It is easy to move up, and they always offer overtime.  There are also incentives and bonuses throughout the year. The benefits and discounts are great from car pricing to cell phone plans and many others. I took advantage of many of the discounts and moved up a few times in my three years there. When I left, a few months later they were increasing wages across the board to more livable ones that reflected the work load. The company is not perfect but after getting new management and shifting the people around, the company made vast improvements.  They also will offer snacks such as pizza day, nacho day, and volunteering, and fitness competitions to get employees more engaged in the community and to provide some work life balance. The company is international and has many different departments to work with everywhere."
good,Good place to work. Great benefits. Training should have been longer than 2 weeks. A lot of information for the job requirements. Only downfall is short breaks and cannot change shifts.
good,"If you like a fast-paced environment, this is it.  Overall management is excellent but as with any company, there are the few managers that just do not care about cultivating their employees. Luckily, I was moved to a manager who cares about the company and the employees that works for her. "
good,Very busy call center especially during peak season.  At times it can  be very stressful but co-workers were great.  Excellent pay and benefits.  I would work there again.

good,"Very laid back."
good,I really enjoyed working for GDIT. The supervisors are really helpful and the environment was always welcoming. I would recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable job.
good,Though it was fast paced and often times very demanding the crew often came together to help complete a task.  Management does not get to know their employees very much but does take care of the security of their jobs in the long run.
good,Working at GDIT has been a wonderful experience and they provide the perfect work life balance.  I love working with my colleagues and everyone is treated equal and our customer is fantastic.  I have learned a lot and I feel there is room to grow.
good,The company as a whole is great to work with. You are with people all day long. You meet new people on a daily basis. You are able to communicate freely.

good,GDIT in Mt Laurel is a great place to start your career after graduating from college. you are immersed into the culture with great guidance from senior team members and giving opportunities to learn more than imagined.
good,"The work day is what you make it.  Very flexible hours, easy to take off and take care of business.  Income is the biggest issue.  It the pay was increase by 1 to 2 dollars with guarantee increase it would be perfect."
good,"Cannot accurately leave a review for GDIT as my company was recently acquired and still in the process of transitioning in terms of benefits, management, etc"
good,I enjoyed working at General Dynamics. They were my first call center job. It was different but they made it  easy with their helpful training department.
good,Really good and supportive managers. Atmosphere is relaxed. You're provided all the tools you need to work. Facilities are clean and computer tech is up-to-date.
good,"Enjoyed the opportunity to provide consumers with their health chose options. Consumers would call to enroll, cancel, update their health insurance.  We also had to handle some tax information for the consumer, such as form 1095A , which is required if you have healthcare thru the ACA."
good,"Overall, it is a very good job with good benefits."
good,"I just recently joined General Dynamics from another contract.  I haven't necessarily been with the company for long, but some members whom I work with have moved on and left.  I've had to take on more of a working role to ensure we are meeting our SLAs.  The team environment is pretty cool, and where I'm working is a very friendly environment."
good,Good management. Good workplace culture. Enjoy the 9/80 work schedule. Enjoy working remote. A company focused on operational and people excellence. Overall good company.
good,"GDIT has been a great employer with good pay, benefits and opportunities to advance. Flexible shifts, good working environment and collaborative teams."
good,Great place to work. I was hired for seasonal help. Was giving a month in advance when my job would end. Great supervisors that were very helpful. Would go back if givin the chance. I can’t complain about the company. Great environment though they do need to drug test. Do not like the amount of drugs seen passed around.
good,"Not at all a difficult job, however there are many periods when there could be more callers than a new person could handle. This would also diminish their viewing in the eyes of their supervisors, but the management does help out when they can."
good,"Fast paced, challenging, open to changes, family type atmosphere. Most employees had over 30 years with the company and we had great respect for our employees. A culture of safety first, quality a must, and to meet expectations."
good,Overall good place to work.  There are opportunities for advancement.  You're given the tools you need to further your career.  There is an open  door policy
good,"Great team to work with and very flexible as far as hours and freedom to  manage your own work. Great culture overall but management did not interact with me at all, though they were very happy with the work I did."
good,GDIT is a great place to advance your career. It is a relaxing place with strong ethics. Management is helpful and professional. I recommend GDIT as a great place for those looking for entry level jobs.
good,"I have been working at General Dynamics for a year now. It's a friendly work environment. It's a very relaxed causal office job. If you don't like the idea of sitting at a desk all day, then this isn't the job for you. The benefits are great. You get free health care, sick paid leave, and vacation time."
good,The hours there are very flexible and they do have pay differentials. The work is easy to learn if you attend all of the training and pay attention. The only con is that there is a shift bid every few months so your schedule isn't set in stone.
good,"A typical day consisted of bringing parts to aircraft assembly line and doing audits. Very easy work, lots of employees and good pay. Workplace culture was very busy and fast paced. Hardest part of job you could be bumped because of the union. Most enjoyable potlucks and good people."

good,"Come to work sit down take calls and go on breaks, the only thing is that their is not any good places to eat for your break and since break is so short no time to take a stroll."
good,"Strict, but fun workplace. Room for advancement. Enjoyed coworkers. Company had shift bids to get different shifts based upon performance. Company also had different activities for down time to keep job interesting."
good,"If you don't mind being yelled at occasionally by upset consumers, and strict attendance guidelines. Supervisors are great, management and HR not so much. Un-willing to accommodate seasonal staff, permanent people get a lot more benefits."
good,GDIT is an employer that provides many opportunities for advancement in the company. The benefits are great and the incentives show how much GDIT appreciates their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to adapt to change and learning new things everyday.

good,good company good pay rate nice people very strict rules but good benefits to employees over all a good company to work for just wish they would hire on more full time employees
good,As a remote work from home Operations Analyst/Subject Matter Expert it was a great way to develop curriculum. A good amount of hands on the curriculum development. Really able to pour into the content which we wrote. Network had issues but still able to do the work needed. Was able to work with former Seabees on the job. Was an overall good experience.
good,"I worked in the student financial aid  department for 2 years and Medicare for one."
good,Flexible work place. Nice Work environment. Good Place to work. I have worked in this company for about 4 years and I liked the place
good,"I handle calls assisting consumers with their health insurance marketplace applications. This job has enhanced my customer service and computer skills. Our management team works hard at making sure both consumers and employees and taken care of and that all job requirements within the company are met. At GDIT the management team keeps an open door policy, which allows employees to seek or consult with management freely. This is very helpful for us employees who have any questions or issues. My co-workers are very friendly and professional, and overall a joy to be around. The hardest part of my position would be maintaining an above average scorecard based on company graded calls. the most enjoyable part of my job is reviewing those great scores and actually receiving positive feedback from upper management about it."
good,"A typical day at work was answering calls, adjusting account info, and giving out quality customer service. The work environment and culture is a big thing."
good,Liked working there salary not great. Moved on for a better position. Very long hour along with weekend more hours then I wanted to put in.
good,"Being a customer service representative entailed many responsibilities. I learned all there was to know about the affordable care act. Different insurances for different people, how medicaid expanded in some states, COBRA, the tax credits, and much more. The management was great just a bit too many supervisors hanging around in one area. Co-workers were professional. The hardest part of doing this job was telling people they did not qualify for help and had to pay hundreds for insurance. It never ended well. I enjoyed the professional environment most."
good,"The Company offers great benefits and resources. I was on client so cant tell you much about the culture. "
good,"A typical day at work is providing excellent customer service to consumer by helping them with any questions or concerns about the health care coverage. My co-workers are nice and provide assistance to one another when needed. The hardest part about my job is dealing with some frustrated consumers. I've learned that although it seems like they're taking frustration out directly on me, it's not at all about me so I still do my best and try to assist them."
good,Enjoyed talking about work and home experiences before the start of the workday with supervisor and coworkers. Discussed the days goals and what was expected to be accomplished for the week. I learned how to prioritize the many jobs that came up during the week at any given moment as they were presented to me. I learned how to communicate using the computer and the phone on a daily basis to resolve issues with equipment and ensuring contractors knew what was expected of them. Staying informed in order to close out tasks when they were completed.
good,Management was helpful and supportive. Excellent benefits and flexibility. Growth and employee development was encouraged.
good,"very nice place to work. great health benefits. "
good,"We would arrive at our job and go to our assigned desk. The chairs were comfortable as well as the workstation. We could raise or lower our computer if we chose to stand for a while instead of sitting down all day. I learned how to easily navigate systems required for the job. I learned how to stick with scripts and problem solve customer concerns. I did not receive much help in the way of job duties from the management teams, but co-workers were of great assistance and resourcing for questions, concerns, and issues that would arise with the equipment from time to time. The hardest part of the job was listening patiently to the angry and abusive customer, and finding the correct approach to calm them down and provide them with a peace of mind. The most enjoyable part was the co-workers. We all helped one another to achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction and to keep spirits high in and around the job."
good,Contractor.  Employed by GD but I was a contractor supporting another organization.
good,"I enjoyed the working environment provided by General Dynamics Corporation.  The benefits were incredible, and the team environment was spot on.  I would have liked to see more advancement from staff to management; that aside, I benefited from their educational options."
good,"Best job I've had so far. Lots of training opportunities. It's a shame my contract lost funding, and even though I scoured the career placement program and other job opportunities, it just didn't work out and had to find employment elsewhere."
good,Good place to work for.  Company vehicle and tools.  Great starting pay.
good,"This was a amazing job, learned so much about Medicare and Medicaid services. Answered incoming calls to help with any questions or problems with their Medicare services. I enjoyed this job so much. The job could be hard at times. As with any job you cannot always please everyone, that was the hardest part. Hearing that the customer was unable to pay for there medications, and there was nothing I could do to help."
good,"My typical day insisted on answer inbound calls from Medicare clients to assist them with questions that they have in regards to what Medicare covers, changing their coverage, and questions about their claims."
good,I really enjoyed working for General Dynamics. The bosses were really helpful and I loved the benifits.
good,"Relatively easy routine work, with friendly co-workers and good management. "
good,getting to know others while working at getting the job done and finding out that different people does things in different ways and out of being aware of others work habits there is always a lesson to learn
good,"Mon travail consiste à assembler différente composante sur des mortiers, manipulation d'automate, partir les automates au début de chaque quart et arrêts pour les pauses, entretients des tempoprints: au début du quart, netoyer les imprimantes, changer l'encre, si problème avec les imprimantes,les mettres à l'arrêt et renettoyer ou changer les tempons de l'imprimante ou encore changer la plaque de métal ou sont gravé le lettrage à imprimer sur les mortiers. Je travail d'habitude avec un autre employé dans le cubicule (endroit fermé par des portes blindés car là nous mettons les beignes remplient d'explosif sur la queue du mortier (4 par tête) soit environs 4800 beignes par jours pour un total de 1200 mortier. Ce que j'aime dans mon travail c'est qu'il y a beaucoup de chose différente à faire et à vérifier, beaucoup de point d'inspection visuelle à faire, les automates à débuger, la vittesse d'exicution pour mettre les beignes sur les queues ( à coup de six mortier x 4 beignes en moins d'une minute) Bref un environnement stimulant où les nombreuses tâches à accomplir remplissent bien une journée et le temps passe vite,un environnement très sécuritaire malgré le danger de manipuler de l'explosif."
good,I enjoy working there. but after working there for one year doesn't give enough time to proper evaluation.
good,"A typical day working for GDIT was a good opportunity but I have learned that even the good jobs go away when you are dealing with contracting positions. I found most of my co-workers to be ex-military which if you are not part of this brother and sisterhood is the hardest part of the job. Breaking into this alliance and gaining trust from those that have already networked together previously within their military careers, is not easy to break. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining new opportunities and becoming cognizant of how contracting works, along with developing future networking opportunities."
good,I enjoy the amount of responsibility and support that General Dynamics provides. This company finds a way to utilize every skill that an individual has.
good,"La apertura del módulo a las 7:30am, se instala el módulo se prenden computadoras, se instala cámara, y cada unos de los aparatos, a las 8:00am es la apertura a la gente se te va rápido el tiempo ya que a todas horas hay gente tramitando su credencial que es la que acredita a uno como derechohabiente imss, y es ecesario y obligatoria tenerla, a las 12:00pm llega la persona que tengo a cargo para retirarme a la comida, tomo una hora y regreso al módulo y a las 5:00pm es mi horario de salida, es un trabajo agradable con compañeros muy agradables y aprendes mucho de cada una de las personas que estan a tu alrededor"
good,"Being that General Dynamics is the sub to another company, their culture is not too much enforced here at Scott AFB. The government has the reigns here however, any business I have had with the General Dynamics upper echelon has been professional and most helpful with each of my needs. Many of my coworkers are from another company. I do not find any part of my job hard and the most enjoyable part of my day is working with customers to repair their services."
good,Great workplace culture. Very diverse which makes the it a great atmosphere that i enjoy. Management goes out of their way to make sure employees are in a positive environment.
good,All departments work together. Very welcoming staff and employees. Family work environment. With good work ethics comes promotions. Will work there again in near future.
good,The company has a great sense of proud identity from the top down however when they purchased CSRA there was a disconnect between realistic goals and the actual working situation.
good,"5 yrs working 50 yrs old great place to work if you like helping others."
good,Company was very helpful with many situation.  If the person you asked could not answer your question they would direct to someone who could help. Managers had open door policy

good,The management was very helpful and patient with each person. A typical day of work consisted of taking phone calls and solving consumers questions/problems associated with their healthcare through the Marketplace.
good,"Great coworkers and benefits, but the work was challenging. I always had good supervisors and managers, and my coworkers were easy to to get along with. The last couple of years I worked there they started having activities occasionally for the employees and allowed us to finely have food at our desk, which improved the work environment."
good,"Great place to grow and learn. Management team was excellent and truly was out to make sure all employees succeeded.  Though busy, the workplace was always like a family."
good,"Working at GDIT is a pretty amazing opportunity. The management on the field level is amazing and the job satisfaction is also pretty high. The only con of this company is that I believe that with what the job entails we need to receive more compensation. Level 1s are not paid very highly. However the fact you are given so much responsibility with no supervision helps make the job more relaxing and fun. GDIT has many benefits including Tuition Reimbursement and low cost Vision, Dental, Health, Life , and identity protection."
good,Recibi capacitacion y el ambiente de trabajo era agradable. El trabajo con mis compañeros de trabajo lo invitaba el jefe para ser mejores. Es una tristeza tener que dejar un trabajo tan agradable
good,The job was beneficial to me for my own personal reasons. I learned many new things about the different laws on healthcare and various other healthcare information that I know will be beneficial to me throughout my life.
good,This was a good job and it paid well. Only downside is that you get screamed at a lot by your consumers on the phone because insurance rates are ridiculous.

good,"Excellent work environment, friendly and professional relation with co-workers.  Very well competitive industry.  Managers and Leadership were amazing!"
good,"I loved working there and wish I hadn't got fired. The benefits are what make this place great. Management sucks, punishments are not given evenly to employees. What one person may get a write-up for,  the next may get fired. The employees in general are alright, there's a huge turnover so you often see new people."
good,"The flexibility with the company was great, a typical 8 hour shift comes with two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute break which gives you leisure to move around after sitting for long periods. Management was always flexible with the employees needs. The hardest part of being a customer service representative was not being friendly, if you enjoying helping others."

good,"Typical work day consist of heavy inbound calls. Days can be very relaxing or could put you in a bad mood, depending on you handle the calls. Learned more about the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Social Security. Gained experience in learning more about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or as I call it the Marketplace. By working in both departments I've gained experience on the you can gain health care coverage. All co-workers and supervisors and managers are very friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job to me is handling callers who can't grasp the information I tell them although most are elderly's. Sometimes keeping the call on task can be very difficult because callers like to say different scenarios that don't relate to what we handle. The most enjoyable part to me is just being able to be laid back and relax while talking to those who call in wanting more information."
good,"Not knowing anything about procurement, I was offered this job while working at the General Dynamics recreation center, and took on something new.  The people were great to work with, the hours worked were perfect."

good,I enjoy working with General Dynamics. I am a Tier One Technical Support Specialist and Help Desk Technician
good,"General Dynamics prides its self in going after and obtaining seasoned talent, particularly from our military.  Because many had a similar background, similar accomplishments and similar work ethics, it was much like working on a college campus.  I learned how to be a corporate professional while at General Dynamics.  It held to strict standards that was part of your daily work life.  Management provided a great learning atmosphere because they were seasoned, accomplished and willing to show you how to do it.  They understood leadership - what it was and more importantly, what it wasn't.  Co-workers were a talented bunch that you would take home to have dinner with your family.  The hardest part of the job was the realization that if you did not do your job well, others who were doing a great job may be laid off due to the lack of Congressional funding.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my colleagues and working with the Abrams Main Battle Tank and the Stryker Family of Vehicles."
good,"A day at vangent was a fast pace enviroment. I gain more call center experience, also I learned more about medical insurance. I had great co-workers who work together and assist each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to assist callers with information that was needed"

I have learned that just because I was not a management level managers in my department trusted me enough to over see the department on an as need basis. The hardest part of my position was working with people would had been at the organization for years and when changed occurred there were times certain individuals were not happy and did not adjust to change well.
good,They are a great company to work for and they also have even better benefits>
good,"Most days were spent answering calls, but I was also responsible for any take down/put up of new computers.

good,Worked with great teams. The management was very supportive and always had an open door policy. This was a fast paced call center that excepted inbound calls from Medicare Beneficiaries. I would provide quaility training to Customer Service Representatives and supervisors. I would observe Spervisors providing coaching on quality to their teams and provide feedback on how to improve their sessions by speaking to the CSR's behavior. I would work hand in hand with the managment to better the quality of our call center. I lead projects that I would need to provide feedback to our customer(Medicare) to help better the calls and experience for the caller and the CSR.
good,GDIT is a good company to work for. GDIT gives a lot opportunities and education for it's employees.

good,This company really cares about keeping its employees. It has a great work atmosphere and offers great benefits. They are very laid back when it comes to taking time off and offer two weeks paid vacation after being their a year.
good,"Productive days are usually the most exhausting because calls are back to back. Other than those days it’s a fairly laid back job, and the job is honestly what you make it."
good,"GDIT has great pay and benefits for the area. The attedance policy is generous and fair. Supervisors are wonderful. Training department could be more knowledgeable. "
good,A regular day was taking inbound calls from people that want to enroll in coverage (marketplace or or Medicare). Some of them were rude. Most of the calls were in Spanish. During OEP (open enrollment period) calls were back to back (really exhausting) but after that during SEP(special enrollment period) usually there will be a wait time. It’s a great company and people are respectful to you. I would’ve love to stay there as a permanent employee.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was work as part of a team to resolve consumer problems with application and Insurance needs dealing with there healthcare. With my current position I've been able to develop outstanding customer service skill.
good,"I have found that the staffing and management is always willing to work with their teammates, but they do expect a degree of independence and self awareness."
good,"We had a set schedule "
good,the job was very easy. I learned you have a lot of patients to help your customer while doing a application for them to get insurance. The hardest part about the job is making sure you help the to best of your knowledge.
good,"I loved working here and the only thing I have against them is that I feel like during the ""nesting"" part of training, I was not trained properly. The guy that trained me was more interested in getting to know the females then train."

good,"I really enjoyed my time with General Dynamics.  I worked at a client site and was able to get all the support I needed to accomplish our goals."
good,"I was a contractor with GM Defense through London, Ontario, Canada before General Dynamics bought them. I was the materials liason/manager for the materials coming from London.  I managed the inventory and was responsible for returning the damaged parts.  I had the greatest manager in the world!  All of my job was enjoyable!  I stayed extremely busy, it was challenging and I got to use my talents, skills and knowledge."
good,"General Dynamics has several different branches. I worked for Center of Medicare services and also the health insurance marketplace.  This is a call center, so there will be high call volumes during open enrollment. Its a great work environment."
good,"Great place to work.  The only downside, was management was not always on site.  But when they were, they were always around to answer questions."
good,"A typical day of work would be a busy but at a steady pace. When on each call you have to make sure your are carefully entering information correctly. Management were very strict and made sure they went by the secure floor policy. Co-workers were friendly and very helpful. The hardest part of the day was knowing that our location was going to be no more as of April 26, 2014. The most enjoyable part, was being apart of a company that is going to be known for changing lives for the ""Affordable Act Care""."
good,The Company is always giving you daily advise on how to handle issues and situations for the Consumers.
good,A typical day at work always relaxing and the assistance of helping those with Medicare benefits.
good,Please review resume... I really enjoyed working for this company.
good,I enjoyed working for Vangent. I liked the benefits of the company for the most part.
good,"Worked on cases to meet requirements by the customer. The company overall is a good billion dollar company.  They chose not to keep the contract I was working on, so I lost my job."
good,I would recommend this job to everyone.. good place to work  I'm happy I was able to get the job. Training went by fast the only thing I don't is when the weather bad they don't care
good,"One of the best jobs I've ever work in.  i would love to stay, but they only offered part-time employment which doesn't offer great help for cost of living."
good,I really do enjoy working for GDIT.  They allow us to do our jobs without interference.  They support us whenever we need assistance and have been there for us.
good,Supeevisors work we'll with you. Nice positive feed back from everyone. The management is we'll put together .  The policies that are set are very strict.
good,Great place to work also have great management team and system just needs to pay every week and they would be a five star place to be employed and you meet great people to work with
good,Was a specialist handling claims for clients that wanted to apply for Health Insurance only thing was that The pay is good for the Waco area but wanted me to change shifts and I'm a family oreientated person my daugther is one of the top guards in the state of Texas and she is going to attend Baylor University this year and was not going to miss any of her games he rlast year of high school so I resigned and went to work for Baylor
good,"Work environment king of stuffy but good opportunities very friendly faces. Downside, all about your scores and verbatim sometimes sounding like a robot does not help your caller."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. speaking with the customers were the best part of the day because there is nothing like the feeling of being able to help someone as much as you possibly can. The management was wonderful. co-workers were very upbeat and a joy to be around.
good,"A great work experience."
good,Help customers thru invoices and inbound calls with solutions to their problems for the cars project.
good,"Typical day would be to answer calls from consumers about their medical insurance. You would have to be prepared to listen to to"
good,"Extremely enjoyable and productive. I got along with everyone. There was always something to do to keep my busy, and i was able to take on new tasks!"
good,I’m going to be honest there is a lot of drama in this work place and a lot of immature ppl but besides that some are willing to help you if needed just stay to your self if not u will end up in some drama and ethics don’t help you supervisors like to choose the race card so your pretty much on your own a lot of racial profiling and sexual orientation discrimination from other employees
good,"Good work but very impersonal, and highly repulsive atmosphere. contact between lower level and managers practically nil. working hours were good, but remuneration was not so good. work load distributed unequally, leading to disproportionate end of month pay."
good,on a daily basis this was a very strict job they were not flexible when it came down to a single mom life things change with schools and if something came up and if you let them know it still penalized you once you reach a certain number of points you were on a warning and then your job was on the line
good,"In this position, I work as a well rounded technician in all areas of maintenance, customer service, electronics, and problem solving. I have gaimed ample of knowledge solving rudimentary to complex issues concerning land based platforms. Since most of my work is performed outside the U.S it has also allowed me to become more social with other cultures and learn about how other people in the world flourish."
good,"Its a good job good people and i enjoy my job. The job is good I like taking phone calls and I am good at it, Its fun sometimes calls are slow."
good,The supervisor was not allowing for growth. Many levels of service that need special knowledge and was not given the needed time to learn.
good,"I loved working here, the environment was relaxed and not hectic. The work schedule was very flexible and the pay was very nice and the benefits were good also."
good,"I would work there again if there were better managers. At GDIT , the people with authority don’t really care about life threatening situations. I honestly think the place needs to be under inspection."
good,Laid back usually.I learned a lot from older workers. Management was good. The hardest part was waiting for all safety to be checked to start work. The most enjoyable part was getting off work.
good,Have Management problems at the local level. Culture is hard core when it comes to results. Would like to work with them again if the need for my skills is needed.
good,"Great company to work for! Has awesome perks and benefits. Diverse working environment, state of art machines. They have Competitive insurance rates, General Dynamics matches 401 k up to 6 percent!"
good,"My position was through a Temp Agency.  After assignment was completed I was released from General Dynamics"
good,"Most days was the same felt really happy solving issues, disliked not having enough time in Empower for scheduled trainings.."
good,"I have worked under a contract under general dynamics for going on 2yrs. The longer I work there the crazier the job becomes. I started off as a Tier 1 representative and worked my way up to supervisor ISG. Lately I have been given an unreal work load, taking four different types of calls coming in back to back. Its basically a job of all day unhappiness where consumers are crying, screaming, cursing, threatening, and etc. the supervisors are extremely hard to please. With the amount of stress nobody gets along with each other. Our motto was ""one team on fight"", yet supervisors and management have us competing with the very person that sits next to us like it is some kind of sick game to them. The most enjoyable part of my day is the thought of going home and getting away until the next morning."
good,Great Company..... Enjoyed my time working with the Denver group. But Vice president was not Fully engaged to the level of Leadership that was needed to satisfy customer expectations. Sad ending to a good team of professionals.
good,learned a lot / great co-workers/ downsizing work force/ management needs work
good,Good company with great benefits! The only thing is that they pay you pretty low for your experience and credentials
good,Excellent company to work for. Many opportunities available for starting and advancement.
good,GDIT is a great company when it comes to providing your opportunities. There are no shortage of jobs with GD. The only issue is that you are not going to much raises.
good,"Great place to establish yourself as relevant in an industry. Raises are slow and not big, but you will always have opportunities to grow and learn new things."
good,"Over all I'd stayed with GD but things change and I'm retiring, I'd rather not bite the hand that feeds me so I have little to day on this topic. The program that I support could service its people better."
good,"Flexible if you are in school full time"
good,i haven't been there for too long to give a decent response. a typical day at work i wouldn't know of. i learned that we basically go over medicare insurance.
good,I worked for GD for 5 years straight. It's a good company training is available and paid at a rate of 14-16 an hour. after Training your bumped up 2-3 dollars. a lot of hands on activities need to be very active and ready to work.
good,Management failed to support field service technicians. Required work tools were not made available. Lead engineers were disconnected from necessary off-site certification testing.
good,lot of long hours on the phones. Sometimes a call doesn't come for hours but you have to sit there and wait. The call grading system doesn't work as well. The company is way too stringent on scoring calls. You are set up for failure. You have to stick to predetermined scripts which is uncomfortable and irrelevant at times.
good,it was a pretty decent day good co workers and great pay. good location
good,Enjoyed temp position @ Needham facility. Would be morethan receptive to employment with General Dynamics in future
good,"I do not work for General Dynamics Information Technology, I actually work for General Dynamics Electric Boat. General Dynamics as a whole is a good company to work for with great benefits."
good,I enjoyed my time there. The training staff and Management are always willing to answer question. The support from the supervisor was also a big help when I was working there.
good,"Technical Environment, Problem Solving Environment, Manage yourself type of daily work environment. Government Service Position. Hardest Part of Position was taking time out for Travel and Expense Reporting instead of helping customer base. The Focus should mostly be on the customer. Most enjoyable part of the position are the individuals I was able to support and my team."

good,Working for GDIT has been a great learning experience it definitely had its hard times as well and it could be a little overwhelming at times. Dealing with medical insurance will always be a busy job but with the training provided it does make it a lot easier.
good,They treat everyone fair and a caring company i was in charge of a group of CSR that listened to call to make sure they were answering things correctly. Trying to get some of they to be verify explicit on their coaching was the hardest part.
good,"Material Handling , equipment layout, read worker logs, maintain quality of products, assembled windshields for army vehicles,  put in fire extinguishers and periscopes."
good,"A great place to work if you would like a good balance of work and your personal life.  The benefits are on par with its competitors.  You don't have to work too many hours outside of a normal 8 hour work day, unless there are production deployments, which may require occasional weekend work.  A great company to work for if you like a team collaborative learning environment.  Productive workers that enjoy challenges and problem solving."
good,"GDRS was a great company to work for. Unfortunately, new management didn't follow the path of company founders and due to poor decisions lost a lot of opportunities for grow. Company closed as a result."

good,"Daily work from 7,00 AM to 3.30 PM."
good,"Decent hours, decent pay, in all honesty it was a contract/temporary position so it wouldn't be fair to say much about the direct company as far as procedures and policies."
good,I entered the cyber security workforce with this company. They provided high levels of company paid training to meet work and certification requirements. This was the best contractor I have worked for in 10 plus years of experience
good,Very nice environment with hundreds of people! So many learning experiences and chances to grow in one place! Very busy and productive with assisting the world!
good,"I overall love this job, it's one of my favorite jobs they offer here in Hattiesburg. I recommend this job to anybody if you're good with comunication or like things repetitive."
good,"the hours are long but the people you work for are understanding, the pay is great along with the benefits, I would recommend anyone looking to boost their career or start a career to work here"
good,I constantly am challenged to do all kinds of skills and work on complex documents and this helps me expand my knowledge making this job the most rewarding.
good,"We were hired on as contract workers, so we knew it would not last forever.  It was a great place to work while I was looking for a permanent position that paid an actual living wage."
good,It was very fast past job if you liked being behind a desk it was ok. You was rated on how you did your job and hoe you talk to people. If you needed help your supervisor helped you when needed.
good,working at gdit is good they offer plenty benefits and the pay is ok but could be better. The calls can be stressful at times but all and all its fine
good,"The job is a very nice place to work for individuals who are looking for a place with great benefits. However the advancement process could be quite slow. It overall is a very nice job that requires no hard labor, but the company requires several phone calls be taken and the callers could sometimes be very rude. You have to have tough skin to deal with some of the calls that you may encounter."
good,"Job is fast paced but the time goes by really quick and the job is very easy once you have completed,and if you paid attention in your training class. Trainers are awesome as well."
good,"call center fast paced in the open enrollment , does alot of work with insurance companies. Room for growth with the company, Good benefits and better staff."
good,"This was an OK company, I loved working for them, they could be more understanding of having to miss work. It's was always something to do, no raises, but opportunity for promotion."
good,When I worked here it was for taking calls about the department of education for defaulting student loans. I'm unsure if this is still what they are doing or not. I remember them being in the process of being bought out when I left. The phonecalls were stressful mostly because people were usually always yelling at you. not for the faint of heart.
good,There was a buy out so there are some new people I can not speak for. However the company is a big company but a good company to work for. The management if you get the right one will fight for you.
good,I had my own office and supported the Base Communications squadron. I supported multiple agencies and learned from my  customers as we worked together as a team.
good,"good company"
good,GDIT is a great company very fast pace and frequent changes. Number over opportunities available to move forward while tenure with the company. The location is great for me.
good,"This place is a great place to work, everyone is super nice and willing to help you. Its pretty easy work once you get everything down. The only issues is that there is a lot to take in and the training seems crowded and its sometimes hard to remember everything they teach you. Wish they would spend a bit more time on training. Another thing is following your empower. You have to stay on schedule as much as possible, if you are so much as a minute late to go into an Aux you have to send exceptions and if you don't it could count against your grade for the week. With it being a call center I understand that you have to work as close as you can to the time, but its hard if you get stuck on a phone call. If you don't stay within the percentage each week your grade will go down. and actions are taking from there if you cant keep up."
good,"Mission focused, productive environment, takes care of employees, focus on employee education, tremendous benefits, focused on employee work-life balance"
good,"This was a good company to work for but they are very large.  As usual in a large company, it is easy to get left behind or forgotten about.  They did everything they could to help me."
good,Company pays great but can be depressing when listening to Medicare patients who need help but can not get it. The job and the company are great you just have to be able to accept that you can not help all of the Medicare pt problems

good,General Dynamics offered great opportunities to their employees.  General Dynamics kept their employees apprised of upcoming opportunities for advancement.

good,Flexible schedule and minimal work required. Great supervisor and fun peers. Large cafeteria and public transportation accessible. Casual dress code. Fun
good,"If you want to work for a company that's human resource department is on your side, helping you every way they can this is the place for you. Phone calls both good and bad, somedays back to back calls other hour or so apart. GDIT has an excellent pay with excellent benefits. One of my biggest regrets was leaving this job."
good,Enjoyed the flexibility as well as the work at your own pace environment. Very professional and overall my coworkers were very smart ambitious people.

good,"enjoyable workplace"
good,"It is a job that if worked seriously and enjoyed, then it's a matter of time until you are a manager or a supervisor. Every now and then, the company will host playful events to keep the workplace interesting. They offer overtime around peak times and provide additional benefits as well. Overall, great place for one to burrow in to start a decent career."
good,"The job can use other employees that have greater knowledge and willness, than those who have a diploma and don't equal the position. The job is OK, if you need something temporarily. They really aren't organized enough to give a standard review on employees.  They will fire you with out a cause."
good,Training consists of 2 weeks in which you are taught everything you have to know in order to be successful. You are helped even after training and the information you are given is helpful for yourself as well. You get to help people resolve insurance issues and at the end of the day you feel accomplished.
good,This job was fun and it gave me the opportunity to learn more about customer service. The knowledge I gained will be value because I learned more about trouble and it taught me patience.
good,"Answering phone calls from people need help with their incurable, also answering any questions they may have about there insurance or why they revived and email or letter. "
good,"working at general dynamics at the time that I did work there was very competitive from 1977 to 2007. I enjoyed the travel, and I enjoyed the work. My work was mostly on ships and submarines."
good,"Good Workplace to work, excellent trained program, learned to be an effective customer service agent, I recommended this place to work.  The company had a team work culture."

good,"GDIT is a very well organized, managed professional Company within the IT community. If you are an IT professional I would seek employment with GDIT."

good,"Receiving incoming calls through out the day, makes the day go by fast. Typical day includes answering calls about marketplace and responding to consumers concerns about insurance plans and termination of plans with the marketplace. Coworkers always have negative things to say, management is a little off no one is ever available when needed, hardest part of job is not being able to assist everyone with their needs. Not everyone is eligible for help through the marketplace. I love providing serive to my consumers and helping them where I can. I enjoy proving my bilingual skills to help them understand the service we provide."
good,I learned a lot working for General Dynamic Information Technology. I was able help a lot of people find affordable health care and answer any general questions pertaining to the Affordable Care Act.

good,I enjoyed my job at Chick Fil A. The people there made it fun and exciting. My co-workers were very nice and pleasant to work with we were all like one big family. Everyone always pitched in to help one another at the end of the night when things needed to be done. They all taught me a lot being that it was my first job as well. I would say the most hardest time of the day would be when we would have groups of people all come in at one time like for instance baseball teams and church groups. There would be so many people at one time that we wouldn't expect and we would have to rush fairly quickly to get more food ready. Personally I think the night shift was the most exciting part of my day everyone just got along so much better and they all tried to have fun while working and getting things done.

good,A typical day at work for me was challenging. I worked in the Facilities Maintenance Department and everyday there was something different to be done. I enjoyed this particular job for the very reason that it was not too redundant. I would work with different people and at times would manange and lead a group of people to get a job done. I woulds say that the hardest part of the job was docking and undocking Navy Vessels. Sometimes the valves and the hoses were heavy but for the most part I really enjoyed this job!!!!

good,It's not so bad once you get past training and get some hands on learning. It's so much to learn in a classroom in two weeks that it's easier once you learn it on the floor. The experience I had was mixed but I feel it's a good company probably the only company in my area that has as many benefits as it does.
good,"Great Company, lots of growth and competitive environment, nice benefits, only cons is management is inconsistent, keeps changing and constant lay offs."
good,Contract position for safety eyewear which allowed me to work in my chosen profession in conjunction with working in the medical field as a certified  nurse assistant in the emergency room.  The hours of operation between the two positions became conflicting so I had to give up the contract position due to limited hours. Great place to work for and be able to utilize your optical skills along with good compensation.
good,It's a call center job so it's expected for the job to be demanding and stressful. What I don't like is the management as they don't know what they are doing and they just power trip on people.
good,They will give anyone an opportunity for employment. This a great place to start a career and gain work experience. It is very easy to advance if you put in the work. The downside however is the pay is low compared to other call centers. There are also no yearly raises.

When you help understand and they get what  you are saying to them.
good,"I would help customer fill out application for the affordable care act."

It also recognizes that its CSRs ARE the company product and tries to take care of us.  Health insurance is free, and on stressful work days, they even take a snack cart around the cubicles.  Very generous bonus system."
good,"My typical day was arriving around 6:00 AM and leaving around 4:30 PM.  I generally was assigned CREO work to do.  Towards the end, I felt very comfortable coming up with designs and utilizing CREO.  Towards the end, I don't recall having problems creating geometry.  At the beginning, I did have issues understanding how the models were filed in different areas.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was pretty much left alone to do the CREO jobs."
good,"Postion as a working structural lead was very physically demanding but in the end was tremendously rewarding. Management"

good,Great place to work right out of college.  Worked where they produced the F16 fighter jet.  Was fun to go to the actual building portion and see the stages.
good,"A lot of times they will hire just about anyone. You are typically hired on as temporary but after open enrollment, you are typically hired on permanent. Not the best job. You have to sit there all day wethere you are busy or not. But the job isn't hard and the hours are there if you need them"
good,Working for general dynamics was an absolute joy. I learned that great places to work with helpful management exist. The hardest part of the job was clocking out for the day. Being at work there was an excellent escape from my daily life.
good,"I learned so much about working in a call center while I was here. It's laid back, and fun at the same time. The hardest part of the job would be some of the issues people need help with. The most enjoyable is just all day, you sit and help tons of people. You answer calls back to back and you help people with problems they might be having with health insurance, or answer general questions they may have. Some people are applying for health insurance. It's a great place!"
good,Well organized company.  They try to take care of their workers and the managers are willing to make accommodations as required to help you when problems arise.
good,Great job they don't really train you that well when you are on the floor. sort of toss into the water and learn how to swim. Some supervisor are amazing some couldn't careless to help you and some only look out for themselves. If you have a a sick day even with a doctors note so it will not be counted against you. HR does not care or has the mental capacity to understand that its not supposed to be counted against you. SO you will HAVE to use your sick paid leave or request ATO if not it WILL be counted against you.
good,"Your management dictates the culture and morale of your workplace. Since we had so many turnovers in the apst 2 years, our expectations has changed. As long as you're hard working and motivated, you shouldn't need to worry to much about that change."

My varied competencies in human resources and education means that I am an accomplished and results-driven professional with experience in meeting key business needs through the development and implementation of critical strategies and organizational development initiatives. I possess the proven ability to initiate, organize, and deliver process improvements and positive changes within complex organizations and institutions. "
good,"We are trained well to do the job.  There are people around to assist with questions.  Many supervisors are amazing and professional.  "
good,"i worked at the houston site before it was closed.  i sat in what was called the ""island"" for several months. the few tems that were in the ""island"" were very easy going people and it was a very stress free work area for several months. i has a very easy going schedule and my trainer was very nice and explained the system to a T. i had an incredible schedule from 7-5pm  mon-thurs. the hardest part about the job was when my supervisor stopped coming in and my team as well as others were moved out of the ""island"" into what was called general population. we then all found out the shift of a relaxed world into the dramatic filled world of the company and from there went through 5 more supervisors. things were no longer as managible as they were before but i was still on a good team that got along well. the most enjoyable part of this job was being on a team taht stuck together and believed in being there for one another. i hate they closed the houston office for this company...and in the end the managers showed their true colors, as it was truly every man or woman for himself. their goal was to fire as many people as possible and although i wasnt one of these people it was hurtful to see hard workers terminated for no reason at all"
good,It is a good place to work and i like workig here but i dont want to travel 7-8 months out of the year. i enjoy my job working with the soldiers and sharing my knowlage with them.
good,Used different types of tools to take apart Army Striker Tanks. This was a very demanding job and dangerous. I had to make sure that every part was accounted for and properly stored in proper place. I learned how to be very careful. I learned how to work with other team members to get the job done correctly.
good,"Currently working at the Bogalusa site. Productive and fun work environment but do not offer yearly raises. Decent amount of pay, but it is not a competitive pay."
good,i like ours that i work i learned new and important information this was my first call center i like my job alot and they provide alot of learning material and you always have your supervisor helping you in a chaotic  situation
good,This job has its ups and downs. Sometimes when the calls are back to back it can be very overwhelming. There is a lot of information that you have to know and maintain.
good,Incoming calls to enroll customers into the obamacare. Assisted the customers in completing the online applications to see if they were approved for any tax credits to lower their monthly premiums. Educated customers about health plans so that they were able to make the best decision for their families
good,The hardest part is not letting people know what you would choose  about their insurance. I learned alot about insurance and what not to choose for personal use
good,if your not a person for manual labor the job is great. you would be trained in a variety of departments that answer phone calls for the public.
good,"I did Medicare claims and review for patients. I love helping people and has an extremely sensitive place in my heart for elderly people. Great learning experience, my all time favorite job."
good,"I started off as a Receptionist but then I was given the title Front Office Administrator and I also received training to be a Property Administrator. I supported 2 offices, one in Arlington, VA and the other in Fairfax, VA. I ordered office supplies, greeted visitors, reserved conference rooms, worked closely with the Facilities department, assisted with new hires for our office located in Richmond, VA."

good,fellow servers and kitchen good people. management plays favorites.
good,"One of the most enjoyable work environments I've worked in. It was essentially self-paced so once you learned what you needed to accomplish the work you could pick up the ball and run. The supervisor, lead and my trainer were all very patient and helpful."
good,"A typical day as the Operations Manager involves the oversight, direction and responsibilty of the entire division in support of the Manufacturing process. This responsibilty is made up of over 250 mechanics, Supervisiors and Area Mangers."
good,Answering inbound calls. Company offers excellent training
good,A very good company with good benefits. The only drawback is they make you deploy when needed or leave and help other areas when needed. Many people loose their families while working for them.
good,"running cnc lathes to produce military ammunition,I have learned alot about the job so far. Fellow employees are always willing too lend a hand. Hardest part of my job I would say is the heat in summer time but you get used to it."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company, I wish they would have kept the contract. I would work for them again."
good,"Mission oriented, customer focused and the teams all seemed to be very capable of solving problems and overcoming obstacles. The tools and technology were available to get your job done. Like any contract-based company there is not much job security for the long haul so don't plan on retiring but again, all defense contracting companies and most certainly the larger ones (LM, GD, RTN, L3, etc.) are in flux but GDIT seemed to be the best managed that I've worked for or with."
good,Very face past training  was easy and calls are very repetitive it's micro manage bit the people who work. There are willing to help and very nice  I would consider this a great start for anyone who doesn't have customer service experience  in a call center
good,They have very friendly people working there and they are very helpful if you are struggling to understand the work they do. They mainly work on government contracts and their building does not allow paperwork  because everything is done online.
good,"I enjoyed working at GDIT, the workplace was great. I was only a part time employee so I only worked 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week. I made $12.95 an hour and if I worked anytime after 7pm my hourly rate went up to $14.25"

good,"Friendly co-workers, cohesive workplace. Most days can be hectic, a few are laid back. the most enjoyable part of the job for me is the different equipment and learning how to work on everything."
good,"I learn daily information that I did not know the day before, An typical day at work is callers calling about premium information. Management, some of them are great at their job and others I think the title makes them feel they are capable of doing less than what they are really there to do. The hardest part of the job is when I can not help the Bene with what they need to be helped with. The most enjoyable part is when I get to oversee the CSRs because I love to help and would rather have a helping position as a Supervisor than an CSR."
good,"General Dynamics IT was one of my favorite jobs. I strongly recommend working here, though you may be hired on initially as temporary or seasonal, you can earn a permanent position with a good work ethic."
good,My job duties were to answer inbound calls and assist consumers with applying for health insurance. Working with this company was an advancement to know how the healthcare system work. Also with providing consumers with a peace of mind knowing that they are now coverage with insurance.
good,"It was great working for this company, flexible hours and friendly people. Pay rate is awesome and you learn a lot of important factors about health insurance in general."

good,"I worked as a contract employee, so I can't speak to Compensation and Benefits.  I enjoyed working at GD.  They invest in their employees; the engineers always had the software and hardware they needed.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  The culture is a little redneck; I liked it, but it may not be your thing."
good,Yes.. I was challenged thoughout the 9.5 years. It was a production environment; very structured but rewarding. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with other to achieve weekly & monthly planning goals. We always overcame the difficulties and pushed thru to meet or surpass those target goals. I learned that to be part of a structured workplace that prides itself on Safety plus continued hard work can pay off. Performance Bonuses are good incentives as well.
good,"My typical day was being on of the night Supervisors, having a large team of agents that came to work and did there work. We had alot of fun, too bad the location wasn't able to handle a call center and had to close down."
good,"Full time shifts ranging from 8 or 10 hours. 40 hours in a work week, work 5 days off two for 8 hour shift. Pay is 12.06. It's an easy job if you don't mind staring at a computer all day and talking on the phone. Health dental & vision & they match 401k. They hire seasonally for temp positions they offer the chance to become permanent. Offer gifts and incentives during their peak times."
good,The company is fantastic and I was grateful to have the opportunity to temporarily work for them. My short tenure with them was basically an internship.
good,The certifcation reimbursements were great. They allowed you to work with your team and solve issues at the lowest level
good,With people are getting high on the job I never feel safe. I fell unsafe when I getting ready to go to my car. The most enjoyable is being able to help the elderly.
good,"I worked totally on Proposal graphic illustration and design, this was a short term contract work. I would have liked to continue but the Proposal arena is difficult to predict when they will occur. The hours were very flexible and the managers were great with communication of what was needed and expected."
good,"In my work environment in GDIT we were able to help people in all three programs I was able to achieve that reward of helping others. If it was helping a college student getting financial assistance to go to school or help an elder person get their medical claims paid. GDIT was a wonderful experience that I like to work at, there is just no room for advancement."
good,I enjoyed the time that i was employed with General Dynamics. Most days were easy flow calls mainly questions about the processes of obtaining health insurance and the requirements. I was able to gain knowledge on various computer programs and also learn the new ACA laws and tax rules for not obtaining health coverage. The job was fairly easy my co-workers and supervisors were laid back and understanding. The work pace was fast and steady during the peak seasons of open enrollment and slow and laid back towards the end of the season. The most difficult part of the employment experience was the misunderstanding of the consumers and the rumors that they've heard and were acting upon when trying to register for health coverage. I really enjoyed talking with the consumers and helping them to better understand what types of insurance was available tro them and helping them find a plan that fits the needs of thier families.
good,Great job I love working here. I  make good money and I love taking phone calls. You talk to people all the time. You hear different accents.

good,Fellow employees I had the honor to work with were amazing. The call center was very clean and nice working environment. Hard working individuals and dedicated to proper work polices.
good,good company lots of perks and good compensation could improve supervisors and trainers. Lots of work not much down time.

good,Great company to work for. Proud to work in the aerospace / defense industry. I only left because the industry is struggling as a whole.
good,"Took incoming calls on Health Care Enrollment. I learned how to enroll customers for Health Care and affordable plans for every family member that they had. I learned how every states Health Care is different policies an procedures by law. My co-workers were great and helpful. The hardest part of my job was going through a whole application that sometimes took 2 hours, and not having it go through because of a website malfunction. The best part was being able to help customers get Health Care that has never had before."
good,"Provides a good informational training, calm atmosphere. Was already aware of the call center and clients that I was working for."
good,"I enjoyed coming in to work, the atmosphere is amazing. The people that I worked with are great technicians and top level knowledge group.

good,Typical day at this job was very short actually. I learned how military tanks were built and how things were put on them.
good,I loved working for this company because I love helping people
good,"My day usually started with phone calls to the lead people of our many general contractors . Followed with site visits checking on job quality and job progress , always ensuring that the men where working safely . Interfacing with co-workers was always helpful for everyone involved when dealing with unforeseen issues . The hardest part of the job would've been all the windshield time and hotels . But , meeting new people on the projects was always good ."
good,"An overall awesome company to work for, however our training was too short and inadequate. We relied mostly on each other and trial and error. I truly enjoyed being able to assist consumers and offer them excellent customer service as the program we worked was very stressful to consumers. Being able to use my soft skills in situations where needed and keeping my call quality at or above 90% the entire length of my employ, made me happy."
good,"Easy environment, learned  new migrating tools."
good,"I would recommend working with GDIT, but the fact of the matter is that it is a contract company, and the security of your job is not high.  The co-workers in which I worked with gave me an enjoyable workplace."
good,"Responsibility but not authority."
good,"A typical day is spent interacting With Computers, using computers and computer systems (including hardware and software) to set up functions, enter data, or process information.  "
good,A good place to build your career but incremental raise rate is a joke.
good,"At the current moment the hardest part of my job is having to review cell sites and make the determination of what work was performed in order to bill our customer. Since the Market is closing and the Project Managers/Construction Managers are no longer with the company, I am forced to make those determinatons myself."
good,General Dynamics in Tallahassee Florida was a great place to work and I really enjoyed the work and the people that I worked with.  I was shocked when the company decided to consolidate the purchasing effort to the headquarters in Detroit.
good,"I never thought I would find myself looking for other opportunities, however after 3 contract recompetes and/or merges, my time has come to seek out something new. "
good,I spent over ten years working for the company before being hired on as a full time employee. The technologies being developed there made the work interesting and challenging. My fellow employees were knowledgeable and fun to work with. 
good,I really enjoy working at General Dynamics. I really love welding especially if it helps to keep our troops safe out in the field. Very diverse place to work. Enjoyed the group of people I worked with. I loved the fact that it was structual welding all day long. Fabricating was the hardest but also the most enjoyable part of my day.
good,I liked working at General Dynamics. I would return to work there given the opportunity.
good,"High-throughput production environment. Immense pressure on all team members for quality, safety & production quotas."
good,A typical workday at General Dynamics is exciting. I've learned a great deal about medicare and everyday on the phones helping the beneficiaries is an adventure. Management is cool. Most of them started on the phone so they can really relate to what you are going through. The hardest part of the job is being on the phone. Sick old people is not a pleasant mix. tyou have to really have a mindset to help people to do this job
good,Loved working here great people. Training thought you almost everything you needed to know. time went by fast had weekends off. Great experienced Easy job.
good,The food was delicious and on work site. The gym is in the facility. I was sick and had months off with full pay. The people were great and the work load was steady.
good,"The company was great, it helped all of us in the team be able to learn more than what we already knew in the time being before joining the company. Management was understanding to a certain point involving other soldiers and their units. Great opportunities to be able to continue and have a job, only wished it wasn't a contract."
good,"A worldwide, powerful company to work for; lots of resources..."
good,"We began with tons of incentives and company events. There was unlimited amounts of overtime. The benefits are excellent. As a company they were collaborative and impressive. At my particular location, we lacked management skills and continuity.  I would still work for them on another contact."
good,"It’s a fast paced job, but once you learn your specific joe it’s not difficult to maintain. They offer many incentives and the benefits are great. You also have the option to take their free health insurance or you can opt. to pay for better insurance."
good,"Amazing coworkers. You really feel like you are making a different and making it safer for the men and women in the military. Not all managers are the same, currently I have the best one but there are others that would make you want to leave."
good,A typical work day is fun and at the same time challenging. The environment is open and welcomes new innovative solutions at the same time encouraging the growth from within.
good,Great place to work. Good training program. Knowledge staff. Different work shifts available. Would recommend to anyone to work there. Great facility with great personnel available to help.
good,This job is a life changer. The people there are like a work family. They work with you and help you to be your best. The trainer is awesome. I would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Very stressful job, continuous phone conversations "
good,"This place should be more considerate of parents who have children. The hours should be flexible. I remember I was fired because my daughter had to have a surgery. I put in for FMLA, but it wasn't approved until after I was terminated. Nothing was done in order for me to get my job back."
good,"Managers at GDIT have been nothing but kind to me and my coworkers. We are often told that we are doing a good job, and we are rated fairly. There are ample places for employees to take breaks and unwind before getting back to their code."
good,"What I liked most about working there, was that time moved very fast."
good,"I worked for the Controller of General Dynamics.  He headed up many departments for the shipbuilding industry.  When he was transferred because the plant was closing, I was moved to the General Manager's office to assist there."
good,"The first line management will not go to bat for their employees. Program Managers will go to bat for the employee of the manager though. Upper level management is fine, I just think they are not aware of what is going on."
good,"The calls during peek season for signing up is stressful and the customers were waiting on hold for 1-2 hours so their mood was not too good until I began talking to them and assuring them I would take care of things and stick with them until we had processed a Health Care plan they were comfortable with. My shift was the 4:30 pm to 1 am and calls were non stop talking to people from all walks of life."
good,The way the yards run now fixed price verse msmo. constant laid offs reups. great team long time to get in Union. Great guys taught me everything if your willing to listen and work. great safe shop and yard.

good,"It's a good job to work, you can get your 40 hours a week, You don't get a raise unless you get another position. The benefits are great. The pay rate is not enough needs  to increase and don't get a yearly or quarterly raise."
good,"took inbound calls, helped customer sign up for health insurance. Answered general health insurance questions. read from scripts. face pace. enjoyable co workers."
good,I loved this place.  My fellow employees were wonderful. My Supervisor was excellent. I answered inquiries about Medicare. To talk to elderly individuals and help them understand all of the complexities was very fulfilling. Anytime you needed help people were more than happy to assist you.

good,"Overall the job that I was placed in was very challenging dealing with a variety of COTS equipment.  The hardest part of the job is staying current on the different technologies. Most enjoyable part of the job is working real-world issues, in a time-sensitive environment."
good,"Left because I was not offered the job I was promised. While I was there I enjoyed the work tremendously. If I would have been offered an Intelligence job, I would have stayed."
good,My role in GD was as the Systems Training manager within the ATLAS Consortium. GD were a second tier partner. The job was varied and interesting. The Home location in Wales meant a lot of travel was required for Programme reviews. The consortium finally morphed into HP Enterprises with little input from GD after the initial 5 year rollout of Defence Information Infrastructure.
good,"Great job. "
good,"This is a government/military job, more strict then a civilian job.  If you comply with the rules this job can be very fun and fulfilling. You will learn a lot from this job that you can apply to your own life."
good,"Working at GDIT, isn't a terrible job. The management staff are great. I stayed to myself a lot . The only down side is, there isn't much advancement. Your paid rate will always remain at $12.58, unless you work the night shift ($13.83 after 7 pm, locatation closes at 2 am.. you do the math), converting to dual (working Medicare & Marketplace),  ISG, Quality, Supervisor, or Manager."
good,"Always overtime available, work and life balance was manageable due to three shifts to choose from.  Advancement was always an option they had traveling opportunities as well as skill growth.  They provided evening classes for those who wanted to advance.  Benefits where the best I have ever seen, health insurance could not be any better."
good,Very productive and friendly work environment. Always provided the equipment required to take care of the tasks at hand. Involved management team with employees.
good,Good working environment. Learn something new everyday.  Kept current with training and staff development. Staff very helpful and knowledgeable. Friendly staff.

good,"This job was very tedious. Because I worked at a call center, there's thins that I had to say and do correctly or I would lose points.Can't work there"
good,Great company with important customer service mission.  Company announced closure of my facility and provided 60-day notice.  Senior management visited site to provide announcement and answer questions directly from workforce.  Hard job done very well.  Company is supporting various outreach and reemployment opportunities for anyone seeking help.  I have enjoyed my work with GD and would highly recommend the company despite the business decision made to close our facility.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Obama Care. I learned a lot about insurance and helping people. I was disappointed about them closing my call center down, and laying us employees off."

good,Assist pension participates with pension benefits. I enjoy helping others and this position allows me to do so without so many restrictions which allows me to do what I love best...assist thoroughly. I have several years of call center experience and this CCCO is by far the best call center environment. The benefits and opportunities are also endless as they are carried all over the U.S. I would definitely recommend working here.
good,Overall it was a fun place to work and most customers were friendly. This was my fist job and I loved it and the only thing that could be difficult sometimes was the pace but once I adapted to it; it was awesome.

I then worked for USARC as a help desk technician. After that I spent a year in Afghanistan as a Helpdesk Lead. Overall the Supervisors and managers at GDIT were outstanding. They gave me the training I needed for my job.
good,working in a call center is not for everyone. However working for General Dynamics is not as bad as some call centers. Their management and employees are a pleasure to work with and for. The hardest past of your job is doing your job correctly and dealing with some callers. The most enjoyable part of your job is being able to pick your schedule and getting the time off that you have took off for.
good,Great Company to Work for.  Really enjoy the work and the people that I work with. Everyday it was a joy to go to work.  Hardest part of the job was the commute.
good,All my co workers were a great deal of fun to work with.  Plenty of comrade group sense.  We had a busy schedule with a strong sense of urgency to meet time lines on project build out. Management was supportive and encouraged your individual dedication to project with any needs considered of matter.  Getting recognition for your hard work did not go unnoticed.  A very rare thing in most cases.
good,"On a normal day i would answer call for commercial and residential regarding health insurance.  I was the supervisior on the floor when there was a hostile consumer, so i would not only calm down the consumer but find a solution.

good,"Awesome place to work, I was hired on for the Affordable Health care Plan. I worked in the call center, dealing with incoming calls from consumers trying to purchase health insurance.The calls came from all over the United States. I had a great Manager, who took time with updating all of the CSR'S with the daily changes of the dead lines for the ending of open enrollment. There was really no hard part about the job, just informing the consumer that they didn't qualify for coverage.....The most enjoyable part was telling a consumer, they qualified and gave them great affordable coverage. The job ended on April 25,2014 due to the closing of our site location."
good,Fast paced stress free environment. Management was easy going. You basically managed yourself.
good,Great benefits. Was able to advance in job roles.  Gained more knowledge and responsibilities to further my career.

I have great relationships with all management including all co-workers. I enjoy creating and sustaining a positive culture wherever I work.

good,"This is one of the best companies I ever worked for. It was a place where everyday is a new day of learning as military technology continues to evolve and grow. Outside of learning everyday and having the opportunity to continue training our warfighters, the work environment and atmospherics were great when working with fellow veterans."
good,It was a temporary position doing the Google Fiber Project in Louisville KY. Once all the design and make ready was identified General Dynamics was completed with the contract.

The management was great, the co workers were mostly retired military personnel so it was easy relating to many in the office. Everyone worked well within their respective teams and most employees got along well with each other. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the military service members - feeling engaged, still in the fight. Unfortunately, the sequestration forced many of us out and as a result  we had to seek for new employment. Otherwise, I would have stayed on with General Dynamics."

good,So many riles and guidelines and not very fun place. The supervisors are un knowledgeable although there are good benefits and it pays the bills month to month
good,"This is a great job when there are soldiers in the building to train.  Hours are typically 7:30am to 4pm.  We work the live, virtual, and constructive integrated architecture (LVC-IA), We stimulate simulated missions so the mission command (MC) systems get worked as if the soldiers were in the field or in combat.  When soldiers are not training, we integrate systems that are potential Army programs; not all make it to that point."
good,I worked on a contract site and had little interaction with my GDIT management. The only reason I left was that the job wasn't even remotely challenging. I needed more stimulation on a regular basis.
good,"I enjoyed working at general dynamics during the open enrollment season, once the season ended the inbound phone calls became extremely slow which made my day go by even slower, but I recommend this job to someone who is young and ready to live on their own."

good,Fun place to work with very good managers and customer service representative and alot of experience. would enjoy working there
good,"Pretty good job. Pretty bad communication between management on different shifts and pretty bad disciplinary action for people who didn't do their job.

The work also can be very slow at times leading to a lot of people standing around."

After toggling through my emails, I walk the floor and greet the many different faces with a smile.  I ask how they are and If any concerns arise than I am willing to assist.  After greeting the CSR's than I turn to my Sups to check on them and see where we are as a team.  When we are settled in we start our work day.  Great place to work at and look forward to coming in."
good,"Great company to work for, great team of people. I was looking forward to go to work every day and lots of overtime for those that wanted to make money."

good,I enjoyed my job would love to work there again just wish it was a more permanent job. While I was there I learned a lot and found people to be very helpful.
good,Answering phone calls and assisting beneficiaries with medical questions and information. Helping them with drug plans and billing issues as well it was different and very interesting to learn because I didn't know much about medicare. It was difficult at times answering questions in a limited time and giving them the correct information and it was hard but I eventually got hang of it.

good,"Classroom management focuses on prevention rather than punishment. A secure, inviting classroom, along with respect for the dignity of children and purposeful activities, prevents most discipline problems. The role of the teacher is crucial in establishing an effective learning environment. The objective is to instill inner self-control in students, not merely to exert your control over them. Set the tone of your classroom from the start by being firm and fair; friendly, yet professional. When you are more confident of your ability to maintain order, you will be more relaxed, and the students will perceive you as a person who really cares. "

good,I have multiple duties at GD which include scheduling and handling 35 quality inspectors in 3 different areas on 3 different shifts. I always try to make it my goal to ensure that all my employees have everything they need to get the job done which often includes training.The hardest part of the job is getting everyone the time off they have earned while making sure the lines have what they need from quality.The best part of my job is knowing that the military is getting a quality and dependable munitions.

However, I don't know what it is like now."
good,"The company is great. Gave me a chance even though my knowledge level was below par. Was given the opportunity to grow and learn. Hours are great. I worked 4/10 hour days with 3 days off.

good,"Managed a large projects  center. Very fast paced with frequent deadlines. "
good,"This is a good job to have if you want to sit at a desk all day.

It does get busy, as call centers usually do from time to time.The only thing I did not like was when I signed up for the 7am to 3pm training class, they moved it to 6am to 2:30pm which made it difficult to get to work on time for me and they didn't tell us about the change until our first day of class. They also kept extending our training weeks so it was 2 weeks longer than it was supposed to be. A lot of people in my class had to leave because of the time changing they did."
good,Come in take calls for two hours and break then come back take calls for another two hours. then break for lunch 30 mins. come back calls for two hours. then on last break then go home. its a very receptive job doing same job duties over and over. but the pay is good and you meet a lot of nice people.
good,"Its a rather good work environment... kindly fast paced,  with nice coworkers and friendly management. I learned how to respect the caller no matter how angry and disrespectful and how to keep my cool and help the customer resolve the issues that they are dealing with. The most enjoyable part of the day was later in the shift when call volume died down a bit and you were able to relax a little more with more time between phone calls."

CMS administered the regulations and material I used on daily basis to assist my customers obtain insurance though the Affordable Care Act. At this call center, I learned how to interact with many different people from all walks of life; not only via telephone but co-workers as well. Working in such a large call center was extremely educational in many aspects, including how to provide great customer service with numerous cultures, religions, ect.

I had not worked in a call center before, so this was a new experience for me. However, I am able to use the people skills and organizational skills that I have developed in my previous jobs. The hardest art of my job is having to tell the consumer that they do not qualify for a particular type of service - or that due to policy, I am unable to enroll them in and insurance plan, or that the plan they were enrolled in last year has increased majorly in price.

good,I did well until I got sick and could not maintain a 40 hour work week.
good,"General Dynamics is a fun and educational place to work. I learned how to work well with others. I enjoyed the travel opportunities. Beneifits are very good compared to other companies. The hardest part is the time spent away from family but it is all worth it in the end. "
good,Would work there again. Employees well treated and Safe work environment.
good,"GDIT is a good company to work for if your looking for growth and the opportunity to travel and learn various trades. A typical work day for me is fast paste, logging into my GDIT account and seeing what Leads and or supervisors have emailed me MRF's (material request forms) for the day! After doing so, depending on the material and the demand of the material ill check what we have in stock, make sure the tool/supplies past safety inspection and most of all usable!. Then id transport them to the required ship in which the job is. Management well?? It's a exactly what it says Management. Some days I can expect to be micro managed others not so much. The co-workers are pretty fair, there aren't really no difficult parts to the job. The most enjoyable part is knowing you have security!"
good,New information was provided everyday about health insurance
good,Working with General Dynamics Was an Amazing experience from my co workers to management to the customers
good,I learned how to take and manage calls and questions regarding the new health care plan.

good,"•	Customer Service"
good,"I deal with different types of people everyday, so I always have to make sure I have a positive attitude as soon as I walk in the door."
good,"Good company, focusing on IT aspects of security."
good,"Generally I arrive there fairly early so it makes it easier to keep to a routine but essentially you get there, check your outbox and then empower (schedule) before you have to get on phones. There are three break times consisting of two fifteen minute breaks and a thirty minute lunch break. It does vary as to what schedule that is assigned to you but they also do have rotation in schedule times. but the current shift given is 8am-4:30pm. call volumes tend to vary from day to day but it is generally higher on weekends as well as when the days draw closer to the enrollment date in the time line. As far as management is concerned , it is fairly decent but there is often a shift in supervisors and it is not always a seasoned supervisor but one that has just come out of training which in some aspects is troublesome. For co-workers there is quite the variety and what I am meaning is that some are quite the socialite while others are quiet and to themselves. There are also those that are there to work and tend to be the few that seem to think its a place to pick up women or men when thats truly not the case. The hardest part is the scorecard and how they go about scoring said card.Often it is found that compliance cannot be entirely maintained due to the fact that a call can typically run over the break times that are set explicitly in your schedule so it brings the score down. Also it has been noted that the cards are not always updated or properly calculated at times. I however do believe one of the most enjoyable aspect of the job is actually making a consumer feel at ease or helping"
good,"Family oriented, challenging work, qualified management that cares about its employees."
good,Working at GDIT was great! I enjoyed the whole . I regretted having to leave them because of my health conditions. They really care about their employees.
good,"Staff arrives early and leaves late"
good,"I worked 40 hours a week. They allowed me to think for myself and to develop as a professional. On my own time I developed curriculum and instead of dismissing it, they ran it through the proper channels and added it to the every day instruction to the students. They are open to suggestions. Their continuous education and training programs are excellent. They go out of their way to make sure you are properly trained to do your job. I have never had management look out for their employees the way mine did. Co-workers are intelligent and down to earth. I thoroughly enjoyed working with students. You never learn more about your own job, then when you have to teach someone else."

good,Wonderful place to work. They sold out to Maximus In November of 2018 so their call center is no longer open as such. Not sure about any other branches of GDIT...
good,CEO is awesome.  A lot of communication between corporate headquarters and remote locations on a regular basis. Regular job announcements for career advancement.

Management and employees relationship is not good. they don't treat employees good. I recently heard the two managers who didn't treat employees are not there any more and it seems a good place to work with managers too."
good,The daily work load was quite different from my past experiences. I learned new system (GDIT-IFS) for managing inventory receipt and shipping. Being an off site and working closely with the partners at Interstate Shipping gave me great insight in the organization of the warehouse processes.

good,"A challenging but rewarding workplace. I learned the importance of doing a job right the first time with professional engineers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to troubleshoot the the equipment for non compliance, but the most enjoyable part of the job was shipping a outstanding, functional piece of equipment to the customer on time"
good,Daily you would be on the phone answering calls and helping others get appointments for their health needs. I have learned alot from booking appointments and learning how to use the computer in different ways for 6 years. My co-workers were hard workers as well as I was. The hardest part of the job is when there is no appointments for the patients that we would have to have them to call back and that was always a hard thing for me.

good,"As the only inter-agency advisor/analyst working on lessons learned studies for Joint Forces Command, the engagement with the military was key to my position as a former USAID officer with deep knowledge of the foreign affairs development environment.  My role was to advise the command and to participate in studies requested by Combatant Commanders (PACOM, CENTCOM, or others) and provide the USAID/DOD perspective to my organization.  I was also asked to conduct training at the Joint Forces Staff College on inter-agency relationships and how USAID works with DOD elements. During the course of my employment with JFCOM/JCOA (Joint Forces Command, Joint Center for Operational Analysis), was able to deploy and particulate in studies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Honduras and Haiti and engage in other studies from our Suffolk, Virginia offices. Bringing a USAID perspective, I also was able to participate in war games.

This harassment wasn't any particular form of prejudice, but got in the way of me doing my job through heavy verbal abuse and rudeness, and management unfortunately failed to address these issues appropriately, leading to my departure. All in all, as the ratings imply, working for GDIT was a wonderful experience and the managers were extremely nice and the company culture was very relaxed and easy going.

good,This is a fantastic company to get the opportunity to work for. I have been in the computer industry since 1989 and owned a successful business repairing computers for commercial business as well as residential customers. I must say that I been treated extremely well by my supervisors and as long as I am turning in my required documents on a weekly basis they leave me alone. They don't micromanage me which is a blessing. I hate when a company is so insecure that they feel the need to do that to an employee. If I am doing my job and the work is getting done they should leave you alone. Yes I am very happy with GDIT.

good,A typical work day at GDIT could be slow paced or either fast depending on the time of the year. Open enrollment can be a little overwhelming because the calls are constantly back to back. I thought out my calls I have learned to become a more generous and courteous person. I have also learn information about health coverage and Medicare. I what I have learn is helpful explaining and providing information people that I know. I this workplace you have to dress casual and sometime you can dress out costumes. I hardest part of the job is practically everything. To me this is a challenging job. I challenges you to be the best call center representative you can be. The most enjoyable part of the job is the group activities and the assessment training. Group activities allows everyone at the site to come together and share their ideas. The assessment training is a way of giving head up on upcoming caller and what to expect.

good,Working at General Dynamics was obviously amazing. Your typical day at work is always relaxing well that until its time for open enrollment. Open enrollment is simply signing up the elderly for drug plans and calls are coming fast and some people are actually confused. You learn that you have to be patient and try not to say or do the wrong thing while being overwhelmed . Management is simply amazing & they're by far understanding as well. the workplace is full of different personalities and amazing people. There really is nothing hard about the job other than the cold air. The most enjoyable moments were all of them . i simply love being a CSR.

The only thing that i really disliked and the company is that you may have some callers who call in and be very upset but you have to choose whether you want to continue to either be employed or not an employer but other than that you have to have your composer and a good mind set to work at General Dynamics

good,General dynamics was a wonderful environment only reason I left is because the company is no longer. I would highly recommend this company to anybody.

good,"Typical work day would be taking phone calls back to back assisting consumers with questions or concerns they may have or filling out applications for them because they got stuck or did not have access to do so, I learned how to be patient at that job and the hardest part is you do have consumers who call in an know it all but they don't know a thing sorry put it that way didn't know how else to put it most enjoyable part of day is knowing that consumer has a smile on their face when they get off phone with me, cause I assisted them to the fullest extent."

The hardest part of the job was when there was nothing more I could do to get the consumer where they needed to be.

good,"Communication skills, patience and problem-solving abilities are required each day in a store, call center or office environment. Most customer service reps work full time, and because many call centers operate 24 hours a day, you may have to work early-morning or late-night shifts. Depending on your job, you may spend your days on your feet in a store or sitting and typing for long periods while fielding phone calls. These conditions could cause headaches, backaches and fatigue. Yet Kamps says the job can be rewarding when you boost customer satisfaction. ""When a person comes in, they are stuck in a problem and want to know what to do,"" Kamps says. ""We're problem solvers and teachers and are trying to help people."" Despite the potential odd hours and physical issues, customer service jobs can serve as a stepping stone to higher positions within a company such as supervisory and management roles."

I started out as a customer service representative, enrolling people into drug and advantage plans, I then certified in claims Tiers 1 and 2. The hardest part of the job is answering questions for the patients that have lost the medication, they need to survive, these are usually cancer patients, The most enjoyable is helping these same people get what they need."

good,"I love going to work everyday. I've been working since I was 16 years old. Worked 23 years for General Dynamics before I was laid off due to cuts in Government contracts.  I take my job very serious. My typical day started off checking my email for special work instructions. These matters are taking care of first or worked in as required. I worked as a Material Handler. I drove and unloaded trucks as they arrive with forklift (Certified). Put material away as required.  Built proper boxes for out going units,(Mil-Standard). Packed finished product from production floor to Mil-Standard for shipment. Prepared shipping labels and manifest. Palletized units and banded to pallet for shipping. All this is done as a team. Team players are important to get the job correct the first time in a timely matter. To see the finished product complete at the end of the day is enjoyable for me. Management is other key player in any job."
good,"a typical day at nassco would be as followed. i would be in full ppe, tools and ready to go about 30 minutes before our shift starts. i would    report my self to my general supervisor and get work from him. after my general supervisor gives me details about my job ill go and inspect my job. once i have finish the task ill report back to my supervisor to notify him that all work has been accomplished. usually the job my old supervisors would provide would last us about the hole day sometimes even more. over at nassco i actually learned a lot of skills which i probably couldnt have learned them on my own. they thought me the basics on the electrical field such as running cable, power tool handling, conduit bending, dc theory, ac theory,mechanical cable installation and using a fork lift. the management department was fair with everyone, they would listen to and try to help any person in need of their assistance. the people i worked with were  really cool, we had a family like environment. some of the more difficult task was when i had to take the lead for like 20 employees. some wanted to cooperate and some didnt. in the end i would have to figure out which people to partner up with another person so that they can be as equally productive as the other group with out upsetting anyone. i would say that the enjoyable part of the job was meeting ends meet in a timely fashion."
good,It was a nice job. The staff was wonderful and understanding.
good,"Every day was a challenge and most of all you looked forward to it. I learned that the best times don't last for ever.  Management was more respectful of the talents of each individual and treated every one the same. My co-workers respected each other as well and always welcome the right to disagree and agree. the Hardest part was the travel to extreme places and working contractors."
good,"My work days started for me at 06:30, our work hours were 08:00 to 16:30. I always came in early so that I could always get a head start on the day. Their are so many skills that I have learn while being a Supervisor their, the most important thing I learn is to always have respect for your employee, take care of them, and they will perform to their best ability and take of you. Our management was great, our operation Manager was excellence. The head office was very helpful when working, or taking care of the team. I enjoyed all of my co-worker we work hard for the company and our customers to make and keep them happy. The job sometimes was not very hard, because the team was well trained, and we all knew what the other instructor was teaching so that made it easy, and we always gave classes to the team when we were on so down time and stayed up on all new changes that came up. The most enjoyable part was the end of training doing the AARs (after Action Reviews) with the soldier and hear all of the great comments that they thank the team for the great training that we have given them."

The most enjoyable thing about the job was the environment and fun co-workers."
good,"I worked for General Dynamics for 13 1/2 years. It was the best company that I have ever worked for. If I could find a position with them close to my home, I would go back to them immediately! If you have a chance to be part of the General Dynamics Team, I would highly recommend it!"

The hardest part of the job was telling clients the even though they were unemployed, they still had to resolve their student loan issues to prevent further collection consequences.

The sign in is fast and easy and allows a few moments to breathe before diving in to the workload which is about 70+ inbound calls a day. Management is friendly and easy to talk to.
