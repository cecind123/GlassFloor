rating,review
bad,The culture at PCC is insane and not worth the money. They do not believe in safety or work life balance. The upper managers at PCC push constantly but do not do their due diligence to ensure either proper training or a mentor to help train their newer team members.
bad,A handful of favoritism and bullying. Supervisor’s handing out positions left and right to those who shouldn’t or don’t deserve to be in charge. Abuse of power.
bad,Poorly managed lazy sloppy work environment. Manufacturing equipment is old and broken ceilings are caving in electrical was put in somewhere in the 1890s to 1920s.  The Union run maintenance teams have no interest in keeping anything running they're trying to milk the company. Most of them baby boomers who have their retirement in don't care about the future the company.
bad,The supervisors are horrid. They are lazy! You shouldnt employ supervisors who dont know how to be active in their own location. My supervisor was the worst. Allowed certain harrassment. He also was the person to do most of the harassing.
bad,"This company doesn’t even deserve one star ratings. I would give them zeros but I had to put at least one. Run very fast from this place. It’s stressful, too many hours, low pay, management is HORRIBLE and there’s definitely some discrimination going on in the company."
bad,"The worst place you can work. Lack of competent supervisors and managers. The only engineer is bad at what he does and doesn't keep buyers happy. Boeing is extremely displeased and it's a matter of time until they outsource their work from this company. Work here if you'd like a dead end job, there is a reason this place is a revolving door for its employees."
bad,If u r rat then u will grow here . All ways kissing plant manager then u will get raise and u will grow other wise find something else where people respect your work not u bend down.
bad,"So I worked in the melt department, I was ok at first. But then I felt uncomfortable working in that department, asked to be moved to another department. They said no, wouldn't even work with me., horrible people. I honestly just stayed there till I found something else. If you do end up working here, STAY AWAY FROM THE MELT DEPARTMENT!"
bad,this place is not good they hire alot of people there. then they lay them off in 3 months. even if u get hired on after temp. they will lay u off in a snap.
bad,"Don't work here. Your health and well being aren't worth it. The old timer cliques will practically haze you, upper management will not honor promises of training or advancement, meanwhile lower management will bully you about any time taken off, even unpaid with a Dr. note. Nepotism is rampant and the blame game is a favorite of all the machinists."
bad,"Poor management un educated, racist arrogant philiphinos and Mexicans "
bad,"PCC is the worst place I have ever been employed. The management and Leadership is a joke and non-exsitant. "
bad,"Stay far far away if you are under the age of 50. "
bad,"Unrealistic goals,  Micro-manage, Lack of tool support ,  Just a number!,  Family/Health DONT matter.  Long work hours.  Forced overtime.  HR department is nothing more than a police state!"
bad,Steer clear of this company it is a career killer. Very abusive management. Especially the Quality Manager. No help from Human Resources when wanting to file a complaint. The management is verbally abusive and I don’t know how they are able to continue to function like this. This is one of the worst working experiences I have ever had. Those still working there find another job and run like I did . This management and HR needs to be reported for abuse.
bad,They have managers who don't care.. A nite shift supervisor who drinks with other employees.Some people there don't speak English and can't read blueprints..let alone work instructions.The pay sucks!!  They just don't care about their employees.
bad,boss is crazy doesn't pay well at all cant have anyone work there longer then 2yrs so he doesn't have to paymore thinks Walmart cartshoppers are more qualified then the workers there
bad,"Worst place I have ever seen for work culture and management support and effective leadership"
bad,"Ever wondered what it's like to be hired for office work (accounting, IT, etc) and be told to work on the floor? "
bad,"They don't train you, and they set you up for failure. And the management is the worst management I've ever had. Horrible the way they do things.Youll see when and if you get hired"
bad,"Co-workers are tired of the managements lack of appreciation of effort. This is a great example of the saying ""The beatings will continue until moral improves"" I recommend this as a great place to get started but don't spend much time."
bad,You will be expected to work manditory weekends and then be sent home for lack of work in the first part of the week so that you're working seven days a week and getting little to no overtime pay. Management is comprised of people that are willing to do anything to make the company look as good as possible while doing little to nothing for the employees. I learned that if your a big enough company and you pay enough in taxes to a state that you can get away with just about anything and only get a slap on the hand. The environment is unsafe most of the time and as long as you can put out work it's okay.
bad,The line walks were very stressful and managers would think nothing of  swearing at you or degrading you. HR had no problem with it. HR was there for several of the line walks and they had no problem watching supervisors be yelled at or cursed at.
bad,"Back in the day, it used to be an awesome company to work for. As it changed hands, so did the atmosphere,  job placement and respect for the employees, especially if you are not related. It seems now that they only hire from within from current employees family (of certain ethnicity). My boss is racially biased when it comes to hiring. He only asks certain employees if they know of anyone that might like to work there. Run the other way even though the money is temping."
bad,"Have you always wanted to work for a company that will take advantage of everything you have to offer and then throw you out? How about a company that does not care about the quality of their products? Do you like manufacturing and not having to worry about quality standards? Maybe you like the challenge of making turds look like desserts knowing that at some point they are going to be exposed.......if you said yes to any or all of the above, give PCC a try!!!"
bad,"They have zero empathy for any worker, they will lay you off with no advanced notice. then call you back when its convenient. work/life balance is not in there vocabulary. it has greedy corporate culture."
bad,Constantly pushing for more production. Management is very negative. expect you to be there 7 days a week. No work/life balance Would be a good place to work if it was better managed
bad,"Was told I would be management/ supervisor of an area until the bosses brother needed a job, the guy messed parts up right and left, "
bad,Management sucks from the general manager to the human resources. If you have problems or concerns don't bring them up nothing will get done. Your nothing but a number to them.
bad,"Toxic work environment devoid of any teamwork to get to the desired results.  Productivity is number one at this company, they will not let you forget that either.  Cheesy mottos are thrown around in a poor effort to get you to work harder for a never ending target.  Two words sum up this location....stay away!!!"
bad,Little innovation at the Groton plant.  Cut throat management style and no investment plans to replace the 60 year old machinery.  No safety culture despite risky environment.  Employees get hurt frequently
bad,"This is a tough place to be. Demands are high and they keep on changing, even if you meet your goals and targets. "
bad,"The company provided a good paycheck and great benefits."
bad,The fumes from the processes burned my eyes and made it hard to breathe. A man died a horrible death while I was there and others were hurt. The men in the area really didn't like women doing the work there and made several comments to that effect. 911 came along and most of us were laid off.
bad,Corporate Officers lack people and leadership skills.  They should focus more on mentoring and coaching rather than consistently demanding unachievable goals.
bad,Worked as an Inventory Auditor expeditor. The worst group of people to work for. They take advantage of the company by not working hard/at all and receiving a decent pay for it. Break company policies. Lead and supervisor had no idea how to manage a warehouse. Very stressful and toxic environment. Nepotism in this department. You cant trust the team.
bad,"Don’t work at PCC speaking from an engineer. Bad culture, don’t care about safety, don’t care about engineers, don’t care about development. Often encourage bullying"
bad,Great pay and benefits if your willing to put up with the revolving door of management that don't know what your doing but continue to tell you your doing wrong.
bad,"They pay well but supervision and management are clueless on how to manufacture parts efficiently. They go by massaged information on production then have unqualified supervision direct parts on the floor. Having a degree is nice but they have ZERO hands-on experience with what they're in charge of. Despite this, the people on the floor still manage to do the right thing to ship parts but are also looking over their shoulder constantly because of the hostile work environment generated by management."
bad,Corporate Officers need some sensitivity training.  Managers are treated poorly.  Often required to work seven days a week.  Profanity is a norm during management meeting.
bad,"I worked for their R&D branch in West Virginia. Do yourself a favor, stay far, far away. The boss expected me to go in at all hours of the night, for 30-60 minutes, and was then upset about why I did not come in on time the next day. Seriously mortifying, he did not even want to give me overtime for it. What a horrible experience. I cannot speak to other plants across the country, but avoid this one like the plague. It is the least profitable of all of the plants, and when you're there it truly shows. No one cares to fix anything, they just want the books to look good. Seriously, look elsewhere. You're better than this."
bad,I had never seen a more poorly run department with apathetic workers. Tickets languish for months. I was ashamed to be affiliated with the department.
bad,Good security job for a student or someone who likes to read. Mostly lock ups and unlocks of buildings and call for service being new name tag needed to be made or jump starts.
bad,"Fire-fighting all day long with no organizational process. CNC machines are old, out-dated and cannot meet specifications.All orders are late! Top management does not know how to resolve issues since there is no production plan... just which order is the latest"
bad,"they moved me from the east coast lied about the money, hrs i jumped thru hoops for this job, and in the end laid off due to lack of training on their end.."
bad,"They schedule shipments before product is ready then"
bad,You're overworked and underpaid. There's no opportunity to advance your career and management could careless because they're getting paid well. Training for your job is nonexistent. You have to use your pto for sick leave which is ridiculous.
bad,"Decisions are made according to policies and procedures.  Then management ignores them if someone yells loud enough.  "
bad,It's all family so if your not with the family you'll be out the door in a drop if a hat an if you voice an opinion about the way job is going you can be out of the door you're working on pins an needles
bad,"It go's without saying I learned a lot at PCC. In all aspects of manufacturing from inspection to processing but, unreasonable goals handed down from management. That has no clue or care of the process. Put a great amount of stress on supervision and the work force."
bad,The management sucks. They are money hungry and  will do anything. Revolving door. No one wants to stay there and look for the next job. I’m surprised buffet didn’t sell this place
bad,"Has the potential to be a great employer, but a legacy toxic work environment prevails and perpetuates. Hard to move up. Impossible career progression unless you have been through their management development program."
bad,"Decisions made on the whims of the HR manager and GM. Incompetent or actively trying to run the plant into the ground. No regard for anyone's life outside of work. They should just automate the job completely so they don't have to treat the operators like robots. Push for production had crossed into a unsafe and unreasonable zone. Went to 12 hour shifts to avoid paying doubletime. Used to love working there but it became very hard to have a positive outlook. Go try out CPP instead I'm here now, it's seems like a better environment."
bad,"Worked there for 5 years as a machinist. Long and boring shifts. Management is terrible."
bad,purchased by Berkshire Hathaway in early 2016.  Change is rampant with updating to new methodology.  Business ethics are a serious issue and taken seriously.  Everything else is based on growth and cash flow.
bad,Changing personnel frequently.  Can be difficult to work for.  Good Benefits
bad,"The hardest part of the job was the lack of Integrity, Accountability, Equality, Teamwork, Trust, Respect and Appreciation. I would also say it was the lack of adequate supervision and not having a HR Rep."
bad,I left this company in 2013. It was an impossible culture where expectations are raised and raised literally and purposefully to the point of failure.
bad,"I was only an intern, so I was protected from the worst of the expectations, and expected no benefits. As a bystander, I witnessed overworked engineers, technicians, and supervisors with an upper management that cared only about metrics."
bad,"good pay , is the only thing about this place that is good,  bad management and too many hours . No reliable HR to go too.very poor not a trust worthy place to work."
bad,The IT department needs a lot of work starting from management down. The manager does not care about anyone but himself. If you get any praise for doing a good job and it conflicts with what he things of you he will try to get your fired under false pretenses.
bad,"Horrible management forces all who enter to sign up for impossible metrics which gives management power to control you or threaten your job or get rid of you any time they want."
bad,"PCC, at certain of their sites, has terrible leadership and a poor culture.  I left due to poor work life balance, poor treatment of employees and leadership that makes decisions that put profits before people and customers."
bad,"Management was extremely poor.  Through out a one year time period, 3 department managers were hired then fired.  The workplace was decently safe, with all safety equipment required in all areas.  Getting a day shift schedule for foundry employees was unlikely without 15 years of experience.  The company seemed to put an effort into the employee morale, with a raffles and sometimes free snacks.  Work equipment was generally in poor working order, and constantly broken."
bad,Make great money and some opportunities to move up. This company has a lot to learn about providing a safe work environment for the employees.  Harassment is running ramped in this company and they do not seem to care. They expect supervisor to put in 14hrs-7 days a week and carry a company cell phone you answer 24/7.
bad,The operations team owns everything from quality to cost which makes it difficult if you cannot multitask.  It's a great place to work if you like risk and reward.
bad,"this Job is very difficult and demanding and not well suited for a married person. Learned about six s, theory of constraints, and manufacturing technology. All in all very stressful and fast paced, metrics driven and not for the faint of heart."
bad,"Safety problems, average management, average work place culture, poor pay and benefits, co workers problems, in summers very hot touches 70 degree centigrade"
bad,"Company is stuck in the 80s culture, technology is 10 years behind.  Being a sycophant results in more career advancement than being hard working and smart."
bad,It use to be a great work place with pretty good pay but it went from having 4 supervises to having over 30 within one year and the whole workplace went downhill
bad,"PCC purchased The Timet locations in 2013 and that is when the culture and focus away from quality began. Learning about the plant is amazing. The unfortunate part about working at the Henderson facility is the culture of ""Us against Them"". Departments consistently struggle at odds against each other, and have a hard time with focusing on the common goal of working together. Questionable business practices at times. Management either has a bus to run you over with or a knife to stab you in the back with. Be very careful working here, and by all means CYA."
bad,"You like working overtime? Weekends? This is the place for you!"
bad,It is sad to see a management team do so much damage to a good team.  I truly hope the corporate managers will investigate the effectiveness of their employee relationships.
bad,"Place to expand, grow, and develop if you can do monotonous work. Timed and busy work pace. When job is done, you go home. Lots of overtime and incentive to work overtime."
bad,"Busy"
bad,I was trained to be a Titanium Production Grinder. I learned a lot of useful traits and skills but I ended up leaving because my supervisors for swing shift never helped me through some issues I had.
good,"The CEO can be outspoken and loud at times, so have a thick skin if you apply here.  Varied duties and responsibilities and the job itself is fine.  Just be aware."
good,"policies and operations changed randomly and normally on the whim of a person or group who either do not know the details of the process they are attempting to change, or are simply changing things for what appears to be no reason other then a social/popularity gain."
good,"Worked there for years. Management is always new and rotating from plant to plant, so they never seem to actually learn enough to do anything productive (you know the saying ""a little information is a very dangerous thing"".) Employees are harassed by new management constantly and they fire workers they dislike the most. Then a few months later these new managers are rotated to another plant to wreak havoc there.  Overall the production teams are weakened and production slows while years of working knowledge and skills are lost."
good,Good place to work with new challenges each day. My job is project based and thus some days require long hours and week ends and some don't. Work life balance is fair to good when needed the most.
good,"Work experience here was great to obtain although I would not consider this a please try experience. Overtime I have no problem with but management was very spiteful and employees were leaving all the time due to low pay, strict deadlines, and were not being treated properly or with respect. I did not enjoy working here but didn't have much of a choice being so young with no experience."
good,"Everyone got to work by 5:30 am got there coffee looked to see what they had coming for the day. The Foreman ( Lead ) would come over to us tell us we are in timecard fraud while he is sitting on a forklift smoking and drinking his coffee. Our supervisor did nothing about it. "
good,"Hard to watch company head in wrong direction but there are plenty of opportunities for advancement. I would only recommend working here if you have exceptional drive and patience. But if you are a yes man there also may be a place for you here since the management does not like to be challenged, especially by young, eager, and intelligent workers."
good,"There is little to no communication between management and supervisors."
good,"Supervision at PCC is extremely demanding. You will work 10+ hours days during the week, and most likely work one to two weekends per month. Your bosses will be down your throat to hit your safety and production targets, however at PCC there is opportunity for rapid advancement. You will directly report to the GM everyday and the division president twice a month on average; so there is good vision from upper management. There method is to throw you into the deep-end and see if you swim."
good,9 hour work day is stranded  However the demanded expectations of being available 24 hour 365 on call is not compensated. Ever changing product responsibility makes long term investment in product changes or improvements unlikely.
good,"it started as a good place to work, tell they wanted to close the machine shop to focus there time else where. and leave the machinist high and dry it was very unexpected."
good,"Poor wages, poor bonuses, poor management, you can get away with murder though and still have a job, everyone gets a participation trophy, hard work is not rewarded, terrible yearly cost of living raises which have nothing to do with your actual performance as an employee, slave labor all year round, this plant has been stuck in a rut for many years now and I don't see that changing anytime soon."
good,"PCC is a very challenging environment work in, it is a manufacturing culture through and through. It will require a tough mental capacity and thick skin."
good,"Compensation was pretty good and market strategy was excellent."
good,"The wage was competitive for the type of work. There was a lot of overtime available."
good,"Machine runtime is a big deal to management. Management is always changing, in 6 years I had 6 managers. One manager in particular is the reason I finally quit this place but other than that it is a good place to learn and grow your career. Once you hit a certain point it is dead end as far as learning processes goes."
good,"Safety is number one."
good,"This is a large, sprawling company that is still growing rapidly. It is therefore a chaotic place to work. In my department, promotions are not all based on merit, but on personal relationships and favoritism. There seems to be a fair amount of nepotism in the company generally. However, it is a stable job: I think I could keep working here as long as I cared to."
good,"PCC is a results driven company that expects a lot from its employees. It will compensate for your efforts, but does not take into account work-life balance."
good,"A fast paced production environment. Company is very lax in safety. More money spent on employee injuries and mishaps than on preventative maintenance. Some Supervisors/Leads, cater to or favor employees over others causing some to advance or choose shift times without regard to seniority. Although they have a policy in place regarding seniority, scenarios where they were able to find ways around it that were not ethical."
good,"In the department I worked in,management was very inexperienced in the line of work, there were no shift leads, and they pushed new people still in training to do things they were uncomfortable with, and out of there skill range."
good,A typical workday in the adult life. A place you can work independently. I learned to work with wax and assemble wax patterns.
good,Production driven with little care for employee's needs. Co-workers are generally nice people. There is chance for advancement with schooling paid for by the company.
good,"I have learned that production is a difficult job and sometime the impossible is expected. My leadership was usually helpful, but the only thing that mattered was how much money the company could make. The bar was high and when you reached it the raised the bar higher."
good,This job had potential for me.  Unfortunately I was let of due to lay offs.  It did open the door for me to the steel industry.  It was hands and physical at times but I loved it and went home satisfied.
good,Working at Precision was a interesting experience. Major factory with strict dead lines reading tech cards and safety guidelines for every part worked.
good,"The IGT x-ray department was very fast paced, highly micro managed with poor environmental controls.  Most of the castings over 100 pounds and could not be manipulated efficiently with a hoist."
good,"PCC as a whole is a wonderful company to work for, they bring fourth great ambition and integrity within the ranks to accomplish their goals to reach the next level."
good,"PCC prides itself on being a high pressure company that gets results. This is the best and worst characteristic of the company. "
good,Lots of opportunity to grow with in the aerospace business.  Fast pace production work. Great pay with quarterly bonuses.
good,"While overall Precision Castparts Corp. is a strong company, there is a certain lack of communication between departments and levels of responsibility that could definitely be made more efficient."
good,"Top trainers get you certified fast and start working on aircraft parts in a week. Work is fast paced with a top quality welding. Take notes of parts worked on, weld wire used, advice on part, time taken, supervisor notes, and anything else weird or wrong done by other welders. YOU WILL BE SORRY IF YOU DONT KNOW A ANSWER TO SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO OR DON'T TAKE  INFORMATION. You are responsible for every part you produce until it is scraped. Supervisors watch your every move and ensure you take breaks and lunches on time. Overtime is mandatory most of the time for weekends and can often be taken during the week. One year of work was 10 hours a day  monday- friday with 13 hours on weekends 25 days straight, 63 days straight, 91 days straight and 52 days straight. We had a ton of work and we did great during this time... so they did it again the next half of the year when management promised we would get more time off. Only times off were for celebrated holidays and I was not going to come in to get triple time. Taking advice from co-workers is at your own risk-take advice from trainer. The job is extremely stressful and will take a toll on you and your family if you have one. They hate when you take time off and when your sick. Alway have a doctors note for being sick, you will get dinged for not being at work. The last three years have improved for less mandatory overtime and more weekends, this is not a guarantee and can be taken away. Best part of the job is knowing any aerospace/airline company will accept your welding skills and you get to work on some very"
good,The company worked very fast to move aluminum parts through the entire process. The process was fluid and effective.
good,"A typical day is Assembling wax part. Learned all about alloys and the process of them. Management is Management."
good,If you are part of the Management team you are expendable more so than any other job. They have an outstanding Benefits package but if you are a supervisor your days are numbered from day one
good,"When you first get hired everything is a little bit hard but with time you get the hang of it."
good,"The hardest part of the job is Precision CastParts is a very larger corporation and at the end  of the day you are just a number."
good,If you haven't worked in Aerospace then prepare for allot of Red Tape. This includes simply giving visibility to the Purchasing team on usage of its own materials. The Director made us work up to midnight for Christmas and new years to meet deadlines. The IT department wont allow you run a report on your own information. and any improvements attempted by departments to help themselves will get your hand slapped.
good,Rude employees. Managers/supervisors always favoritize. Never gauranteed the right job and hours. Managers/supervisors seems to not do their jobs. Love the fast paste work.
good,"Dog eat dog, seniority based everything. Great vacation and pay benefits though. The work was pretty simple, but don't expect anybody to help you when you need it."
good,"It is a fine place to work with good benefits and pays quite well for the education and training required for most of the jobs. However, advancing from one station to a better one can be difficult as I myself have been trying to get out of the foundry department and into machining for about 2 years now. I have actually gotten out twice, once into manual machining and the other was CNC. But both times I have been sent back to the Foundry due to a lack of machining work. That was very frustrating for me, especially to have it happen two times."
good,"a typical day at work, to move parts through production using customer speck, to the best of your ability in a timely manner. learning to troubleshoot on a part to part basis."
good,"Working in a foundry is a very loud and dirty environment."
good,The people I worked with were great at helping me learn what I needed to learn. Management on the other hand was short with you and expected you to know everything before they trained you
good,"If you get hired, you’re the last in line to get any kind of raise. I only recommend this places to the electricians fresh out of school only for the experience."
good,"Provide basic maintenance, repair, instillation, cleaning and modification of equipment, facilities and grounds"
good,"At first I really enjoyed working for Precision, I really like the warehouse environment. The only problem I have an the main reason I want to move on from this company is the hours I went from 40 plus to barely 20 because production has halted. I want to find a new job with at least 40 or more hours a week."
good,"Load box truck with parts, deliver parts to other docks within the company, then pick up parts and bring them back. "
good,"Management is backwards, lots of tension and the work environment seems very toxic. Compensation is very unfair, management and HR may have ethics issues on their hands."
good,If you are doing a other teams part like sandblast or F.B.I line and if the other team management has more then two people things and parts can be change and management don't talk to each other.
good,This company manufactures the highest quality aircraft structural parts.Programming these parts is very demanding. The machines are bridge type capable of machining 5 parts at a time.
good,"I learned to grind steel and basic surface defect detection methods using florescent penetrent. What important to know about this company is that it's a manual labor shop. They don't invest anymore than they have to to get the job done, and rely on labor to carry the weight of the workload. This lean management style is common in the manufacturing industries, and an important part of the culture at Precision."
good,very productive work place fast paced steady movement time flew by.
good,While demanding I felt that I was respected and appreciated at Precision Castparts.  I always tried to perform at my optimum for the company and felt the company provided me with opportunities and to manage my businesses.
good,"I have hit a ceiling. Without years of further education, there is no more advancement for me. Even then, I would probably have to take a pay cut from where I am at now. I could possibly make more money in the long run. But it would be a gamble."
good,Work was always available and great people to work around team work and great attitudes a positive work place my rate for this job is 4.0 maybe more thumbs up
good,"I learned more in my time at PCC than anywhere else I have ever worked.  Fast pace, driven culture. Performance based. Not for everyone but great for those that thrive with expectations."
good,A lot of nice people.  Job was not bad and the money was good.  PCC has good management and overtime wasn't required but available.  Oregon was a great state to visit
good,Very busy atmosphere working with several individuals who have performed this job for many years.  These individuals teach me something new every day.  I enjoy working in a high-energy fast paced environment.
good,I learned a lot about social and work dynamics while at this company. I learned how to succeed and continue to work hard and strive toward my goals.
good,"There were many tasks to do at all times. It was a bit chaotic, but it forced things to get done. Great people working there."
good,Difficult environment. Work in a facility and it is difficult to merge cultures since facility was recently aquired
good,If you are looking for a regular 9-5 job this is not the place for you. Just be ready to work in a fast pace environment that pushes for daily results.
good,No review at this time. I worked there over 21 years.  Enough said. I do not choose to write more at this time. It was a fair and friendly company to work for.
good,The job was a good job until I got hurt I put in a work order to get my floor fixed and they did not fix it so I messed up my back and tail bone I was on light duty
good,Decent place to work. Fair share of cronyism and nepotism making it hard to advance into management positions. Pay scale isn't up to par with the market. Was able to learn a lot on the job mostly from excessive overtime and online classes provided by the company. Worth staying if you can come in with a decent pay grade.
good,"A typical day at precision consisted of training modules, inspecting aircraft castings per techcard standards, performing different methods of FPI inspection. Entering data of discontinuities, and reporting defects of different call out sizes. The workplace and culture was a great environment with skilled professionals. Management was easily approachable and highly informative. The commute from Salem to Milwaukie was a negative for me. It was a hour long commute so my job work / life balance was way off, leaving me with limited time after work for other things. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was learning the job. I'm passionate about this industry, I had the best time in NDT school and I know I can preform and enjoy most of the NDT inspection method positions."
good,"I've had a very rewarding career with PCC but am looking to move forward to something new. Throughout my time with the company, I was given plenty of opportunities for growth both personally and professionally."
good,"learned how to work well with different culture of people,they were very supportive and willing to assist and help me in every way.i experienced foundary and ware house work.i learned how to melt metal and shape n mold wax as well as operate a press machine"
good,"A day in the life of IT, a challenging environment driven by the ability to help the business achieve the goals of the organization.  Fast paced, long hours in support of a global organization on the rise."
good,Spend much of my time in meetings reviewing short-term performance to stretch target and working recovery plans to achieve.
good,Loved my coworkes didnt like the layoffs. It was good pay but my shifts were always switched around and with kids that too was hard to deal with.
good,It was a good place where they gave everyone equal opportunity to work there and it was the kind of place where unity can advance quickly if you where determined.
good,"You get out of a position what you put"
good,My experience at PCC was mostly a good one. I looked forward to the challenges of working on some of the biggest and most complicated castings on the planet
good,If you are looking for very fast pace and ALOT of work this is your place. You will work 70 hrs a week. 12 he days and every weekend. It's an awesome job if your life permits that schedule.
good,I learned how to do cycle counts and correct routers if paperwork was wrong. Management wasn't overbearing. They were helpful when issues would come up. They were encouraging on a daily basis. I would say the hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all of the other departments. The most enjoyable part of my job was the co-workers.
good,"You have to be an accountable,self-motivated and strong self supporter to work within the PCC culture.   "
good,PCC lives by a management paradigm called Theory of Constraints. They are very metrics driven so as an employee you will have to prove your worth. If you work hard you will make a lot of money working for the company.
good,Great work environment with an emphasis on creating new and innovated procedures to increase output and maintain a safe and profitable workplace. Change for the more senior employees prooved to be a challenge but once overcame was rewarding for them and the company.
good,I work in a very transient office. I travel a ton. The hardest part is keeping up with work while I am traveling. Advancement is tough in the fast paced environment.
good,"The pay wasn't great starting out but the structured pay raises are worth it (plus, nice benefits). Great co-workers/work environment. I worked in finishing & packaging parts for Merida and it wasn't a bad job at all, just a bad time in my life. The biggest downside is long hours standing or sitting (one or the other), but if you're used to factory work PCC is a great company."
good,"You will have no problem finding something to do. Every day you will be analyzing different problems with parts and processes in the plant. Furthermore, you get to work alongside a lot of intelligent individuals."
good,Was easy stuff but I was able to go out and explore other plants. The people that I worked with were always full of life and made the best out of their situation.
good,Working for this organization was a good experience and would recommend it to anyone who would be interested in working in their particular field of expertise.
good,"A great place to work,  but a bit repetitive. Very easy to become complacent and not progress. Great people and management seems to be improving with listening to employees on the floor about ideas. Team work is becoming more of a part of this company which is great for everyone. This job is definitely a good job to stay at an advance but its also good if you are young and want to be independent but are looking to leave the labor force which IMO is important to do."
good,Great people inside this company. Met some life long friend here. Able to grow and a worker very fast and learn many things. Hope that anyone that works here take everything they can learn.

good,Safety was a priority at all times. Very fast paced work environment but enjoyable to say the least. I learned how to multitask and priortise my daily job duties. Management was great and allowed employees to learn at their own pace. The hardest part of the job was really just retaining all the information and applying it to my job functions each and everyday. I enjoyed everything about my job.
good,Fun and stressful at the same time. Ive learned a ton of new skills working at this place. The more you put in the more you get back from this company.
good,"Good place to work but very physical, PCC is a great job to make some good money for some tough physical work.It has many plants so there is opportunity for transfer for better jobs within the company."

good,"Pay close attention to changes in company policy and you will be fine. I loved working here, I got cross trained at every opportunity and went to other shops when they needed help. I got along very well with co-workers and supervisors, enjoyed my work, and appreciated the option to earn OT when there was work available. The company had potlucks, BBQs, meetings and feedback that kept the culture friendly and made you feel appreciated. Promotions are very possible when you are diligent and do quality work."
good,"My introduction to SOX, they had many tools to make the transistion understandable. PCC is a very good company to work for, benefits are very good."
good,PCC is a great place to work for.  There is tons of overtime and room to grow at the company.  Co-workers were amazing all of them work as a team.

Very aggressive management style; used to be small, friendly place to work; good learning environment; chance to grow with a growing business.  Now it's huge, with plants all over the world, making many different kinds of aerospace, Defense, and Industrial metal products, including forgings, assemblies, etc.  I had a good growth experience there, but would not want to work there now."
good,"Precision Castparts is not for the faint of heart.  You will work hard and have demanding objectives to meet, but you will find it rewarding to have independence to achieve your goals with little management oversight.  There are challenges (much like any company) but at no point would I call it toxic or harassing.  Managers are under constant stress to achieve shipping goals, but you learn to work with them to make the company succeed."

If I got called in during the night shift, then I could finish my 8 hours then and take the rest of the day off.  The managers were mostly very good to work with."

good,"Offers good benefits, a lot of rooms for advancement, though a multi-cultural society people are friendly, a safe place to work and a good retiring place."
good,"Management could use some work but the leads and co workers are great. Fast paced, challenging, and unlimited room for advancement within the company.

good,Every day brought a new interesting challenge and a great feeling of accomplishment when a satisfactory solution was presented. The solution was derived from a coalition of involved parties. Management expressed their appreciation in both monetary and verbal appreciation. The most difficult part of the job was supporting and understanding the variances to the monthly financial plans. I looked forward to every day and how I could contribute to making improvements.
good,"Enjoyed work for the company, when I started there I was making 10$ hr. as a temp. and after a month or so I felt the wage I was making wasn't as competitive as other places where, so I spoke to human resources and they bumped me up to 12$ he. After my probationary period was up I was immediately hired on and bumped up to 15$ had I stayed I would be making well over 20$ most likely. 😊"

good,"I was at PCC SSBO for almost 4 years and one of the best parts about the company (at least the department I was in which was Cleaning) was that if you mentally and physically stand out the sky is the limit. Hard work where I was but PCC pays more than what some of the people there deserve, along with shift differentials and a QCB bonus (every 4 months you receive a bonus, unless on disciplinary punishment through HR, no matter what, whether is 15% of what you grossed in that past 4 months or even just 1%)."

good,"Good company to work for. Paid weely."

good,"An enjoyable workplace with a large base of diverse workers. Opportunities abound if employee shows interest and applies themselves to learning new skills. I started in a basic entry position and through persistence gained skills necessary to operate much more in depth machinery. I learned advanced techniques while being tutored by a qualified trainer. Every day was a welcomed new challenge surrounded by competent and helpful co-workers. The only difficulty i encountered was maintaining the stamina to work all of the overtime hours i wanted to put in. All in all, i enjoyed every aspect of my job. There seemed to always be something new each day to stimulate growth in my skill set."
