rating,review
bad,The position overall was demanding yet enjoyable.  I loved meeting new people from different walks of life. I had several clients at one point. Received little help from management.
bad,"The biggest positive working at BlackRock is the free nespresso, free rice and soyamilk, standing tables, and sometimes flexible working hours in a few specific teams. The downside are many: weak and incompetent leadership, extremly political and often unprofessional leadership style, dinosaur systems, broken processes, weak tools, legacy softwares, legacy codesets, collegaues barely average or below average professionals (there are some nice and friendly staff but the best tends to leave quickly), bad projects, boring actual work, poor reward and recognition for delivering extras, completely missing performance and other incentives to motivate staff long term. Beyond the free soya milk, some basic hygine factors and the superficial and dishonest niceness this place is broken, showing no signs of improvement."
bad,The facilities department was not organized and responsibilities were not clearly defined and always changing.  Direct hires were replaced with a 3rd party management company.
bad,"Budapest is a TIER THREE operations and back office support center for BlackRock. First tiers are New York and London. Second tiers offices are in all other markets where BlackRock does have an active local market presence as an asset manager like Paris, Frankfurt, Singapore, San Francisco, etc"
bad,"I have been working in Blackrock more than 8 years. Blackrock has excellent benefit and vacation days. However, the compensation is terrible, (no increase and cut bonus in the past two years). They become very demanding on performance review and objective setting. It could take you couple days to set up the yearly objectives plus we have to finish our daily jobs. If you are a manger ( the worse) you have to work on your management goals and taking many classes to achieve your objective for the year.  No recognition on your hardworking. The performance review only record your negative feedback. You will feel that you have no value and no recognition in this job."
bad,your average day is 12 hours plus.  everyone there is doing like 3 peoples jobs.  you work hard with no praise.   everyone is resigning because they are burnt out.
bad,"People are typically very unhappy, burned out and leave pretty soon.  The company is very tight with their budget and doesn't pay promised bonuses."
bad,"It was a great and productive company when under the Barclays Global Investors umbrella. Once purchased by BlackRock the culture became competitive, the benefits were reduced, the great management team left or was forced out."
bad,"Black Rock gives you best salary package but dirty Politics by senior Managers. talk about work life balance but  18 hours work."
bad,No work life balance. Unhealthy high stress work environment. Not military friendly or flexible with spouses who are on deployments. Terrible managers!
bad,"Depends on the management - there are excellent managers, however, the Director I had was verbally abusive and retaliatory.   Human Resources will pay you to leave instead of helping to resolve issues."
bad,"Leaders and managers too comfortable in jobs.."
bad,"Too much talk, not enough action.  Very poor leadership, lack of experienced leaders.  Top heavy, unbalanced.  Unable to keep quality workforce."
bad,"Think of it as Goldman Sachs without the bonus. As an analyst you are expect to do all the work, make relatively little money comparing with banks and hedge funds, and the only training you are getting is BlackRock Aladdin, which is not of much use outside of the company."
bad,"Management decisions are made on little information and based on the crisis dujour. The expectation is that work comes before all else and employees are interchangeable, easily replaceable pieces."
bad,"Now called EFAO, the management treat the staff horribly and lie to them. By telling lies an example is being told certain things can't be completed from home only to try and realise that it can indeed be accommodated. This ties into the fact there no flexibility whatsoever even though blackrocks culture is all about flexibility and easy working. BlackRock culture is fantastic but this team does not follow it whatsoever. Worst still senior figureheads know about this problem and turn a blind eye to it. In my time there the whole team left in less than a year. "
bad,"Diversity is lip service only - purely for PR purposes"
bad,Direcao/gerencia despreparada. Excelente local de trabalho. Ambiente hostil de trabalho.
bad,"Managers are allowed to bully the staff. Fund Accounting Oversight team in Edinburgh had only one member of staff last year, everyone else had left in 2018. 2 out of the newly recruited staff have already left in 2019."
bad,"The management and senior management only sees numbers and not the humans. Very toxic culture. I never enjoyed a single day of working at BlackRock."
bad,Experienced professional not afraid to questions. Constantly meets  all deadlines as neeeded.
bad,"If you're a yes person in order to climb the corporate ranks, then this company will be good for you. It will promote those that adhere to the groupthink culture, strict policies and top down goals."
bad,"Although BlackRock is a successful firm, the work requirements of the firm is draconian. Heavy use of back-end manual processing is disguised as automation. Long hours, Socratic training methods and poor leadership.  The firm provides educational opportunities, partial tuition reimbursement, parental leave and paid vacation.  Mobility is severely limited and management hinders mobility."
bad,Few opportunities for advancement. Corporate culture does not support team-work. Senior Management work to ensure profitability. Culture of team-work deteriorated after two mergers.
bad,Would stay away from the finance team. Toxic work environment with little support and every opportunity to throw you under the bus. Little recognition for hard work
bad,"I've done my OJT here and it is good, but when they acquire us to be a regular employee thats when the nightmare starts the did not pay us salary. I think this company is not existing anymore"
bad,"Formerly a sober, fiduciary focused on institutional asset management, now a retail fund company focused on gathering assets and retail flows."
bad,"Overall firm culture can be good, but it is very dependent on the group you are in.  It can vary from employees being content and happy, and others extremely unhappy."
bad,Attrition of great talent and great coworkers due to stuffy management that does not promote from within and people leave to find better career opportunities. Another irony is that management likes to talk about inclusion and diversity all the time but it consists of predominantly caucasian men. Very few women at top levels.
bad,"Highly 'silo'ed work environment"
bad,"Decent pay, good benefits, lousy middle mgmt"
bad,Heirarchical organisation with a high degree of self promotion. As is typical of all organisations built on acquisitions it is heavily driven by the internal politics.
bad,"The daily grind of being an operator at this company took a toll on my family life not to mention, my marriage. Management did not care as long as the job was done."
bad,"BlackRock is a great place to learn how things work in the life of a trade.  It is great for a recent college graduate, but it is not the best place to build a career.  It is very much a ""good ole boy"" culture that focuses on connection over ownership and quality product.  They have a good product because they keep strong performers ""just long enough""."
bad,"1. You are worked like a dog"
bad,"Culture: Rampant culture of entitlement throughout the company. Employees feel like they are entitled to the world and have no personal responsibility for themselves."
bad,"Company good environment to get broad and first-in class exposure to asset management industry and a rigorous work environment. Very poor I&D management with noticeably problematic internal politics that adversely effect junior employees of color, particularly junior black talent."
bad,"No room for career advancement, poor management, long working hours and thus salary is not competitive. Unfairly within teams. Working with many talented people but too competitive for advancement."
bad,Poor work life balance. Expect long hours. Very demanding environment and a general feeling like a small cog in a wheel.
bad,"1er arrived at 8am, change my clothes and prepaid all my things for clean."
bad,"BlackRock is definitely an industry leader with great products, but they have grown too much too fast. Management isn't able to keep up with the changing corporate culture and lacks direction and career development."
bad,"Not a meritocracy. Bad people stay too long and politics reign supreme. Working here doesn't fit the great company reputation. If you're thinking about working here, good luck!"
bad,A good firm overall. Leadership gives the impression of being strained in certain functions. Legacy systems are painful. Processes are not optimal. Good exposure to other groups in and around certain functions.
bad,"A typical work week back when I worked here was 95+ hours... colleagues were hyper competitive and would often try to mess other people up to make themselves look better.  It was a fairly common occurrence to see people go into conference rooms at night (after all directors and MDs left) and just start yelling at each other.  When I ultimately quit, 6 other people on my team also quit within a month of each other and nobody had another job lined up at the time."
bad,"The HR at Blackrock is the worst i have ever seen ib my life. Pay hikes and promotions hardly any scope."
bad,"Work/Life balance is weighted to work. There's always something else needing done, and needing done urgently. Every day requires you to prioritise the workload, and be prepared to change throughout the day"
bad,"They lure you in with the promise of building your own enterprise, you just have to be able to work door to door sales in the hot Florida sun 60 hours a week, plus attend every after work function, and hire and train riff raff hoping theyll do the same to be able to get there."
bad,Lot of work with lot o fun.
bad,People nice to talk to friendly but also very busy and very organized  but it's hard not to get freaked out some times it was a very tuff crowd to please
bad,"Enjoyed my colleagues, but there was no opportunity for advancement on our team. Pay was low for the work that I did.  I was not required to work long hours, but put in long hours because there was a lot of work and I have a strong work ethic. Management is very liberal with no tolerance for differing political opinions - if you are a conservative tread carefully. If you are looking for  good work, reasonable hours, but are willing to take low pay with no real opportunity for advancement, this is the place for you."
bad,"The new office looks very cool, I really wanted to do for the community and when the Budapest office started to grow from 100 to 500 it became a simple SSC with the same ""we are diverse, we are open"" empty mentality because this is not just about participating at the Pride but accepting other opinions, lifestyle and working style as well. I think the upper management was OK but the VP's, people manager's thinking needs to be improved to trust the team and not to micromanage everything. "
bad,"Quality of work is good, direct client facing is there also u interact with people from different culture and domain  which helps in gaining exposure in different markets, but the salary structure is too low. For certain team work life balance is not so good they tend to attend office even on festivals."
bad,"Boring work with no advancement - everyone seems scared of saying anything that will make sr. management angry. Very odd, no creativeness, hence ""risk management""."
good,"Fingerprint background checks for new employees"
good,"Great people to work with, Management works in traditional format of micromanagement. Management is not good with managing expectation and people. Overall great company to work for."
good,"Its a Sweatshop and not a company to be in Silicon Valley."
good,"Once of the fastest growing asset managers in the world.  Strong opportunities for movement within the firm.  However, the pride of having a tremendous corp culture in the past has declined due to the rapid growth and expansion the last 15 yrs."
good,"You'll get to learn a lot, if placed in a good team and profile."
good,Really strict place to work.  I didn't enjoy my time at Blackrock at all.  The managers were decent oeople but the methods in which the invoiced their clients was a little drawn out.
good,"It is not a people organization. Management in India does not have any power and control."
good,"Do not be mistaken by the reputation of the company, at the end of the day, the majority of the people push administrative tasks around, you become a cog, you get desensitized about more interpersonal elements of work culture, and the only value that is placed on you is contingent on your cultural background, monetary means, and the way you speak."
good,"Internally mobility is really good for Analyst and Associate level. Once you get to VP and above, expect challenges moving around."
good,BlackRock provides a dynamic environment full of opportunity. One of the biggest challenges is navigating through an environment that is in a constant state of change.
good,"Use of the ping pong tables is frowned upon by management. Any non work related activity that takes you away from your desk is taboo."
good,Blackrock is a company where everyone die to work but my reason for leaving this company is the team culture. Objective of the team is not matching with my aspiration.
good,"BLK could be a fun place to work but be carful of team placement. when i started i worked on the CRM and loved the job but moved to DIG and it was terrible. horrible leadership , my manager would fall asleep on his desk while asking us to work harder. no work life blance"
good,BlackRock is a place where very clever people work.  Heavily centralized control over the Bay Area offices from its NY headquarters.  Competitive atmosphere.
good,people were cool here but not room for advancement I worked in the mailroom and the guys were great but they let me go because of a budget issue. They keep the older employees on because theyre old and they been there forever. Some of the people were very demanding and argumentative. The actual BlackRock employees are all kids fresh out of college and theyre all making more money than you are lol. They used to be catered food every day which was a plus because its free. Its lets you know that race in this country matters and all minorities are systematically suppressed.
good,"Many people leave, you will be challenged but the managers are not always the best. Many of the managers act as their own clique where as analysts are always working really hard."
good,"They are the largest asset management company who deal primarily in fixed income assets."
good,This was a project management work with not enough work to go around the team. Recognition on accomplishments was not great and the work was too low profile.
good,"I was brought in to fill in for a person who was on leave. BackRock had a big tradeshow in the works and needed help with their deliverables. I was responsible for 18 deliverables due in 2 weeks: designed, proofed, edits, design reworks, final approval, then files uploaded to printer. Tradeshow items included backlit panels, PowerPoint master slides, posters, invitations, brochures, promotional items, to name a few."
good,Good company in general but totally lack work life balance.
good,Benefits were good. Culture in various departments did not line up w stated company values. If you played the political game and enjoyed that culture you'd be fine.
good,"It all depends on your luck, what kind of manager you work with. Some are typical India managers with politics and favouritism going on within the team, but there are few good managers as well. If you are reporting directly to onshore, chances are good for your career advancement. Else you are stuck in dirty politics."
good,"While competition is a key part of the work, people generally worked well together and tried to help one another.  The intellectual capabilities of both the team and the firm are impressive and unlike any other place I have worked.  The feeling of being able to do industry changing work and knowing you work for the biggest firm in the field is invigorating.  I started 13 years ago with almost no knowledge of investment management and left as an expert all due to the quality and willingness to help of my peers."
good,"There is a reason the firm is an industry leader, always thinking and planning for the future. The firm is great at identifying gaps in the market and always looking at ways to restructure itself for changing socioeconomic trends."
good,"Long hours, you become an expert in a few things but since its a huge company, still extremely specialized. Management is tough as to be expected, a bit of a stressful atmosphere as most people are unhappy, very lean company, expected to do alot of work. Was good to get it on resume though"
good,"Atmosphere is very comfortable since recently input a few fun activities that are to help with the stress of the job.   the workplace culture is very diverse, the most enjoyable part is the people I met while there I have made many new friends,  the hardest part is the communication between departments as the company is Global and not all departments are US based"
good,"Like most places, your experience is strongly dictated by your manager.  "
good,"Some of the best and worst are employed by this firm.  "
good,"Complex and innovative environment.  Challenging work/life balance. Intelligent, interesting colleagues.  Ability to grow and develop in role.  Need more female representation in senior roles."
good,"There may be different review from different persons but i joined Blackrock as an intern and whatever i feel and  notice that they were completely different from me and whatever i heard from senior member of BlackRock specially HR , but not all the teams are like that, in some teams the members will always co-operate with u if u are fresher and always encourage you  to learn the things."
good,High performance required and expectation to go beyond what is required. Management help you to advance and provide opportunity for growth.
good,Internal mobility is not as widely acceptable as employees are led to believe and promotions are determined by individuals that do not work with the employee directly making it difficult to get promoted at higher levels
good,"Difficult to progress your career if your manager does not go to bat for you. If an employee does not respect the hierarchy, they will not progress. Employees that have someone who will go to bat for them have an advantage. Playing favorites is a benefit in progressing."
good,BlackRock was a great place to work and they had a group of very talented people. Teamwork was not always present but management did try to both motivate and keep people in the know.
good,"I had to start early by 6-7 AM PST and days could be 10-12 hour long. But with good team , we will get productive and get work done.  Sometimes it was a challenge to maintain work life balance."
good,Smart people at the firm. Really need to focus on hiring good lower level management. Need better internal transitioning for employees who don't have family members at the firm.
good,Company was okay. Sales job but the pay was horrible. Managers sold dreams to employees and it wsnt any advancement really available for anyone in the company
good,I compared working at a tech company vs a banking company and the processes and procedures were not stream-lined like they were at Microsoft. Blackrock is located in downtown Seattle and have beautiful offices in Two Union Square.
good,But it is a very strict corporate structure.  Managers are constantly changing and often the managers are less aware then their employees are of processes and procedures.
good,"It is a highly stressful, long hour working place with a lot of communication skill required in the back office. Definitely need better work life balance environment. But you get to work with many talented people in the industry so overall it is a great working experience."
good,"Competitive and hectic, but cohesive culture.  Everyone is motivated and love the fact that BlackRock is constantly innovating.  Employees work hard but are fairly rewarded."
good,"Interesting firm, advancement is encouraged but very unclear as to how to do it. Moving pieces are constant but that's the nature of most jobs. I wish there had been more development."
good,"Friendly workplace environment."
good,"Nice place to work. Most people are very friendly and some positions have flexible hours. "
good,I have leaned how to do team work. I learnt how to complete our job in time limits. There are few social events on weekends which provides us the more opportunity to interact with cross functional team members.
good,"Full administrative support, calendar management, meeting coordination, expense reporting and travel for 3 executives & a team of 45."
good,"Loads of work to be done, so you'll stay busy at all times"
good,"The job has a lot of purely operational work, which is tedious and does not teach you much about finance. The pay is really not competitive given the long hours"
good,"*average benefits, average pay"
good,"Flexible environment, good finance knowledge and work life balance. Good facilities"
good,"fairly large and sophisticated office culture. It is a very large institute with many layers of management. From where I can see, there was some culture difference between SF and NY offices."
good,OK place to work. Little understanding of error. You need to get everything right. You are expected to work with no lunch unless you are a star on the team.
good,Some teams are great in ops others have under-qualified managers leading to micro management and tough work environments.  Overall great culture and benefits but very cyclical depending on the team and needs more flexibility if expect team members to work extra long hours on specific business days such as shorter days on non month/quarter end days.
good,"Overall decent company to work for depending on the area. Job Work/Life Balance - good, Compensation/Benefits - good, Job Security/Advancement - average, Management - average"
good,"The underlying objective of the firm is to do more with less, replacing seasoned employees with less experienced (cheaper) hires and building out offshore staff.  Employees are constantly looking over their shoulders and saying only what management wants to hear."
good,A fintech company. Creates softwares for in house use and for other clients. Provides perks and benefits. Overall a great work culture and experience.
good,"Pro: If you are interested in Asset Management it is a good place to work. "
good,"It is a great company, with a great employees and employers. Some of the co-workers are nice, they are always there to assist you with any work related problems if you are in need of help."
good,this company is incredibly successful and there are a lot of perks that come with such a company - as admin staff this would be a very good place to work
good,"This firm is a product of multiple acquisitions over a short period of time, therefore there is an increasingly political culture with continual culling through selective RIFs."
good,"The company has great benefits. And has good opportunities. They throw awesome parties. However, the work load so high that the work life balance is very poor."
good,Everything takes forever.  Resourcefulness and DIY attitude are not appreciated.  Politics and face time are the key ingredients to promotion.
good,"Nice company, something to learn for everybody."
good,"My work load was continual from 7:30 AM to 5:30 PM with very little if any down time. Lots of meetings and increased workloads due to mergers and acquisitions but without adding staff or redeploying staff in critical areas. Still with very junior staff and at times by myself, I was able to perform and excel in my area. The hardest part of the job was to coordinate between the different areas of BLK since it has become very siloed. The experienced co-workers who survived were very professional and excelled at what they did."
good,"I gave a really secure long standing career to come to blackrock .  It didn't take long for me to realise the team I was in had problems as 3 out of the 4 staff had resigned within the first two months of the year so I was one of 3 new staff out of 4.  The training was poor and the derogatory way staff were allowed to talk to the newer team members was horrific. Che manager would slag off staff and talk about staff to other team members. All told my experience of Blackrock was horrendous or the Nav Oversight team.  The only advice I can give people is this is a good company to,work for but if you want bullied and demoralised join the nav team."
good,"Certain teams could be great, but it really depends. Hours can be stressful and long at times. Little flexibility to work remote and be connected."
good,"Overall good experience, job security, supportive management and other support departments. good career opportunities"
good,BlackRock is generally a nice place to get lots of exposure to the asset management world since it has lots of different divisions focusing on different things. The culture is nice with lots of corporate activities. But the pay for juniors is definitely at the lower end of the industry. The company offers a good work life balance but also lacks vigor in the atmosphere.
good,Great opportunity to learn about the financial industry and markets.  Heavy daily workload for projects due in vary timely manner.  Great coaching from management and assistance with various modeling and sales and marketing operations.
good,"Like everything, there are pros and cons.  I have learned a lot and have met some wonderful people, who are now also my friends."
good,Big Firm with limited growth. Big firm that is still relying on excel spreadsheets and manually processes. Hierchary is still very important and office politics is very important/
good,Hard to advance in company. People are generally very kind.
good,"And functions as such.  Great place to learn from smart people who truly care about their clients, but it can be limiting due to the scale of the organization, which inherently introduces more bureaucratic restrictions."
good,"IT service Management, Sevice Delivery, Service Support, Windows, Active Directory, Exchange, MCP, ITIL, CCNA routing & Switching, Information Security, Server 2003"
good,fast paced work environment was responsible for dealing with corporate actions which required communication and coordination with different groups within the company. As corp actions are deadline intensive there was never a boring day at work
good,I like the company. My managers are nice. I have been able to enhance my excel skills with all the project I'm currently working on.
good,good work environment and people. Various accounts to work within the company.
good,"Interesting and varied projects in a global setting with experience colleagues. Development teams cover portfolio management, trading and operations for the Aladdin trading platform"
good,"great name, people aren't as friendly as other firms, decent work life balance"
good,People at BlackRock are hard working. The compensation is good but the hours are long and extremely demanding.
good,- Daily work is intense and a lot time need to work under pressure and deal with many issues at the same time
good,I would like to position myself with a company who focuses on their employees for career development and advancement. Also working with a company that challenges their employees everyday.
good,"A hard working, intellectually challenging environment. You're part of a mighty global machine."
good,"Due to turnover, creates an environment of chaos.  Whole firm does not operate like this, so it depends upon the department you are in.  They neglect support staff and expect them to support too many people whose expectations aren’t managed.  You are expected to be on call, 24/7."
good,"BlackRock is a growing innovative firm with many opportunities for young professionals. Daily duties depend on the team however on the technology side, you work very closely with all of the support operational teams. The environment is very relaxed and learning Aladdin will take up most of your day no matter what team you are in."
good,"Good knowledge sharing platforms "
good,"YOU ARE TIED DOWN TO A HEADSET ALL DAY, Call Center life is horrible "
good,"As a portfolio manager at Blackrock, a typical day at work involves investing client money on a wide mandate of portfolios correctly, and most importantly, managing various dimensions of risk. For me, the most enjoyable part of the job is the exposure to financial markets and news, and the challenging nature of the various tasks. I have learnt a lot on how to manage investments in fast changing market landscapes."
good,Overall it is good experience. The company has very clear direction and has good training program for college graduate.
good,"It all depends on your luck, what kind of manager you work with. Some are typical India managers with politics and favouritism going on within the team, but there are few good managers as well. If you are reporting directly to onshore, chances are good for your career advancement. Else you are stuck in dirty politics."
good,"The firm itself is solid, but there is room for improvement, especially for managers. The technology also needs to be updated."
good,"BLK is a great place to work. The work is challenging and most of the people are great. "
good,"If you like to burn the candle at both ends, this is the company to work for.   "
good,"Happy with the company."
good,"Solid management, great benefits, a little bureaucratic, many interesting career opportunities. Also offers good opportunities for geographic mobility. Overall really like it here."
good,"I work with a highly talented and enthusiastic team."
good,"This review is for the EII business - specifically portfolio engineering"
good,"Really exciting and a fun workplace with good employ management and a employ facilities"
good,"This organization relentlessly strives to innovate. In spite of its size, the firm is impressively agile in detecting emerging trends in the market and adopting changes. Tons of intelligents people is a big plus. I can feel I constantly learn many valuable skill sets through interacting with them."
good,"BlackRock overall as a company is great place to work. Slightly behind on total compensation at the Associate/VP level though. "
good,The company has excellent leaders at the executive level.  The culture is quite fast paced and competitive.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the amount of knowledge you pick up from the people around you.
good,"Depending where do you start, this company can give you a jump start of your career. At least it is becoming more powerful these days. Each one coming to the company will be a small piece of big game. It is certainly innovative in its gene and people here talk about innovations all the time. If you perform well, you will rise fast."
good,"A lot of transactions to handle, review and audit before actual processing."
good,"Great opportunities. A very comfortable place to work. Though the demand for productivity may be high, the firm makes it very comfortable to handle the work requested."
good,They offer work from home which is very much appreciated in 2017. It's a good company to start but not to advance. It's also flexible and the benefits are good
good,"Although BlackRock is a relatively boring, old school financial company they are doing cool things with the vast amounts of data they manage.  They encourage self-starters and are open to new techniques and technologies."
good,Good culture. Sweatshop at times. Sometimes hard to figure out what is going on. Too many people and overlapping duties.
good,"BlackRock is filled with smart, hardworking, and nice people.  I took advantage of the internal mobility program and was able to get a wide range of experience."
good,"I would have stayed longer, but needed a full time perm position and that wasn't an option at 6 months. I enjoyed the work culture, as other EAs were extremely helpful and friendly."
good,"Trying hard to be Goldman Sachs. Will not employ anyone who doesn't have an Ivy League education. Nepotisim is rampant. They pay extremely well, that is the only reason employees put up with the terrible management."
good,整体文化不错，但是升迁机会比较小，感觉管理层管理也很有问题。 根据不同的组的文化应该会相差的比较大。
good,"Developed, monitored, tested pre and post trade controls and processes necessary to ensure compliance with all regulatory and client requirement related to mutual fund monitoring, trading and investments, and reporting."
good,Lots of learning.
good,Work type was very enjoyable.
good,"- Employees on the West Coast are disregarded and forgotten, despite almost outnumbering the East Coast headquarters."
good,"As the largest Financial Management company the culture is good. "
good,"There is a lot of opportunity if you work hard, but you have to work very hard. Average days are much longer than the normal 9-5, and breaks are rare. Pay is good, and the work is very fulfilling. I would recommend working here to anyone who wants to hard to advance their career."
good,"Fast-paced environment with strong training programs.  Experience depends on the team you are a part of, as certain managers are stronger than others.  Very political, but to be expected of a large company."
good,Very fast pased and competitive environment but minimal growth opportunities. Senior management played favorites and employee recognition was minimal in the Audit Department. There was some focus was on quality but integrity needed improvements.
good,"Was one of my first jobs out of college. The only real reason I left was there wasn't a ""team"" mentality in the group I worked with. Group lunches were silent, it was only a manager thing. It is a great company to work for, however, there are bottlenecks for advancement."
good,"Blackrock is probably the best place I've worked. Colleagues are ambitious and bright and come from the four corners of the earth. Management is open-minded if you have a strong idea and will back you in its pursuit. Great name recognition, excellent reputation, etc."
good,BlackRock has great people to work for and to work with. It a nice place to work but as with any company they have things that could change.
good,BlackRock was a place where I grew as a human being and friend. I found that I was able to be myself at the company. It made me feel great to know that I was appreciated.
good,BlackRock as a growing organization has achieved a lot until now and is on it ways to achieve greater heights. As a new organization they have the appetite to learn and accept the most productive methods of working
good,"Blackrock is an organisation where you get good quality of work, a great work life balance, good facilities of food, transport, women security, etc. Also, where management takes you concerns seriously and works together for resolution. So far if I am concerned I just found one drawback that it is not a good pay master. Blackrock as zero tolerance for misbehavior. Though you may have to work for extra hours on few occassions but you always have a support from your peers. With respect to culture its a good company to work with compared to others."
good,"You'll learn a lot and be exposed to some of the greatest financial minds in the world. Well worth it."
good,This a great place to work after graduating college. The jobs are fast paced and long hours. The work environment can be enjoyable. There are a lot of social events.
good,"No doubt BlackRock has built a fantastic global business, but if you are not located in NYC and you are a director career advancement and opportunities are extremely limited."
good,"Pro: Benefits include Flexible Timeoff (FTO) and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)"
good,"An amazing company to work with. Good perks and benefits. However, it lacks work life balance. There is a good amount of job security as ling as you prove to be productive to the organisation."
good,Over all my experience at BlackRock has been great. It's a very progressive company that pays strong attention to the impact it makes to it's investors. Cares a ton about employees and employee happiness. Compensation could definitely be better with compensation but they are slowly doing more for us which is great.
good,"Very fast paced work day, little down time."
good,Blackrock - formerly BGI/iShares...some of the smartest people I've ever worked with. Can be a bit clicky but overall a good place to work and forge a career.
good,"Good place to work. The overall quality of people is good. The compensation is above average."
good,"- Good place to work. "
good,"Props"
good,"BlackRock is a great company. With high expectations for increasing the bottom line, you sacrifice your personal life so you can make your boss happy. The choice is yours."
good,bright people - hard to move up but other than that it's a great place to work. Opportunities are slim due to capacity of bright people
good,"Large company with a lot of opportunities and global reach. Lots of smart people with a lot of ideas but company growth created a very ""corporate"" culture."
good,"BlackRock is a great company to work for although the hours are very long, the workload is heavy and expectations are high. They only hire intelligent and talented people and expect them to perform at the highest level."
good,"while working at BlackRock, i have gained immense knowlegde of the OTC product, i am able to enhance my communication skils,  learnt about handelling the critical situations like data not received from the client etc. BLK Co-worker are friendly and helpful enough."
good,"After the merger between BGI and BlackRock, BlackRock is not only the largest asset manager in the world but the place to learn about asset management."
good,Blackrock is a company that has provide me with exceptional work experience and how adapt to every changing customers.
good,One thing I have always admired about BlackRock is the professionalism of its employees and executives.
good,"A typical day of work insists of inputting invoices and accounts payable procedures. Journal entries, reconciliation, managing vendor accounts etc."
good,Manage the overall consolidation process.
good,"• Reported to Director of Acquisitions providing a high level of executive support including schedule management utilizing Outlook, travel arrangements, prepared and submitted expense reports. Prepared and occasionally drafted emails, correspondence and memos. Personal errands."
good,When I worked for Blackrock the pay was known as the golden handcuffs. You wanted to leave but were paid too well. That should sum it up well. Working at Blackrock was frustrating because I felt like there was no hope to advance.
good,Sophisticated system based processes for sophisticated clients. Cares about the relationships.
good,"A solid name, but too big and impersonal. Your experience will generally be narrow, and joining other teams is difficult for junior employees."
good,Blackrock was the stepping stone to my career. They taught me how to work with people and to utilize and expand my analytical skills.
good,"Corporate culture is lacking due to lack of employee retention and career progression could become stagnant. Great perks though like unlimited PTO, great healthcare, and casual dress code."
good,"There are some amazing people who work at this firm who sincerely take a vested interest in helping you become a better you. "
good,"Truly love working at BlackRock, the only downside is working for a manager who does not know how to work with  talent and does not apply the company's culture. Everyone else is extremely sharp and pleasant to work with, very resourceful and willing to find new and innovative ways of finding state of the art solutions to remedy issues or conquer new markets. Hours can be long but that is to be expected. Wish I could work with a different team, then life would be a dream."
good,"Great place to work, although I was a contingent worker, most issues are with the contracted company, not BlackRock themselves. Many employees are contingent workers."
good,"BlackRock is a large and dynamic company and on the whole, find that it has healthy work environment.  I will say that it needs to update it's Procurement strategy within the organization to a greater strategic group vs. the more tactical placement it has to enhance cost containment and business continuity."
good,"Decent work, Not too focused on cost reduction by cutting perks available to employees. Technology is superior as compared to other Financial Institutions.Use various tools for capturing data and logs ."
good,"Good opportunities in the field of technology. Less growth in Business operations. Good work life balance for female employes."
good,"Waiting tables, being kind to customers, and always know the customer is right. Time management making sure appetizers and main entree don't come out at the same time. Bring food out fast so the food is hot and fresh for customer."
good,A good place to start a career but do not expect salary as per industry norms. Work hard party hard but if one thinks of partying please do consider that there will be no savings.
good,"BlackRock is a good company to work for with good benefits. However, it can be difficult to advance one's career. As a with any large company, there is a lot of red tape and politics."
good,"- busy but needn't be as complicated"
good,"Great company with countless benefits, most notably the depth of resources. With operations and exposure to financial markets around the globe, there's no shortage of diversity and opportunity. The company is very supportive of internal mobility providing the ability to gain unique and valuable experience. Intellectual capital is another area of abundance, so for those who are educationally motivated it's a great place to work. "
good,BLK was my first job out of college.  I loved working there.  I do not have any bad memories being there.  The greatest thing about working for BLK is the people and the culture.
good,Good place to work... Very much dynamic professional people. But if you want peace and stablity.. it is not your place
good,Just an amazing company with people who take a personal interest in young interns and help them learn so much about their specific industry.
good,"Good work culture, senior management follows the open door policy. Working hours are manageable however work from home is a privilege and not your right. Compensation is not as per industry standards."
good,"good industry name, smart people, but no more than other firms in Private Equity. business related technology not as impressive as it should be. compensation is not commensurate with the job responsibilities, below market compensation."
good,"I enjoyed my time working here. The staff was like a family. Everyone was eager to help you learn, had a great attitude, and had an interest in making you feel at home."
good,I worked at BlackRock as an intern and it was an overall great experience. Management was very professional and there was many learning opportunities.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Blackrock. Loved my co-workers, and we have all made friends for life. I feel fortunate to have landed a job there as I was given the opportunity to work on a great variety of types of projects. I was given high-visibility projects, and despite what could be a restrictive set of branding guidelines, I was able to create some beautiful work I am proud of. I gained excellent skills and experience there. It is a shame the company let go of its entire West Coast design team. We were a highly talented crew of designers and managers that provided award-winning and inspiring design. Good thing is that we all found work at great places, and I think that is due to the experience we gained and connections we made through our work at Blackrock."
good,"BlackRock is a huge organization with multiple office.  The culture is unique location to location and business to business. Spend time understanding the culture of your specific team, manager, and department before choosing to work here."
good,"Very pleasant culture and work environment, but at heart a New York behemoth. Don't underestimate the hierarchy and titles. Not a place where out-of-the-box new ideas or radical questions are appreciated...unless you are already part of the executive team. That said, it's a great name on the resume and you can get some great experience and good pay if you behave."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work,  however instead of looking at other ways to cut costs, eliminating roles/employees is always first. Stressful work environment at times."
good,"Challenging and rewarding work culture. Although, huge organization but very focused on innovation and growth. I like most part of my job. The only downside is that it could be political at times and could slow down or complicate things."
good,"Blackrock was a good place to work. Despite being the largest investment company in the world, the company really only came together over the last 20 years due to acquisitions. Fast inorganic growth has resulted in the company feeling like a bunch of small companies rather than a large scale asset manager. From an employee standpoint, this makes your role on your sub-teams very important, but also makes it difficult to understand how the various teams fit within the organization. I've had a fruitful career at Blackrock and look forward to identifying other opportunities within its vast structure."
good,BlackRock is a very well structured firm with great benefits and opportunities to grow your career. Work life balance has improved recently with managements push for individuals to work from home when reasonable.
good,"BLK is good company to work, they have very strong culture. Only one issue is job security. You have a continue pressure to perform. Management and facility  is really good like any other BLK office in world."
good,"I finished my career there as a regulatory business analyst assisting the business to create development documentation outlining system requirements and design."
good,I loved the culture of the company. If paired with the right Manager it can be a success. Should be judged off of job performance and being best qualified for the position.
good,"Management care about employee work life balance, with creative ways to improve working hours."
good,"* Great Tools - solid investment in technology."
good,My responsibilities at BlackRock include but not limited to implementing changes on client directed investment strategies and building and maintaining relationships with the sales professionals to ensure the integrity of all client accounts.  At my current job I have the opportunity to work with many different groups.  I have been working closer with our data group to ensure all of the securities are setup probably.
good,"Overall, this is a great company to work for. The compensation and benefits are excellent, including a good 401(k) retirement plan, outstanding medical/dental/vision insurance, and unlimited days off. In addition, the company encourages autonomy. The biggest down side is the long work hours."
good,All my colleagues are nice to work with. My manager is very supportive. A constantly moving environment where people can rotate from one role to another.
good,"Overall good place to work with very talented individuals. What I learned at Black-Rock, allowed me to transition into more Senior roles elsewhere. Great people!"
good,"Job can be hectic at times, but otherwise it is a good Company. Good culture, working environment, international opportunities if you are competent..."
good,"BlackRock is a driven, fast-paced workplace full of intelligent people. Management is on the same page in terms of organizational goals. They are on the cutting edge."
good,There was great company culture and work life balance. There were opportunities to advance your career and grown personally and professional. I would recommend working at this company.
good,"As an intern, they paid me well. Interning in NYC seemed to be a much better experience in regards to learning and having a great time overall at work. In Wilmington, management took forever to dedicate time to train me. They expected me to sit and watch training videos for the first couple of days. You would constantly have to bug them about giving you work."
good,BlackRock is always looking for innovation and focuses on diverse people and thought with a keen eye on mitigating risk. BlackRock always puts the clients first and is sensitive to the client experience.
good,"BlackRock is one of the most respected asset managers in the world and there is a good reason for it."
good,Joined when it was small. Worked there for 12 years as it grew & grew. Intense place to work. Became increasingly bureaucratic and political as time went by. Lost that small company feel (which was inevitable). Would recommend it to all.
good,A company where you get what you put into it.  From IT point of view there has been great investment in the team. Great global company with a great brand
good,"- Open culture"
good,"Blackrock is an awesome company to work with.Work life balance is superb.Managerment is to some extended creative .Colleagues are fun to be with."
good,"At this company you get exposure to the best financial institutions in the world whether working directly for BlackRock, the asset manager or for BlackRock Solutions and their extensive client base.  The work is very demanding but you are offered many opportunities to manage your own projects even if you don't have seniority.  The company has grown a lot over the past decade primarily through acquisitions and many of the people who were responsible for it's early success are gone.  It continues to higher extremely bright and motivated people which is good for people who excel in that type of environment.  The hours can be long and the work is often very stressful."
good,My manager was very ambitious to the point where he rubbed off on me and made me pushed myself harder. It was a good job. I worked in an office that was very big.
good,"Flat organization with innovative thinkers. Management encourages out of the box thinking and independent work. As the firm grows, however, the culture of the company starts to resemble that of large financial institutions."
good,"The best co ever"
good,It is an excellent place to learn culture of American Company as well as exercise skills of team-working and communications.
good,"Great mentorship program. Good place to work with diversity and inclusion being a priority. The hierarchy structure can feel a bit rigid, yet networking within the company is strongly encouraged and lots of inward mobility."
good,"Company offers a good salary and benefits. "
good,"The workload is daunting, but every other Friday we'd have beer cart Friday. The DM would walk around with a cart of snacks and beer and would share with the employees."
good,"A typical day at work involved anticipating needs and assisting by ensuring efficiencies involving, travel arrangements, video and conference room bookings, phone calls, calendar management, transportation needs and expense reporting."
good,"Family Atmosphere- Family comes first, and they strive to make you part of a work family. They truly care about you both professionally and personally. They have very fun work environment and encourage methods of lowering stress levels. Upper management is easy to talk to and receptive to new ideas. They offer lots of perks, they may seem little but they really add up. That Company also ensures that ""training"" is …"
good,"Compensation is better than most companies on average.  Work demands are high, and working over 8 hours a day is common.  This is a professional company that has a dress code to match.  The benefits are wonderful.  Management was not as focused on teamwork as they should be.  Also, management was not as focused on what the responsibilities of the team were until review time."
good,A pleasant company to work for for very busy the entire time I was there. Not very much else to say. This was a temporary position and it was focus on getting the done.
good,"Blackrock is a fast-paced, critical thinking environment.  It does require extensive commitment to the field of Financial Services and tests your strengths and weaknesses in various ways."
good,Market leading services to the Asset Management field.  Strong growth in ETF's  makes the company the largest entity in the market and is trusted financial services company
good,Great insights from global resources.  Very collaborative across departments and good opportunity to gain exposure to different disciplines.  Compensation at more junior levels is largely salary based with lower variable comp based on performance which can be frustrating for high performers.
good,"It is great for somebody who wants a relaxed job. This company is too big for an any big impact by an individual. Definitely high paying though, great if you want a stable family income."
good,"You are surrounded by people who genuinely love what they do. The learning curve is very steep, but your colleagues help you along the way. The culture is very fast-paced."
good,"Good place to start a career, good place to end it. "
good,The firm prides itself of meritocracy but it only works if you're well connected to senior management.  It's working hard on diversity but still needs more progress.
good,"Fast paced, high energy trading floor environment.  Heavy pone coverage, calendar maintenance, travel arrangements and scheduling internal and external meetings."
good,Wonderful company to work for.  Was a contractor and wished I could have stayed longer.  Encouraged to apply for full time position.  Very close department who valued teamwork and independent thinking.
good,I am pretty happy that i am working @BlackRock . lot of interesting problems to work and completed projects within in timeline. lot of scope for growth .
good,It is a good place to work. Everyday I sit behind my desk and do alot of research on companies in order to complete the project assigned for the end of the summer.
good,Working at BlackRock has developed my customer service and training skills.  I have been responsible for fully training the new employees that join the group.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working closer with my group and learning from them.
good,"I am part of the team responsible for supporting and growing BlackRock's $55+ billion dollar separately managed account business. A typical day at work involves a range of activities - from discussing feasibility of new product ideas with senior management to negotiating contracts with institutional gatekeepers. I also coordinate product/platform training for our internal sales team and new hires, collaborate with Marketing on sales initiatives, and work cross-functionally to complete special projects and ad hoc requests as needed."
good,"Fun to be part of a team, Management is good and there are no concerns about growth and payroll. "
good,Company has a strong technology presence which is felt right away. SQL is a must for most roles. Would definitely go back. From what ive seen they don't do the best at keeping up with competitive salary
good,"Very competitive place. Offers new challenges everyday, good learning, although a lot depends on the team & the manager. Workload is quiet high but after getting used to the work one can find worklife balance. Managers have too much power & if someone is stuck with a wrong manager, things would become very difficult"
good,"Exciting place to work, but some people get frustrated with the bureaucracy and pace. We move fast and constantly pivot, so keeping up requires a lot of energy and effort."
good,solid company culture that emphasizes ethics in addition to productivity. CEo has set the standard for the financial services industry by promoting a collegial and thoughtful work environment.
good,"Blackrock is a nice place to work if you want to grow in Fin Tech."
good,"Constant change, fast pace, excellent benefits, BLK is not a bad place to be working for. Not to mention all newest technologies and Blackrock developed Aladdin."
good,"It is a solid job and a lot of extremely intelligent people work at the firm. Trying to move into technology, and shift their culture so culture going through transformation right now."
good,Well respected in the industry. Resources are provided to do well. Opens a lot of doors just having the BlackRock name on your business card and resume.
good,Learned a lot very quickly and was under great management when I was there. For someone looking to get into finance this is a very good place to be. Overall a great experience.
good,"BlackRock is a collaborative, dynamic, and excellent asset management company. There are many intelligent and friendly people and a management with a clear vision and good understanding of its problems. I am somewhat worried that BlackRock, like other major financial firms, is not adapting its bloated management structure and outdated technology practices and tools quickly enough to compete with newage fintech firms over the long run, but the jury is still out on that case. Definitely a place to consider if you are more in the traditional finance role, but working in tech may be frustrating and unfulfilling."
good,"BlackRock is heavily saturated with talented people in key positions. However, there's always room for more, You'll need to log in the extra hours, develop skills outside of your role and make it known you're looking to contribute extra to advance."
good,"work/life balance is good at blackrock - hours are manageable compared to the kind of jobs you'll have at investment banks (but of course comes with lower pay and bonus also). I'd say it's a good place - with structured training and great platform - to launch your career for fresh graduates. But for me, upside is limited moving up (unless you become a portfolio manager) and at VP level I think pay is significantly lower than alternatives in the industry."
good,"The culture is very collaborative and new ideas / initiatives are encouraged. The colleagues are very talented and helpful to work with, and the management very supportive."
good,"Its a Fintech company, the biggest in the world . Make your mark , work hard and know when to push for a raise and advancement. They are relocating to an amazing location on 34th and 11th in 5 years"
good,a great place to learn about the business - smart people.  Was able to perform well and receive nice bonuses.  Competitive culture but friendly.  Prestigious firm.
good,"Relatively flat business model with plenty of exposure to interesting projects. Learned a lot about different financial markets, and a generally competitive atmosphere."
good,"Worked with Barclays Global Investors i.e. before it was taken over by BlackRock. It is a nice place to work, and the people are of above average callibre in general."
good,"strong firm to start in"
good,I had a geat time at BlackRock even though it was in New Jersey. I would recommend trying to be in the New York Office. It was a lot of work but was well worth it. I learned a ton!
good,"awesome place"
good,The environment in BlackRock is good and the people around you help you very much . and the technologies you learnt in blackrock will help you very much in future as well.
good,"Good Company, solid career track "

good,Good challenging work environment. Global leader in investment management offering a wide variety of career paths.
good,"Caso você goste do setor financeiro a BlackRock é uma otima opção no mercado, principalmente por estar crescendo agora no Brasil"
good,"BlackRock is a great company to work for and strives to be the industry leader. While BlackRock has great compensation and benefits and strives to create a culture that coincides with contemporary social environment, unfortunately its dramatic increase in size has created limitations in internal movement and networking. Roles/ operating departments are beginning to become isolate from one another in terms of locations which makes it difficult to network and progress internally."
good,People here are really nice and helpful. Managers motivates you to learn new things and grow. BlackRock is a platform for people who have the zeal of growing.
good,Great company to work for. Top asset management firm that is working hard to say ahead of the curve with all of the changes occurring in the asset management industry.
good,Working in Blackrock has been a good learning so far. There is a lot to learn and to do. Management is helpful and transparent. Good work life balance. Got a chance to work with Middleware technologies and exposure to many new technologies.

The monetary compensation and benefits - including a vast array of supplementary services - are top notch.  Overall, a superior organization."
good,The culture of the firm is good. Management is generally fairly open and runs the team autonomously. The work/life balance is generally pretty good. The company especially invests in analysts in the grad program in terms of development.
good,"BlackRock Internship was a good experience for my start of the career. I learned lot of things, mainly the cultural values and relations between the teams inside the company. Management is very good over here and the company provides lot of services that makes life easier while working in. The hardest part of the job is to tackle the issues in limited amount of the time. The enjoyable part of the job is to learn things from self experience."
good,"The workspace is divided by departments, so each building and floor focuses on a general area of the business. The overall environment is very professional since the clients are looking towards very specific plans for their assets. As an intern, I was well paid and very well treated. It all feels like a team because space is opened rather than having small individual offices/spaces."
good,"I like workplace culture in BlackRock."
good,Awesome  workplace to be at. Values employees and work life balance. Productive and fun environment. Constant upgradation to new technologies. Tech oriented.
good,I interned at Blackrock during my junior year of high school and it was one of the best internships I have ever had. They have a very nice working environment.
good,"Az új iroda 10/10-es. Tágas terek, nagy, állítható magasságú asztalok, dupla szélességű képernyők. Nyugis, új, szép, barátságos. 2018. ősszel adták át."
good,Great people and pay. Strong pay for performance culture. Need better work life balance. Great benefits - both personal and financial wellness
good,"great firm for investors and great for professional staff but they do not support their admin staff in any way"
good,Company is great but a lot depends on the team you are working in. Company give you a good work life balance and is flexible but the manager is the one who gets the final say.
good,"pretty great place to work at,"
good,Fast paced environment  Worked directly with senior finance managers.  Closely related team. Coaching from procurement manager.  Worked for the company three separate times
good,"Intelligent workforce, high demand, great compensation, much is demanded of you and your time, rewarding working environment, majority of management seems responsive to workers input"
good,A great work place with good work culture. I worked here as a contractor and really liked the work environment. People are smart and seem to be given a lot of responsibility.
good,Great company to learn and grow. Alot of travel. Alot of growth potential. Good company to work at. Alot of people....................................
good,"BlackRock has a culture that motivates you to continue to learn, grow and give back. You thrive when you continue to learn, and approach each activity as a challenge for growth."
good,The company is amazing and if you are placed in a group with a good manager you can go far and be very successful. Right now it is a stressful environment in which over 12 hours worked a day is normal and with bad management it doesn't seem work it. I had the unlucky draw of having a bad manager so while Blackrock is great the unit I was apart of was terrible.
good,"I have been working at BlackRock full-time (More than 3 years)"
good,"BlackRock, Inc. is an American global investment management corporation based in New York City. Founded in 1988, initially as a risk management and fixed income institutional asset manager, BlackRock is today the world's largest asset manager with $5.98 trillion in assets under management as of December 2018."
good,Overall BlackRock is a great place to work with a strong track record. The management and directors give you all of the tools and mentoring you need to succeed. I highly recommend this company.
good,This workplace was extremely fast paced and challenging.  Definitely a rewarding working experience and allowed me to grow and develop as a hardworking employee.
good,"Love my Job!  HIGH Demand and at Nitro Pace which never leaves dull moments, but you have to be sharp at all times.  No down time.  Blackrock only thrives off of QUALITY Talent and their salaries prove they only recruit the crème de la crème."
good,BlackRock is a wonderful company to work for. It has a great culture (especially the Princeton office) and hardworking employees.
good,Large company with small company feel. Lots of money and time put into development of employees. Strong collaborative environment. Long hours but rewarding

good,One of my more favorite places to work. Great culture and people. Very well established in the market place. Good place to start your career.

good,Great place to work at. Interesting projects and talented people.
good,Provides great intellectual resources and reputation within the capital markets. provided extensive opportunities to work in different segments of the industry.
good,"BlackRock is a leader in asset management.  A professional environment devoid of harassment.  You need an internal champion to advance. Long days and nights at times to pursue deadlines.  You will work with professionals, but there's more to success than good work product.  Be prepared to navigate the corporate landscape."
good,"My job at Blackrock required almost 24/7 involvement.  I worked with clients who are portfolio managers to analyze their risks.  The system we used was Aladdin, with overnight work being done in India.  The combination of market activities and working with colleagues in India created an exhausting 24/7 work environment.  However, if you have the energy and an interest in investment management, Blackrock is one of the best places to learn."
good,"Long, strenuous hours in extreme heat.  Employees came and went often.  I enjoyed learning about the oil rig, tools, and how to operate heavy machinery."
good,Blackrock was both a fun and engaging work experience. The culture was incredible and advancement was merit based. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with and I would recommend Blackrock to anyone.
good,"Love what the company stands for in helping clients."
good,"You can't ask for a better place to work. The team atmosphere, the collaboration, and the sharing of information from each team member makes each day a true pleasure to work.  The people are the biggest asset, the talent, innovation, and hunger to push the envelop keeps you engaged and wanting to learn at every corner."
good,"BLACKROCK was a spectacular place where I was surrounded by brilliant people who were always very helpful and willing to teach. I worked with a group of people who were educated in anything from accounting & finance to IT. In the 5 years I worked at BLACKROCK, I cultivated an invaluable set of excel skills for which I will be forever indebted to my managers."
good,"BlackRock is an amazing firm to start you career with. Lots of amazing opportunities and highly productive work environment. It is more like an ocean of knowledge, if you have passion - this is the place for you."
good,BlackRock is a clear leading in the Asset Management industry with few true competitors.  They have the best blend of both active and passive strategies in both retail and institutional.
good,"You will learn a ton from a wide array of talented colleagues. Make sure you and your manager are on the same page, as their portrait of you will ultimately decide your success or failure."
good,Have a wonderful team and enjoy coming to work. Recently was laid off due to fee reductions and the volatile marketplace.

good,"Great place to work. Beautiful offices, compensation is above industry standard"
good,Made to feel like you have unlimited time off but in reality its made so that you take less time off a year.  As a whole it is a pretty good environment.
good,"Great learning experience especially as an intern. I was given the opportunity to explore asset management as a whole, which served as a great introduction to the business"
good,"Working at BlackRock requires the ability to adapt to the continuous changes in the market.  During my time at BlackRock my job function within my group has changed multiple times allowing for opportunities to learn new skills and task.  I have learned to be flexible to changes in my job role.  BlackRock holds high expectations of employees and at times may require many hours of extra work to meet clients needs.  It is rewarding and satisfying to see projects launch successfully after all the hard work.  The management structure at BlackRock is flat and you have to be able to work in a group atmosphere, while also working independently.  Work life balance is important at BlackRock and I have always enjoyed having the flexibility to work from home when needed."
good,Work/life balance isn't the best.  DEL location does not get nearly as many perks or compensation for the skilled work done as other locations.  You won't find better people than the ones at BlackRock.
good,if you don't mind door to door sales. its a great opportunity to grow and learn about business. everyone is great. and the bosses no the system and how to teach.
