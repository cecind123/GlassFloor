rating,review
bad,This company is the worst place I have ever worked. It's like working for a cult. Management has no idea what they are doing. Nobody their really speaks english. It is dysfunctional and the job I was hired for I have yet to do.
bad,I'm looking for a new job. Too much going on. Nobody wants to see you move up. They have a lot of favoritism going on. And I feel like we should get 3 brakes. We almost 10 hours a day. And only get 2 brakes.
bad,a supervisor said inappropriate remarks and kept hitting on me and I just kept ignoring it. He realized I wasn’t going for it and got me “laid off”. I recommend no woman works here.
bad,not very good place to work no training for a skilled job they just expect u to come in and know and management was real uptight cuz the plant was doing bad also they randomed people alot for some reason so alot of people get fired
bad,"Very poor place to work "
bad,I learned 3 jobs in 2 weeks and didnt get recognized for it. A mexican that was there as long as me doing only 1 job got a raise in 1 week. They would work harder with each other but not hard at all if you were another race. Worse work experience i ever had. And management was blind to the fact.
bad,Work all the time with no rewards. Promised raises but no one ever got a raise. Said they were going to change but no improvements. Management does not want your opinion.
bad,Supervisor dont talk to you about anything fast paced and not good enough pay i worked there for 2 days busted my butt and when asked to go learn something else they tell you no your good where your at no one speaks english really there its juat down right horrbile
bad,Poor management.  Management holds personal grudges work is not compensated with equal pay yearly raises are very little expected to.work yourself to death for very little pay worse turnover rate I've ever seen. You know it's bad when the plant manager quits and employees with 10+ years quit. Worse please I've ever worked.
bad,Manager rude and racist they pay 9 an hour the only way you can make more is production but you will never make production. Black female work the hardest.
bad,If you are looking at the Orlando location look somewhere else the plant manager is a joke and cheap never gives a raise and your going to do way more out your job title for no extra pay also treats the employees like slaves
bad,"By far hands down the worse place I have worked in 15 years. This place is a waste of time horrible benefits, very low pay and many illegal immigrants"
bad,no review is available for this company since they shut their doors in 2006.  the plant has been closed for over 10 years and the property has been sold
bad,Was hired for full time drove 50 miles one way to get to work to be told only needed for 2 hrs. No training . Learnt the job on my own. Very poor management.
bad,"They tell you your schedule when they hire you and then change it at will"
bad,"They have there favorite people to help out if you do not make the list you are screwed they will not help no one out they do not care about no one but there selves, They promise you one thing and do another"
bad,Plant manager is a idiot I work for universe forest in grand view Texas for 23 years on fork lift on off for long time plant manager try many ways too get rid off me so I just quit
bad,it is a hard and dirt job if u not use to working out side it hot in the summer and it is cold in the winter u have to work in the rain forklift do not have doors
bad,They rather the employees get hurt and move faster. If you take off for a medical reason they give you the tenth degree. If you expect to see your family you wont. Constant over time with long hours.Worked here for a year and glad I left.
bad,Very Racist and sexist.  Be prepared to not be included if you are a minority or women.  Women are kept only as coordinator/admin work.  No advancement for minorities or women.
bad,There is favoritism. They lack confidentiality. There is no teamwork amongst management only the employees. Repetitive unfairness when it comes to salary employees and hourly employees. The pay is according to the clique.
bad,"lead workers and management are very unfair , you must kiss but to keep your job , i'm not like that , will never go back the bosses make the job stress full ,"
bad,I am a man who works hard and takes orders.  I expect that when you say you will pay me a specific amount or tell me to do a specific job that you do not go back on it and try to throw someone under the bus.  This company is nothing but cheats and liars and management knows that they are selling horrible workmanship products to consumers.
bad,The pay is horrible and they want you to work until death. The only thing the company cares about is profit. A good job for someone just starting out
bad,"nothing to say, many Illegals are working here, they are not afraid to tell you they are illegal either. poor management"
bad,"This is the perfect place to work if you enjoy hauling very dangerous oversized loads and receiving very little compensation for it. Look forward to making about 30K/year, and being stressed to the max, just to hear the Big wigs talk about how much profit the company is making. You receive $2/hour for any time spent not driving....waiting on loads, unloading at terrible locations, waiting for customers to make room for product, having tires changed, etc. Oh, and don't show up even 1 minute late, or you lose all your personal leave time for the month....you've been warned!!!"
bad,"Mainly the ""higher ups"" where highly corrupted.  They hired illegal immigrants.  The main thing, loss pay."
bad,"The worst job ever  poor management , Nothing is organized at the Granger plant . very inexperienced stupervisors"
bad,Worked as a forklift operator on night shift. No management during that shift. My coworkers and coworkers on other shifts were the laziest people I've ever met in my life. Would try and fight you or threaten you if you said anything about it. Sleep on their shifts and always had to pick up their slack. Pay was low for the position. Always had to pick up other peoples messes in the yard. No help if you needed it.  Stay far away. Most of the people  working there were convicted felons
bad,"Good ol' boys club, and very racist towards minority.  I worked in the office among all the purchasers. Day involved paying vendors and reviewing documentation.  The stock option was the only good option."
bad,Working for universal was supposed to be an enjoyable outdoor job but turned in to an accident waiting to happen atmosphere. You are expected to unload rail cars of 24 foot lumber on a three teir boom forklift at maximum height  over rough terrain putting yours and others lives in danger. Was fired for refusing to do this same thing.
bad,"Was lied to about pay. Had I known the truth I wouldn't even have gone to the interview.  Was told in person that if I did a great job I might get a 25 cent raise in a year or so. Clearly they have no real pay scale."
bad,"lead workers and management are very unfair , most all of management was very egotistical,rude and unfair i experienced a lot of reverse prejudiced and if you did not kiss but then you was let go needless to say i do not work their anymore"
bad,i have nothing positive to say about my time at upfi.  I am not a fan of the upper management.  I no longer hold any company stock.  I would never consider working for them again.
bad,"They hire anyone, literally. Upon hire with promises of advancement, shift change and total lack of following through and among the biggest form of favouritism I've seen on a job site. But if you can keep your head down and take whatever, great place to work; if you like to feel under valued, under paid and told to work 2 peoples job. Always told you can do better, produce more, and any complaints, even with an ""open door"" policy, get swept under the rug, or having something thrown in your face to pass off behavior, or the mild threat of being fired is passed around. As well as the lack of consistency with what is passable in quality of wood and varying requirements of tolerable machine measurements."
bad,"Work environment dirty, other employees were not pleasent to work with. played bad music. dreaded going to work every day. pay wasnt great, but got bonuses. this is not a place you want to spend your life."
bad,Just a terrible place to work other than something to get you by till you can find a real job. The pay is absolutely disgusting. The bonuses help a little if you get them. That is left up to the supervisor which in most cases has a couple people they'll take care of and everyone else is disposable and undeserving. Management is worried about nothing but numbers. They preach safety and being a family but if that were my family I would disown them. And safety only matters when they can reprimand someone and make a fool of them. So if you're a pure suck up yes man and like low pay for long hours of miserable work and you don't need much in the line of insurance then this is the place for you.
bad,Was hired as a lift driver. Came in and was put to non-stop fast paced lumber stacking for way less pay than what was discussed. Found out most there were lied to about pay and position. Walked out.
bad,"fill orders, take orders, change orders, and package orders"
bad,horrorable work place. i have a breathing issue which were my reason for leaving. management was one of the nicer group of people in the plant. they have a safety team.
bad,"Started out as a good job. But, when I moved up to a better position with the raise of $.25 was a joke. The Management worked together, to get them where they wanted to be. If you work here to pay your bills and do not get involved in the drama or chaos (that they cover really well from corporate)...you are doomed. H.R. did not even take care of my maternity leave. So, I had to get that taken care of myself, from home. Management would tell me how to do things ""their way"" and not the company's, not knowing I would listen and in the end that Manager would find a way for me to get in trouble. Watch your back with ALL Managers...they do not care about you or your career!"
bad,Typical work day 0600 to 1400.What I learned is that the company never made any money since about 2008.They had some people that had all the answers but the one answer they did not have was how to make money.They would not even listen to constructive suggestions.I think that was probally the hardest part and knowing from 40 years plus of doing that same job that it was wasted time.I really thought that I could really help these guys out but soon learned different.The coworker part we had one person that really worked hard and did a great job but needed more direction from her boss.We had 2 other people one was new and one was well taking up space.The enjoyable part of the job was knowing you won a job but as time went on I found out they did not make any money.
bad,Was paid $3 less then others doing same amount work.NO respect to women OR BATHROOM.used a porterjon in 110 degrees.GROSS! had a disability and was told they would honor some things BUT didn't.. EXPECTED TOO MUCH for lil pay. And only allowed 2. 10 min breaks. Not 15 like rest employees.. Double standards
bad,management is less than educated and in turn will no look out for your safety. All this company cares about is money and none at all about the employees even though they say they do. you will not get a raise and you better now how to speak spanish.
bad,Floor supervisors know nothing about nothing cant ask them for no help have to go find another employee to help you overtime everyday n every Saturday they dont ask you to stay they tell you your staying i was on cnc never got training basically they handed me paper work n said run it everything they say in ordination is a lie its a joke to work there
bad,The training program was 70% hazing and 30% training. While I tried to approach management about more training they just told me to continue to work on the floor in a job that did nothing to advance my knowledge of my future job.
bad,"They treat there employees like slaves . I specifically remember a few older gentleman who had worked there they had worked them almost to death litteraly not figuratively and they do the same to every single employee. There is not a single bit of room to advance in the company and they expect you to work long outrageous hours to compensate for there on screw ups. The office people have no clue how any of the mill works at all. The place threatened to fire me because I took a religious holiday off . Poor management and no organization, horrible pay . A soyers pay rate is $15 an hour but they are to cheap to pay that so laborers are made soyers with out the title to save money. All.in all worse place to work.  Place should be condemned. DO NOT APPLY HERE YOU WILL REGRET IT TRUST ME  I DID"
bad,They ask too much out of their employees for what they pay and their management is clueless.  If u get hurt doing what they ask their doctor works for them.  Not you.  And they will most likely fire you after ur let off light duty
bad,"Not good environment to work there, some people that work see you  don't try to said hello and only to group in the circle.So why go to work and feel stupid working there. You be sitting next to them and it's like if are not there."
bad,I was terminated for the lack of management they allowed the safety director to administer my urine analysis when he had never done it before he dropped it spilled it and couldnt activate it so by the time someone figured it out my urine was not body temp therefore giving a false positive for a drug ive never used I requested to take a new one then and there but was denied and fired on the spot after 3 years of giving 15 hours to get orders done there is no respect there its money over safety and wellness of employees
bad,Horrible management I had a supervisor that did not care about the employees. They want you to work extra for those that didn't. The pay was minimum. No one really cares about the employee's safety.
bad,no team work. heavy lifting. travel is almost too far. Benefits are poor. Bonuses offered but not received. Management is poor. Attitudes are poor. unfriendly work enviornment
bad,there is a higher level of racism in the company.  we work more than they pay us.  usually they don't think about employee advancement. They just think about themselves
bad,This place is just horrible to work for. No one speaks English. If you don't speak Spanish you will not have a good time. Any English speaking new hires leave or get fired. Hours suck. Pay sucks. Working conditions suck. Would not recommend. Ever.
bad,I had gotten very sick and all the drs including the specialist had me off work til I was better. I did every thing that was asked from them while I was off and did soooo much for that company before I got sick and they terminated me and my insurance before I could get better so I had to pay anb insurance out of my pocket to get better. I literally was prepared to give a lot of years of my life to this company I given so many ideas that were implemented and helped production. I was on constant appraisal and even talked about full supervision of a division but as soon as I wasn't physically able to do those things they forgot about me and just fired me like I was just nothing to them and I took that to heart
bad,Well the pay they promise you will more then likely never get the bosses want to push you like slaves I broke multiple records for that company and basicly after the first time showing them I could do something like that a normal days work was never exepted again I spent most of my time there I spent helping ppl they never bothered to teach or getting yelled at for not over producing I wouldnt reco end any one to ever work there and I know several other ppl that will say the same
bad,"A la empresa le falta capacitar y entrenar a sus trabajadores de manera adecuada, tanto como en seguridad personal como en el manejo de maquinaria."
bad,"Very long hours, could not afford healthcare, lack in management, overtime was expected not optional, always loosing employees, short breaks and rushed through."
bad,Focus was all on rapid paced growth and unrealistic goals. Middle management focused on themselves and did not promote team concepts that lead to wasted time and energy and burning great employees out.
bad,"A typical day here usually includes being screamed at by a boss and called many insults after the division before you sends the wrong lumber, I learned how to drive a forklift and how to control my temper while being constantly badgered. The bosses are negative, rude and unfair around 90% of the time. Some days they can be nice. The workplace is very stressful and can be extremely cold. The hardest part is keeping up all the responsibilities that you take are which ARE NOT reflected in your pay. The most enjoyable part for me was working with the few decent coworkers I had until they were fired. Employees are disposable. Something very small WILL BE MADE A HUGE DEAL."
bad,"You will work hard and learn new skills, but unless you are in the good old boys club forget about continuing up the corporate ladder. Family values are pushed during the recruitment process and that is the only tome that it is ever mentioned again. Sort of like prison culture, trust no one and only look out for yourself."
bad,Protudes was feat not time to tlak. Afret 8 hour work going to 2 more hour overtime do not give you a 10 min beark. not give people rise east give food.
bad,This job is underpaid for the kind of work that is being done. Management is very poor and the communication is terrible between Management. I would give this one out of five stars.
bad,Overall the employee's at UFP Chandler are great. But the plant management uses their position of influence to instill fear and intimidate  employee's
bad,"Company always hired people and fired them in sometimes just in a few days, Weeks or Months for No real reasons. Most people weren't very friendly or helpful. Always afraid something was going to happen."
bad,"Managment is terrible. Don't get paid right for the type of work you do. In the Salina, Ks. Plant the ""boss"" degrades you, cusses at you. Not a boss you want to work for."
bad,"neede to be a multiple job worker, sometimes doing 3 or 4 different jobs at the same time, so multi tasking was needed to keep all jobs straight and get them all finished on time."
bad,"When I started at UFP I had a great manager who was mentoring and interested on personal development of his employees, cross-training, and wanted to promote from with in.  When he was transferred the company brought in a recent college grad with zero experience who did not like the previous culture and felt that if you were not at the same education level as him, you shouldn't be there."
bad,UFP is great for someone looking to build a resume if in a supervisor or higher level position. Advancement opportunities are available but mostly contingent on relationships with management.
bad,"UFP has a lot of opportunities for those willing to put the work in; it has a natural give and take working with operators and assemblers alike. I learned how to take my time and do the job correctly the first time; the work can be repetitive and droll and at times, but if you speak your mind you can be moved to different stations and do different things. Frankly it was not for me and you might not have the same experience if you're willing to give it a shot."
bad,Everyone working there is always super stressed about nothing. They push and push and push until you can’t be pushed anymore. Under new management that sucks and is driving everyone away. Lowest work morale I’ve ever seen anywhere.
bad,"This was a temp to hire receptionist position and I was hired full time after my 3 month temp requirement was completed. I had a very relaxed space and enjoyed coming to work under the conditions I worked in. I was allowed to turn my space into a ergonomically required space which helped me to proper execute my   My fellow employees were fun to work with as we participated in activities outside of the work office. Unfortunately, after 2 years of employment I was one of the few laid off due to, what I was told was, a ""lack of work"". While I enjoyed working here, I felt it unfair to be laid off as I had more than enough work to fulfill as I performed tasks for the entire office from the Executive floor as well as sister offices located throughout the United States."
bad,"Supervised wall panel department. Learned how to build a house inside of a warehouse. very good culture there, very nice workers.the job is very physically demanding."
bad,the manager is unorganized that changes what need to be done regularly. if you make a mistake the manager yells at you several times for the same thing. The lead does not give you you deserved breaks
bad,"Pay is way below sub par,stress way above average,if u like surprises like being told u are working sat/Sunday at 5pm on Friday then this is the job for you.very small business with zero room for growth/advancement.one of the only companies I ever felt overworked and under appreciated.if your ok with spinning your tires and getting no where this might b a good spot for you.."
bad,"Arrive at plant early enough to pretrip, tie down/tarp and drive to delivery point by mandatory 7 am delivery.  I like this part because you were out driving ahead of rush hour on the first run."
bad,Definitely a cutthroat company that makes a lot of promises but lacks leadership to follow through.  The job is very physically demanding and compensation doesn’t live up to it
bad,"Job was OK as long as you did not have mistakes. You can do a thousand things right no one notices, but the first time you make an honest mistake it wipes away all the good. Office administrator was always spreading rumors, bad mouthing minority employees, plant manager manages with eyes closed but ears open to the complainers. Always rewarding bad behavior. Maybe this was just the location don't know if others are run the same."
bad,the sales men and management were disrespectful to the woman that worked there. Could've easily been turned in.
bad,"If you want your days to go quickly,  thtey will keep you busy. Many hours by yourself.  Went several weeks without even seeing my supervisor.  Pay is at or above the industry."
bad,I had fun working with people I enjoyed but the management was terrible. The only good thing about the management was the shift supervisors were fair but the managers really took power to another level
bad,"Each day I have numerous responsibilities. I do HR tasks, like new hire and terminations, benefit elections. I also  have dispatch responsibilities such as keeping up with truck mileage, pick tickets, printing bills. I also key inventory and orders. I am responsible for payables and receivers."
bad,"Expect to work at least 9-10 hours a day in the summer in a hot warehouse. Mandatory overtime during this same time. Saws were fairly straightforward to operate, you just punch the dimensions into the computer and set your wood and the machine pretty much does the rest. Building trusses is where the real money is at, builders are paid piece rate so the more you produce the more you make."
bad,"Management was bad. My floor truss manager could NOT read a tape measure and if he tried to help he made things even more confusing. Superviser for the shift is bipolar and can't help with any question you may have, As well as you being told you were not good enough even if you hit the goals they wanted... I personally was told that I was stuck in my position because there was no moving up, that there was no place to go, but it's a multi million dollar company that's is country wide...."
bad,"I liked working with all the air gun tools, making potato bins.  I learned how to use nail guns, management was mess the could not decide on quality or quantity, the workplace was harsh, I kept to my self.  It was very hard work, my skin would peel of when i took my gloves off due to all the nail gun handling and my clothes were stained from ink they sprayed on the bins.  But I loved playing with air guns and nail guns."
bad,Good for temporary work.  It's hard to get hired on even if you work hard all throughout your term. Slight favoritism.  Lots of hours with overtime being mandatory when asked last minute. Saturdays mandatory when Informed last minute.
bad,Poor atmosphere for advancement.  Management was unclear about what goals need to be accomplished in order to move to the next lever or get raises.  Raises and promotions promised and not followed thru.
bad,Good pay but terrible hours and very hot work conditions. Very stressful as well and care more about the company than the employee.
bad,"working here you can learn alot about your trade. you get alot of hands on experience, however this job requires undivided attention, it can be dangerous."
bad,This company is not woman friendly. They do not support the woman in the office and have a double standard. Work days are too long. I was hired on at a lower rate than my male counterpart.
bad,Filled orders to be shipped out to employees on day to day basis. Shipped orders to stores for demo purposes
bad,good benefits but bad dispatch lack of management to fix problems money and runs good till I got on the bed side of dispatcher. High turn over
bad,"a typical workday is for me is pretty relaxing just dealing with parts and general upkeep of the plant as well as and major maintenance jobs that come up where maintenance needs a hand"
good,"I worked on a contract for Costco.  I was promised a lot of things. The management didnt stand behind my decisions for delivery. I also delivered concrete forms to customers for them. Many hours there were last minute deliveries and were pushed to do more. Very seldom were you even told that you did a good job or you were valued. We got to work at 5 am and went home at 3-7pm most days. No sunday work, very few saturdays."
good,"Advancement not based on performance, based on how well you fit with the 'bro-mentality' cultivated and encouraged within the company.  Very low starting pay"
good,At one time i was very happy working there!! Things have changed in the last few years for me personally! If you like the hours universal is your place
good,"Faced paced place to work, has some great people to work with."
good,"Dedicated team leader with more than 25 years in maintenance and possesses an innate ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously, provide cost effective solutions while delivering superior, quality yield. Leverage various technical skills to reach optimum results while sustaining areas of personnel metrics including; safety, quality, delivery, morale and environment. Meticulous in managing department staff members to perform preventative maintenance and routine tests, to assure mechanisms are in proper working order. Capable of interpreting schematic diagrams for systems and revamp functions to coincide with specifications and in conjunction with company policies or procedures. and i was treated like a criminal because i wrote an employee a bad review."
good,Universal forest products Ltd is a good company as a whole. Each plant I'm sure is different. It's hard work but easy enough to pick up and understand. Opportunities for almost every background of work.
good,It’s not a terrible place to work. But there is a huge difference in how things are ran between 1st and 2nd shifts. There is no swing shift. And. I paid sick days. You get a point for every day you miss. Or a half of a point with a drs note.
good,"I am in awe of the poor management.  The department head tells you that ""we are a wood company with a trucking department not a trucking company"" as an excuse for running illegal and unsafe trailers says a lot about the company.  The routes are different every day and they'll tell you late at night so you're never sure when the starting time is or when to go to sleep.  There is also a lot of favoritism as far as route assignments.  Overall it is not a very professional environment with a slew of problems especially when it comes to DOT compliance."
good,"Good employer, fine to work for and had a good experience overall.  I didn't like working nights because I have a family and when you work all night, it's hard to spend time with family."
good,"Ask alot of questions. Ask for more money.. You wont have a social life working here and the company will never recognize any accomplished goals, or extra effort.. Be careful here and ask questions at interview."
good,Do not work here unless you love being stuck in a rut for the next 20 to see any kind of payoff for giving them your body until you are a broken down angry person who cannot work anywhere else.
good,"This is a Very oppressive, unappreciative and ignorant atmosphere The company overall has a great structure, culture and history. This plant will treat you like a damp rag, continually wringing you out"
good,"i learned a lot in 7 years i loved working with all the wood products such as building pallets and fence panels and cutting plywood However, the management was horrible hardest part is when they expect too much and dont take care of there people."
good,"—The starting pay is low ($15) for job."
good,longs days pay is not good  management do not treat the workers good who has been there for years   very hot  company let too many  people  do what thay want. to do
good,I worked there to get through school. My dad is a construction worker and my boss asked my dad to build somethin for him. He asked if I wanted to build pallets and I said yes. It's nice because of the flexible hours with school.
good,I spent years working for this company after they had bought a company I worked for. I had always hoped management would get better but it never did. They are good at telling employees what they want to hear but fail miserably at following through on anything. There always was clear signs of favoritism with certain employees. Management always took care of the complainers and neglected the people who were there trying to keep their heads down and get the work done. In the end I had to leave to take a better opportunity somewhere else. I was treated as if I didn't exist my last few days. I left and couldn't have made a better decision for myself.
good,"if you really need a job, go there. if youre lucky enough to drive a fork lift there youll be good. when i worked there which was a long time ago. The management didnt care much about there expendable employees."
good,Great people to work for upper management is unlike any other. A typical work day revolves around your desk and your email. The atmosphere is pleasant.
good,"My day starts at 5am I build components all day learned how to use the vista-99 saw management needs a little fine tuning.My co-workers are good people fun to be around the job is real physically demanding it is ruff some days I do enjoy working with my hands.  "
good,"Good work enviroment. Offers benefits such as 401k, dental, vision, and medical. Pay differental for each shift. Convient location. Well maintain. Advancement opportunities."
good,"GREAT place to work, learned a lot about lumber, doors, trusses working for the company. UFP need to pay more money to those at the lower end of the working scale. Very under paid. The management is over paid."
good,"work really long hours. Up early stay late, no work life balance. comp isn't at the top but isnt at the lowest. learn a ton about building materials. great first job."
good,"Started  as receptionist, then onto Inside sales coordinator, then transferred out into the yard in the shipping dept. The first 2 jobs were good, but the last one, I was disappointed in the training for that position or should I say lack of training."
good,"fast pace work, you only get 2 fifteen minute breaks. I liked the job because of how it was fast pace and competitive and you got a good work out. a typical day consist of me operating machines and building pallets."
good,I liked working there but they were not moving me up any more and I had a hard time working in the sun but I was pretty good at it . I worked machines and enjoyed the people I worked with
good,"it was an okay place to work it has its moments of craziness and unorderly , mangement is okay a little helpful, hardest part of the job waiting for material, co workers are good to work with, i learned a couple new things how to use a nail gun properly and how to notch pallets,"
good,"A typical work day was a experience like no other.  I enjoyed my job!  Constantly busy working with purchase orders and incoming order acknowledgements.  Communicating each and every day with vendors, plant representatives, sales account managers and clients.    The most enjoyable part of the job was working with independent trucking company's and logistics company's, vendors, sales account managers and plant representatives concerning their product and when product will be ready to ship and deliver.  There was a lot a variety to my responsibilities in what I did each day.   Always busy, always exciting, always meeting new people in the industry of moving wood throughout our nation.   The forestry industry really makes the world turn!!   I was very blessed to have been able to work for this company for 2 years and 7 months.  It was truly an experience worth having."
good,worked on stacking trusts and loading trucks.. worked out side all day sometimes fun and sometimes was bad depending on the weather
good,"learned about electrical,plumbing,welding skills, and electronic skills."
good,"loved the work, but upper management didnt care about the people working there."
good,Definitely have hours you work 10-13hr shifts only one day off only thing i didnt like is they dont fully train properly. But overall not a bad place to work.
good,Management has a lack of communication. Very strict on some policies others are not looked upon. Expect more from their workers than they need to. Call you in on days off and some saturdays wanting you to come in.
good,Managment was terrible was a lot of negative feed back day in and day out. meet some good people. the hardest part of the job was the shift 4pm-1:30am or later.
good,typical day is building components when done with that I help where needed can preform all duties in the shop atmosphere is good we all get along and poke fun at each other the hardest part of the job is the job it self it is very physical and fast paced enjoyable part of the job is knowing that I help build AMERICA.
good,When i started i loved building trusses and learned very fast. I became a table leader in 2 months of working there. I got two raises within nine months and continued to learn and become the best and most efficient i could be and to teach new workers that were hired.
good,"Low pay, job security is not great.  Management looked out for themselves.  If you don't fit in with their click you will not advance here.  Back stabbers for coworkers who will set you up for failure"
good,Strong teamwork environment safety efficient with year around work and rewards for safety and production accuracy for employees good health benefits and promotion opportunities
good,"Usually a fun place to work, most of the people were enjoyable. Benefits were very good. There is some room for advancing in the company. Lots of overtime during bush season."
good,"Very fast paced,, employees are very friendly easy to get along with , always being watched by cameras and time you for everything you do"
good,The workforce is of poor quality at some points. There is a lack of team work . most employees looked to be on some sort of narcotic most of the time during their shift.
good,It’s a greate company to work for if you could get hired on full time I’ve been with company for six month now and still not hired full time and with no benifits
good,"Everything evolves around work and results.  Definitely a ""what have you done for me today"" attitude.  Overall, the people are nice and mean well but there is a constant struggle between Operations and Sales and who runs things.  If you can thread the needle, your good."
good,It's a good place to work bit they just have stupid attendance rules and they would have more good workerst is they changed there policy.  I was on the safety committee and missed a day and they let me go.

good,"learned many skills like work on different kind of machines,safety measurements, properties and types of materials."
good,"UFP is a financially strong company, but lacked leadership vision outside of their internal plants. I was employed in their Consumer Products Division and the customer base consisted of independent wholesale distributors. The independent customer base culture was different than their company owned plants and it created a road block in the vision of our division."
good,"Position was commercial component design that required a very detailed level of knowledge and experience. The corporate environment helped to create a stable work place on paper with little real structure offering true training, advancement, or flexibility to utilize employees other previous job skills."
good,When I worked here there was a lot of us but we all got along as a team. The environment is great as well as the people  that are there to help you out.
good,It was an okay job to work for I work hard everyday I made for trusses for houses and roof trusses for houses also went on other job sites and fix messed up trusses
good,I started as a temp and had to work over the hrs I was told I had to work to become a full time employee. I  worked at my job and did everything to move up but they would bring people in with no experience to take the office positions.

good,Very fast pace you always busy they sell a lpt of trusted and rebuild pallets. This place is a great environmental protection no harmful chemicals ypu dont have to worry about.
good,"The pay should be more.  These positions are for individuals who are limited, and have criminal history's and or other life issues and the management take advantage of that with the low wage scale in my opinion.  The focus on production work and nail gun experience is irrelevant when hiring individuals for some of these positions, if the focus is on experience then the pay should reflect that."
good,"not a bad place to work, the pay is not that great which is why turnover is so high here.  Fast paced so your day goes fast.  Safety is top priority and management works with you."
good,hard work and you had to battle the elements. the winter was the worst. but the job will get you into shape and a great tan during the summer. and i need 150 charcters.
good,"this place has since closed its facility in lodi and did have a very high turnover rate , the only plus was the bonus system in place u could make double paychecks very easy."
good,day hours where good could spend the rest of your doing what ever.  people there where great but the management was way off. over all company all right.
good,Everyday was a challenge in the most positive sense. I learned how Continuous Improvement involves everyone and the best ideas come from the people who do the actual work.
good,very fast paced work place needs better machinery needs up to date machinery needs better management only get 10 minutes breaks but you get 30 minute lunch break
good,"I'm the type of guy who loves hard work, I love getting my hands dirty so this was the perfect place for me, however the schedule was too strict for me to go to school and work."

good,"The warehouse is extremely hot, short breaks, co-workers were not the best to work with. All around not a great environment to work at."
good,"I liked taking two ten minute breaks instead of two ten minute breaks and a half hour lunch. Because, I got paid for the ten minute breaks I was there eight hours."

good,When working with Universal Forest Products I learned alot of new things. I didn't have prior machine operating experience but they gave me the chance to learn.
good,"a typical day at work is everyone pulling together to reach our goals by the end of the week. good overtime though and great benefits, only complaint would have to be the hours."
good,"Coworkers are the best part of this job"
good,"Poor management, low starting salary, mandatory overtime... hot and sorry inside the plant, poor and lazy emplpyesz, looking to advance of other employees."
good,We actually made cabinets at the beginning of my employment and then a couple of months later we start making trustees. Where I was a saw operator I had to cut fast to have the part for the builders.

good,Long days but rewarded.  The benefits from this company are amazing.  The company is very massive.  Sometimes forget about the little people.  But overall not a bad company.
good,well Got Up Every Morning At 5am Leave For Work At 5:30am Got To Universal Forest Products At 7am To Start Building wood Pallets Though Out The Day And Go Home At 5;30pm
good,"i had fun while employed by this company for the most part. sometimes i was told to do things out of my job description with little explanation as to how to perform the tasks, other than that i would recommend universal to a friend in need of a job!"
good,Great work environment where the designers sat together and could communicate not only on projects but chat to make the day to by.  I learned a lot about the design and manufacturing process since the trusses we were designing were built directly on site.
good,"If you don't play the game and belong to the ""Club"", watch out.  If you do though, the sky is the limit.  The culture and people that work here are for the most part awesome!  But like most everything, a few bad eggs and destroy a good thing."
good,The current employees are a great group of to work with. very little room to advance.

good,During my time at Universal Forest Products I was a general laborer.  It was my first job so it taught me my role in the working community and how to work my way up the ladder.
good,"It can be hot and cold depending on the weather. However, management is good about taking care of employees and Corporate Financing helps with larger issues."
good,A typical day working here was enjoyable and fast paced.  I would have stayed longer had I not needed to find something with more pay and closer to home with less traveling.
good,"Preparing food for the customers, closing the restaurant after each night. The hardest part of working at Burger King was the times down. I enjoyed working with my co workers and communicating with the customers. Lastly I learned when I was at Burger King is team work is very important"
good,It's been good working here. I meet some nice people and I also got to learn new skills. I also had a chance to lead a team. They pay less n its always hot.
good,"My overall favorite part of working in this company was building my team and having the pleasure of working with hard working operators, In experience I would say this company has poor management."
good,When I first started I was excited then I saw that they don’t really care about the condition you are in as long as you get there work done I broke my knuckle on my right hand and they were still trying to get me to work instead of having it heal so when I called in to tell them I needed to let my hand heal and everything they decided to let me go
good,If you don't mind long hrs for below average pay with benefits it's great but otherwise they are all about upper management bonus an treat employees like dirt
good,"It is a very high pace environment which stresses extreme dedication and low work life balance."
good,Sometimes had to work additional hours in order to help the sales team that might have dropped the ball on a takeoff that they needed.  Overall it was a positive experience.
good,"Good company but hard work with hostile co-workers. Liked the work but the floor lead was a bully with the people he was in charge of causing a lot of them to walk out including me. Production manager allowed him to act this way without any disciplinary actions. The floor lead continuously violated company and OSHA rules but punished anyone who didn't follow them. It was a subplant in this city but the main plant was in Harrisonville Missouri so human resources never really had a clue to what was really going on here. I would apply again with Universal Forest Products, but it would be at another plant in another city."
good,worked out side so if it was cold or hot it sucked was fun setting up saws to cut wood supervisor was very help full if you had any problems and production bonuses was nice
good,The typical day working here is strenuous but also fun. The people that you work with are the people that you see everyday all day. It is a decent place to work.
good,"The company has a really good culture for the type of business it is. I managed 98 males on a daily basis through timesheets, HR issues, hiring and firing, and ordering of supplies. The hardest part of the job was keeping invoicing up to date because this was part of the Office Manager's role as well. The most enjoyable was assisting with HR tasks, hiring, and being the 'go to ' person for the plant."
good,"Every day smooth sailing.  Monday through Friday.  Early shift, weekends off. Approachable management. Pleasant coworkers. Monotonous though. Enjoyed simplicity and safety of workplace."
good,I enjoyed my job there. All I did was operate a big forklift all day. I really liked that job.
good,"Answering phone calls, responding to emails, communicating with Vendors, Buyers, Customers, and Carriers. Creating and updating purchase orders. Assisting Buyers with contracts and providing quotes to potential or current customers,"
good,The company is a well-established company. Just worried about which way the company is going with the plant that I work at. It is still a working progress.
good,I had good hours amd I was good at my job. You made money by how much you built. It was a good job for me at that time. Labor can be hard on one some.
good,Fast-paced hard-working job for piece rate. Very Hands-On and physical with the equipment to build products for other companies that ship all over the world and through the United States
good,good place to work as long as you don't supposedly offend someone. Plant manager is a good guy. Some employees are good to work with. Tend to take one persons word over the word of others.
good,"A typical day at work included getting work orders, communicating with fork lift driver to get material, setting up job order parameters on my saw and, then running lumber through the machine. After cutting the lumber I would either supply the next work station immediately or stack lumber on carts according to next steps in job."
good,good crew good bosses. very flexible hours. fast paced work environment enjoyable work bonuses great benifits universal is a very family friendly company

good,A very fast paced work environment with many new challenges every day. The people are friendly and willing to help when needed.
good,"Provide internship opportunities for aspiring college students."
good,"Great job, hours are ok, people are what make the job. Upper management listen and get things done. The company itself takes care of its employees. overall good place to work in my opinion."
good,"work from 5-when ever"
good,A typical manufacturing environment with an emphasis on production. I learned many key leadership roles such as operator and assembler.
good,I was a table leader and I instructed my co-workers in what they had to do and I trained new employees. the best thing I liked about my job was some of the people but some was lacking work ethics. The hardest part of my job was getting some people to work.
good,"Take Customer Orders and Quotes by phone, e-mail and fax. Figure Customer mark up prices based on each individual Customer and follow individual Customer Contracts and Guidelines.  Follow up with Production, Design and the Treating  Departments on all orders, when required.  Assist in scheduling shipping appointments for all Customer’s.

good,"People are easy to get along with, co workers & management. Communication lines are open. I enjoy learning how to work the different saws."
good,"Good place to work, great people. I have used my 11 years to learn many international aspects of the purchsing world. I travel frequently and enjoy it, although can not relocate due to my 8yr old son. Eventually the Colorado office is closing. I prefer confidentiality and respect the same."
good,Co-workers were nice and helpful
good,"12 hour shifts on a rotating schedule. 2 days or nights (wed and thurs) in a row followed by a 3 day weekend, then 2 days on, 2 days off, work 3 days in a row. No vacation time for the first year. Personal time at 2 hrs a month and up to 8 safety hours per quarter, which can be taken away or reduced if you dont have perfect attendance or if someone gets hurt."
good,id show up. boot up my saw(vista) get the spreadsheets for the job we were working on and hurry up to get the lumber together so I could bring it in and cut it in order to keep the build line stacked with work. if I didn't cut nobody else down the line could do anything. so I had to keep up or exceed the work the rest of the guys together on the line could do. management could've been a little better in areas but I learned a lot about the assembly of walls and or roof trusses as well as floors. and have even gone on to do some of my own smaller builds by myself at home
good,very demaining on the body in production area most are friendly is a fast pace place safety is big for the company and finding ways to cut down on injury's

good,"A typical day at work. RUN, HURRY, RUN!!"
good,"Expect long hours, but you're working with some fun people, so it's rewarding and enjoyable."
good,"Working at UFP Saginaw, TX was both challenging and fulfilling. The management team is top notch. The culture at the Hillsboro, TX plant was not as team oriented as Saginaw."
good,the pay was low but we had work to do all year long. the job was fast pace and it let you get good at stacking and loading wood onto buggies or racks.
good,"It was a outside job , that means work in rain snow or anyother type of weather no matter what the case may be. With very low pay. It was a good place to work."
good,It's a new company in Shawnee area most everything about job is ok but there is a lot of room for improvement as far as management and organization. They have some in management positions that have much to learn as far as how to deal and communicate with employees sometimes the authority position is abused in handling situations and how to be more professional in the title they carry
good,"Fun and relaxed place to work, learned new skills such as forklift operator and computerized saws. That hardest part of the job was wearing the programs of the panel saw and how everything worked"
good,"Learned some management skills."
good,"Clock in the morning freezing cold in the winter, smoking hot in the summer. It was hard to communicate with the operators most spoke no English. Managers were good. But there were rules that were not enforced, especially safety rules. Co-workers were easy to get along with, we helped one another with projects.  Most enjoyable part was the freedom to go around the plant and make improvements, to help production and add safety for the operators."
good,Great  learning experience with hands on equipment as well as team ethics.
good,"Great place to work for I learned a lot of stuff about cars that I didn't know, and the management/co. workers were very helpful and always willing to help or teach me. The hardest part of my job was resigning, because I enjoyed working there but there was no growth within the company or raises and I was looking for a better opportunity."
good,Enjoyable environment.  Hard work with plenty of rewards and benefits.  Work hard play hard.  Solid foundation of a company.
good,It’s a good company. The Magna plant is new and growing. Everything is new to all employees. Long hours 50/50 working Saturdays. Decent pay. Hard working atmosphere.
good,"UFP is a good place to work if you are just starting out and looking for a career. They are a new company in to Shawnee, but they have been open since the early 1990's. Decent health care coverage, dental, and vision care. Goal oriented management and floor personnel."
good,"Fast pace, be prepared to work.Very hot in summer months. Dusty and dirty at times. There can be times of frustration over work environment. The hour structure works well"
good,I have always enjoyed working for Universal Forest Products. Many options for learning new technologies to keep up with the modern world. Just not many options to advance in career without extensive travel.
good,"Most definitely room for advancement, and the pay is decent. (depending on your position) If you're looking for a short term employment opportunity, look elsewhere, however if you want to put years into the company, UFPI is a great choice. the 401k and stock options are amazing."
good,"I am liked very well and can work with multiple types of people."
good,"Typical work day includes building 320 pallets a day, using nail gun to put them together. I learned lock out tag out procedures on how to lockout machainesfor maintenance and cleaning."

good,Everyone here are very easy to get along with. They all strive for you to do your very best. They are all about safety considering if you mess up there you will lose a limb.
good,"Fun place to work at, and there was plenty of opportunity to advance. Most of the time you will be laid off during the winter because of slow season. Almost always chances of overtime."
good,"I worked for this company 30 years ago when it was relatively small. It is now a huge company although the local office in Woodburn remains small. The culture is casual to this day, which I enjoyed."
good,This is a good company to work for if you are single with no children. The swing shifts that they run make it stressful for a family. But other than that not a bad place to work
good,"This has been my favorite job yet, i enjoy the hard manual labor and working with others as a team to complete tasks. Communication and willingness to learn new ways to do things was key working for UFP."
good,"Good Company to Work for.. Excellent Benefits package and you run your own department as a small business. If you would like to have a great career at UFP, the best method to get your foot in the door is to start in the Production Management Trainee Program it will provide you with all the essential tools to be successful within the company.."
good,"I loved the hours, however the winters where harsh with the freezing cold work elements. Also I was not fan on how departments would be laid off when many people wanted and needed them hours they would bring in new hires instead of laid off employees."
good,It's a great starting company but the pay is too low once you have gained the skills needed to be truly effective.  Hours are typically 7-5 but I have been here until midnight before.
good,"Very long hours, and not time for one self or family. You are constantly on the road. You are required to submit information at a moments notice that requires searching, inventory and it is not something you may do at a glace or a deep thought, when you have to compile all the information yourself."
good,The majority of an account managers time is spent on the road meeting with current customers and also trying to obtain new customers. Monday is typically the lone office day of the week where a lot of quoting and scheduling is done.
good,Design all day. help customers figure out how a project will work and make sure designs are completed to great detail. I have learned to meet deadlines and give very accurate time estimates. Sometimes being late could cause financial penalties. Management was always supportive and once per quarter we usually had an employee appreciaition day where would get lunch catered. Co-workers always workd well together and sometimes we would spread the load of work when we can. The hardest part of the job was when I got laid off and the company closed. It was something I had done for years and had grown with them. the most enjoyable part was the challenge. Every design was custome and sometimes a job came along that really challenged us.
good,I like my time work for Universal Forest Products. Good to be a part of the team.
good,Management is alright their and working for the company was good I like the fast paced environment and the fact that it very physical at times overall good company to work for
good,"I really enjoyed working at Universal Forest Products. They cared about their employees. They showed it by having special events when certain tasks were completed. For example, they would have cookouts for departments that excelled."
good,"In 2014, I did enjoy working there, but I'm glad I'm not there now."
good,I started working at ufp after I graduated high school. At first it was difficult but as time went on because I became one of the best workers in my department. I like the environment as everybody gets along nice and everyone is welcome. The only bad thing I could say about ufp is the management.
good,"Worked there for many years. Had to leave due to personal situation. They are willing to invest time and energy into the right canidate,to help you advance."
good,I worked with Universal when I was running another Trucking company. I was happy to be able to work there when I left the other trucking company. Great people and a great working environment.
good,Good environment to work in. Great pay and a good company. The workers there are helpful and patient. Most problems were fixed quickly. Parts were most readly available upon request of repair.
good,I enjoyed my 14 years working with UFPI. The company offers great benefits and can take part in the stock option plans. The do offer a variety online courses to help advance your career.
good,Every morning you are giving a piece of paper stating what will you build and how many different types of pallets you will build. you will go to your work station and prepare yourself by getting a air hose and air gun that you need to proceed with your objective. you will tell the forklift drivers what type of nails you will need for your nail gun. you will read your blueprint and set up your pallet to the correct measurement using your measuring tape. after that your will build a jig for your pallet so it can be at the same measurements every time you build another one just like it. either you will build 60-100 of one pallet or you will build up to 500 pallets all day.
good,It was an ok job i did not intend to leave got injured and was later dismissed was not injured at work received temporary disability and recieved unemployment after dismissal.
good,"Can be a great place to work if you are willing to work long hard hours doing hard manual labor.  If not, don't apply!"
good,"I worked for this company for a little over a year. I really liked working here. Fast paced but not back breaking But, do to lack of work ,I was laid off. Would work for them again."
good,it was a nice place to work and it was a very casual setting.  Very comfortable to be yourself.  Co-workers were always willing to help.    Felt like a family environment
good,"I would recommend my position to any recent grad looking to start a career in production management. In this role, I am able to learn and enhance many skills while being challenged to perform at optimal rates. The workplace culture is to always improve yourself and everything around you, and I believe this is a decent general philosophy. The most difficult part of the job is seeing all of the ways you can improve the workplace around you and influencing others to change in a positive manner to accomplish goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is all of the opportunity to make a change for the better."
good,"Work on a variety of customers ranging in difficulty from simple roof truss jobs to custom homes."
good,Operating the saw was the most enjoyable part of the job being able to work all kinds of machines made it enjoyable. The faster you worked the job the more money you made thats why it was so fast paced
good,"Universal Forest Products was a unique work experience for me as I've worked there the past two summers and winters between semesters. A typical work day is 5am-3pm both inside and outside throughout the day. Management was very easy to get along with, no matter who you were. The aspect I like most about management is their number one priority to you is safety. My co-workers are amazing. I still hangout with a few of them outside of work. No matter whether you do something right or wrong, they're there to help you (even if they throw a joke in if you mess up). The hardest part of the job on the inside for me was reading the details of the blueprints, but once I started to learn more about what certain numbers meant everything started going smoothly. On the outside, the hardest part of the job would be not letting the heat get to you on those hot summer days. The most enjoyable part of the job for me wasn't the working aspect, but the interaction with my co-workers as a whole helped me get through the day."
good,"I enjoyed working there and the people I worked with a lot, but the pay is horrible for what you have to do,  Also working there in the summer is horrible!"
good,Efficient and effective training to start. Environment was conducive to the tasked required to be performed. Production based pay motivates and drives worker dedication. Only negative was lack of materials or failures on resource monitoring leading to slow workloads. Overall a good workplace.
good,"Nice career opportunities. "
good,"Doesn't pay enough, but its not a bad place to work as a driver. Get paid every two weeks. They pay by the mile/drop and if you sit anywhere for more than 45min you start getting paid by the hour after that."
good,I enjoyed working on universal Forest products Incorporated they provided clean safe work environment and I would work there again if given the chance
good,Good environment good work pace love the work set up love the sound of nail guns one of the reason I chose the job other than the far location of my home but good people
good,I love this place it is fast paced but not to fast they care about there employees and take care of them. Have to be able to work good with others and work as a team to complete the daily job.
good,"A typical day at work began by attending morning team meetings and group building activities. This help with communication between other employees. I learned about the different times of woods and cuts as it relates to my job. Management was good overall they were helpful and very understanding. The atmosphere at work was very welcoming and enjoyable. Everyone got along and made work seem easy. As far as the hadest part of the job, I would have to say it would be the heat. But what I enjoyed the most would be the people I worked with and the things that I learned from working there."
good,"They had a great spirit and while there were rough days, management did care about their employees. I would have loved to stay, but there was no room for advancement."
good,The opportunities to move further up in the company are available for all that are willing to put forth the effort.  Open door policy makes for an enjoyable work environment.
good,"There is never a lack of work here. The supervisors and managers oversee day to day operations including employee safety. Safety training is an everyday procedure. The challenge for employees here is understanding that their attendance is required Monday-Friday. While the environment is outside work, accommodations are in place to offer comfort like sunshades and fans. What I found enjoyable was the family atmosphere. They all pull together to get the job done."
good,very competitive place to work. lots of over night travels and weekend on calls. if you are willing to put in the time the pay is very rewarding......
good,I enjoyed the job and my co workers and supervisor's just had to relocate to South Carolina but really enjoyed the work environment and all the good benefits within the comoany

good,"Controlled receivables"
good,A typical work day is 10 to 12 hours.  I assemble truss for homes.  I enjoyed management and my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was getting use to the weight of the truss.
good,A great company to work for with friendly and supportive management and ongoing training to allow employees to grow in their skills and careers.
good,The company operated a fast pace. receiving orders and making sure they were complete and accurate. Profits depended on being better than the competition. There is  a great deal of satisfaction is this job. Maintain quotas is a big part of the business.
good,"Busy lumber production plant that is always running. Learn how to grade lumber, and the process it goes through before being shipped out to customers. Mainly nice set of people and dedicated group of management."
good,"Typical day, maintain product production, review product orders and set up augers and blades for production. Inspect angels of cuts and quality of lumber. Monitor work safety, endure quality and count is accurate and employees are following all safety requirements. Best part of job is the team development."
good,I really liked this Company and it was a great place to work.
good,"El trabajo es pesado, pero cuando se le agarra el ritmo se hace sencillo. Salí de alli por problemas de salud. Los beneficios son muy buenos, se hace mucho overtime."
good,"Decent place to work at if you enjoy the outside and inside, it's fast paced, quick learning on building pallets and supervisors are really experience so you will learn a lot from them."
good,A company with greats opportunities and fair payments  at the positions offered. Good management's and excellent compensations at any positions offered
good,I had to set the laser sights and jigs up on tables and I built rafters. I built floor joices and undercoated the floor joices. It was a fast pace work environment but it was a good job.
good,"UFP in Medley is a different place now than when I was there with changes for the better.  The work environment is safety oriented with little over a dozen work centers set around building pallets, fence, and boards.  The main hub of the business is pressure treating lumber and in that department you get to really learn the science of what goes into wood and how to best protect wood products from the elements."
good,"A typical day involved: The daily beginning of shift meeting, receiving daily cut list, performing daily checklist for Forklift followed by daily checklist of the 3 other machines I was I was to be operating, then retrieving material to be cut down, preparing the packs to be cut, placing prepped packs on Holtec, cutting and measuring finished packs, creating labels for each finished pack, and putting each finished pack in appropriate spot. Then cleaning up my area at the end of the day. I learned ways of increasing my productivity and safety. The hardest part of the job was usually either the elements, since my job was mainly outside, as well as trying to come to an agreement on an alternative solution for improbable cuts."
good,Very busy in shipping and multi-jobs were my responsibility. Getting independent drivers loaded and out in a timely fashion while making sure product was correct. Tracking shipments and inventory on lumber.
good,"A typical day would be reviewing your paperwork assignment and use your hammer and steal plates to build the truss according to the blueprint then use a 500 ton press to press the truss on the steal table. Accuracy is extremely important. Management walks around the shop seeing if everything is going ok and seeing if there is any problems anyone is having, also isn't scared to help assist if it is needed. Most co-workers are a breeze to work with and will teach you certain techniques to help you work smarter not harder. Other co-workers can be a bit immature at times and would rather find humor in  watching you struggle trying to do something you've never done before instead of teaching you the ropes, an give a bad review to your supervisor and boss. The most difficult part in the position I was working in which is called ""low man"" was running back and forth from the building room into the next room where the truss would be partially pressed and review to make sure they were not mistakes. Then I'd lift the truss on "" the roller"" as the table would continue to move, then roll the truss down onto axels I would line up previously to the beginning of job. Then go into building room and then into the room where the truss would be pressed then repeat the process and stack the trusses neatly on the axles until that specific job was done. Then I would band the trusses together spray-paint the order number, wave in the forklift driver and after he would take the trusses off the axels. I would bring them back in and repeat the process. Though it was hard work I did enjoy the atmosphere"
good,"Was a good company to work for, gave me the ability to grow and learn on the job. They met my hard work with rewarding positions and opportunities. I would recommend UFP to most."

good,At universal forest product was a stressful environment to work at. I started working as a temp for the first 2months. The company hired me on right away.

The Plant Manager refuses to promote within the company, before the Plant Manager they have now came to that Plant I moved up in the company, after he was there for 6 months he cleaned house and put people in positions that didn't have any knowledge of or experience of the jobs they were given. I had a really good crew working for me in the shipping & receiving department, we always got the job done an done right no matter how much work they would add to us everyday."
good,My overall experience was great. Some managers made it difficult to reach goals I learned a lot and would recommend any person to try to make a career with this company .

good,Enjoyed the training of employees very much. I also like the travel during my time with UFP. This job was exciting and had lots of changes in the day to day routines.
good,The hardest part of the job was flipping 60' I-beams. I learned how to use a large forklift and a smaller forklift. My supervisors were very nice and full of advice when I needed it. I learned how to properly read a tape measure. I had to band bunks of I-beams and staple the job number on them. I also picked tarps and wood particles from the yard. My coworkers were all so helpful and they were good to be around and completing a good and safe work area.

good,My company was bought out by universal in June of last year. Since then I have nothing but good things to say about them.  They treat you like a human being and value hard work.
good,Great company with a lot to offer its employees and community. Has a competitive wage scale with an opportunity for large incentives. Management has been great. A lot of long term employees that work hard and really care about the company.

good,"come in at 4:00am and see 25 trucks outside the gate.(motivation) loading and unloading trucks, seeing truck drivers drive off with a smile , sharing tips and ideas with co-workers. the hardest part was working in the rain during the winter. safety first!"

good,I enjoy my job at universal forest products.A lot of hours but make a decent living.I would recommend the job to others.The benefits and bonuses are pretty good as well
good,This is a high production lumber shipyard specializing in the treating of lumber products for commercial and retail applications
good,"Work was great until I got a new supervisor. He gave most of the work to me, and when problems happened he never listened to me. The problems  happened because he didn't know much about maintenance."
good,In my opinion I love the family oriented attitude that they share with their workers. Always fair and they really want you to advance in their company.

good,I really enjoy working there as I learned a lot everyday and love the environment in my department. Too bad they had to moved and it was very hard for me to continue the job.
good,It is  very fast paced and easy to learn your job. They do make u work over time no matter what so adage 40-50 hours per week. The company is as a whole is very wonderful to work with just show up to work every day and work hard at what ever spot u are at and you will go up chain with time.

good,have been working here for almost 3 months. Lots of room to grow with good ppl and a great management team. company itself is growing quickly if you have the opportunity to get in I would.
good,"The most important thing to know about UFP is that you get back what you put into it. If you show up and punch in, keep your head down and punch out then you will get a pay check. But, if you show up, work hard, and put yourself out there this company will take you places. Your attitude and work ethic will dictate your experience at UFP."

I am retired now,  going on 3 years, and had it not been for Universal I probably would not be enjoying the life I now have.  They were very fair with their compensation and I always felt that I was valued and respected by management.  This company also made me realize that the best value of a good company comes from it's people."

good,Awesome place to work but not much room for advancement and better pay.
good,My review went well nice and good things about me. I think just lack of monies that are do to those who earned it. The company is a great place for a career.

good,"When you start a new job/career you get nervous about not being welcomed into an already small family type environment... Not with UFPI! They are amazing and help train you all that you need to know, you can take what they teach you and put your own spin on it. The work/life balance is amazing and the pay is nothing short of expected if you do your job to the expectations you set at your interview. It can be both fast paced or mellow, depending on the day. The management is great and friendly! Everyone"

good,I love my job. I recommend any of my family and friends to work there. It is a very good company to work for. They mangers and employees are very good people to work with
good,"I absolutely love Universal Forest Products. The typical work day is never the same. One of the best parts is you stay busy and time flies. Iv learned how to run different types of machines, how to run a power saw, and how to assemble floor trusses. The management team is the finest iv experienced from any other place iv worked for. They are very professional yet understanding, very giving, always keeps a positive environment. The hardest part of the job would probably be falling behind and having to produce work faster to catch up, heavy lifting or the weather conditions. The most enjoyable part of the job is that its mostly fast paced type work all day and the work environment is relaxed for the most part. Also you get your own personal space to work in."

good,Its awesome working so many openend minded and positive people with a past but they push and encourage to do more such as my supervisor rosendo santos ive never met a guy so positive and hard working man as him. really a pleasure have worked at UFP hillsboro
good,Great Staff in this company. It's a nice place to work and grow for new career. good training work relax with opportunity to advancement will recommend this for everyone.
good,"I enjoyed my work here. I would have stayed longer if I didn't live so far away. The pay is competitive and the work keeps you awake and busy. As long as you work, time flies. Stay for more than two months and you'll receive benefits. The only downside is that there is a learning curve for communicating with some of the employees who cannot speak English, but over time you'll learn to break the language barrier. Otherwise I would strongly recommend working at UFP."
good,This place offered so much in job advancent for those who wanted to more than just a job. They will train you. They will help you learn and grow within and they care about you going back home to your family.
good,I really felt from the first day I started that we were  a family. There was so much team work no matter what you asked help in. People would stop what they were doing to help me with a smile on their face.

good,team players who work together. Hard workers that have a good heart. Fast pace but easy to learn. Opportunity for growth.
good,"Must be able to multi-task at all times. Able to advance quickly to take on more departments, and employees worked as a team. Hardest part of the job was when you have several different employees at your office door for several different reasons. This was the best company I have ever worked for. Unfortunately, when the economy starting crashing at the end of 2007 so did our jobs. If I had a chance to return to this company should they open back up, I would be the first one at the door."
good,"Mi trabajo abarco todos los sectores que conformaban la empresa, ya que en ese momento la empresa era de nueva creación y todos los departamentos necesitaban ser constantemente ser atendidos."
