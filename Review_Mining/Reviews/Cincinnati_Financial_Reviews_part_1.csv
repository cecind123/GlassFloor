rating,review
bad,"At first, I thought this was a great company to work for. About a month after working there, I found out that it is a horrible company to work for. HR does not listen to complaints. Managers are disorganized, unfair, practice favoritism, and have unrealistic expectations of their employees. When I resigned, no one called me for my exit interview. I had to call them 4 times to get an answer, and still there is no exit interview. When I reached out to my manager, she never called me back. This is only one of the issues I have faced with my resignation. I am very disappointed in their unprofessionalism and sheer ignorance."
bad,"As long you fit the mold, no matter how little you actually do, you can get hired and move up.  The hard workers are overlooked if they are not with in crowd."
bad,"- Average age is 40-50 "
bad,"Consistently hire managers based on cronyism, nepotism.  Most significantly micro-manage.  Limited advanced opportunities, pay well below industry average.  Going through process of instituting increasingly difficult metrics whereby make it most impossible to attain, and chasing away many good employees in the process.  Hiring many new graduates that receive lesser pay.  "
bad,Some good people and good benefits.  The problem is Management.  Very back biting.  They don't care about good people or giving people second chances in life.  They are cold and heartless.
bad,"Worker moral was low.  Employees all agreed that it is very difficult to move forward with career in IT.  Hard to get motivated being a contractor when employees are always complaining about the company."
bad,"At first I liked the typing pool but I felt I could do so much more. The boss at the time was fair. I was promoted to a policy typist and I think I might even have been asked to leave. Kind of flying blind at the policy typist job and when I talked to the others doing the same job, it probably got back to somebody I was not on the team. It's been a while."
bad,"I wouldn't work there again....managers are not trained in managing their people, upper management doesn't know what their employees really do. Commercial lines is the worst department for this."
bad,"Mostly contract employees that fear for their jobs on the bi-annual review and miscommunication between teams of development, testers, and management."
bad,"decent place to work"
bad,Co-workers were sociable. Company culture was (is?) 50 years behind the times and very insular.
bad,"The management either is a micromanager and his assistant won’t take responsibility   It is difficult to do your job because the company won’t hold associates and the managers accountable for the policies they want enforcement of   HR ties your hands and when you see a criminal act or violation by associate you can’t notify local police,  The ways that management does things is old and out dated! They say they want  a security department however from the CEO to the AVP and HRVP security has no support and they change policy to what suits their needs!! They won’t listen to the veteran law enforcement officials they have hired and allow them to share the knowledge they have! Instead they have a print manager micromanaging them and leaving holes in the building security.  The CEO violates policy and fails to lead by example that has a trickle down effect on the personnel and they feel they have the same sense of entitlement as he does!! Will not implement the needed security procedures to make the company and building safe."
bad,"I was only working as a temporary position, and the first week there I did not have a computer due to management not submitting my paperwork and was missed training that I should have had with my computer and I believe that reason I was not offered a full time position."
bad,Had Several Problems did not joy the my time there. Employees had an overall negative attitude.
bad,"The management is only worried about how they look to upper management.  They are black and white, to the point where even if upper management doesn't like the manager they play by the rule book to the point they can't be dismissed.  This filters down to the associates and makes everyone work very conservative."
good,Many years I enjoyed working at Cincinnati Financial; however over the past couple years there have been major culture changes. These changes have influenced my decision to explore other options.
good,A nice place to work as the pay is good but definitely not an employee oriented place as there’s definitely too much favoritism and the company’s main concern is for satisfying consumer agents/customers not individuals
good,Currently I take calls and payments and deal with any account problems. I have not been able to learn anything due to management denying me to take my online classes. My co-workers are all 5 years old and cannot get out of their cliques. The hardest part of my job is no transparency when it comes to policy issues or information. The most enjoyable part of my job are the nice customers which are thankful.
good,Good place to work for. Nice environment. Good management. Good resources. Learning environment.I learned many skills there. Co workers are really helpful. Hardest part of the job was delivering within deadlines.

The company tries to keep their employees informed of changes that are happening with the company.  They do provide a way to further your education. The company tries to keep up with the times in their technology."
good,"Cincinnati Financial Corporation and The Cincinnati Insurance Companies have proven to be successful and were making several changes to hopefully improve even more when I was leaving the company. I worked with a great group of people in my department and I developed friendships with several of them. I did relocate to a different city and there were no current positions in the city I was moving to, or I would have stayed with the company! There are SO many different career paths within the company, so once you get a foot in the door you can see which is best for you. Training and development can help you explore the different career paths if you need the help."
