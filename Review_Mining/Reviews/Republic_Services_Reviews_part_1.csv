rating,review
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"Would not recommend this job to anyone, yes the pay is decent but comes with problems. When you catch the supervisors not doing their job and call them out on it they simply turn it around on the employee and write them up or fire them. Very stressful, long hours, not appreciated, just work like dogs and keep doing that everyday. The current supervisors should not be supervisors."
bad,Work you to death  Pay you when they want to  management is a joke  lie to you constantly they are concerned with stock holders not you or the customer
bad,Not enough money to many hours  I wouldn’t recommend anyone there the management is poor they will have you doing extra work for no pay.they will tell you one thing like you will make this and that but once u get on you really not making nothing.the managers have no good communication.
bad,"The job was ok until they fired half of the staff due to immigration issues, they then attempted to make me do twice the work with no compensation. When I began to voice my feelings to my supervisor, she began to write me up for whatever violation she could come up with. I ended up just finding another job."
bad,"Management plays favorites,The A**kissers and whiners get the best routes and equipment.Shady business practices,There is ZERO accountability,upper Mgmt. are some of the most uneducated and dishonest people you will ever meet,they support negativity in the workplace and do nothing to help employees succeed, they are known to start rumors from the top down,giving new drivers horrible guidance Ect. they really make the job harder than it has to be."
bad,"The company puts so much pressure on its employees resulting in finger pointing, insecurity, backstabbing and no employee support.  Management is a joke.  Worse company I’ve ever worked with."
bad,they were defenitly not the besrt company to work for i needed off early occasionaly for kids and most the time that did not happen most the time they felt the garbage was more important then being a parent the reason i left
bad,"99% of callers are upset customers. Call,after call, after call can't breathe. High call volume! Supervisors want you to descalate calls by lying to customers which causes more upset customers in the future when their problem wasn't solved when promised. High turn over rate. This place is not good for your mental health unless you don't care about yourself."
bad,"Basically a typical day is talk to 100+  customers a day. There is no culture here, and you're basically on the phone ran by a computer."
bad,"This company is extremely unorganized ! Management never wants to help employees! Stressful environment, would not recommend if would like to be over worked with little pay"
bad,"This is the worst ghetto Hole that I've ever wrked in. A typical day would be taking abt 60-70 calls from angry cust yelling & cursing b/c their trash has not been p/u in weeks. All you can do is LIE to the cust or try and come up w/a new lie You can tell the cust that you will put in a tckt to ops for a p/u, whch will be IGNORED. Supvsrs are unprofessional, gossiping and laughing w/reps abt other reps. Mngmnt is even worst especially whn a sr.mngr comes to the huddle LOUDLY slurpping on a lollipop.if you like wrking w/loud ignorant weave wearing hood rats then this is the place for you.this company hires from the bottom of the barrel My advice is RUN!! don't walk"
bad,"Lack of training and accountability. Sexism. Racism. I was very unhappy, the job is misleading over worked and underpaid. A lot of underhanded business. I’ve witnessed at least ten people leave in the year plus I was employed"
bad,"Company is a growing company but leadership is not so great advancement opportunities are not equal throughout ,pay is not lining up with job requirements"
bad,"your co workers are brainwashed to rat you out even if you did nothing wrong they will make up things even when there is no incentive, they give you junky trucks that break down and then blame you for no productivity and the bald headed manager will yell at you for it"
bad,"Low pay, bad call center environment.  Micromanaged every second of the day and nonstop phone calls!  Most of the phone calls consist of getting cursed out for trash not being picked up.  Complete waste of employment."
bad,i will not work here then do not pay well below the guide they treat there employee like children. will not work here will not work here will not work
bad,"All was well in the beginning started making really good money, great benefits, paid vacation. Then after 1 year we had a major restructure, it seems of the whole company. My pay was cut in half with no explanation. After several MONTHS of trying to get in touch with management about this I was told the pay cut was due to the new pay structure that we switched to, which when I spoke to the CFO he could not explain to me how exactly our pay was structured! Mind you after my 2nd year the GM and the CFO where fired and escorted off the premises. So that situation was never resolved but even with the pay cut i was still making decent money so I stuck it out. Now at year 5, I received a new to me truck that was better than my previous truck, mind you at times the old truck had no A/C and I'm in Houston with 100 degree summers in the cab it was close to 130. I drove the new truck for right under a year then the last few months that i was at the company was told that they were sending my truck to another yard and I was getting another truck. This was very upsetting so I spoke to my manager and said that's fine what truck am I going in. I was told that I was to go back into my old truck. I told him that it was not acceptable and I would be willing to go back in my old truck if I  had the opportunity to get a newer truck when they arrived in September. I was told that was not gonna happen because seniority had those trucks allocated to people already. After this I said I will not work in that truck another summer with a barely running truck and A/C that sometimes worked was not acceptable"
bad,"Its a place to work but management does not believe in promoting from within or training.  Throws more work at you regardless of what you already have.  Company is good, just management can be better and have some sort of work life balance."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"The office I worked at was all about favoritism, they had their own little group and would give bad attitude to employees.. a few times a lead was very rude to myself and others and she would rarely get written up.. worst company, unless you become besties with the manager there, good luck."
bad,When you finish your route they send you somewhere else. They don’t let you take breaks and the supervisors are always right on top of you tracking you with the GPS. There is no home life at all if you have kids you’ll never see them. I would not recommend working here and the pay is awful
bad,Get stabbed in back by other employees. Watch your back is all I can say about it. The manager dont like you your thru. Good luck if you applied  to a job there.
bad,"1) Extremely punitive managerial style, you will always know what is wrong with your work but rarely told how well you are doing."
bad,Bad co two mean bosses that interrogate u and think dey better den everyone .waste if time bad co boo dont go here no I would never go bak fr . Bad co no no
bad,"GM was removed from one location due to the BU failing and moved to a prosperous succeeding BU. Now the succeeding location is failing miserably! Everything this GM has had hands on has caused things to spoil. This GM and BU are failing the market, failing their clients and failing their employees."
bad,Wasn't a good experience.  Met some nice people. But other than that. It was not a good experience. No room for advancement.  A lot of chaos. When the machine  breaks down. We had to take days off  without  pay. Or use our vacation  days. I can go on  and on. But I'm glad I finally  found another  job.
bad,They pay a day rate. And the pay is very low. Plus the Supervisor lack training and are very rude. And also the trucks brake down all the time. So I would not recommend anybody that I know to this company.
bad,"Higher management are decietful, backstabbing, only care about themselves, no moral, no ethics, no principles and pays like a rubbish. Don't waste your career for this company."
bad,If you want a 20 cent raise and terrible health benefits and work every weekend this is the place for you! No room for advancement . Terrible employer.
bad,"This is the worst trash company to work for. On top of poor management and trucks constantly breaking down, the Teamsters union does not have your back. Do some research on this company before you apply. They are crooked"
bad,"Started with republic about a month ago, training (if you want to call it that) is ok. Was told they’d take it easy on me starting out since I’m new , 2nd day out on my own got a 12 hour route got back at 8pm , clocked in at 6am .. long hours and disorganization seems to be the norm there.. If you want a work/ personal life balance then stay away, which is funny because they talk about that every meeting, but fail to make it happen. Things need to change quickly there."
bad,"Horrible. Another scale operator was hired at a higher wage than me and I was there for 7 years at the time. Unfair, unacceptable, so I quit after 9 years and lived happily ever after!!"
bad,"This is the worst company I ever worked for, management is horrible, hours are terrible,truck was always breaking down.I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"The plant manager have his picks, they unorganized, they lie about the job description and they use you and don’t pay enough I would not recommend this job to anyone I"
bad,"starting out at any garbage company is tough, you are at the bottom of the food chain. Good pay ($30 hour) but doesn't make up for the 12-16 hour days, unknown what route you will be on the next day depending on what everyone else in seniority chooses. Training initially was good on a side loader, but when they wanted me to operate a rear loader, front loader or a smaller vehicle on extremly winding roads with hard to get to stops (500 plus) and get the route done in 8 hours, no breaks...thats when the job began to suck! the majority of the trucks broke down and you were still expected to get the route done. On any given day approximately 4-7 trucks were towed into the yard. I saw two burn to the ground. Management does not care about their drivers or their safety. Its get the route done at all costs!"
bad,"It's  not  the job it's  the people  and management  and unfair favoritism among "" certain employees""and ""certain supervisors"" that makes working for Republic Services .A NIGHTMARE  !!  And very regrettable place to ever work in your life supervisors aren't professional and they are very unorganized Etc.  The work place is most likely always not up to code regulation with OSHA. I spent 5 years "
bad,"really suckie building, parking, no training, management quitting all the time, no encouragement from team mates or managers, lots of backstabbing, not interested in any improvements"
bad,Work there for almost a year all management did was scream and holler at me all the time seem like nothing you do pleases them they say it does but then again they turn around talk bad behind your back not a good place to work.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,Chattanooga TN site is A joke it's ran by people that have never been in the garbage world  and management doesn't know what they're doing cutting people's pay it's just totally ran wrong
bad,"I was never late for work, never had a write from a customer. I was at 6 pts (the max) they took one point because of snow... 2 days b 4 I was fired I had a FMLA meeting for my papers. They have clicks, Supv sit around laughing at those they fire. I even email the CEO provided all this info, no response since last Aug. They treat ppl like they are nobody. The only job I worked that u had to lie to customers and RS allowed b/c they didn’t have their stuff together..."
bad,"Managers can't stop lying for some reason.  I've been in this industry for over 30 years. Only place I've ever worked where the managers will literally threaten you on a regular basis.  It's mormon ran. You're basically garbage in thair eyes if you're not Seriously bad"
bad,"Training was useless, trainer was gone more than she was there! And then it's like I will show you then you go to your desk and work. They have a revolving door with people leaving either the Department or the company. If they let you go they WILL NOT PAY YOU THE VACATION YOU EARNED!!!"
bad,"Management doesn't agree on anything. They do no route the pick ups correctly and they do not care. The only thing that matters is that you get the route picked up. You do not receive any proper training on the route. Therefore, if you move to a new area and you do not know your way around you are basically just thrown out in a truck and told to figure it out."
bad,"Poor management,you get in trouble for just about anything,you get in trouble for unscheduled breaks, Sup’s are rude,to much call center politics,RUN!"
bad,"Worked at the plant in New Boston. I was a front end loader operator, hilo operator, and i knew how to work by the baler, and when time for raises came around, they gave me 12 cents. Very unappreciative company with horrible management. I worked 12 hours a day 7 days a week and I was still struggling to make ends meet. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLANT."
bad,Recent changes in the management structure has called into question the stability of this position.  Management is no longer concerned with employee comfort in the workplace or their home/work balance.
bad,Worse place I ever worked!  Management is very racist and everybody sleeps around with everybody there. They call the work recyclables but half of what you do is not  recyclable  It is sorting through household garbage.
bad,If you'd want too. Rub together pennies trying. To make a quarter this is the job for u. No paid down time trucks litterly junk lucky to make it thru a shift. You'd be better off working seasonal you would make more $
bad,"Don’t waste your time working for Republic Services out of Oklahoma, City. I hear Republic in other states are wonderful, but Oklahoma City has the worst management, mechanics, and work environment that I have ever been apart of. I was a driver there for 3 years. They leave you in 100+ degree weather with no air conditioning in 75% of the trucks. Also they let lead/swing drivers pick up what they feel like and go home before the regular drivers."
bad,"They suck especially for women! Also not just for women they suck for men as well! In Tucson , Arizona they don't give a s*** about anybody man or woman. Bad company to work for! It's hard to have family time!"
bad,"I would not give a recommendation for anyone to work for this company especially in the Houston area.  The people at the top are only concerned about making money for themselves.  Riases are not worth it,. The preach all this structure and family to get you to work for them and a month later that's out the window.  There is no such thing as fairness."
bad,Just not worth wasting your life working here when there is no team work involved when sorting here and they have useless temps come in and let so much debris go by which gets stuck in the screen causing down time causing so much loss in productivity.
bad,"taking anywhere from 70 to 100 calls a day, more to trash than throwing it out & container sizes, management is unidentifiable, unprofessional and useless. Workplace culture and moral is somber, hardest part is having to spend 8 hrs having to lie to customers that pay this trash company. Most enjoyable is receiving my paycheck."
bad,"I wasted 8 years working in all fields to residential,commercial,industrial,"
bad,My experience at Republic was the worse experience ever. Management is only focused on meeting the numbers so that they can cash their big bonuses and they don't care about anybody else.
bad,"Terrible place to work"
bad,"If you like low pay, being micromanaged, being belittled and being hit on by managers than this job is for you my darling. The pay is low for all that you have to do and go through. If you decide to work at Republic than make sure to keep your resume updated because you will get fired for anything; the doors are constantly rotating. Also make sure to keep a part time job and/or a roommate; this job does not provide financial peace or stability. Good luck, you have been warned ."
bad,"The worst place to work ever!!!  No home life work minimum of 10 to 14 hours a day just to keep of the junk garbage trucks to do routes. They buy cheap trucks and they break all the time. No on Job training,  safety is a joke only applies to fit that situation.  Managment is the worst unskilled or qualified people to manage."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"All this location cares about is spreadsheets, not the employees or the amount of customers they have lost over the years.  It is a daily struggle to get the garbage off the ground with the amount of break downs  from trucks, from all lines of business.  The shop is a one star rated shop company wide. The employees feel the strain when they have to assist with other route and management does not care.  Then they wonder why accidents happen.  Management talks a good game in front of leadership but never delivers.  I call this “The dog and pony show”.  The amount of time wasted sitting in useless meetings is mind blowing to me!  "
bad,Job is horrible managers don't know what they're doing half the time the landfill roads and hills are not safe ops managers force there subordinates to do the work and hr is not good at all if your lucky they won't be sleeping with and higher ups
bad,I worked at this company for a decent amount of time. I decided to end my employment when a great woman (my manager) was 1 year from retirement and they chose to wrongfully terminate her employment for something a person in another department did.
bad,"Management is a joke. Bring in a bunch of college chumps that don't have a clue about the waste industry and expect them to know how to fix a division. Falling apart trucks and losing customers left and right. This company doesn't care about you, your family or their customers."
bad,I was laid off when Longevity Alliance was acquired but then they hired me back.  It took me NO time to accept my position again.  Drive Time hired me back because they didn't know what a good employee I was.
bad,I worked early morning shift.I learned a lot about how important garbage was to us.Management was horrible the couldn't keep up with time off days.Hardest part of this job was to keep if very professional when he supervisors are condescending I met great people theer.
bad,"What can I say, it was a starter job straight out of trucking school. At that point being in dept, everybody needs employment, and I really thought at FIRST, wow....this is my retirement career job. Well that changed 2 years later...."
bad,The Company took over another large Company that had just recently (2 years prior) adopted a new program that was good for its employees and the people. The program was changing the Culture and the people were loving their jobs. When Republic took over; their decisision was to scrap the program and change it to Their way. Failed to identify the changes in the people and that the program more than paid for itself
bad,"Got hired at an heavy equipment operator first shift, went for orientation sat there for 6 hours to be told that I was not hired for what was agreed to and the hourly wage was not the same. After being accused of knowing that the manager went into the emails and admitted to being wrong and had no available work for what I was hired for. Also had been accused of taking drugs because of my red eyes. NEVER have I been so embarrassed. They are EXTREMELY unorganized and Extremely unprofessional... STAY AWAR RUN DONT WALK!"
bad,"stressful, incompetent, poor equipment, management blames drivers for everything no matter what, huge favoritism terrible atmosphere very low morale. steady decline in management and overall decisions"
bad,"Management is inexperienced and ignorant of lean management, leadership and ignores company policy and the union contract. THE UNION REPS ARE IN THE BACK POCKET OF MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS."
bad,This Job Was Terrible I Didn’t Like The Trash And The Dust Everywhere And Also The Smell. Co Workers Were Not Working As A Team And Was Moving Slow I Wasn’t Getting Paid Enough For All The Work I was Doing There. I Had To Resign  After I Found Another Job.
bad,Just another day and time that works for you and it made day go by faster. Had to start the day with a early morning or late evening . 4am is to early for me now.
bad,Management has a bad role is the treatment of their employees. I find they lie and cover up to protect themselves instead of the employees who make them look like stars.
bad,"Horrible management very rude "
bad,"I can not rate this site as I never worked for Republic Waste. They bought out Allied Waste long after I had left. "
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,lucky if your truck makes out of the yard.couldnt trust other drivers.very bad management.if you were a supervisors bff things were sweet but if you did your job and stayed by yourself things were not so sweet
bad,"This company has poor management and poor morals.  This company located in the midland/odessa area  had awful management. This is a very hostile office. The GM doesn’t care about customers,  or employees for that matter, he only cares about the dollars that are going into his pocket."
bad,"The culture there was very bad, lots of harassment. Management would not do enough to stop it. Training was  inadequate. The culture was very strange. Very long drives home."
bad,Would not recommend this position. Too stressful and all about numbers not customer service. Management never there when needed. Too much harassment with no ability to assist customers
bad,Worst place EVER! Don’t EVER waste your time here!  Your over worked and management is HORRIBLE! Management SUCKS! Not worth my time! I won’t recommend this job to ANYONE!
bad,"This company does not follow its own mission.  There not respect of those that do the job.  Management is cut throat and out for themselves."
bad,"Horrible mgmt! Accounts Receivables manager is the worst, very abusive to the employees. Never express appreciation, always highlight mistakes & weaknesses! "
bad,This company is very difficult to work at in which there is no hard work like this company. Not only you have keep a fast pace throughout the whole 8 hours or more.
bad,"Not interested in rating this company or its managers or a work day "
bad,Don't do it worst place to work you think think you have found the promise Land but that's all they do is promise and and come up with excuses to not fufill the promises they make
bad,This company was completely unfair in the fact that when I went to go get my heart surgery and go through recovery they did not compensate me whatsoever on the hand I was dealt. They never even considered calling me to see if their own employee was okay after the surgery.
bad,"I worked for this company and it was the worst experience I ever had . Management is very unorganized, unprofessional. I overheard a conversation regarding African Americans and braids and tattoos. I went to hr about what I heard and was advised it was a misunderstanding. On top of overworking and lack of advancement. I decided to quit and go to a company and make less pay but appreciated like any hard worker should . Don’t waste your time . The turn over rate is high because of lack of training and mangers . Nice pay but a waste of time!!!"
bad,horrible management.  never coached and managed out place.  do not care about their employees.  over-worked and underpaid for the job.  management was focused on other things than their employees
bad,If you are ready to become a number. No advancement from within. If you are not a union shop get ready to ready to be screwed. Loyalty to company is ignored. Stay away from Boise shop.
bad,"Too many things going on in a small building, lazy maintaince team that often lacks the necessary knowledge to get things fixed, and a management team that is only in it for themselves and doesn't care about there employees needs in the building"
bad,"I enjoy working but the weather was a big issue , we had to go out side in the rain , just as it was thundering. I was happy with the management, but the coworkers weren't to friendly."
bad,"They are unprofessional glad I am not working for them , they did not have the decency to email or call me to let me know if I did not get the job, if they do this to applicants imagine how they must treat their clients"
bad,was interviewed in a trailer closet and was not impressed with the work environment next to a shop with a lot of noise and smell from the garbage trucks with cubes that had carpet in them not at all sanitary.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,Horrible management always make up rules everyday to try to make your life harder. If you fall behind you never got help from management to get your route done. Pay is horrible for what management wants you to do. If management gets yelled at management take it out on their employees/crew because they don’t do their own job expect drivers to do it all for them.
bad,"Terrible atmosphere, the management is corrupt. They don't comply to osha regulations as far as their employees being certified on machinery. No room for advancement. 10 hour shifts with only one 15 mintute break with a 30 min lunch break."
bad,The company has consistantly made changes in our pay structure and the market we are allowed to sell to. They now look at sales as a expense instead of revenue producing. Upper management is not intune with sales because all of them come from a operations background. My typical day was to cold call on 20 to 25 accounts and try to earn their business.
bad,Every morning would start out at dark at residences waking people up with these loud trucks.I didn't learn anything at this company that I didn't already know.
bad,They will lie to you to get in the door. Management is terrible and will throw you under the bus as quick as they can. This place is the worst if you want to have a life and a family.
bad,The immediate supervisor and management don’t care about how little you’ve slept.   they only care about making sure the trucks are up and running even if your sleep deprived. You usually work 50-60 hrs a pay period and have no personal life it’s a crummy work enciornment
bad,"When Republic Services took over City Carton things went downhill. You were no longer a part of the family, you were just a number. Any issues that were brought to management were not taken care of, instead they'd rather tell you to fix it for them to make their job easier."
bad,"After being a driver and a supervisor, even though I was hired to be a supervisor, I asked about the bonus and was told I had yet to do anything exceptional.  Myself and another supervisor carried the extra workload during the summer, violating company policy.  Operations Manager would not hire appropriate number of drivers to cover the extra work.  Then I was told I was not performing my supervisory reports adequately on the days I was stuck in a truck."
bad,"Bad pay, low paying job, stressful, unfair management, hardest part of job outside in all elements of weather. Best part nothing. Would not recommend this place to anyone"
bad,thumbs down sucks back stabbing weasels cowards pieces of liers worms sunnge beetles trashy people with no morals or sense of pride will turn their back on you
bad,"Don't work for them! It is a terrible work environment, with unbelievably terrible management! Such a joke! Always the management against the employees, never a team effort."
bad,"If you want to be miserable, sad, unhappy, stressed, unfulfilled...then this is the company for you.  One of my colleagues said last week...coming into work is a traumatic experience.  Please save yourself the headache and steer clear of this company."
bad,"Lots of favoritism,  lots of snakes that work there that pose as your friends until something happens, then they act as if they don't know you,  And management will lie  on  you just to cover there own butts. If your looking for a place to work at to be Depressed, miserable, Gossiping, Lazy people,  and a cut throat environment then this is your lucky day ?   If not then don't apply."
bad,"Upper Management was really bad starting from the operations manager on up. They do not care about employees, its all about the bottom line and the morale was bad."
bad,"I did not like this company when they sold to republic their managers picked their favorites it was very unorganized , very stressful work environment, no advancement"
bad,"First off they start you off at $15 an hour, then after a couple months they do some sort of slide of hand tell you that you are getting paid by the ton and that bring your check down to almost $10 an hour.  And if you get too much overtime they cut that pay down too.  They dock 30 minutes lunch time daily but don't want you to take it.  It is very cut throat, supervisors are only out to save themselves, drivers are only a number to them.  The trucks are old, they brake down daily, and the mechanics do not properly fix them, they band - aid them just to get them out of the shop."
bad,This is a filthy job with low pay where management has no respect for employees.  It has consistently gone down hill since they purchased City Carton and left behind all ethics and positive qualities that they had.
bad,"The worst place I've ever worked. They are unwilling to work with you , regardless of your home situation. They let management bully you, and HR doesn't work with you for anything."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,If you want long hours horrible management  horrible pay well then this is the place for you and the list goes on and on i wouldn't work at this company if it was The last job on Earth also a lot of shady business practices
bad,"Probably the worst place I've worked in 21 years of billing and collection .unprofessional, horrible management, micromanagement , heavy workload unreasonable expectations, too much work and not enough pay."
bad,"Such a great company to work for but people on management is what is running this company to the ground. Supervisors are two face,they will make your life miserable."
bad,"I witnessed plenty of good people get let go because management did not think they fit the company culture. It does not matter how well you do your job, how well you help customers, or how productive you are-if management doesn't like the way you look, good bye. If you're introverted? Good bye! "
bad,"Expect to have no life!"
bad,"The conditions in which I worked were a joke, port a potty since we could not go in and use the bathroom. poor management. Sick time is non existant. I do not reccomend ."
bad,"If you don't have a life and what to work like a mechanic slave this is your place to be, they work schedule is over 40+ hours including Saturday. The starting time to work is after 3 pm they will lie about it."
bad,Disrepectful theives. Racist power tripping teamleaders. White american coworkers disrespect brown americans on the daily by violating personal space and property.
bad,was bought by republic but maintained the culture of allied.  Not a great place to work and its too bad they couldn't adopt a more forward thinking culture.
bad,Every day was hectic and Management turn over provided an unstable environment.  This turned into an every man for himself atmosphere.  Stability and lower compensation made the division a very hard place to work.
bad,When I started it seemed awesome then came lies and broken promises then when their one fleet bs came on and it was more about how pretty the shop was then fixing trucks
bad,Terrible place to work.   Management does not care about you or your safety.  Overworked and under paid.  Same company has surrounding divisions that pay better.  Always pressured to speed up which leads to accidents.  No two people are treated the same .  Bloomington has the highest turnover rate in the company.  Route supervisor needs to go and it would operate smoothly.  Cutthroat and back stabbing environment. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!
bad,Did not pay commissions as agreed.  Stopped answering his phone and emails to collect commissions.   Owner was excessively mean and abusive toward employees with yelling and bullying.
bad,"job required more than one person I was given unsafe trucks to drive that endangered myself and the public, the garbage was behind the houses there was no limit to what each person or family could leave I had to retrieve all and return barrels my self"
bad,"I applied for 2 different positions with this company. Both through the same recruiter. The first position I was stood up by the interviewing manager the first attempt at an interview, and ignored by the recruiter until I sent an email to corporate HR. Then the hiring manager for the first position calls me to tell me to apply for the 2nd position, as he had to hire someone else because they had previously mishandled his application. On the 2nd position, that I was told to apply to, I never heard from the recruiter anything about the position, despite leaving 3 voicemails. There is no wonder the turnover is so bad here. I am fortunate to have a place of employment, but I felt anyone who applies should know what kind of experience they are in for."
bad,"Management was terrible. My supervisor was a new hire with my training class and treated me like she wanted me to fail. No support from upper management about it. I used the restroom while at work, because like a normal human, I need to go. She timed me and I got written up."
bad,"That bought the business and took over the pre-on-going business and let go the people that had a lot of time in, and did not give any year of serviced paid."
bad,"From the moment I walked into the building all of the managers were rude, during training they kept having these meetings with our training class and these people never had a positive thing to say and the worse part is I was hired in thoughts that I would be making $16 an hour to only be making $14 and no one could tell us when it would increase"
bad,poor work culture and poor pay rate with no area of growth. I would suggest that anyone come to the location even if it is your last result. Keep looking
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,As a temp  was really terrible place to be.With my work ethic i have I was totally ashamed of being here.That being said.Typical day as a thrower is a very hard job.The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting kids waiting  for you with water as you picked up there garbage.
bad,Not recommended. A typical day at work is to be micromanaged and not given the opportunity to take breaks as per state and federal regulations require. Hardest part of the job was induring being on your feet for 10 hours with no break and having to walk 3 miles in order to take your lunch.
bad,"great place to work, nice place, new environment new call center ect nothing else needs better trained people and more organization with the calls and"
bad,Horrible management with liltitle to no rewards always no budget to fix quality repairs. Horrible shifts with no consideraction for family time. Lil to no rewards for going above and beyond your job.
bad,"Every day was different."
bad,"Bias, prejudice group of people, from management on down... Inconsistent work, chaotic work environment... Management wants to see their workers fail and not excel. They are fault finders who do not praise their workers for a job well done, yet they will most certainly acknowledge your faults. They play games with people's livelihood and stream them along with false promises/false hopes. They sit and watch their truck drivers on cameras all day, because there are cameras in the truck for ""insurance"" purposes. it's a job that could be enjoyable, but the super micro-managing, eye-spying camera methods/games kills that altogether... And so does the bias management team."
bad,"Stay away from this job , not worth the pay and the management is horrible. They don't care for your personal life and they will keep you out all day and force you to help with another route after doing your own. 800-1400 homes per day."
bad,"I worked here as a temp for 8 months. A month in my job responsibilities changed, was given more to do with no pay increase. 2 months in, I have more responsibilities due to someone leaving (hated Republic and found a better job) still no pay increase but receiving glowing reviews from management. 3 months in I'm being promised permanent positions as soon as temp agency releases me. From this point on I'm given way more responsibilities, pretty much the office manager ordering office supplies, completing reports I received no proper training to complete, still being patted on the back and now I'm asked to please not look for another job because I have an incredible pay increase and permanent job waiting. Finally able to interview for a job, according to the sup I'm the best candidate, have the best interviews and she tells me I pretty much have the job. One day I'm asked to create a spreadsheet for the manager, he asked how long it would take to complete. I gave him an honest answer and expressed I had one major pressing thing that I had to finish up, but would get to his task immediately after. According to supervisor, the manager didn't like my answer. From that moment on (while still performing the same, producing the same quality work) he didn't like my reports, or my work. This man never approached me to inform me that my work was lacking, or was subpar, or to complain about anything that I was doing, but because he did not like literally one response from me (which by the way, was never addressed with me either) he tells my supervisor that while I was qualified for the"
bad,"Training was a joke. they don't teach you half of what you need to know. their attendance and pto policy changes at the drop of a hat and you can get let go very easily. management is a joke unless you are part of a click, then you are golden. they expect an awful lot from their employees and while overtime is not mandatory you are looked down on if you do not work some overtime"
bad,Company Sucks. high turn over  stay away management dont know what they are doing dont pay the right overtime pay you make less then 8 dollars an hour
bad,"Many nights came home crying after working 10 or 12hr days.  Managers are terrible.  They have no clue  what is going on.  Management uses all minions  to do the reports to make them look good.  And they take credit for the reports not the actual employees.   And believe  me if a report is wrong you will hear about it!   But will get absolutely nothing in return for doing them and the better you are the more you will be required to do!  "
bad,"Antiquated behemoth whose policies are crafted to the lowest common denominator - the hourly truck driver position, which has lots of turnover. Behind the times."
bad,"Low morale due to horrific management, daily bullying by management, expected to be on-call but will not pay to be on-call, always negative, work 12-14 hour shifts without breaks, sometimes no lunches, different rules for different people, I got the highest raise out of all the scale operators for being there 1 year, and got .20cents per hour extra, no set schedule."
bad,"I was a mechanic for republic for almost 10 years. The management is horrible. After leaving my salary is 6 dollars more an hour at my new job. I was a first shift mechanic in bishopville where my duties consisted of door traffic, road calls, big scheduled repairs etc. since I've left they haven't found a stable mechanic to handle the work load. They have since fired the general manager who not ever listen to anyone on the help that was needed. So glad to be gone from this olace"
bad,"Horrible place to work, the pay is horrible and the management has no idea what they are doing. They give you very old trucks to drive and they are very unsafe. do work work for this company. Pay if horrible too."
bad,"On my first day, I asked my supervisor what I would be doing, her  response was ""We don't know yet. I was the only contractor that had to sign in and out on the login book in the front entrance every time I left for breaks and lunch. .They wasted my time"

bad,Horrible place to work nepotism at its finest here.  Thank God they got bought out by a better company. Do not apply if they ever come back.
bad,"Drivers are the most important employees, but everyone forgets who the customers communicate with.  Customer service is who makes it all go, if they don't take the calls, set up services, take complaints, request trucks to return for missed pick ups, where would the rest of the company be?  Management fails to provide product, ie trash, recycle and yard waste containers. being out of stock is a huge disservice to the customer and employees that have to handle the complaints"
bad,"long days, no money,bad place to work.unless you will kiss up to the boss.routes to big,starting workers make more than someone that has been there for years..no job security."
bad,"Words say safety is a top priority, unfortunately actions say bottom line profit has become top priority. Compensation is different at different business units.  Maybe hourly and time and a half overtime is fair. But if they pay a day rate with coefficient overtime RUN. You are not allowed to work under 40 even if you finish your union bid routes. They will run you into the ground and punish you for being efficient."
bad,"bad management, very negative work environment would not recommend this place to anyone. Low pay but benefits are okay."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Hired for 24 hours a week and worked at least 50 hours a week with no benefits. Took out hour lunch even though never got to take a lunch. Would go in at 630am and not get off until 7 or 8pm waiting on drivers to finish their routes. Was supposed to get off at 4pm. Horrible management who would scream at you inches from your face for things they did wrong, not you! Also, couldn't get any time off but management took more time than they had off. I have never worked with such horrible people in my life. I have a great job now, with wonderful people and I am paid a lot more."
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. Trust me you can find better. They treat you like dirt and will work you to death. The regional HR Manager would point her finger in my face and literally yell at me. I have since moved on to have a successful career with a company that actually has a great culture."
bad,if you like a local feel this is not a good company - the corporate structure does not favor customers and never employees - good benefits but unrealistic goals and objectives
bad,Very stressful place to work.  AP Manager and Director treat employees poorly.  You go work with a very heavy workload manager will call in you to pick at everything possible under the sun.
bad,If you work here stay to yourself and do your job. They will try everything to get rid of you if they dont like you I know to many good people they did this to stand clear and watch your back
bad,poor poor poor management. if anyone called DOT today the company would go under. no training. No organization. Lazy workers. Management has not a clue of the equipment knowledge.blind leading the blind.
bad,Picking up trash .I learned about the trash business management couldn't get it together . Seemed no one there was happy . The hardest part of the job was jumping in and out at every stop and having to dump trash dumpsters. Really wasn't a very enjoyable job.
bad,"Been interviewed 3 times for an operators position. Been an operator for 37 years and can out operate anyone they have there. Practically was given the job but never called back. These guys are  ""full of lies"""
bad,Management has no respect or compassion for employees. Most of the co-workers are very pleasant to work with. Management is very disorganized every morning. The days are very long and unpleasant.
bad,"not a good company to work for,  never know what you were going to do each day as they would pull you from your assigned job. had no respect for the management after they changed personnel , the hardest part of the job was showing up / best  part was going home"
bad,When I got hired I was told how great this company is. How great the benefits are. You get interview by 3 people when you go in for the interview.  They ask you all these dumb questions standard nowadays.  I was hired as a driver helper.  They told me I would make anywhere between 500 and 800 a week. Typical days was starting at 6 till you finished with your route.  Not that hard of a job. I worked here for 4 months never once had a paycheck over 500 Dollars.  The managers are really lazy. Don't care about their workers. Everything is put on the driver's I seen at least 4 driver quit in the 4 months I worked there. Always hiring new employees that never work longer then a month.  You really have no family life. It's just work work work. After working here 4 months I couldn't afford to work here any longer so I found a better paying job. One of the worst places I ever worked.  I'm thankful that the Lord blessed me with a better opportunity.  Their are a lot of unhappy employees working for this company.  All I heard from other employees was complaining about the job. It seem like everyone working there was looking for a way out like it was jail. They would give each other job leads. Never in my 38 yrs have I ever seen so many unhappy employees working for a company.  This company really need to step back and look at what their doing.  I never hated a job till I got this one. I hate to talk bad about this company but it's the truth. You work way to much for the little pay they give you. Sometimes I had to work on my day off just to make it. You'll work between 50 to 60 hours for

bad,"I went through a temp agency to get the position here. Training was good just long. Then we were tossed out to the wolves. We learned then that training didn't cover what you actually needed to know.  Your in house management team were no help, probably because they didn't know themselves. My main issue with management was that if I wanted to gossip they had time but if I had a true work related question or issue and needed help they disappeared. I personally called the office, ""The Land of Rejects"", people who were fired from their previous job and just needed a paycheck."
bad,learn some new life skills - this is just a job and really not a step in the way I would like to go and be
bad,Equipment very old and money not often put into busines to keep it going. Very poor safety awareness. Trucks in bad condition. No straps and equipment available for trucks. Many tire blow outs and truck break downs.
bad,"Typical day at work very stressful..."
bad,"If you would like to be disrespected on an daily basis and treated like your in preschool and don't have a brain in your head, this is the perfect place to be employed at.  Supervisor's here don't have a clue to how to manage people and will never be productive in a positive way.  And recently, a supervisor that doesn't follow any republic protocall towards how to act on accidents/injuries was promoted to a higher position that he cannot perform either. There are meetings after meetings on how we should be doing our job and how to do it safely, but yet the managment team we have never lets us work safely, they continue to harass us verbally and mentially to where we don't wanna be at work.  And to dwell on safety, that is pounded into our heads daily, but that never is the truth.  This company is never worrried about safety, they are more and always be worried about how fast it is done and how quick they can get the manpower off the clock and safety never matters, just ask our current route auditor that question and then ask our current ops manager if he understands rules and english and how he didn't follow one guide line when safety of a fellow employee didn't matter and how certain steps were overlooked and mis guided and mis informed and falsely filled out and now have a route auditor that will never be the same again!!"
bad,Poor safety practices. Promote driver safety but poor management of their facilities.
bad,"Had interview with site & operations manager.  Nice people to talk with."
bad,"Manager plays favortism to toward employees, there is no room for advancement, the hours are back breakingly long, no phrase when a good job is done."
bad,"The environment in that company is so angry. All supervisors treat you terribly. They have a face in front of management but as soon the manager turns the corner is like a switch! They're unhappy,  rude, haters, and never available to help you of you need anything job related. They'd humiliate you on any given opportunity.  The manager is a puppet manipulated by one of the most hateful woman I've ever met in my life. The poor guy doesn't have a mind of his own.  All employees are angry and unhappy too. They're rude on the phone with each other but I don't blame them the supervisors are super rude on the phone when they explain something to you when they finally answer! Their system is arkaic, old, and their moto is we manage this business as we go. They tell you one thing on the interview,  we dont measure that, we like to have fun, BS!!!! Dare anybody to even try to have a laugh there! They don't let you breathe. You feel suffocated. Don't even dare to make friends and talk to your coworkers then the supervisors will be there to tell you something.FORGET about teamwork! You get 30 mins lunch and there's not even a place walking distance there to buy your lunch when you couldn't bring any. And the breaks are very short. Most call centers give you 2 20mins breaks here you get 2 15mins and 30 you feel like you can't take a breather.Ah! And the politics! Almost everyone is a backstabber rat ...everyone for themselves! And FORGET about growing its all personal not business and nothing about how good of a job you do!"
bad,They are an anti-union company and would rather starve their employees out than give them fair wages. I worked there for nearly 10 years and only made $4 more when I left than when I started. They have awful mangement and benefits. You will be overworked for a disapointing check. They will also use anything they can to fire you. They have a three strike accident policy that doesn't matter if the cost is $1 or thousands. Even if you offer to pay for the damages yourself. Their healthcare benifits are expensive if you have a family for poor coverage and they wouldn't give my wife life insurance because she is on meds. This is a hostile place to work with a constant war between the company and its union employees. Their 3 year contract will run out this Oct. where they will intimidate you not to strike by bringing in a higher paid group of  workers they call the blue crew to do your job if you strike. And will lock you out and refuse to negotiate or force you to work without a contract for about 6 months before they agree to about a 2% raise and higher insurance costs to you.     
bad,Managerment is VERY poor one sided
bad,this is a horrible company to work for. Management is horrible and only care about getting their bonus. You work LONG hours and get treaded like a dog. I would NOT recommend this company to anyone. You would be better off working at Mcdonalds.!
bad,I don't work in the shop I am a driver. It is not a good place to work. Unless you like walking on egg shells. Know matter what you do or how much you accomplish in a day it will never be good enough and to work at this branch you have to enjoy being belittled.
bad,A typical day starts at 5am. Weall would meet in the break room to get yelled at and then sent to work. Management was uncaring. We worked very hard in extreme conditions with 2 15 minute breaks and 1 30 minute break.Then we would get off at 1:30 pm.
bad,"Too many favorites in this location.only worked 2nd shift, got all the garbage jobs"
bad,"The worse company I’ve worked for, favoritism, rude & disrespectful. Ops manager is a joke. No such thing as HR! They’ll leave you out for 12 hours everyday. No such thing as PTO, can’t even get 1 day off to go to the doctors!  50-55 hours every week no matter if you want it. Forced overtime, pay a lot for medical. Operations is ran by a bunch of clowns. Save your time, run away quick! Don’t even waste your time.!"
bad,"Wasn’t a bad experience but could have been better with the people and how everything was managed, didn’t treat there workers the best when working on business operations"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,The only good thing about this company is the vacation time and personal time. The supervisors and managers do nothing but lie to you. The trucks are absolute junk and maintenance team is lacking in knowledge or experience. Best bet is to steer clear of this company period. Your safety means nothing to them despite what they say.
bad,"Bad from the start. Rushed through training and put on route. False promises regarding raises, quality of trucks etc. Drivers openly berated and humiliated. Not at all what I was expecting."
bad,"poor management! I was a driver and let me tell you,  You don’t wanna work there. Not enough mechanics. And the mechanics they do have are a bunch of idiots. The mechanic supervisor gets bonuses for not fixing equipment. I worked there for 10 years and just imagine no air condition at all in the summertime in a hot truck. So like I said you’re better off elsewhere do not waste your time working for this company there are real companies out there where you can make decent money . The benefits suck. And there is little to no room at all for advancement within."
bad,This is entire company is run by a bunch of good ol boys. Favoritism runs this company. The absolute worst people get promoted. GO work for Athens or Waste management.
bad,The most unsafe place I have ever worked. No travel pay or per diem. No direction from management whatsoever. Housing was ok and the pay was about average for the area.
bad,"Waste Management location was acquired by Republic Services."
bad,The manager had my position doing everyone’s job.  They run equipment that is not close to Dot standards and unsafe.    The manager won’t shut  down dangerous equipment and scolds you for trying to do your job correctly and shutting down for repairs.  Constantly threatening to write you up or fire you for everything.  Hostile and threatening work environmenT.  Worse place I have worked in 35 years.
bad,Management pockets money instead of giving it to the drivers whom does all the work. They will have broken down trucks and instead of renting some they will just let customers trash sit to save money. If management wasn’t terrible it would be a great place to work
bad,"favoritism, racism, and ageism, not a fundamental sound place to work, if you are an older worker, I wouldn't apply to republic stay away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Have to deal unprofessional supervisor will be little you they'll say there joking but they are full of it.no advancement junk equipment always breaking down.
bad,If you wanna work at a place where you constantly being belittle by management and employees + bullying + harassment well that’s the place for you  to work otherwise I would suggest keep it moving... the office staff and dispatch were so unprofessional they are all into your personal business. The mechanics don’t fixed nothing they just patched every work order they got. Which is not safe for all the Drivers’s remember @ the end of the day you still has a family to go home too they do not Care about you life’s They changed so many supervisors in a year that I work there just like a revolving doors so ridiculous. I would not recommend this job to anyone who wants to succeed in life and want to be financially stable.
bad,Old worn out equipment break down weekly.. if you donot finish your route you are expected to work weekends.. management is worst I ever seen..a gotcha culture everything is blamed on driver .there's a reason a now hiring signs been out front for 6 years..Driver beware
bad,"I hardly know where to begin with this company ..Everything from the Yorktown branch manager  ,to their trainers is extremely unprofessional..They offer one of the poorest CDL training programs I have ever had the mis-fortune of being involved with ..I don’t about the rest of the company but the Yorktown branch is very inconsistent with their work ethic..And their equipment is always breaking down ,which in turn puts more stress on the drivers ..Last but not lease if you decide to work at the Yorktown ,Va branch WATCH what you say around the staff because they like to run their mouths .."
bad,"Unfair treatment of employees, he said she said then termination. They dont send w2 to terminated employees, giving endless run around. With absolutely no solution in site after 3 weeks of calling, getting numbers that dont work."
bad,"Absolutely the worst job ive ever had. Lack of management, the managers are idiots and only care about fudging paper work to make their numbers look good. Safety is the lowest priority there, they just keep running every single employee in the ground more. Equipment is junk facillity is embarrassing. The best part of this job was leaving"
bad,"90 hour work weeks and the preach safety, I often was falling asleep at the wheel of our work pick up trucks. The company dropped my spouse from my insurance sticking us with a $38K medical bill."
bad,"I am surprised, I worked in eden prairie , mn location for 2 years , in the face of it you are valuable driver, after 2 years you are just a number , they can fire you anytime , bad management, I quit after 2 years , bad bad bad company to work for"
bad,"Locally in KY it is the worse place ever to work, the typical day is hostel work environment, degrading and discriminating supervisors, no assistance from management either GM or OPs Mgt.  Constant badgering of employees by one particular male supervisor and back stabbing is constant.  The job was not bad if the people in the office were professional.  Change is not an option, no improvements are allowed and any ideas are shot down.  The other Supervisor will not let go of the operation to allow anyone else to assist.  Its his way or the highway.  Its a local cult that will destroy any self confidence and inner peace.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE OF WORK IN KY!!!  If you can work at the Corporate office in AZ then that would be fine, it seemed like a different world out there and they were oblivious to the local operations."
bad,"My HIPPA rights were violated, ADA was violated, there was clear favoritism and discrimination.  I worked and was early every day.  I also did 5 times the work as anyone on my team and there was no kind of compensation or recognition. No raise.  I applied for 6 different promotional positions and did not get one  Someone lower than me applied for one that was above my pay grade and got it immediately.  They only promote if you kiss their butt and don't stand up for yourself.  Horrible place to work."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"Management here is atrocious. Hours cut and increased workload made it extremely stressful. No one works together which just caused problems for all in operations."
bad,"I felt like this is where my career went to die. You have to be in the 'click' to get advanced, otherwise you are a pawn for the management to play with for their amusement and political power. Your experience here will depend greatly by what your position is in this company and who you report to, but I wont risk it taking a job here in hope you win that lottery."
bad,I worked here for 14ys. I have never see management so bad. It all in who you are how much they pay you. If there is a job you want if the management don't want to get the job they will hire off the street
bad,The job itself is not bad Management is the problem. Out of everyplace I have worked none have ever been as bad as they are there. I was hurt badly on the job lied to about filing workmans comp and then when i returned to work was put in a position to re injure myself so they could get rid of me.
bad,"The worse management ive ever worked for in my life. Lots of favoritism, micro managing, hostile environment. Once they know they want to get rid of you, management sets you up to fail by giving you a bigger work load than you can handle and once you start complaining and find your weaknesses they find ways to write you up until they can terminate you to find another monkey they can do the same to. New sales manager is a complete ignorant and new to the industry, so all he does is micro manage to feel “like the boss” avoid this company unless it’s your only option."
bad,18 hr days treated to constant scrutiny about work performed. never given objective opinion on status of day. way overworked.should allow for work/life balance
bad,"They talked  a lot about caring for the drivers. But when it came down to actually taking care of the drivers it didnt happen unless upper management was there to see it . It should have happened all the time . Trucks are not taken care of . Regardless of the type of job this is the drivers should not have been made to drive in those. Pre - post trip paperwork was all lies . Drivers jumped right in trucks , wrote down the miles and left . And on the rare day that something was written up by someone that actually cared it was never fixed . This place is very poorly ran and I do not recommend anyone get a job here. The management is in total denial ."
bad,They don't care about any of their employees at all. They care greatly about their business but not about the people working for them. Unfortunately. Great benefits but not worth the horrible management and lack of caring.
bad,Republic is so big that it doesn't focus on the needs of the individual sites and employees and customer satisfaction after contract has much room for improvement.
bad,Management is terrible very micro manage safety means nothing Can not move up in company they know it all will not take suggestions it only a good idae if they come up with it you have to be one of the chosen ones to get ur way around here and this place is full of them they want u to skip your lunch and run like a mad man to get route done as fast as you can
bad,"This company is absolutely horrible to work for. The only people they care about are their share holders and insuring they see an immediate increase. That can mean it comes out of the customer's pockets, or the employees, or both. Management is a joke and the turn over is rather high. They do not reward their employees for good work, but simply expect more the next time at little or no additional monetary or emotional compensation. The health plan options keep getting worse. The pressure just goes up and up, do more, for the same amount of time, for the same amount of money, or in some cases, less money. They will change your job title and responsibilities without your permission and tell you you can either get with the new role, or get out. This has sometimes meant pay decreases and demotions for employees. When you voice a concern you are told you should just be appreciative that you have a job and that it's worse other places."
bad,"Worst company ever. You are lied to from the start at your interview. Everyone is a backstabber under managements desk to get ahead. No such thing as team work always looking over your shoulder. Lowest paid shop throughout the whole company. They say they are union but trust me they are far from it and ""real unions don't snitch on their own people "" this company doesn't deserve to have the title of being union. No matter your qualifications and experience you start at the bottom which you aren't aware of until your first day."
bad,"Worked there two years and the last four months were bad.  My line supervisor decided to target me and yelled at me every chance she got.  Got in my face yelling to work faster, get more plastic out.  I kept telling her I was moving as fast as I could but she would not let up.  There were four of us on that line sorting but I was the only one being harassed.  Even after going to the mgr and HR the harassment continued until I couldn't stand it anymore and quit.  I applied for unemployment but this company blocked that. Even to this day they say they didn't do anything wrong.  News Flash, if something bothers an employee then it is workplace harassment."
bad,dont work here do not even try this place sucked they expect way to much in a day they cant keep drivers cause of pay and work load and the ones who do stay have to do the job of three i quit
bad,"If you like,rats,raccoons,vomit,rotting smells,and a ""good ole boy""management well then ......This is the job 4 you,if upper management dont like you they'll be very unfair too you ,they gave me a 90review in my 64day and told me I wasnt cutting the mustard,I guess I wouldnt if not allowed too use my gps putting me up north in the middle of the night expecting me too read a map on dark,narrow county rd,so stressed out I lost 17lbs"
bad,"maintenance manager does not want to fix any issues. he does not listen to his supervisors about the issues. lots of favoritism to the people that are liked by the manager. training is horrible. rules only apply to certain people. shop is suppose to be ONE FLEET ran, but it is only ran that way been people are visiting. co-workers talk behind everybody's back to make the next person look bad and the supervisors do the same to each other. I wish I could give something positive about my 6 years working for this company, but what I have said are the issues here is what got me fired."
bad,started out great but after a few days u can see the quality of people at the Orlando location upper management exercise their power when choosing there favorite (bob clark service mananger)
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"I have never worked for a company like this one. They don't care at all about the employees, They will write you up or suspend you (unless your important to them) for any little thing. Supervisors micro-manage you to a fault. I was screwed over for a side load job because my supervisor did not know policy. DON'T WORK HERE !!"
bad,"Typical day consists of picking up really nasty bulk items from the side of the roads. I have learned much about how hard this kind of work is. Management only cares about the customer and nothing about the employee. I enjoy working with my fellow drivers, much respect for the hard work that they do with such little pay. Hardest part of the job is low pay, long hours, bad equipment and the scare tactics management uses the motivate employees. Most enjoyable part is at the end of the day I get to go home. Tried moving up to better positions only to get the door slammed in my face."
bad,"Republic Services claims that people are their 2nd highest priority and that they are committed to investing in them to ensure their success.  This is a façade, which is confirmed with the quantity of turnover they have and continue to experience.  Read the multitude of reviews that echo this within and they will confirm Republic’s lack of sincerity.  How many Fortune 500 companies terminate their employees (many with extensive tenure) for no reason at a moment’s notice (I encourage confirmation as it is abundant from the bottom to the top).  The immoral, unethical and irresponsible behaviors are abundant throughout, which can be seen even at the local Republic level, where a GM hired his son-in-law as a supervisor within his own regime.  Good luck to you if you dare to express your concerns and present constructive criticism (don’t drink his or his cronies Kool-Aid), as you will be fired.  Republic’s lack of professionalism and inability to overcome the complications of the merger with Allied (which occurred 5 years ago) are evident, as they are continuing to struggle with even the most simple applications.  If you desire to go to work every day with anxiety, depression, apprehension, fretfulness and hopelessness associated with whether your job is secure, I would highly recommend that you work for Republic Services.  Hopefully, the board of directors will recognize that this tactless, hot headed, uneducated CEO is running this company into the ground before it is too late.  Lastly, how many CEO’s of 8 billion dollar companies are mandated to undergo anger management classes"
bad,This division has been failing for a number of years. Management changed twice in my short time their. Anyone that had an opportunity to leave in sales took it...
bad,Management pulls you in under the assumption that you will have a certain schedule but then tells you that you must work outside of those hours. It's take this shift or leave it! Management could care less about work/life balance. Ancient computer systems and limited room for growth.
bad,Bad untrained management = fearful environment. Many current corporate employees looking for outside opportunities. Very high turn-over and low morale. Job and environment misrepresented during interview.
bad,As a former employee
bad,"Company hired me on to work in a capped territory. I left a job that I was happy with for the money promised. Five months later when I asked why my commissions were lower than discussed I was told they ""forgot"" to tell me that corporate didn't approve. Never had a chance to be successful. Manager told me I'd be coming in to have a one on one and discuss things, then pulled me into her boss's office and I was let go without any warning because they ""changed their sales structure."" Meanwhile there are inside sales positions open in this same office that I could have been offered. If you want to make decent money and be worked into the ground without any appreciation, this is the company for you."
bad,Republic went down hill fast. Supervisors are overwhelmed with duties because of the poor management skills from above. Used to be a good company to work for. Drivers with previous knowledge of the industry are paid well.
bad,"Its was a strange place to work, people got hurt all of the time and management  would try to blames the employee. The conidiations of the facility was unsafe"
bad,"No professionalism or patience hired on with no clear job description, sense of direction and/or structured training in order to serve the purposes of employment in operations. Terrible work hours of 12 noon to 10 pm (Tue-Fri and Saturday early mornings). Employees insecure with no training abilities or team building offered especially someone with potential for advancement and abilities to fulfill job requirements. Employee's with tenure allowed to be disrespectful towards others including management without corrective action to mitigate issues. Overall, a toxic work environment due to consistent personal questions that lead to personal attacks and the spreading of rumors. Micro management is way over bearing the leads to high turnover of drivers or staff."
bad,"Culture is money and speed, management does not care about the employee just how fast they can get done. Trucks have many issues that do not get fixed until there no choice or it breaks down on the road."
bad,H.R. team does not work with the Supervisors or Managers.  Hard workers are thrown out while H.R. holds on to people who really don't want to work and only cause problems
bad,The worst company I ever worked for in Arizona. The very best company I ever worked in Virginia. The professionalism in Virginia was much better than any I ever received in Arizona.
bad,on I first was hired it was a great place to work . over the years they have changed managers from worst to worst. The management only looking out for themselves they act as though there looking out for the customer but there are customers who don't even get there trash pick up but they seem to bother and stress out the ones that do there work. we have a union also which is totally worthless
bad,I really would think twice before I would except a job there. Work/ Family life is the worst I have ever seen. I feel bad for staff and drivers cause there aren’t appreciated and valued.
bad,Not a good place.  Worked hard treated poorly.  Lied to like crazy.  Want you to do things that are against fmcr.  I had fun in the beginning but true colors came out after 3 months.  They cant even keep supervisors.
bad,"Racial tension is thick enough to cut with a knife. As long as you play the game and give your services to the white guys who is in chill mode all day to help finish their route after being killed trying to finish your own duties things are fine. The first time you don't agree to helping you are marked for your career at the company. Management is horrible! A bunch of uneducated misfits that got a break in life to make some money, but don't know the first thing of how how to deal with people or personal issues.There is no compassion when it comes to you or your family, but their dog could become sick and their weeks at a time. Hostile environment with plenty of racial overtones! And it doesn't help the situation any better when the company and Union 731 are in bed together."
bad,"I was hired into a new role from outside the company, they did not tell me that they were only giving 9 months to succeed in a market where Republic is severely disadvantaged.  I left a secure job that I had performed well at specifically to join Republic and then 9 months later I find myself unemployed.   They offered no job training or support, basically sink or swim culture and mentality."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,The pay is okay but that is it. Your over worked and management does not respect you and they don't really care about you. They just want the work do and if you have any questions they will disregard that question. So in closing I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It's so bad that people won't last a whole day most of the time.
bad,The most racist place I've ever worked! Blacks and minorities across the board get 40-50 % less for doing the same work! Blacks and minorities are micromanaged while whites are treated like their privileged! We were only allowed to have 3 accidents per year one Swing Driver(white) had 15 accidents in less than 4 years!
bad,The management is very poor and did not collaborate at all. The on-boarding process was nothing of sorts.  I would not recommend for anyone to work within this management structure
bad,"i drove for them a couple yeaes and there trucks are junk, they leak really bad , mangement will try to make u take a un safe truck out, if u tell them no they will try to get rid of u"
bad,The site was extremely hazardous and disorganized. Equipment was always broken and the company never provided tools to fix issues so most times you would have to make something to work or use your own. Horrible site and redicuously disorganized!!! Look elsewhere!!!
bad,the company sent in someone to clean house and they made the work environment so harsh and stressful and overwhelming that it was impossible to be productive or really part of the team.  people were singled out and were treated to.  the environment was extremely cutthroat and deception  embedded with lies was a normal part of the environment.
bad,"Jackson Ms , Very Racist Job . They Show Favoritism And They Will Have Yu Doing Everything But Don’t Want To Pay Yu For Your Knowledge And Experience."
bad,Man this company is a joke they do not care about you or your safety the new operations manager is a real piece of work and a supervisor promoted from salesman between the two of them you will go crazy only guy who knows anything is the side load supervisor but his opinion isn't valued enough total buddy system good luck unless you are friends with them
bad,"I worked for this company 14years. The managment there now is terrible, I witnessed the Operation manager yelling at dispatch & other employees in a very unprofessional manor!! Managment don't answer the phone or work radio for nothing then blame you. Definitely not the company I started of at in 2006. In their mind trash is more important than family!!! I quit because they said I had a no call no show when I called off when my dad was being rushed to the hospital!! 14 year I mad had called out 15 times but only for emergencies.  I do have children & a family!! When I told them why I called of they were worried about a 8yd front end can that was supposedly missed. Lack of communication & terrible work environment!"
bad,"The trucks are the roughest , nastiest , worst maintained I've ever dealt with . and they will beat you down on an 11.5 hr day . the route I drove was  200 miles a day with 100 or more dumpsters everyday . the company sets their drivers up for failure when they push drivers to run that hard everyday . it causes accidents"
bad,"Specialist I ($15.00 an hour) Specialist II ($16.50 an hour) is a Customer Service Rep's job taking calls from angry, upset customers that can't get their trash picked up. The problem is you can't get customer's trash picked up no matter how many complaints you send to the dispatchers who can't get the drivers to do their job. Upper management talks like they care about their employees that are getting dumped on constantly, but the Supervisors are changed so often it's hard to remember who you report to, and they're so busy doing whatever they do to look so busy doing, that you have no back up on problems that constantly arise with the really incompetant data/system software programs that are useless to complete the CSR's job. There are some really good people that work for this trash disposal company, that I will miss, and my floating desk was a dream, but the small open cubicles create a noisy work environment. If the Human Resources manager wasn't a complete moron, and belonged to the human race, that could only find joy in belittling, and humiliating Republic Service employees (on their days off!) I never would have left."
bad,"Work life balance, there isn't one. Lots of favoritism. No team work, Its not what it use to be. You do have a nice vacation package that you can use for your appointments."
bad,"Management in Pinconning, MI Whitefeather landfill is terrible.  If you do not kiss butt and you are a hard worker you will not go far.  Special treatment for certain employees, can only like one employee at a time.  Management steals and lies to make himself look good."
bad,They have cut drivers pay and nothing you can do about it. Shut up and work mentality. Trucks stay broke down and insurance is high and don’t cover nothing
bad,They always complain about the budget but never get the parts you request. I guess big bonuses are better than looking like idiots. They’re stupervisors have 0 skill/knowledge and try to dictate your every move. They let you diagnose the truck but keep you from fixing them so they can tell the manager that they’re the ones who found the issue and how to fix it. Techs are treated poorly
bad,"I worked for Republic services as a fleet maintenance manager Although my job required many hours I enjoyed my team. That was until October 2018. They decided to hire a controller with no management experience as a general manager and he single-handedly crushed morale and lost his entire management team within seven months. Shame on you Republic services for subjecting your hard-working  dedicated  employees To this abuse."
bad,"Don't be a middle manager there.  You will get a tiny bonus and accountability galore! It seems to be a great place to be a driver, if you are a good one."
bad,This place is horrible.  Management will claim that they have helped you with any problems you have had but never give you any insight that is helpful.  My supervisor told me that she would do a side by side with me and help with problems but never did.  Supervisor was nice to my face but talked about me behind my back.  This was a very bad experience and I just can not in good conscience recommend this place to anyone.  Not a very professional environment.
bad,Make the company more diverse with the workers in the supervisors especially in California you mean you saw that the only bringing the people in the family for work get the other races fired so you don't have no chance corporate they don't want you on the clock more than 11 hours that make you finish the route to you have blisters on your feet working 16 hours that's what I did and then they said you're not performing I think I undercover boss me to come in the job sites and see how the supervisors or managers running the company and then I think it would be a good company all Hispanics are drivers in California you can never win if you're different race the supervisors are Hispanics
bad,"Dispatchers just talk about co workers. Bad attitudes. Managers just have titles. No need to escalate anything to HR  Coporate. Both are jokes. You can be treated horribly, but there will be no help."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"The call center suffered from many changes in management and processes. Training is inconsistent with actual job skills. Unfortunately the job does need to be difficult, the tools provided are not up to the task though."
bad,Management only cares about their bonuses nothing about employees or safety. They will lie about you to keep you from getting promoted into another department
bad,"Too many breakdowns, pay is never correct,  junk trucks, company wont spend money to buy parts so maintenance has their hand tied on what they can fix"
bad,"Run, run, run. It's all a gimmick. They lie to get you in the door and turns for the worst about week 6. You're just a number. Coach the behaviours they say ha! Why not coach the behaviours of your management staff. Constantly wondering who's going to be walked out next. I say run as far as you can."
bad,They tell you one thing and do another. No one is paid the same or treated the same. Based on how well you kiss the mangers butt.I would tell anyone going their good luck.
bad,"Upper management does not care about anything but themselves. There is no coaching, only telling. Upper management does not care about ones future unless you are working under the same roof.  HR does nothing for anyone but upper management. If you bring up an issue with someone, they just defend that person and blow you off."
bad,"If you want to work in a cut throat environment with no room for advancement, favoritism, no appreciation, a hostile work environment, a place where Management laughs behind your back because they are the only one benefiting from your hard work, where you will only get a 1-1.5 % yearly increase when they get 5-12% yearly increase and a yearly bonus that is more than you make in a years time after they have you roped you in because you bought into their lies and gave up your current job then this is the Company for you. This is a company that covers for each other if your a boot licker and one that makes sure you stay in your place if you don't play their game. Long hours, Managers that make you wonder what is this Company thinking by continuing to allow these people to stay in charge, and not realizing that the turn-over is because of the Controller, GM and Sales Manager's inability to manage people. Look at their turn-over record.."
bad,"Operations Supervisor is the Escape Goat position. Phone and emails all day everyday. That you are expected to answer every time. Normal work hours are 12 plus. Somewhere between 55 - 65 hours every week. No support from upper management. Was told you will have training at corporate within 90 days, took over a year. Writing someone up is the only way of communication."
bad,If you speak up you are pigeon holed. Do what you're told and be quiet and be prepared to not have a work life balance. I worked for this company for over a decade and nothing ever changes. The diversity stops at the Operations Supervisor level. If you are not a white male you will not go far.
bad,I really don't want to do this I was not the re to make friendsit wasjust a job I didn;t seek to get close to anyone so I have nothing to say about the company
bad,"racist,and bad management,not family oriented,company doesn't care about there staff,pay is not fare to employee that has good performance out in the field."
bad,Job Was Stessful helper Was Lazy Had Too Work Weekend Management Dont like Black People U get like 45 A week Short Days on Saturday Training Is Bad Not A good Company To Work for
bad,"If you’re a mechanic, don’t ever work for a company that makes you sign federal DOT paperwork when the truck isn’t safe to be on the road.  Shop not setup for work being done, and no training."
bad,After working 12 hour shifts and Saturdays. Company can not build a team between Operations and Maintenance always finger pointing. New Manager will let you go without a performance improvement plan even after your last 2 annual reviews stated you consistently exceeded expectations to get his friends in the door. They do not follow the coaching model after preaching about it.
bad,What I was told when I hired in and what was real was totally different. The manager was complete anel oraface with no positive feedback at all. This was the worst job EVER
bad,"Where do I begin? They expect more than anyone can do in one shift. The atmosphere is not team friendly. It is every man for himself at this place. You will be expected to work miracles. There is NO structure at that place. Managers expect you to do the impossible and think you should be able to do it in a matter of minutes, when they themselves do not know how to do the job or what all is involved. They go by these guidelines/times that are set by some person or group of people, whom I am sure have not had to ever work on that task. Also, when things go wrong, they will pick one or two people to be the fall-guy and throw him or her from the bus and run over them with a train. Pay is somewhat decent for the area in which I worked, until they start piling other work on top of you without any additional compensation or even a thank you."
bad,Poor management that is in it for profit! does not care about workers and pay wage is very poor! would not recommend working working here for the amount of money being paid. Seems like the only people that could advance are caucasions and get higher up positions.
bad,"long work days, trucks break down frequently, poor management, pay is not sufficient for the hours worked daily. frequently working 12-15 hours daily with minimal breaks."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"Poor management, zero training, no guidance.  Very political and people who didn’t deserve jobs there were in management positions.  Zero help when complaints were logged.  No help in advancing or moving to a different role, you were expected to just deal with it."
bad,"go out on set route pickup open top container, transport to landfill dump content and return back to customer. most enjoyable part of job was working with customers on route."
bad,The workload was massive. We all put in many hours and on 24/7 phone duty . Everyone had to hit the ground running. Start up business with no solid policies and procedures.
bad,Company has old equipment and horrible management. They will try to blame all the problems on anyone but them. The real problem is not enough help and they constantly threaten you about your job. They have you fill out loads of paperwork that they don't look at just to cover them when an accident happens. If you decide to work for this company you have to watch yourself and know if they can blame you they will.
bad,"Safety culture did not exist, employees are the furthest thing from management's mind, safety mindset does not occur. I was hurt on job because of improper tool for the job, when I confronted management about the body risk, they commenced to tell me that there is no funds for the proper tools and that I will have to make due."
bad,"High stress due to poor management, customers left unassisted for many months. I have been there 2mths and just got a working company cell phone but no charger for it. Company tools do not allow us to properly or effectively assist customers in a timely manner."
bad,Promised a lot of that was just a lie to get me in the door because they cannot keep drivers. This place is a joke it is not for a family man or woman with kids they expect you to work yourself into an early grave and the money is okay but you have to work 6+days a week to do it there is no such thing as down time and forget having a lunch break if you want to get everything on your route done they make it we're it's almost near impossible to take one please be aware of this company it is the worst place I have ever worked
bad,"You have to watch your back at all times.  Supervisors will write you up for anything.  Don't be tardy either.  If you're 1 minute late, that's a half point.  6 points, you're fired."
bad,Right now it is a hostile working environment.  Supervisor is all about himself.  Will not get raises - unless you consider .06 per hour a raise.  Office workers are peons.
bad,"I was a dispatcher for Republic & what a joke. Worst place ever to work, if the drivers or other employees want you gone....you will be fired. Management does NOT care if you do your job, everyone is just looking for someone new to pass their work off on. Be ready to get blamed for anything & everything, then get fired because you won't kiss butt or disregard the rules. Save yourself the time & trouble, find another place to work. Having a job with this company is a guaranteed way to create one of the worst memories of your working life."
bad,Hostile work environment. Misleading from the beginning of hiring process. Pay not what was established during hiring process. Always lied to by supervisors. Never able to take the 30 minute break Republic took from pay anyway.
bad,"not an employee friendly company. long hours, not compensated for OT. Did work alongside some hard working people. Worked for many different managers."
bad,"not a good career driven place. not sure why i wasted 5 years of my life there. not a good work environment. communication between management and workers lack, low morale and unhappy employees. place lacks."
bad,"Company lies and places blame on its employees for mismanagement bad decisions surrounding resources. Team work is nonexistent. When you continue to do the same things that you've done for years, you gain the same results"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,They have no concerns about your health or safety.  The pay is decent I guess is the only positive but that all depends on whether your boss likes you or not.  Just getting your job done SAFELY in 0 degrees or 100 degrees is not enough.
bad,Overworked and underpayed. 14 hour work days and don't even make 180 dollars. equipment is so worn out I broke down weekly. I broke down 3 times in 2 trucks one day. bosses here you complain and you're out the door.
bad,"they have some kind of Chinese over time scam going on."
bad,"Horrible company makes rules as they go, no respect for there customer service reps. Management at call center in Arlington Tx very POOR. Great pay but your TREATED Horrible. ."
bad,"One of the most horrible places I've ever worked at! Everyone blames each other for mistakes.  The drivers (who get paid a TON of money) pretty much do whatever they want - which means not at all what they are supposed to do and they take no responsibility for their mistakes.  The customers are treated horribly, are ripped off, and get terrible service.  Management plays favorites, let's people who can not even do their job stay employed, do not follow the rules, and come and go as they please.  The people who do bust their humps do not get paid more (there are NEVER raises for anyone), they are only expected to take on more responsibility.  To make matters worse there are rules that are not in the employee handbook, but employees are expected to ""assume"". The worst part is that management says negative things about employees who try to move to a different position (whether it be to move up or just out of the department.)!"
bad,I've worked for better companies. If you are looking for advancement in your carreer don't stop here.  Annual rounds of layoffs in October. They have the appearence of a good company but pay attention to the guy behind the curtain.  it's all smoke and mirrors.
bad,"first off I interviewed during the holiday season, they waited a month to tell me I got the job but they were not ready for me yet had to wait another month to actually start. So then I am in orientation and I am told about the do's and don'ts of the driver and how they have zero tolerance for talking and texting while driving but while driving with the trainer he starts looking and texting his wife. he is not checking tires like they told us too he is just doing things his way, and bragging about how he can make or break me to my supervisor. next thing I know I am called in and told I am not the ""right"" driver for them and now I am trying to get a job and they wont even confirm that I worked there.  I have the stubs to prove that I did. This place was not even work the hassle, this has caused me many problem.  Think twice before applying for a job with this company."
bad,If your looking for a place to earn income until you find something that you really desire this is the place to be. It is not a permanent company to work for. Unfortunately they don't value hard work they only value profit. The customers are always dissatisfied and when problems arise very few people do anything to resolve it. The management team in customer service specifically only care about making themselves look great to obtain raises and promotions. Impossible guidlelines are set that management doesnt have to abide by but they than expect other employees to be perfect. When you have an issue with any of them they and seek out assistance that is the end of your job.  So as I stated prior of your looking for something to tide you over until you insights school or get a real job this is the place. If your looking for a career I suggest go else where.
bad,"Worked there about 2 years,there is very little communication from the top to the bottom. Drove front load,started at 3:00 a.m. heavy work load  short amount of time to get it done,always someone watching your every move.No home life,get off, shower eat in bed at 7 p.m."
bad,"When I interviewed with the company in December 2010, I was certainly sold a great bill of goods:  good benefits, work-life balance, ability to telecommute, and the hours were only tough during closing.  Once I got there, however, things changed within a week. I immediately picked up on a ""vibe"" of mistrust and fear.  I quickly learned that the Staff Accountant position at Allied Waste - at least as it pertains to the Seatle area - has most of the accounting duties placed squarely on its shoulders:  Most of the closing, all SOX testing, all account reconciliations (a very complex and overly-detailed process), inventory, and (at least at the time) all the accounts payable for the divisions. I frankly am still not sure what the division Controller actually did.  This is in addition to the budgeting process which is, at best, cumbersome and ultimately not worth the inordinate amount of time put into it, because you ended up being given a certain bottom line number and you were expected to work to that number, rather than reality.  This made for long days, fear of reprisal if you made even the smallest error, and constant worry about not getting things done on time and the repurcussions that would follow.  The Controller at the time had been with the company for many years, 5 years at that division, and was the most inconsistent, beligerant and angry manager I've ever worked for.  Because she had been there a while she felt she was absolutely untouchable.  She could be nice one day, and in a complete rage the next, and treated me and everyone in other departments with complete disrespect,"
bad,"Company talks about safety and that's all it is, TALK. it's all about getting trash as fast as you can so that the GM gets a big bonus. Upper Management could care less about anyone but themselves. Their work day is about 7 to 8 hours, the average Supervisor works a 14 hour day. if you complain about it they fire you. You are constantly told to push the workers harder. Anything to do with Safety is pencil whipped, the worst training programs I've ever seen. New Supervisors are given two weeks of training then it's sink or swim. Don't waste your time with this company unless you want to learn to lie, cheat and treat the customers like dirt. Not to forget you will no longer have a life. Weekends, Holidays and personnel days..gone. You are nothing more than a number, just don't expect anyone to remember what your number is. They just don't care. Don't get me started on the equipment, if your lucky your truck won't loose all of oil until the second part of the day, and those are the new trucks. The old trucks are ticking time bombs. Over half of the fleet has no working AC in them, real nice when the outside temp is over 115. Biggest problem with the company is Allied Waste and their attempt to bring back slavery, pay you for 40 hours but work you 70 plus hours and look you in the face and say be thankful you have a job. Trust me when I say STAY AWAY! it's not worth it."
bad,"I accepted a supervisor position with this company thinking they offered nights and weekends off. When I interviewed with them I stressed this point and was told they firmly believed in a good quality of life mix. I started on MLK day; which is a holiday for the drivers. The management team reported for work on MLK day. On my first day I asked an existing supervisor how many hours a day he averaged. He told me he averaged 15 hours a day. It turns out he was telling the truth. We had to work the Saturday after MLK day and ended up putting in 70+ hours the first week. I noticed that all management above my level took the Saturday off. The supervisors were the only group forced to put in a 6 day week. The next week the 15+ hour days continued. When I got home I had time to eat and go to bed. This left you with an average of 5 to 6 hours of sleep a night. The hourly group had very low morale and even went on strike while I was there. The strike forced the supervisors into a 7 day work week without any days off for 12 days and a total of 180 hours. The operation was in complete chaos and upper management hammered me and another new supervisor without mercy . Both of us ended up resigning in less than two weeks. My experience with this company was nothing short of a disaster. When you divided your salary by hours worked, you realized you were making less than the hourly group. After I was in place I also realized there were no paid holidays off. When a holiday fell on a week day you worked on the following Saturday. There was no work / family balance for the frontline supervisor."
bad,"I was let go on Oct.9, 2008 after coming back from being ill the day before. I was not given a valid reason for my release. The person who released me was the regional manager who was later fired for criminal activity. In 2011 I was told to reapply for my job which I did, once that was complete (collections), the division manager told me I was not rehirable."
bad,"had to take a $35,000.00/ yr pay cut because allied waste merged with republic services. republic took away my service truck from taking it home but expected me to drive my personal vehicle to the shop to get the service and that was when i had to punch the time clock. so i had to burn my gas and didn't get paid for that time. they also cut out any overtime. i asked for a lay off but of coarse they wouldn't. also they have never replaced me and it has now been 2 years after this happen."
bad,"I cant speak for other locations but the Greensboro location is horrible to work at. Managed poorly, and do not care for and have the employees back there! In a little under 3 years they've gone thru 3 ops managers and 3 residential supervisors and the future for that side looks horrible. The work is fine and not hard at all; very time consuming but if you dont mind going at 5:30a and not getting home until dark then you're good!"
bad,"25 years in the industry never have I seen such a dysfunctional company from operation to sales management. In my time with the company it was "
bad,Do not turn your back on management they will stick a knife in it and turn it. Feel free to ask me how i know.Dirty management they are looking for ways to get rid of people.
bad,They over work us and only care about the bonus that the General Manager gets. Equipment always broken they never want to fix anything because the company “doesn’t” have money.
bad,Maintenance manager at the sylmar location (sunshine canyon) likes to play favorites and discrimates against employees that don't agree with him on everything.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"There is not much I can say that is good about this company.  I was not, in my opinion given a fair chance here.  I would not want to work for this company again."
bad,"Worst and most unintelligent enviornment Ive experienced in my career, anyone can find a better place to work.  I cant write a review that would properly depict the reality of the negative environment."
bad,"Horrible company, you never know vwhat time your getting off.  Alot of 10,11,12 hr days.   New trucks but they have no air ride, you basically sit or if you can stand on a metal seat, by the end of day your back, knee's and legs are so sore.  You can never just go home.  You basically stay out until all routes are finished.   You work Saturdays after holidays.   Stay far away from this company"
bad,They don't care if you have a family. Would not suggest working for this company especially the michigan location's they are worse then high school...
bad,"Management is self sabotaging. The day rate is a joke. Preach working as a team in a team like environment but no one does, you have to be clicked up to get any help trucks are well garbage no pun intended. You have to be in with the good ol boys to get decent equipment or help when your thrower is to tired stay far away from this yard if you have any dignity and self respect! From new drivers and even if you have some experience they will only pay you 150 to 180 a day which is penny’s compared to other companies"
bad,"This company is micro-managed from the very top. Shareholder return is the number one priority to protect the CEO and his cronies. Instead of investing in their equipment, property, and employees, they choose to continually make band aid fixes to major problems! The pay is good, benefits not bad, but that is all there is to it. You are simply a number to this company!"
bad,Working at this company has given me experience and knowledge in the waste industry and helped me to develop a professional voice. It has also given me skills on excel and in Salesforce.
bad,Ever since last year when the Division Manager left the company the place has gone down hill. previous Manager cared and we worked hard for him new Management has no clue and doesn't know the business
bad,"Work hours suck. Pay is ok"
bad,"Republic services is the worst place I have ever worked and definitely not an employer I would recommend of choice. Management is ok however, there isn't much they can do about customers calling to complain about their bill going up, errors on their bill or being missed amongst a lot of other issues. We don't have access to contact customers division supervisor or dispatch. Instead we have to create a case and hope for the best as a lot of times cases are opened for action and review by the division and most of them are ignored totally or may take weeks to resolve if it's even resolved at all but yet there is supposed to be a 48 hour window. Agents, senior advisers, direct supervisors etc are not given the proper tools to do the job which makes it difficult to relay information to a customer. The processes within the organization are definitely broken and need to be fixed! Also pto time is accrued and not given up front which caused me to have to cancel vacation to avoid getting occurrences or any other corrective action. I feel like I am forced to make that place my life! Also agents are glued to a phone with no buffer and no time to break away from the calls. When employee appreciation events take place agents have to rush to get their food on lunch breaks that are staggered and all over the place. I am definitely not happy and looking to pursue other career paths."
bad,"I would not recommend this employer to anyone. 3 management ""teams"" in 14 months dis organized. When I posted my resume to find a new job they tried to recruit me, I was already an employee just as an example..."
bad,long hours. hardly no home life. local management is terrible. most days and 12 hour day and they try and write you up if you go over. they are big on saftey
bad,This place is a joke to work for.  SO many chiefs and not enough indians.  When employees are left to work GOD awful hours while managemtn is home mid day is DISTURBING!
bad,Do not wish to provide any detailed input. I would just like to use your service to locate another position with a good company that provides a good income for my family.
bad,"No teamwork, managers lie about everything, managers play favorites, you work like 60-70 hours per week. Place is dirty. Poor management. No structure. And they wonder why they are #2 in the country. Evidently waste management has their stuff together better than republic. They set you up to fail at everything. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I will never work here again!"
bad,After 23.5 years working at this company they were very discriminating against certain employees.  The management here does not have experience at the job and tries to tell you how to do your job.   Even after 23.5 years
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here.  Management is all about cutting cost so that they get a bonus at the end of the year.  they do not extensively train new employees for the job they are hired for.
bad,Not a good company to work for. Management is not supportive fellow coworkers are not well trained nor are they capable most are lazy and inept. The inability of management to properly discipline their staff is only shadowed by their inability to hire quality personnel
bad,Management sucks and unless your cool with many supervisors you will be on their get him outta here list..  Too many hours a week due to routes being cut. They dont care about you or your family. I have little kids and I cant make it to any after school activities because of the long hrs
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,This is a company that is controlled by the Union. it is very hard as a Manager to get things completed because the Unions will file a complaint if you try to get the employees to actually work and not play while on the clock. As a manage would not recommend this company at all.
bad,This company  called REPUBLIC SERVICES  will use you then through you away like the garbage they collect . They are all about how too make a buck off it's employees.
bad,"Where do i start? Once you are out of training, it goes downhill from there! The two girls who are supposedly your trainers DONT help at all. They get the other girls to do their jobs for them. They are very lazy! Management does not stay on one accord. They tell you conflicting information and then when you get a low quality score, they try to act like they provided you with the wrong information! Those of you coming in through a temp agency PLEASE BEWARE! They basically let got of our entire temp class to make room for the new permanent people they hired. They act like they care about their employees while in training but as Nesting is almost over, they drop you like a bad habit. They don’t care that you may have children or a sick relative to care for. All they care about is themselves and clocking out early! Please don’t be fooled people! This is NOT a good company!"
bad,"Will try to get you to do residential route no matter what you apply for. Unreasonable workloads and hours expected of you.  Junk trucks, if they had any in working order."
bad,Some managers are Tyrants. They'll get rid of really good folks in management to save money. They have fired some long term good drivers for bad reasons..
bad,Fast Pace job benefits are good money is decent but management is very poor and does not help often company does not care about their employees.. lack of equipment
bad,Terrible.....do not work here run for the hills!!!! No room for advancements and no equality also poor management....The system of you scratch my back I scratch yours...And not you work.
bad,"I work at republic services in anaheim and I the supervisors seem to be unorganized and lost at times. I thought I would be working for a first class company but it's not. It seems like a lot of their driver's are leaving,I would not recommend anyone to come work at republic services(ANAHEIM)."
bad,Ask a lot of questions - Be aware of the answers you are given - you are not to engage with management  - Be aware of what you express and any beliefs you have towards all facets of the company and pratcies
bad,Work hours were normal 5 am until maybe 4 pm sometimes 6 pm. Your day depends on if the truck  will operate properly. Sometimes the help they give you are extremely lazy which prolongs the day. The supervisors run the facility like its their personal business. Giving overtime time to the drivers who are friends with them or allow another driver to do their partial route while they go home.
bad,"phones, scripted and they listen in...if you dont  follow the script precisely you are written up. Customer service NOT, it is about up selling the product, and saying your lines period. Number of 100% on bare calls, and how well you kiss up to the managers. Pay raises are a joke!! DONT WORK THERE!!"
bad,"After 50 weeks of 10 -17 hour days trying to learn a job I had no prior experience in during a nearly 14-year career, I was terminated. None of the initial support I was promised materialized until month 10. But I was held accountable for the lack of positive results regardless of the circumstances. Tread carefully...if at all. RSI has no loyalty to you or to any of your previous success."
bad,"management does not care about any person in the shop only about the work and making sure trucks are running even if that means working until you are no longer in a good state of mind, with the hours you work in the shop you will never see your family."
bad,"No onboard training for new hires and no one gets promoted. Employees either resign or get terminated. Ridiculous amount of turnover. There is no work/life balance. They work drivers to the brink of hours of service violation. The employees stab each other in the back, and look for reasons to discipline and push people out the door, rather than coach and mentor. Negative energy and low morale are the norm. No policy, process or procedure in place for anything. Management shoots from the hip, and makes decisions based on bias, opinion, mood and feelings. Too much finger pointing and fixing blame. Everyone has an axe to grind and is beyond miserable. Technology is 1980's. Way too much paper. The trucks are a joke - they wait until a next month or quarter rolls around in order to fix anything - for budget reasons. No holidays - they work on Saturdays to make up for it. The pay and benefits are decent, and are the only reasons people stay. Everything else is a giant mess."
bad,During my time at Republic I worked any where from 50 to 70 hours and was only compensated in my salary for 40. Horrible management and deplorable integrity. They do not treat people well
bad,Horrible place to work! Supervisors are very petty & personal! Had the ability to be an excellent workplace. if certain people are removed..
bad,If you want to be threaten to get fired constantly cause management won't take responsibility then this job is for you. You will never see the management on the work yard but they are willing to fire you just to blame someone else. It's not worth it I'm letting you know now
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"a typical work day can be challenging and stressful at times, can be a better company. management can be better than what it is sometimes things just seem out of place and not right."
bad,"The management team in columbus,ohio is a joke favoritism is rampant, management is clueless!"
bad,"The buy out wasn't good when Republic took over. Change in Mgt. made things very difficult to deal with. Everyone was afraid that they would be fired and many were."
bad,3 years and 3 General Managers hired and fired!
bad,"I clock in to clock out, the hours is the only thing that keep me at this job. It works for my schedule and family vacations during the year. JOB just above broke"
bad,Its been alot of people tthghat start & quit right away because of the stress & drama at this job. Management tells your businesse to other emlployees.
bad,"The co workers are cool but there was a 2nd shift supervisor that had his favorites, his picks and clicks initials (AW)...also the building needs heating and air conditioning you should feel comfortable coming to work not feel like you need to wear 1,000 pieces of clothes in the winter and a bikini n the summer, pay is ok if you have a roommate but could be better being though its like working in a sweat shop..."
bad,"Overworked , underpaid. Not a good place to work if you have a family.  You're never home , might as well live at the office.  Was not a good experience and I will never work for republic again."
bad,Hostile work environment. No room for advancement. Can’t talk to mgmt without it being spreaded around to your peers. Co-workers act like we’re in high school instead of grown people. Nothing changes by talking to HR.
bad,Poor management of employees and work assignments. Some managers never even drove more than a year before becoming management. Took their positions since no one else wanted them. Push through lunches or skip lunches to get work done yet still charged deduction for lunch daily half hour loss
bad,"The company is disciplined with hitting numbers, the CEO speaks to VPs and below about 68 minutes a year or 17 minutes a quarter.  He’s not visible and many times the term “DWI” would be used when people questioned a strategy.  Why are we doing this?  “D on W ants I t”"
bad,"Worst management ever. Switch out managers like underwear. Don't repair trucks properly. Almost lost my life due to poor mechanic work. There always looking for an angle to screw you out of pay, or write you up"
bad,"when you get inside you realize that managment is mostly guessing and everyday is more of a let's just do it this way today, but of course never actually fix the problem."
bad,"Pay seems good to some, but falls in line with the national average for commercial drivers, which hasn’t changed for 20 years. I made what I made at 23 yrs old and I’m now 47. They want you to work more and more and more whether it’s in your job title or not. Job security is great, because trash isn’t going anywhere. It’s a recession proof job. Benefits could and should be much better just because of the sheer size of the group enrolled. It’s a fortune 100 company and your benefits do not reflect that."
bad,Racist culture horrible union there’s a buddy system and the work environment is hostile. The culture is also very sexist very unprofessional. The union reps don’t represent everyone only they’re buddies
bad,Fast pace they tell you to take your time then jump you for taking to long. No drinking eating or smoking in trucks will get wrote up for not wearing proper safety gear or if forget seatbelt three times and your gone.
bad,"Managers need to be replaced in Charlotte CRC"
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend this job to my enemies, poor management, fast paced job for a low pay, a lot of favoritism, exposed to chemicals and the list keeps going on"
bad,"Dont recommend anyone work for this company, at least at the Oklahoma City location. They talk about integrity and being respectful, but it doesn't apply to area management. Frequently asked to do things that go against morals and integrity, and then get treated like trash when you say no."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"while i was there at republic services , all management tried to do (supervisors) was continually fire and hire people from temps to permanents and if they didnt like you they would fire you . It was a constant political slugfest of who was a yes man and who was a no man . worst place ever to work . If management was different it would be a real place to work . but management put who they wanted in charge regardless of what background they had , it was whoever catered to them ."
bad,it was very terrible the worse experience ever in my life I would never recommend to work there the management is very poor and inconstant and very unhealthy
bad,"Upper management sucks. They have no time for you.  Tell you to do something one way today and another way tomorrow. Equipment sucks trucks are not safe to be on road but are forced to put them on road anyway. DOT should shut this place down."
bad,They dont pay you enough for everything they want you to do. I felt like I was running the whole company. They stick together and always put me in the middle of grown up drama. I literally just waled out and never returned.
bad,Management is not there to develop leaders but only there for the bonuses. The most unethical and fraudulent jobs I have ever encountered.  Bad workplace culture since you constantly have to watch your back to make sure you are not dragged through the mud.  This is just for the Tucson Division am not aware of other division's issues.
bad,the biggest problem is management never take responsibility every thing that goes wrong is blamed on the drivers. they find ways to divide the drivers. there is really no advancement other then truck to truck but no drivers to the office promotions.
bad,"Hands down the worst place i have ever worked..No structure,no plan, management hides from whats really going on..Spotters no 0 english...Garbage NEVER gets covered...this place ought to be shut down..its a circus up at Ox Mtn-Half Moon Bay"
bad,"If you like to work under constant micro-management, then Republic is the place to be."
bad,"Do not work in the Texas area office, you will get fired. Especially if you are female. Particularly stay away from the Finance Group."
bad,"Place is understaffed, workers are overworked, underpaid and treated like robots. Love the co-workers, hate upper management."
bad,Lots of forced overtime. They tell you to be legal and in the same breath tell you to break the law. Dangerous poorly maintained equipment and bully management.
bad,If you like being treated like a rock on the road then you will fit right in. I was treated like dirt from the 2nd shift supervisor from the day he started. The working conditions at the facility are horrible. The truck fleet is absolutely horrible as well. It was a fight day after day to  get anything done. The shop has very little money to buy any parts as well. would not recommend this job to anyone that i know.
bad,"poor treatment towards its employees,not enough compensation for hard working employees."
bad,"Hours are fine, a normal 8-5. The computer system is out dated and not user friendly, to say the least. This is not much of a dispatching position but more of a data entry position with minimal dispatching. Management, or lack there of, are hardly ever on site. Yet your worthiness of the job is determined by them....?... The other 2 dispatchers are ""know it all's"", sneaky, and caddy. Everyone is out to get every one. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the other employee's. The driver's are union and for the most part very nice. Bc there are only 2 other dispatchers, any time someone takes vacation or PTO your hours will change and your work load doubles. You have to pick up the other dispatchers work. Sounds like a team environment, but is anything but. If you get hired for this position at the crown point location, watch your back! Ask the driver's, they don't like getting to know anyone there bc they say, ""they never stay"". There really isn't room for advancement in the dispatching area, but if you have experience in other areas that are related to their other positions, there maybe. Good luck to the next one!"
bad,"I believe if a company takes care of it's employee's they will take care of the company, making it a positive place for everyone, and the company will succeed.  This company believes everyone is replaceable, I feel they don't really care about their employee's, and most every employee you talk to is not really happy.  They do not believe in job and life balance.   When a company works you 55 hours or more a week it makes it hard to have to have a family life.  "
bad,"to fire crazy. supervisors don""t  know how to treat people they stress you out and put you behind a 26,000 pound truck, they always clling you while you driving and want you to answer before you get to a safe place to pull over and ect."
bad,"I made pretty good money working there. Had to work a lot of hours but the hours fly by on the job as your busy all day. Management was an absolute joke. This company absolutely does not care about the worker.  They play favorites for sure. I was fired for another driver driving into the back of my truck,  with no repercussions for that driver (Favorites) Work there if you want decent pay but no other reason. Just money"
bad,Management at Republic is its downfall ! Putting people in charge because they have a degree or past experience in management does  NOT mean  that they should be qualified to run a Landfill. That's just my two cents worth anyway.
bad,The union side of this company is great. Unfortunately you will have to deal with the management that has absolutely no idea what they are doing. Don't bother going to H.R. for anything.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"Management poorly ,tell one thing ,do the opposite. Some drivers get pay different.working environment is poor, some of trucks break every day , some don't have air conditioning hot during summer months,cold winter time."
bad,Supervisors are out to get you. This company makes big promise but never follows through. One write up and the sign on bonus is gone. You have to go a year without any write ups to get it. And the sole job of the supervisors is to make sure the company doesn't give away free money. You are paid a day rate. Trucks are in bad condition.
bad,Bad management all the way up.  I here other locations are better.  Terrible unsafe equipment. You refuse to drive a truck that has faulty brakes(leaking massive amounts of air from all over the place)another one that has smoking exhaust leaks (and A/C that doesn't work so it's filling the cab)and another that can't stay in its lane on the road and get sent home.  Instead of fixing it they ask others to drive the truck.  They bring it to the shop do nothing and say truck is safe to drive.  They keep trying to pass the truck off till someone drives it because they can't afford to go home.
bad,"Management fabricates their own version of any situation if they don’t like you, you’re doomed they mess with you psychologically and condition you their way or your out. All starts with management and trickles down to people they manipulate with unofficial raises and unearned position. If you work here bring a voice recorder or camera or they don’t believe you. Do not recommend to work here."
bad,"youll never be home, always be tired, and management only looks out for themselves all that being said if you want this job to be your life then have at it"
bad,"This place is a horrible place to work, if you are salary, you work 14 to 16 hr days. And the place smells of trash all the time. Republic Services simply sucks."
bad,"The job itself isn't bad once you finally get your paperwork and do your pre-trip. The equipment is not up to par, for example theres no AC in any of the trucks. When something breaks down it never gets fixed."
bad,Allow us to it's better other than Crossing each other over as it seems that we are all having Financial struggles other than those who are picked or consider to be a favorite due to constant complaining in the office👿
bad,Very poor management. Talk down to you with no respect. Worked to death with little appreciation. You were made to feel guilty if you didn't work on your days off. Bad management caused us to work 65-70 hours per week. No family/work life. Safety was a big concern until it cost money. Brought many safety concerns and it went on deaf ear.
bad,Location was very dirty and smelly as it is a dumping station.  Very stressful office with phones ringing constantly.  Office staff was severely underpaid.
bad,Very long days! Equipment is always broke down and never enough equipment for the daily operations. Maintenance is very poor. Management is always looking for a way to give you a warning letter or even fire you.
bad,"hard place to work long hours mean people very difficult place to make a living, managed poorly and stinks all the time, no emphasis is placed on innovation"
bad,I think the company should consider a lot of revamping. Employees should not be expected to work under such stressful conditions to the point of being mindless and miserable at the end of each workday. Extremely exhausting.
bad,loved being and ISR but the jealousy aspect came out from the account managers and sales manager. I did not feel I was appreciated as a growth representative.
bad,The landfill is run by poor management whom lets certain people do whatever they want with no questions asked. You are treated like the dirt you walk on day in day out.
bad,"Hard work for a company that sees you as a number. It has its good points and just as many bad ones. Corporate policies that make no sense in some locations. Good paying job if you want to work, more than have a home life, which is what management wants."
bad,A helpers job is crazy. One helper to a truck and the drivers does not want to help. So that leaves the helper to lift very heavy stuff. There is no team players here. The driver want you work fast so they can go home. It is very hot. Heat stroke is a great possibility. Some of the drivers don't care. They will try you. They will put you out in a rain storm with lighten and thunder with no rain gear and hope you don't get fried. This job is hard core and this is for people that are desperate. You will have back pain! English is a second language. Some of the drivers don't even want to stop for lunch. They eat while driving and you the helper is still working. Some of these people want you run down the block and get that trash. Good luck if you go. You will find out real fast.
bad,"Republic Services Corvallis Oregon is by far one of the worst run business divisions I've ever encountered.  Managers have absolutely no close of what they are doing which has caused a all most 100% turn over in maintenance personnel and an 85 or more percent turn over in drivers.  This leaves a void in experience that cannot be replaced in a day.  Maintenance is run by a fleet manager that has run off top experienced technicians in every business unit under his direction.  Corvallis, Salem, Grants Pass, Albany, and Coffin Butte Landfill have all been somewhat crippled by his leadership and the higher leadership doesn't seem to understand or don't care.  Of course where else would you put a person who was kicked out of Salem Republic Services for his loving personality that was so horrifying that he all most caused the drivers to walk out.  Operations in Corvallis needs to be totally revamped.  Most of the drivers with experience and time there have left and new drivers coming in are all ready looking for jobs.  Will someone from the higher management level please wake up listen and fix the problems at that business division.  The advice from former a present employees is to purge management completely and do some firing of the incompetent managers and hire people who actually know what they are doing and care about there subordinates."
bad,"I am not going waste a lot of energy going into detail. The pay is good, the hours are terrible, advancement is limited at best unless you are a BFI legacy or a suckup. Management is clueless as to the realities of our job and will rarely have your back if necessary, furthermore every aspect of your job is micromanaged and a paperwork nightmare. Having said that, if you are a single person (or prefer not being around your family) it is possible to make a very comfortable living."
bad,"Very simple, don't waste your time. This company is all about clicks. They do not treat their employees all the same. Their Company Policy book only applies to employees they don't like."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,Ver bad they lost contract and contract employee get hurt and they don't help them or there family thet lie about recycling and send 80% of the materiel to the landfill whwn the city comes in for inspections they ge over whelmed and have the night crew take the materiel up to the landfill at night so the city don't know the the materiel didn't get ran. They lost a lot of contract because bad costume service guys always on there phone at republic
bad,"I was verbally abused daily, both by my foreman and manager which will be left unnamed, were rude to me on the daily, and as an intern they were not patient or willing to help me with simple questions or tasks so that I could learn and grow to help the company and be better at my job."
bad,It's a good place to work but management needs to be adjusted.They the job more work than it is.Not enough people or just broken Equipment. Difficulty
bad,Upper management really stinks but not bad place to work. Pay was good but had really bad upper management to deal with and let go really without any write ups or warning.
bad,Poor management that has a rotating door. 10 yrs there and 4 general managers. 4 operation managers. Numerous supervisors that have no idea what job consists of. Everyone can do job better but none willing to actually do the job. Sign on bonuses because cant keep drivers.
bad,I cant go into details. It would be a book.Basically. Strong back weak mind.Good o.t.they pay ok.other's pay more.was hassrasted. Buy employees miss lead.about job.no support. No training. Thrown udder the bus. Go elsewhere.
bad,If you want to haul trash not the worst place to be.  Pay is higher than average.  Health insurance is so-so but you could do worse.  No-one cared how long you worked until they switched to hourly pay in 2018.
bad,No open door policy.. supervisor shows favoritism.. everyone is intimidated by lisa customer service supervisor..stressful work place and poor training
bad,"Huge diversity within the Columbia location, rules and policies are made up and used to managements advantage when they feel the need to intimidate! Lack of respect from management! You give your all and they constantly want more! Serious turnover rate with employees in my time of being there, I have seen 14 mechanics and supervisors/managers in maintenance come and go during my time there( 6 years), If your single and don’t mind dirty work and long hours while working weekends in holidays then this would be a perfect fit for you! If none of that I terst you then keep scrolling and do t even apply because they will paint an amazing picture to get you in and then stick it to you! Do t know about republic as a whole but Columbia SC is a bad move for employment."
bad,Long hard hours. Trucks often go on routes with known safety issues. Average 10 or 11 hours a day. Often going up to and over 14hrs in a day. They are good about training though... You learn a lot about the equipment.
bad,Hostile work environment like inventory not family oriented was not appreciated did not appreciate all the hard work that was done was not appreciated with the knowledge
bad,"Start day at 5am. Work through lunch to get your route completed. Equipment routinely has breakdowns, thus making it difficult to complete the route. If route is not completed that day you must return the following day and finish it, then you can start the new route for that day. Now you will be behind on your route for the rest of the week. Company has a policy that if you call in sick more than 4 times in year then you receive a Disciplinary Write up"
bad,"dealt with constant new challenges which made the job great, supervised great people, making tuff decisions with Cities to Improve Service and Schedule Special Request, had the privilege to work with great Cities in Texas and also meet an extended amount  of great People whom I still considered them my great friends."
bad,"At the beginning of this position, the environment was great. Throughout the next few years a lot has changed. The management was really rude and over all I do not recommended anyone to the office."
bad,"As they say good employees dont quit jobs they quit bad managment"
bad,co hires temps that can not do or meet osha requirements to save money but costs time  drivers in  time.  Has very poor HAR department. Does not accept valid medical leave for employees would rather terminate them
bad,"My experience was a company that looks great at a glance, but you slowly discover why they always need more temporary employees. I was ignored for up to 6 hours at a time, stuck at a post that was distanced, and at one point with no working radio. When I got breaks, I was always rushed as the person filling in was often supposed to be somewhere else. I learned that temps were making more than lifelong employees who had chosen to stay in entry level positions, because they liked their jobs. Temp employees were kind of treated like second class citizens, even though many of the permanent hires had started as temps."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"Normal , free Lunch , relax , somewhere thats not Ruth ,good friend ship with my Core workers , hippy , help others , Word as a team, Watling to come on Monday."
bad,"i was fairly new to driving trucks and was promised. a min of 21 days with a ""behind the wheel trainer"". well i guess all the ""trainers""  but one had accidents and lost their certification. the only available trainer was very disgruntled and not a people person or willing to train a beginer. so i had 6 non consecutive days where i drove whilst being barked at and belittled , then rode around with a non trainer for 3+ weeks till i had an accident where i was written up and terminated for non satisfactory progress and a saftey violation with someone who was not even a trainer. also it seems that none of the trucks are safe enough to drive. theVCR's are filled out every day but with no budget it all gets neglected."
bad,There are many opportunities for employee engagement. The benefits and pay are fair. The hardest part working at Republic Services is the culture.  The best part of the job were the benefits.
bad,The local managers at my division are horrible human being .They have the power and can take away your job after 38 years of loyalty and dedication for personal reasons .Then they terminated both my sons one had been there 18 years and the other 12 years.What a horrible place to work where employee are just a number next
bad,too much conflict among employees! Superintents did not supervise as required.Was a good place to work until Republic bought it. I can't say here what employees did to make job disliked.
bad,The work culture was an enjoyable place to work with your co-worker. Most are helpful with workloads. Management and become unbarring and unappreciative.
bad,The Raleigh location likes to fire management. I worked here for just over a year and they had fired over 12 people 2 in which were in one week the same week that I had given my notice. Be careful as there is a lot of drama in this location and the employees are very clicky if your not in the click they will fire you.You will be worked and they will expect more then what you can give as a dispatcher.. if you have family issues don't plan on keeping your job they don't care..
bad,"If you ever worked at an real good company where you were able to help and have an 1st call resolution with  support and felt good.THIS ISN'T THE PLACE! 3rd supervisor in 6 month and I have more CS experience... like working at an 3rd party out sourced call center.... Great employees whom a after an few month all have same question. What does managment accually do here but warm an seat and fill position? Response from most.... no clue or guess it all whom you know! If new to call center envoirment or you an robot, whom really doest care about customer after you hang up this is for you!"
bad,Excellent pay and benefits but the managers micro manage to the point were you fail. They constantly blame drivers for all mishaps. Customers dont adhere to company policies.
bad,"hated it!! too many ""policy changes"" that were only enforced to certain employees. management sucks and wouldn't know how to take a call if needed. they are not customer friendly all they care about is you meeting your productivity and adherence. they dont value their good employees. no empathy for unforseen circumstances in employess personal life outside of work. supervisors smile and your face and turn to your co workers and peers and talk about you. too much favortisim when it came to enforcing ""policy"""
bad,"Your on a hill all day picking up trash by hand and some how your going to get yelled at for doing it wrong ,and when u do get that all done the wind comes and destroys the hill again so its never ending"
bad,"A typical work day at Republic Service is STRESSFUL, OVERWORKED, UNDERPAID, Management don't know their JOB,  Equipment don't work and is none fixable."
bad,"Preparing air and gas reports for OEPA.  Download and check all gas reports from ET.  Prepare engineering budgets for three landfills.  Site inspections and manage all reports for each landfill.   Accounting duties:  Month end closing for 20 landfills. Prepare month end payroll reports for month end.  Do journal entries, general ledger, and accounts payable."
bad,This place has displayed racism and discrimination. They make sure that you feel left out if you do one thing wrong. This place is more like a high school than  work place. I have talked to every HR you can name I have even called lawyers.
bad,Company has no respect for its drivers. Does not care at all period..... will not pay for over time.... you will be required too haul over weight loads. You will threatened on a consistent basis of employment.  They feel they are above the law of this country.
bad,Too many people here are related. Sonority doesn't matter. It's all who you know . If they don't like you they will find a way to get rid of you. Not a friendly atmosphere
bad,They tell you one thing and their actions are another it’s like day and night you can not trust the people who you are working for but the company is good to work for the management will tell you lies after lies to get you hired on and never keep the promises they told you
bad,"I worked for republic for three years, and I have never seen a place changed so much. I understand the call center was new, but every month there was something that was changing. Even when things didn’t work they expected you to keep doing it the wrong way so you could fail and eventually fire you. There was no room for growth! The management team knew who they wanted to advance and who they didn’t. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here."
bad,I was supposed to be a nonCDL Driver started me out loading trucks and cleaning garbage totes out said I was going to train on the truck never did.this job don’t let get no breaks but one 30min then u got to work the 30 min back u in the hot sun all day terrible.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,Its all favoritism and discrimination   The management is bad. They underpay minorities. The genaral manager and HR do nothing to adress the problems at work. Very hostile work environment
bad,company is way to big. The service is poor for it to be a fortune 500 company. Reps do not get paid enough to BS customers all day on the phone. if you dont care about customer service then this is the job for you.
bad,"Container delivery also consist of picking up HEAVY BULK ITEMS COUCHES, STOVES, etc by yourself. No ac in truck. I ended up in the HOSPITAL. It’s sadd"
bad,The manager could not handle the seriousness of maintenance costs of a aging fleet of solid waste vehicles. The direction of suggested maintenance costs reduction was a unrealistic thought.
bad,Don’t have a accident they wait 5 months to suspend you for it other than that it is not a bad company to work for. Most of their fleet is newer and take care of there trucks
bad,"Favoritism, poor management, liars, low pay, no team work, everyone is out for themselves. Management has had proof of drivers having horrible customer service, slamming carts and not obeying republic rules and regulations yet nothing is done. The list goes on forever I would not recommend anyone to even apply save yourself the headache and move on to the next application."
bad,"Cut throat.  The dispatchers hate each other, but will dig the same grave to bury you.  Dangerous and toxic environment.  Redundant work.  Supervisors and managers have no clue what they're doing.  I've seen monkey scat fights at the zoo more organized than this place."
bad,"You will be asked to perform your job unsafely to meet goals dictated by the company."
bad,"The environment was cold.  Employees who were not in ""good"" with upper management were scared to move from their desks and make eye contact with anyone.  Supervisors had their favorites who hung out with them, outside of work and could mistreat other employees without reprimand. The residential supervisor, speaks in Spanish to his favorites, and most of the time their conversation is inappropriate or they are talking bad about another employee who is generally 5ft away (totally unprofessional).  If someone reports the abuse to management, they are sure to lose their job."
bad,Ther were no safety equipment supplied for breathing the different types of trash and chemicals that were received.
bad,"I got a interview with this company and I thought the interview went well but to my suprise when I did not get a call. I call the number given for follow up and noone never answered or returned my call.  This company does not represent what I was presented in the interview.  Where was the customer service?  Gone on strike, I guess.  Bad PR......."
bad,"This is a company I tried to get employment with in 2013. I had the experience they were looking for and could have almost stepped right in and done a good job for them, yet they not only turned me down, they did not bother communicating with me that I did not get the position. "
bad,It was a great career opportunity but management in this division was horrible at that time a lot of the employees were undercover prejudice and openly displayed it
bad,"Stressful, micro managing, manager thinks hes better than you, equipment always down,training sucks,people quitting left and right cause of manager!!!"
bad,I would show up at the office. Each day a set assignment of the days trips and loads. I had good coworkers. I constantly worried if I would be employed. The turn around rate for this employer was high.
bad,you are a number replaceable in seconds they dont care about you personally only  money if you have your own thinking your thinking on the enemployment line
bad,Good luck having a life outside of work you are expected to work at least 10 hour days 5 days a week depending on location sometimes it's more there ain't no training Management's not organized management cares more about their bonuses then their employees
bad,Same routine day in and day out.  Supervisors are not always aware of internal issues or choose to fix them.  Many people leave because of management.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"Run as fast as you can away from this company.  5-10 years ago was a great place to work. Today not so much. Local GM is only focused on making a name for himself. Customers quitting in droves, equipment always down, routes incomplete.  The backbone employees are leaving due to poor management.  Someone needs to take a look behind the curtain to see what is really happening in a division that 2 years ago was stellar and is now at the bottom. Ask yourself what is the one thing that has changed??"
bad,"The pay is substandard, the management is scared to make a decision, work is all of the time, no trust in its employees to do the right thing, promotional track is non existent, every department is in a silo, no working together, power struggle with, vacation policy is poor, will eliminate a job in the drop of a hat and take pay away."
bad,Don't consider for employment. Lack of communication from the management team. No follow up or direction. HR is unprofessional and horrible.  No career advancement.
bad,"Very poor management,they do not take care of their equipment and the operators are there just for a check. No one there takes pride in their work and there is no type of communication between workers and management. If you are looking to work alot of hrs 6days a week and have a I dont care attitude then this is the place for you"
bad,"Horrible work/life balance, benefits, and management. It was not the company it said it was and I was not doing half of the things on the job description."
bad,go to work not knowing if the truck you drive is in working order. If not you're put in trucks that can also breakdown so you can't get your route done. And you are EXPECTED to get your route done! If you can't then they want you to work on Saturday to finish. Lots of stress. Not well liked if you speak up when something is wrong. Want you to work like robots and shutup.
bad,The supervisors are not required to know the jobs for which they supervise. They are not held to any standard. They do not lead by example. Too much horseplay and not enough attention paid to the customers or employees. Alot expected from their employees with nothing in return. Very Racist. Very Antagonistic. No Structure.
bad,Company employees insecure GM's and HR Managers are inept and never present or available for questions.  Very little direction and no clear answers when questions were asked about new policies and procedures.  Hiring process for staff/team members is extremely slow and almost non-existent.  Recruiters of the company are in AZ and I was trying to hire people in NC.  Very large disconnect during this process.  It is extremely slow so be patient if you are applying for employment.  SR. Management wants your opinion but doesn't listen to anything.  They have pre-determined what they will do and take nothing into consideration.  It's a true dictatorship.
bad,"Divisional Leadership lacking integrity, in the Greensboro Market. Issues transpiring that were not corrected leaving the company open to severe DOT Violations and issues."
bad,I think that is why they went under is cause just the lack of leadership and moral was really low before and of course after the strike so the buy out by recology was long over due
bad,Worst company to work for in Sacramento Ca.Routes are to large and when you ask for help they tell you only if you are broken down. Junk equipment to drive. Most drivers are cool and helpful. Management sucks.Low starting pay of 18.00 dollars an hour.
bad,"I do not care to elaborate at this time.  However, I will say, the company has management issues that cause and sustain a multitude of problem the company blames on the lower level management/supervisor employees."
bad,Stood up for 8 hours straight picking trash off a conveyor belt for minimum wage. During the summer felt like you were in an oven and in the winter felt like an ice box.
bad,"Worked as a Collections Specialist in the Lewisville office.  NO ONE talks to you (as a new person) unless they want you to do some of their work.  The A/R Clerk stated something derogatory about me, the new supervisor heard it and told the CFO. It was their decision that I was a problem NOT THE PERSON MAKING THE COMMENTS!  She was rude, ignorant and made my life hell. Anyway, she is still there and has turned around MANY other people in that position after she got me fired.  I could have done her job and mine and saved the company money.  Their choice...they made it and they will be stuck with it."
bad,This company was constantly out of supplies needed to provide the customer with services. They did not have a formal training program and they did not invest in the success of new employees.
bad,Constant upheavals when someone comes over from Waste Management and then replaces everyone with personell they work with at their prior job. I guess this is a constant in this industry.
bad,Starting off on the operational side I accomplished that. I moved on to the maintenance supervisor role. I knew was lacking preventive maintenance for the last 6 years I did all I could do to make us go from a 77% uptime to a astonishing 97% uptime.
bad,This place has a high turn over rate. They try to write you up for anything. The hours are terrible. Management doesn't know what they're doing. Other mechanics try to throw each other under the bus.
bad,Woman have no real place in the trash line at Republic. They did away with rearloads and make drivers do everything themselves. Routes are not even. Uou have eliminated woman in the resi line of trash and young people not qualified to drive but can still work. Favoritism and buddies between employee and managment is a bit ridiculous.
bad,Complete waste of time. Management has no idea of who is doing the work and who isn’t. It’s all about if they like you or not. You can work work as hard as you want and they will never notice. Save your self the trouble.
bad,Not under good management they don't care about their workers you are just another number to them. The days are long and you don't get enough sick time or days off for this type of work.
bad,"Republic states work life balance, but does not follow.  Sales Manager not able to do what they were hired to do. No trust in allowing professional sales reps to manage their own customers without input from everyone.  Not enough time in work week to accomplish everything that is asked - continued to be asked to complete work that has nothing to do with sales"
bad,It was a if I know you I’ll pick you type job some days you wasted time coming out there to work. It’s most likely different now but was horrible when I was there.
bad,"No real advancement from drivers, good ol boy system in full effect. The have low pay long hours and employees are just a number. Was told many times you are replaceable. Management doesn't communicate well with drivers and seems like they are out to write guys up for anything."
bad,"bad thing is, you have to train yourself. good thing is, management doesn't have time to hover over office workers because they never know who's doing what. Multiple process changes and emails from different managers in and out of the local office.  Management doesn't get along so choose your alliance and play the role then you just may last and grow with this company. Find a stable buddy who actually knows what they're doing. I suggest one of the admin girls. Bribe other departments with food & treats then your work is sure to get handled."
bad,Management doesn't care about their employees unless u could  threaten their job security. they got big bonuses because we over-exceeded expectations with our product output and broke company records but they dont give us bonuses because we were hourly. if they want to hire a different employee they will find any reason to get you written up including but not limited to breaking labor laws and then coerce u into signing an incriminating document so can't fight it. DO NOT WORK HERE
bad,It was cool no complaints. Under paid but cool to work for.  Flexible schedule cool manager. Clean environment.  Recommended for friends or family. Hire basically anyone with any background.
bad,"By that I am saying you have no life during the week, simply because you never no what time you are going to be done. Supervisors and some mangers don't even have there cdl's to know what it is to drive a route in there trucks. And are the first to second guess your ability to drive the truck when they never have. It was a sick feeling going to work there every morning."
bad,My experience was horrible here. Everyday was a new challenge and not a good one. The pay was not good for the duties that were required of you.
bad,The work load expected on the field is increasing and unreasonable
bad,"If your a hustler that is not concerned with the quality of trucks, your personal life, being treated poorly, shop guys that are horrible mechanics and do not care about your safety and dealing with all the corporate nonsense this might be the place for you. More then half the drivers at this location would walk out tomorrow if they had an opportunity to do so. Mostly because of management and Dispatch issues.  "
bad,"As a current employee, I  have seen and heard a lot of broken promises from our supervisors, they don't know what it takes to do the job,when we have problems come up in the field, they don't know what the driver's go through to get the job done,as long as it looks good on paper. They need to actual drive a route and operate the truck to see the problem we come across every day"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"was a fun place to work until upper management gets involved. Relationships  with coworkers was great. Benefits were good. There were lots of perks, Could never speak with upper management"
bad,They don't pay the workers enough and there's no set schedule.Also the truck drivers are very rude.they also don't give you the equipment that is required.
bad,Republic services LA county not the best place to work managers do not know what they're doing workers are horrible all 5 transfer stations the lowest of the in the trash industry
bad,They have completely changed in the last 3 years.  Extremely poor management.  No work/life balance.  Extreme micromanaging. They do not care about the employees welfare.  They preach safety is number one but will not provide poly (light weight) containers for the drivers. Good benefits but extremely stressful
bad,Upper management does not listen about other management and how horrible they treat and talk to their employees. Work life balance does not exist with this company
bad,"After being hired on ,less than 30 days later they told me they lost a contract in Mississippi. Therefore I may get bumped by someone else with more seniority (last hired 1st fired). Then the last week of my employment there they told me I could transfer. That was a lie."
bad,high management turn over. at least 3 general managers while there 2 years. each one brought all there own people who knew nothing about the job at hand. this was a trucking company and no one person in management knew anything about trucking....period...
bad,"With the experience that I had at republic services promotion was not an option for me even though I had recently had the position, Corporate ideas does not make its way to this business unit."
bad,First we only got paid 8.25 and we're picking up dead animals needles and all types of hazardous stuff and then we where talked to like trash by our higher ups
bad,the company has implemented a daily sales goals and expectations on meetings and daily calls are excessive to do job. the workplace culture is toxic. there are employees that for every little thing they run to management. I have seen where employees have cried because of the way they are treated by other employees. The management wants goals set that is not conducive to daily work environment.
bad,"I worked for Republic Services for 18 months as outside sales rep.  The management constantly and supervisors play favorites to the point that you feel like you work for 2 different companies.  The account managers can both manage and sell to new business.  So there is a constant fight over new builds.  They won't even put their leads into Salesforce so that you can see that someone is actively working the account and just close the account with your name and your meetings behind your back.  My sales manager required the sales reps to come in 5 days a week leave the office and then come back in the afternoon.  I would have to stop what I was doing at 3:30 pm in the afternoon to just sit in traffic. Mean while the account managers could come go as they pleased.  The software the company uses is still a 1986 software and the ipads are not set up for click to sign which is time consuming.  The micro management is at a corporate level and the goals are no where close to being obtainable.  It is sad when you get a monthly sales report across the country and 10 reps are at 80 percent or higher.  They actually consider 50 percent doing good.  Which for me is not heard of from any previous employer.  I do believe Republic Services is a good company but needs to put money into their cullture, and technology.  The turn over is extremely high because the salaries are okay but with a few years of sales experience and accomplishments you can certainly have a higher base salary and a more aggressive commission structure."
bad,"It’s realy not a bad company it’s just the Management department need major improvement, HR treat you like you nobody, they don’t listen to Driver’s complaints"
bad,"The area management is awful and racist.  If you don't think like them, look like them, or worship them you don't have a place on their team.  Then to top things off, they placed an incompetent GM on their team in  Wayne/Pontiac... of course she looks like them, is racist, and use there brain to think for her because she can't get the job done-- in my opinion."
bad,It’s fast pasted heaven lifting work in any weather conditions management could use more work the pay is low but overal it’s a good starter job to get you in rotation
bad,"A culture of bias, disability discrimination, and mysoginy was prevalent at this location. Management regularly bullied and degraded employees. This was atypical behavior for Republic Services."
bad,"Managers don't know what they are doing and nothing is running smoothly at the new Call Centers. Even though other operations are not functioning properly, the customer resource reps are expected to function at a very high level with unrealistic productivity demands. The pressure is from productivity, compliance, adherence, error rate, attendance and it is relentless."
bad,you have to work long hours. You do not get enough paid vacations. I learned hot to operate the hopper on the back of the truck. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor and the smell.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,People either don't come to work at all or if they do they seem to act like they don't know what to do with themselves or how to complete their work orders to keep the trucks that we put on the road maintained and safe
bad,Too many want to be chiefs instead of paying attention to their own job and trying to play supervisor. Poor management poor time starts to have a family life but perfect job for a single man.
bad,management diddnt no what they was doing great co workers pretty nice routes great customers you put some hard work in learned how to run routes long hours
bad,This is a company that services customers trash.  Benefits are good.  Paid time off and time off for death of a family member.  Home with family at Christmas.
bad,If you are an hourly employee you are good with the exception that some supervisors and managers will lie for their benefit.  Policy and standards are expected to be followed unless you are a supervisor or management.
bad,"In recent years they have adopted wonderful new policies. "
bad,"very stressful place to work, long hours you don't know when you are going to get off work.pay and benefits are good but you wont have a life at home. they dont do proper diagnostics of hydraulic systems. parts are not available. need more people there always short staffed."
bad,You wear different hats and unique industry. Can be successful with right leadership and successful promotion of its employees. There is a lot talent often overlooked especially in employees that have been with the company for a long time.
bad,"There is no work life balance,none of the management is held acountable . There is a lot of racial problems with this BU, if I had known I never would have taken this job"
bad,OK if you just want to be a manager but hours aren't great and not a lot of investment in employees.  Hard work and if you can't hit your numbers it can be a pretty tough environment
bad,"Changes polices and management do not explain the polices very well,a day is long and majority of time no time for lunch breaks,it is a joy to serve people,management shows favoritism to certain employees"
bad,"When I first started at republic services post waste facility I was completely satisfied with the way they handed day to day business. Conditions were met, everyone got home to their families at a reasonable hour, there was a extreme focus on safety, and most important the managers were fair. As time went on however the atmosphere changed. Under qualified personnel were put into positions of authority. Now the equipment is run down, and your work hours are extended or retracted at the whim of your supervisor. If you do not run broken equipment you will have to come in on the weekends and finish the job sometimes long into the night. 75 hour work weeks are not uncommon. If you complain to the supervisor you are not taken seriously. I would not recommend anyone work at this republic services landfill."
bad,"Overtime is not calculated at time in half, they calculate overtime using Chinese overtime which adds up to $1-$2 more on your check."
bad,"depending on your department head, there could be good days and bad days.  micromanagement is a big thing here, specifically on employee time in and outs."
bad,"Poor management - lack of communication between management and employees."
bad,While working there they didnt provide you with the equipment to complete your job successfully. The truck I drove often broke down and made my long day even longer.
bad,"There are many better choices in West Texas.  Choose wisely.  A couple years ago was a great place, but with new contract came new management with different agenda.  Myself and numerous others were chased away by reading where the location was going."
bad,"in my 2+ experience at this company as a scale operator/ gate attendant. Was great at first but then everyone else looks down upon you as the small fry. And it will remain that way. Advancement is not an pinion they will say you can but will not happen, management does not care about you, work balance is terrible they will call you in all the time no matter if you have plans for your day off or not."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"Constantly changing, lack of support, must be independent and adept at Dodge Ball. Salary poor for qualifications."
bad,abnormal working conditions
bad,"I have been there since mid 90's and it has become the worse place to work. It has very bad moral and guys don't get along. It has very bad management who try to push u to your breaking point , which causes accidents. They go through supervisors all the time especially when they don't conform to what the upper management wants. Very long hrs and they just don't care for your family life. I would not recommend this company to my worse enemy. It really is a bad place to work."
bad,Working for this company was crazy. It was a very stressful working enviroment. The managers I had to work under didn't about my well being. It was hard to go to work every morning knowing how it was.
bad,Co-workers are great !!!  Hours can be tough at times....Most of the equiptment has some type of issue ... Job is physically and mentally exhausting.. Corporation does what ever they want with pay ... They Rarely give out raises.. Have a pay cap and basically no oppertunities to progress..Over all it is a dead end job...
bad,Just rush trucks out the door not caring how many tires fall off or trucks burn down. Plus techs are backstabbers like loosing lugnuts on trucks you did out in the lot. Dont try to tell management tho they dont care.
bad,"The one thing I liked about this place was the drivers. They are amazing. Management on the other hand is a joke. They lack communication & are never there when you need them. If you aren't a part of their ""circle"" it is hard to get them to do anything, such as taking care of customers/customer complaints. They turn their cheek when it comes to inner office complaints & only are concerned if they can benefit from it. "
bad,The management in this company is absolutely horrible they make it seem like every little thing you do is badd in your horrible employee even if what happens is unintentional the safety mechanisms to prevent disasters are non existent in vehicles and that's why there turn over is so big females make mistakes get fired males make the same mistakes get to stay horrible company sorry I ever worked there
bad,"Company endorses unfair practices in the area of promotions.  I was fully qualified and applied for several positions unsuccessfully due to my age.  No one in my building over age 50 was promoted during my more than 2 years of employment. Unable to prove but obvious to anyone who could observe objectively. "
bad,Pay is good  management is horrible no care for staff  constant change never good allows customer to degrade representatives  company never picks up trash and has representatives lie to customers about why and when we’ll come back out
bad,"Slave drivers who couldn't care less is you had death in the family, I'll children or anything. Just be there regardless to pick that trash up. "" Or your career may be in jeopardy."""
bad,"This is a trash company and some managers treat the employees like trash. There is no recourse for employee complaints about management. It’s not what you know it’s who you know, which is in all companies but in this case if you don’t tow everyone’s line you can be fired for no reason, or one that’s made up"
bad,Price increases for customers occur twice a year so be ready for angry customers to call weekly complaining about the fuel fees and price increases.  Operations would be a better job here. Don't do Sales.
bad,If you want to work for little pay and look over for movement to another position.. if you want to work for them it would a good move take as stepping stone!!!
bad,Not enough money or help too much work....not worth my physical health...lasy people always get good credit here...hard worker's get more work😂not a good conpany
bad,"Poor equipment and maintenance sucks!!!    "
bad,"Good pay if you work 45 plus hours. Too many bosses, have management follow you when driving and find anything to write you up or mistakes in driving. Drivers are are great to get along with. Lead driver thinks he is a god but isn't good for the company. Area bosses come in and make rules all the time and pretend to listen to employees but nothing ever comes to it. Stay away unless you like bowing down to others."
bad,"Good company if you are a follower, Bad company if a leader and have common sense. If you choose to work here do your job, shut up and go home. Policy changes all the time. You are not rewarded for working hard and going a good job. Beware their are untouchables at this company, There is a problem here In the one year that I worked here We went threw 3 different managers for our department and a span of three months with out a manager in our department. Between the three departments total in a span of a year we went threw 8 different managers and still don't have a manger in one of the departments."
bad,A lot of the problem at this location is the favoritism of certain employees.  Also safety is number one priority but they are willing to send drivers out when road conditions are so bad cars shouldn't be out.  This job would not be so bad if we had decent upper management  untill this happens Fairmont will always suck.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,for union  job only paid 15 an hour no raises until next contract equipment break downs all the time. poor management didnt care for who you are just a number
bad,"They dont work with you, they dont care what you have going on. Management is all about number numbers! Management wil talk down to you and belittle you!"
bad,"Time to move on, 27 years with the company I feel I do not get the respect.  "
bad,"this place is all about cliques, it's as though it is a high school and it is everyone for themselves there. The management are split into two cliques, and one group is great, while the other just simply do not care about their staff."
bad,"The company ONLY hires managers from outside. After the last 9 years since the merger, I have never seen anybody promoted from within. Managers are hired , not only from outside the company, but outside of our industry. People are put in charge, who know NOTHING about the waste industry. Very high turn over of Division Sales Managers. Very micro-managed day for all sales people. It was not like that before Republic Waste merged with Allied Waste, in 2009."
bad,"Management is currently being held captive by the transfer station employees who have threatened to go Union, but have temporarily re sent their cards in order to get what they want."
bad,"This is a typical call center. However, management is bad with communication. Things change really quickly and it's difficult to know whether you're doing a good job or a bad job. My direct supervisor was great, and did all she could to help."
bad,"This company will hire and training all, is great for favoritism, their way or no way if you work in the center."
bad,"Lack of support from management, unless you are part of their favorite group. Blatant favouritism.  Micromanagement and scare/fear tactics are a daily thing.  In house HR department is a joke."
bad,"The environment, at least for managers, is not collaborative at all.  Everyone is very territorial and leadership is poor.  I would not recommend Republic Services as a place to work for Human Resources professionals."
bad,"Long hours"
bad,"Overloaded workday with unreasonable expectations from management; Inadequate training, Changing Expectations; Unstable future; Good staff; Excellent pay and benefits"
bad,Don't expect to move up ever. the work environment and co-workers are very good to get along with but as for management its nothing but a bunch of back stabbers and people that don't know what they are doing. Unprofessional and lack of leadership
bad,"Strong lack of understanding by management to make sure the tools to do the job are in place. Success was measured by the numbers and not by taking care of the customers.  Multi software did not work. It was always ""we're working on it"""
bad,"in fairness it was a good place to advance your skills , even though you had to figure out a lot of it on your own. The work environment was nasty, of course it was garbage trucks but in my opinion more could have been done to provide a sanitary environment. Management depending on your skill level and your willingness to give up your life to company needs will treat you accordingly. I worked there for a number of years and overall I would say it was not a bad place to work but as a supervisor once told me  "" this job is a stepping stone to a better job "" ."
bad,"My friends spouse was a class A tech for the Little Rock Ar. His shop supervisor was horrendous. He expected him to come in at 1 pm got off between 6. To  8 am the next morning 6 days a week. He was promised a pay raise never got one . When the Union wanted to come in the shop supervisor took 2 of the new hires to lunch to have a ""conversation"" with them.. Before that lunch the Union had enough votes to come in. After the ""lunch"" they didn't. My friend husband was told due to his support of the Union he would be fired eventually. Anyone who makes the  the shop supervisor mad  always ends up fired and or accused of something they did not do. The Little Rock shop has zero tolerance for those who have family members who are dealing with depression , mood disorders, chronic health problems. If you or a family member are Dealing these issues avoid this company.. They will fire you. "
bad,"Unless you are in the corporate office or in the operations department, corporate doesn't care. The only ones that will care about you are the people in your office, to corp, you are just another number. Even though you are the face of the company to customers, no one realizes or cares about that. Your thoughts and opinions of how to make the customer service process better will just fall onto deaf ears. The center is way understaffed for the amount of customers there are, which creates large hold times and upset customers, for whom you will then be their punching bag. The amount of verbal abuse and disrespect you have to take on a daily basis is way more than a person can handle. And you better not hang up or tell the person how they are treating you, because that will result in corrective action. The pay is not enough to deal with what they expect you to, and you better be really good with computers and mulit-tasking since you will have at least 5 programs running at 1 time, and in those 5 programs, at least 15 different pages open total. One good thing about the center is that the manager does care and tries, but that also seems to just go no where. Supervisors don't always have enough training for the job, you can ask supervisors the same question and get a different answer every time. There is no consistency to be able to do your job properly. The supervisors are also off the floor so much that you have to rely on your coworkers to help you, but if you get caught asking them a question, prepare to get an attitude from the sup. The coworkers there are the most supportive"
bad,"The work was stressful and customers expect entirely too much of trash. The field employees work all year round from 4 am to sometimes late at night. Unless you are in the office, the schedule is too crazy to work here. The co-workers are okay but the environment is pretty disgusting. Management changes very frequently."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"Company is very dishonest.... and is not trustworthy the union Teamsters 294 does not stand up for there members.... they only care about the union dues... Management there is very poor.. And if you are a minority (BLACK) the pay scale is lower,  and unfortunately advancement as a minority is rare at this company.. also if you are earning above wages they find away to get rid of you This company is not Loyal to there employees."
bad,Dont let the pay fool you. It's really not a bad place but there are favorites. I was let go for a backing accident which I could understand if I had more than one. I hit a telephone wire with my bucket. and I drove on grass. So thats 3 strikes. its a gamble.
bad,"Worked here for over 2 years. Enjoy the challenges of daily operations. However, due to work longevity mandates, unless you can bid out of a lower position you have no chance of scheduling changes, no weekends off without using a personal day, no holidays off with your family, and no respect."
bad,"In Mobile, AL it is very difficult to operate as a Human Resources Manager. The local management team there is not interested in having Human Resources as a business partner. Unfortunately until management turns-over in the Mobile business unit, Human Resources Managers will not be successful in that company."
bad,"This company perpetuates a proactive work environment when in reality, it is under budgeted and solely reactive. Very fast paced with a hypocritical management team. ""Do as I say, not as I do"" mentality. No room for advancement and many managers / supervisor return to lesser positions or leave due to the impossible demands. Not a career position. The hiring process takes about 6 weeks."
bad,Not A company I would work for again unfair wages and treatment of employees
bad,"the management doesnt have your back, only look out for themselves...treat you like a dime a dozen...push all employees to the breaking point...talk safety in workplace BUT management does not adhere to safety practices...100% turnover during my time there"
bad,"always multiple pieces of equipment down throughout the day. employees want to do the right thing but not given the tools to complete their jobs. place is always operating with hair on fire trying to get caught up. No accountability from upper management, throws everyone under bus when a problem occurs."
bad,"Start at 5:15am, get off around 4:30pm. You're on a ""day rate"" which is basically salary. Overtime is Chinese OT. Get around $5.50 per hour for overtime. Mandatory 48-50 hours for a $400 pay check. Healthcare is expensive."
bad,"Order, receive, stock parts for technicians "
bad,"You will work hard with short breaks and little appreciation from management. Co-workers are ok. The hardest part of the job was seeing good workers leave time and time again, because of unfair treatment."
bad,"To do pre and post trip inspections on trucks that I drive on the day I drive them, To drive assigned route giving to me when other drivers are out or on vacation."
bad,"very inconsistent, treats workers very bad for the little bit they pay"
bad,Mangement only cared about the bottom dollar. The welfare of the workers wasn't taken into consideration.
bad,it an ok place to work.  management is a mess.  they don't know what they are doing day to day and it affects the work.  they are constantly threatening your job as well.
bad,"It’s a job. The training is comprehensive. The hours are a little ridiculous and the job is pretty intense. The reason why they pay you so much is because, quite frankly, there are parts that are extremely disgusting. I was told by a manager that I needed to lower my standards in order to work here. I’m not happy, but it’s a job. I don’t have to love what I do. I don’t even have to like it. But I will jump at the first opportunity."
bad,"I have worked a republic services and has been the absolute worst place to work, most of the management has no clue what they are doing and worker are severely underpaid for all that they do"
bad,Management does not care about the health of their employees. All about the numbers. Little room for advancement and current management known to play favorites.
bad,"Republic is a decent company to work for, but the dept that I worked in is a cesspool!! they play favorites (they deny it to the core) and will only assist and promote their favorites. The current Manager of National Accounts Customer service is as fake as a $3 dollar bill. She will tell you everything you want to hear yet her actions tell differently. past employees would always cry about discrimination (age & ethnicity) and I would always just pass it off as disgruntled employees. I now recant that thought as it is absolutely 10000% accurate."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,Company doesn’t care what you have going on at home all they care about is you doing their job .... the pay is good and the management is so unprofessional and constantly changing
bad,This company does not appreciate their employees and when equipment breaks down they will not pay you for the hours you missed because of poor maintenance.
bad,They were okay to work for. Management will run this place in to the ground. It was nice to have Ice Cream Friday’s. That was a nice bonus on hit summer days.
bad,"Area management is never involved until there are issues. When they do choose to become involved, they will not accept any responsibility for their lack of involvement or lack of support. If local management identifies problems beyond their control, they are told it's all their fault. There is no support. Area management's solutiomn is to terminate everyone and start over instead of addressing the real issues. Local management careers are short lived. You will be blamed for area management's incompetence and held responsible for not meeting goals that you do not have the support or resources to achieve."
bad,The supervisors and managers don't know how to improve the work conditions and they don't accept suggestions. They need to be trained in relationship with the employees.
bad,"Very poor management, few exceptions. Everything is undermined and your ideas are garbage. Mangement takes all credit for jobs well done. Time off is a joke your pay will suffer and you will come back to nothing done and have an unbelievable amount of work to catch up on. Okay for short term."
bad,"Wouldn't refer anyone."
bad,A typical day at work is about 10 hrs a day. There is no teamwork in the dispatch department. Nobody helps anybody.  Management are clueless and know nothing about the department they are in charge of. There is a lot of bullying of other employees.  There is no regard for other people’s property. There are several unprofessional people that work there. There is no regard for family life.
bad,Was an good job starting out then an few months after it starts to suck cuz the union dues an insurance was outrageous an will blame u for anything if your not an brown nosier with supervisors mostly on afternoon shift an douches all around
bad,"The company has a lot of benefits and good pay for the type of work you do in the Business Center.  A typical day in the Business Center involved entering customer orders into a system. This was a very repetitive boring job, mind numbing."
bad,"Hours changed with little notice- hard to make personal appointments."
bad,"I did the work of 3 people and in the 3 years I worked there only received a total of a 62 cent raise. I worked 6 days a week, would work 10 to 12 hour days and missed maybe 2 days sick in the 3 years I worked there. I even went and worked at their Kentucky location for a couple of weeks and drove from my location an additional 20 miles to the local headquarters to help out with a few projects for a couple of months and it was still not worth giving me any more of a raise than what I received."
bad,Theres a reason why theres always a hiring sign up front. Bad training program. And bad unsafe trucks which breakdown everyday preventing you from completing you route on time.
bad,Learned a lot on my own at RSI. The company is trying to archive a name as a Great Place to Work now. I is giving more opportunities for training to the IT staff.
bad,it is a stressful place to the people are nice the equipment and cans you have to work with is junk and needs to be scraped the trucks are junk this is the vero beach location
bad,Management will friend you and as soon as your not benifiting them they will kick you to the curb like a piece of garbage part of their road side pickup
bad,I took temporary to perm assignment with company and got terminated for not meeting metrics .  They are very cut throat make the job stressful. Management does not give u any feedback or guidAnce but helps to set you up for failure.
bad,my route was good until it was changed on me weekly. I was injured at work. I have been taken care of good.  The days were long and very short breaks and everyday was informed to run and help others. hours were long and pay wasn't that great.
bad,"Long hours of work 6 days a week, and the paid is not the best for the amount of work you supposed to do daily basis and very stressful to the employee"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,it was job working outside with trash was dirty job could be dangerous had to pay attention trucks were always coming through had to be careful constant movement
bad,Plagued with bad management decisions followed by blaming  employees for failures to plan and address known problems.  It takes very thick skin to survive at the Yorktown location. I made it a year and a half until I lost my temper and said somethings that cost me my job for yelling at a supervisor / insubordination.
bad,"Busy call center  and taking temps orders starting new resi service and commercial accts as well."
bad,I was only there for two weeks as a temp and it was within walking distance from home since I had car trouble at the time.  This would not have been my first choice if my car was fully functional.
bad,"If you tell the truth about numbers, they don't like you. It's very political and favoritism is extremely high here. The same rules don't apply to everyone. There's more drama here than high school.  You can't trust anyone there. The pay is good but you don't have a life to enjoy it."
bad,"Corporate has made so many significantly awful changes over the past year that has really hurt morale. Very limited career paths and options, and most require you to relocate."
bad,"Started out looking pretty good, similar core values to my own, Responsible, Reliable, Resourceful and Relentless, do The Right Thing each and Every Time...that soon disappears and it is all about the ""numbers"" clocking in/out must be precise even if you are on a long call.  There is little to no support from your supervisor except for punishment and negativity. Many customers may have to call in 7-12 times for the same problem and Customer Service keeps just taking the same action again and again expecting different results, customers have been sent to collections due to the companies mistakes not the customer. Customers call to cancel their service and many times it can be 2-6 months later and 7-12 phone calls before the company gets around to it.  How hard can it be? This is not a lunar moon shot, it is garbage for crying out loud. Just pick it up and get rid of it. You are rewarded for compliance and time perfection, not doing the right thing at all.  We make false promises that are often not kept so the customer feels deceived, but as long as we have a bright and cheery attitude then it is all good.  If the CEO is really aware of this very poor customer service and allows it to continue then that does not speak well of his leadership."
bad,"Poor leadership in upper management. I enjoyed speaking with the customers on my route. I enjoyed working outside, with little supervision relying on my skills as an operator and common sense."
bad,I only went back here because they bought my company out  the pay was very well but I believe it’s a very stressful work environment which to me causes unsafe work environment you are paid by can so you have to chase the cans in order to make money management among supervisors and operations mngr were poor to say the least they micro manage and it’s always the drivers fault the superviser I had seemed very happy when he got to write you up money benefits good driver turn around probably around 78% because of poor management
bad,This was honestly one of the worst job culture environments in which I have ever been. Constant micromanagement. Recruiting Manager is more concerned with process than results. Talent Acquisition in constant opposition to Operations and HR. For instance Recruiter not allowed to cancel a req upon request of the Hiring Manager and/or HR. Recruiting will force them to hire. No consistency in enforcement of policies. No travel. Not allowed to physically meet your hiring mangers. Really not much like any recruiting job I have ever had. Horrible experience.
bad,"Not a place to make a career unless work is your life. If anyone intends to work at republic, i would encourage them to make it a temporary job to get the experience/job title and get out. Systems are outdated resulting with undue stress of systems or applications failing. Most hours are spent utilizing outdated systems(excel). Republic is centralizing a lot of processes but lack systems communication between corporate and the field. Also, job security does not exist which is also why you should not expect to be around longer than a few years. On the flip side, upward mobility exists because of people leaving or getting fired."
bad,"loved doing commercial, because i'm a morning person. Early mornings meant getting done with daytime to spare. The only problem is they are not consistent with their policies."
bad,"Interesting place to work. Not like any other IT shop I've work in before. "
bad,Everyone is required to come into the office at 8am and back at 4pm.  Biggest waste of time!!!  They have unattainable goals.  No one in the entire company is hitting their numbers.  The entire company is disorganized and the driver's have serious service issues.
bad,It is a corporate company. Its all about numbers and numbers it is. They don't take good care of their trucks. They don't pay you overtime. Their health insurance is really bad and costly. You have to pay out of pocket for dental and eye then wait to be reimbursed weeks or months later with an 80/20 split.
bad,"Just like an up and coming corporation. more focus on profits than the customer, or the employee. Very stressful, multiple people left for mental health reasons."
bad,"I rode on the back of a trash collector, gathering all the trash and throwing it in the truck. I did not feel appreciated by the company and often felt like an outcast among the other workers."
bad,"Everybody from upper management to workers pass the buck down to others to fix. Management has almost no perception of what it really takes to do your job and put unrealistic time fames on them. Pay raises are very sad less than 2% a year with no training available. A very retroactive company not proactive as far as maintenance shop is concerned. If you want a job (not career) to go to every day and want no advancement just show up, go home, and not care about this company is for you."
bad,"Pay is not the best. Contract has changed owners several times over the last 20 years and each time, rate of pay is lowered. Benefits have changed for the worse."
bad,"i think republic services is a good place to work at if u like to constantly move around , the people that work there are very outgoing and fun to work with"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"This is the job where I learned to get tossed into the water and learn to swim by myself if you know what I mean. Very hectic and not very much staff to help you along the way. You will be on your own, but if anything will get you prepared to learn fast and be amazing at multi-tasking, this will!"
bad,"Company had fair compensation and good benefits. That's about all of the good I have to say. Things constantly changing for no apparent reason and then changing right back the way they were before. As a manager/supervisor you get no backup on holding employees to their job. Employees constantly destroying equipment and no recourse taken."
bad,"Management is terrible. Rookie supervisors that have never driven a truck that work with lead drivers to get answers because they are incompetent.  Management are trained to lie in order to protect the company.Everything is about the numbers.  They write your numbers and weekly percentages on a board for everyone to see and judge you by.They have what they call ""lead drivers"" that call themselves your boss but are not really your boss because they are not allowed to make a decision on their own.  Buddy system and good ole boy favoritism in full effect. Moral is amazingly low. Everybody is usually scared that they are going to get fired or suspended.  Equipment is junk. Only larger or training facilities get the good equipment. They expect you to work with broken or dysfunctional equipment.  Mechanics are really bad. Can't even change a tire. Everything is a patch job or fabricated part. The safety points award system is a joke and a fraud because the credit you supposedly earn is taken out of your check. Republic Services generates an annual revenue income of 9.12 Billion dollars a year and starts its drivers out at 13.00 - 15.00 an hour."
bad,Enjoyed working my coworkers but management has no sense of reality when it comes to family time or working conditions. It was ok until they changed the rules to work on flag rate instead of just hourly.
bad,"can no longer review, company was purchased by waste management. it was poorly ran, under funded and out dated equipment"
bad,"Decent people but everyone has their favorites. There are things that you'll be told not to do, that violate company policy but at the same time your management will impress upon you the meaning of getting it done and will make exceptions. Just dont get into any incidents because once again these people save themselves 1st. Everyone talks outta both sides of their mouth here. This is not a place for someone with a family. One day your employed next your getting your letter of termination"
bad,To much work not enough pay. You work a lot of hrs and you get paid by the day which means no overtime or Chinese overtime like we call it.
bad,"It was a temporary position, where I learned a lot about various programs, and cold-calling techniques. I wanted to learn a lot more about the company so I could properly address any questions or concerns that customers had, but I was told to stick to a script and not stray from it. Which in turn effected how much of a help I really could be to the customers. It wasn't a bad company it just wasn't the right fit for my approach to customer service."
bad,"If you don't have nothing good to say then don't say it so I'm not"
bad,"Horrible hours"
bad,"The work and most people I worked with were nice. The managers were terrible and only followed the rules when someone was looking over their shoulders, at this point there would be a ton of write ups going out. The work was easy but it was made hard by lack of good decision making made by the bosses. None of the bosses even have cdls to be able to perform the work that we are."
bad,"Work was available everyday"
bad,"Actually not a job with Republic Services, but with a company providing sales services.  This involves door-to-door sales, attempting to get people to sign up with Republic's trash removel, by offering then a lower rate than they are currently paying."
bad,"a day at work can be ok some days where you can learn plenty by what you do but the management can do a whole better because most is not qualified for the job they hold most co-workers aren't qualified either , and lazy. the hardest part of the job is dealing with unqualified management and whining drivers, the most enjoyable part is enjoying the people you do get along with."
bad,good place to learn with the industry of diesel trucks.. team work is the best  and going to work and knowing exactly what your to do during the day was a plus.
bad,"company has a program called one fleet, all it does is point a finger for someone to blame.they expect mechanics to do the impossible like check 200 items and service a truck in 1.75 hours and u better not miss something or you will be called to carpet on it.in short time i was with company i watched a man there 10 years just not show up, he was a pm mechanic who felt that he was being blamed.i watched another mechanic who was there 20 years get blamed for somthing once a day. that program is nothing but a witch hunt for the blame game. i wouldnt recommend my worst enemy to work for a company like that.in my short time there the mechanics were more than helpful to someone has never worked on garbage trucks."
bad,I would leave the office and go to many town to pick up trash and yard waste.
bad,"Allied Waste was a poor choice for me, as I was going in expecting that I would be working with professionally minded people. Instead, some of them, that could speak English that is, seemed to not really give their time to offer quality training. There were some good people whom worked there, and the company just seemed to me be somewhat fair. However, if they would have strived to be more knowledgeable with their systems, and made efforts to treat their employees more fairly, I would recommend this place."
bad,"you try to be flexible with your hours and days to show you're a team player, but in the end it means nothing to management. Start day at 5 am and at times are forced to work about 14- 16 hours, Get asked for special pick ups and favors and after you complete your task, long hours and favors you realize you are just a number to them it was like walking on eggshells.  Benefits, pay are great"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"The people you'll end up working with is horrible. More temporary than actual employee. Your in all weather. Hot cold no shelter for you. Pay $11"
bad,"The company itself isnt bad. Unfortunately that representation is based on your local management. My experience with my current local management is one of distrust, misleading communication and discriminatory practices."
bad,"Not happy with the management here and my pay, i have seen favoritism by management and a lack of respect and a stressful work environment and unfair practices."
bad,Work is easy but c.Y.A is a must at this place.I'm currently dealing with a situation involving a eeoc because of them.Each individual could have their own opinion.
bad,"""One size fits all"" and micromanagement from Senior Area/Corporate Leadership Culture. Good income. Tough defending ongoing, service issues and exorbitant price increases."
bad,I don’t like how they’re paying some people $24.50 and I’m stuck at 20.91. It’s not fair they had a new guy come in and he makes $1 more than I do. I don’t think it’s fair and we don’t have mechanics that can fix anything
bad,"For a company to start off with , ""a Driver – CDL (B) is responsible for ensuring his or her vehicle is in compliance with the Company’s safety standards prior to operating the vehicle"""
bad,The company sales you on safety and family values but once you work there the truth comes out. Poor management and there is no real HR dept to turn to if you have internal issues...
bad,"The company does not value your skills, performance and dedication. Your success depends on your relationship with who can make decisions about your future. Many true talents have left the company."
bad,"I was a commercial driver for around 4yrs of my 11 years with the company. The day started at 3am so if there was anything at all going on at home after 7pm I either missed it or didn't get sufficient sleep that night. I believe in safety but I thought both the safety meetings and the yard skills tests were overkill. I believe a safety manager should take time instead to ride along with drivers both in the beginning of their career and after an incident. I realize some of the information covered in meeting is mandatory regulations but couldn't some of these items be condensed into emails that include mandatory viewing of video. The employee can still be compensated for their time. I did not intend to leave Republic Services, my intention was to transfer from Joliet, IL. to Pimento IN. unfortunately I stepped on an Operations Supervisors toes at Pimento and he helped to end my 11yr career with the company."
bad,Republic goes through so many managers because it changes its missions every 28 days. is hard to survive as a mid level or front line manager. If your not caring about getting to the top Republic has a spot for you. The only problem is they expect you to work like those people who are trying to get to the top. Lots of blood sweat and tears money is alright for a while but you get no love and you ll loose some years.
bad,"This company can't keep it's word on anything. They pay well but it's only because the work is awful and unstructured. The dress code changes all the time and they don't have it posted anywhere so you can be in violation suddenly and not even know. They do not care about employees and it seems like they do not use common sense when making new policies. They hire a large amount of people expecting some to quit of be fired and provide the bare minimum for training. They change the way things are done and don't tell anyone until the morning of in an email but then don't allow you any time off the phones to review the changes. The call center is only a few years old but they still can't figure out how to properly motivate or train their staff. There are just so many things wrong with working here. The only reason to do it is for the pay and having weekends off. I am constantly feeling like I am going to get fired, even though I always exceed every single goal. I leave work and look for another job almost every day. Don't work here."
bad,"My day to day consisted of pulling reports and entering data into the dossier system in order to track and control the budget for the maintenance side of the location. However, the manager that I worked with did not see eye to eye with me. We had situations arise that did not sit well with me and lead to me leaving the company. Most of the workers there were easy to get a long with and were always there to assist when problems arose. "
bad,"I know that there are other offices that do more for their employees than the office that I currently work out of. We have no special occasions that are celebrated. Birthdays are just another day. Retirements are ignored. The mood of the office is null because we get no affirmation of complements from anyone, but the minute you mess up they are on you. Dispatch is awful!"
bad,republic services is a great place to work but they will take advantage of your kindness and use you and promise you promotions and wont happen not much to say.
bad,New management came in. We're very disrespectful and harassing. Tried to do the right thing and hr did nothing. Had to quit. The retaliation was brutal.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"stressful, no leadership, to much pointing fingers. Find myself doing every hard jod that comes though the door with no help. Cant get anyone else to stepup."
bad,"Stressful working environment"
bad,Long long hours each day. Not to bad of a place to work if you enjoy working long hours. 10-12 a day. A typical day is just being as safe as you can possibly be on route. The hardest part is getting up so early in the a.m. which is 3 a.m.
bad,It's a work at your own pace type of place the faster you work the faster you go home pay is pretty ok to work just have to be ready for new opportunities
bad,Excellent pay and benefits however a constant rollercoaster regarding longer term employment. Upper management brings in far more outsiders for openings vs internal development and promoting from within. Re-orgs occur regularly every 24-36 months.
bad,Senior management is trying to change the culture of the company and it is a long-term process.  Many new and upcoming programs that will differentiate us from the competition
bad,"Great pay and benefits but the hours, management and the job duties should be all changed.  Not a good experience.  I don't think I can say to much more."
bad,"The people I worked with had amazing personalities! Awesome to work with. Management is clueless...."
bad,"Work every day was simple, I would turn the machine on and check if there is any possible jam on the conveyor belt, then dump associates' bucket full of p.e.t trash. If there was a jam in the machine I would try it in maintenance mode, if that wasn't possible I shut the system down and get in the machine to unjam the machine with crowbar or whatever is necessary to remove the item that was causing the jam. Breaks are cut short since the company doesn't tolerate lateness so we would lose 2 minutes of break every day. Lunch is 30 minutes,but management always tell you what you need to do after lunch, but it's pretty much same thing every day yet they don't believe that I know what to do even though I have worked there for a while and have experience. If you were to do something that is wrong or your supervisor doesn't agree to they will tell you to do it a certain way and chew you out which is unprofessional. The supervisor on the shift would yell at the sorters if they're not picking fast enough. Every day was a constant war with management not being able to realize that you do what you can and not what you can't. Overall if you plan to just find a job to for experience this is a start, but I would not recommend this company because they don't treat their employees like they claim they do, if you don't like the smell of trash don't bother, if you are slow you are tend to get fire and if you disagree or do something that the management disagrees you'll get fired like me because the company ""claim"" I was just standing around doing nothing yet the dirt and dust on my vest totally"
bad,"Sadly when I took this job it was a step up from my previous trucking job or so I thought.  The hiring process was a complete joke I had to complete the same job application three times before they could even process it because the managers didn't know what they were doing.  After getting hired i had to ride shotgun in a truck for a month and half before I could even drive due to there training program.  After was able to start driving I soon discovered how poorly  maintained the trucks are.  They were always braking down, having motor oil and hydraulic oil spills or catching on fire. I was assigned a truck that was too small for me and I was forced to drive it even though I couldn't see out of the mirrors. After months of driving this small truck my back got injured from all the twisting and turning I had to do in the seat.  After the injury I saw how much management does not follow policy at all  they pick what policies they want to follow and ones they don't. Management always has two supervisors present when talking to an employee behind closed doors.  You feel bullied and you know that it doesn't matter what they tell you because they can change what ever they told you and it would be two against one."
bad,they tell you one thing in training and do another at the division. they say you cant work over 11 hours a day and yet I have worked 3-15 hours days 2- 16 hours days countless 14 hours days. they don't take care of the trucks. they don't care if you tell them that a truck is to heavy to drive they will tell you to take it slow and put your hazards on. I drive 3 different types of trucks and I am only suppose to be driving 1.run away very quick
bad,"This company is not a good place to work. I worked there for some time and found that the management allowed issues that were against even their own rules (people putting their hands on others, yelling, screaming, cussing, racist name calling, throwing things at other people). This was against everything I believe and I was a nervous wreck working there. People weren't treated or trained the same way. Workers were unhappy and talking in small groups about the problems they were experiencing, trying to figure out what to do."
bad,"My supervisors only made decisions that affected their bonus. If it negatively affected their bonus they would not do it, even if it meant giving an employee a chance to put training into use."
bad,Political positioning with who you know is more important than what you know in the case of advancement
bad,This was a job that I couldnt see myself at in five years. Employess are not taken to mind like they should be and it is a very negative environment also
bad,The company struggles with gaining  keeping well suited employees. Management styles are often chaotic conflicting manager directives makes for a poor system of direction. Managers are ina  constant power struggle with one another.
bad,"If finances and benefits were all that a company was rated on, Republic would be amazing.  Benefits and pay were great.  However, upper management and lack of organization ruins that.  There is a huge discrepancy between home and work life."
bad,"Very depressing job"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,Pay was great when your new and with a driver who has a town that pays him. Never shown a rout just given a copy of a map and told to figure it out and then told to hurry in so many words. Uniform and boots were cool and more then enough. Dispatch and supervisor do not communicate.
bad,"Sharklike company promotes culture of throwing anyone in front of a bus."
bad,I learned how to remove trash out of the screens and I learned how to sort items from the trash that is recycled I also was trained how to work the  conveyor belt
bad,"It was a Temp job and it was not at all what i was expecting, longer hours in the rain/heat/sun all day and they dont treat you very well at all. i would not want to work there again"
bad,"To be honest, I dislike the whole job here. This review is SPECIFICALLY meant for the Egg Harbor Township, NJ location. I'm a guy who needed another job and I was willing to do all of the sweat work for $10.60/hr which consisted of 10 hours. As a SORTER it's just literally sorting through recyclables. Straightforward and easy. End of the day, sweep and clean floors/work area. Cool. HOWEVER, management is bad. I wasn't told when to start the next day, what my schedule is, how many hours I'm gonna work (e.g. if it's a 10 or 12 hr shift), EXTREMELY confusing alternating days off, and most of the workers are Spanish so if you don't know much Spanish or at all you may get by but keep in my mind you may have to work with workers who may not know English at all. In addition, the next day (coming in late due to them not informing me of my schedule even though I repeatedly called the manager about it) they ""threw me to the wolves"" on this one. Basically, was told to look at how this one guy did his job in order to pick up on it, but he really didn't seem to give much interest in me learning his job. What really messed me up was being told I'll have 5 days off straight because of how the alternating days off were. I'm pretty sure I applied to work not suddenly have a vacation so assuming this may occur here and there, I left."
bad,I also wanted to have an opportunity for advancement and there doesn’t seem to be any chance for that. There is morale issues and not everyone does the same amount of work.
bad,"The upper management is always looking to cut someone. Without warning. We heard rumors of layoffs two years ago which were vehemently denied. Till they had a meeting in Wednesday to cut two guys on Friday. That’s bad enough but another division of our same company was hiring and they made the two guys upload resumes and go through the entire hiring process again. Loss of seniority and benefits. One guy got on the other didn’t because he wouldn’t start all the way down the pay scale again. The management has lost contract after contract then cut people. I’ve been here fir a period of years and it’s slow attrition, when a guy retires they don’t replace him. It a union job so pay and benefits are good. But you’re always dreading the next consequence of managerial incompetence."
bad,Good work environment but too many systems creating too much communications issues. Having knowledge about the industry is needed with the systems that are used. Training in certain sections goes above and beyond others are needing improvement.
bad,"If you have a problem, you might as well keep it to yourself because nothing will be done about it. Management seems to care solely about themselves and their bonuses."
bad,Local management did what they could. There was always someone above local management making the calls. The most enjoyable part of my job were the local team I worked with.
bad,"Fun industry, company use to be great till they tried to become too corporate, too much paperwork, high turnover, micromanaging, horrible management, commission structure isn’t up to par with the guidelines, switched over the last few years, now they’re screwing the long tenure reps."
bad,Lack of experience in this business is the rule for management personnel now and very little understanding of what the jobs here are required to do to accomplish and service customers. This is hard to complete your job when the person or people who are your managers not only don't know what is required to do your job but have no experience or very little in this industry.
bad,Early morning start and late evening finishes with administrative duties and demanding to be on the road at the same time. Not enough support for the role.
bad,Very stressful unstructured work environment.  No training involved on new job requirements.  High expectations for minimal training.  Just thrown into a new situation and had to find out how to process with absolutely no training.
bad,"Typical day at work is throwing your headset on and logging on and having an auto-ring through answering system. I never realized how crazy people can be when it comes to their trash. at slowest times there can be 2-3 minutes between calls. Most calls there have ever been since I have been there is about 4,000+ calls in queue waiting to be answered. Most managers are wonderful and willing to help you succeed, but the strict set schedules for breaks, and lunches and the goals that are required to be met are somewhat overwhelming. You're unable to go to bathroom without it hurting productivity and adherence. For the most part the workplace can be pretty positive, but dealing with customers who scream at you and use profanity for something that is not your fault takes a toll on you. I definitely won't be looking for any other call center positions unless it would be data entry and not answering phones."
bad,Just do what they tell you and you’ll be fine. You are just a number. Everything is by the book. Management shoots from the hip. They don’t do what they are “suppose” to do. They paint a great picture on the videos but all there equipment is junk boxes
bad,"Work 12-16 a day, very minimal training, incompetent managers, and dealing with rude drivers. Tasks are repetitive and personal development is uncommon."
bad,"qucikly turned into a very streesful days of work. Every day there is change with no correct comunication between the reps and managment, There would be times where the managment could not answer a simple question. Every call is a complaint and or escaltion. the Supervisors will not take the escaltion calls and will sometimes have the customer on hold untill they hang up. This company SUCKS !!!"
bad,This company has a very unique product and services that are marketed and sold to businesses.  Unfortunately they are led by people who do not understand sales.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,The overtime is great if you want to work long hours.  To much work and not enough time in the day to do it all.  Benefits are good
bad,"A normal day would be pre tripping box truck."
bad,It is very hard for advancement with this company.  The pay raise is a joke.  Management does not show appreciation for workers.
bad,. good benefits. often times you are verbally abused by customers for upper management not resolving issues.
bad,"Knowledge of surrounding Cities"
bad,"This use to be a great place to work until they merged with Allied Waste.  You're not respected by management and they continue to make work harder than it has to be.  Making up rules as they go along to harass employee's.  You will make decent money but you will be under constant stress, because of the poor management that have been put into place."
bad,has been a great working experience but need to improve my family's future. unfortunately overlooked for a position that I had all the credentials. will focus on moving forward to making an impact on a new company willing to increase their profits while decreasing man hours under my leadership.
bad,Cuts and more cuts.Top operator gets same 1 and one half percent raise past five years as the person who is late every day. Cookie cutter for all hourly. No reward for performance. Straight downhill since buyout of Allied Waste. Same people who ran Allied in ground now running Republic. What you get when you start is it. Less than cost of living every year after that. Decent benefits and a paycheck.
bad,"When you shake a man's hand that's should mean sumtime, there it doesn't. Was told one thing when I was hired. Then it changed and they acted like the didn't say it. Took me out of a good truck n was put in one of the oldest truck in fleet. Just setting you up to fail. Was told vacation wasn't going to be a problem, then it became clear to me that, that it became personal after calling in sick . over all a"
bad,Sales structure and goals have changed for the past 5 yrs every year.  Clearly not giving the sales team an opportunity to succeed in the current plan.
bad,"Work/life balance tough"
bad,"After 3 years of pouring everything I had into the job as a supervisor, and making a failing division a successful division I was passed over for promotion and ultimately let go.  My passion for the job was not recognized by area management and I was expected to cover 3 people's job duties along with work with a very substandard counterpart that no on held accountable for anything.  This led to many many frustrations, I asked for help and none was offered It was just expected of me, so I voiced my opinions very loudly and people didn't like that, and I was let go, even though I was carrying the division and yet still nothing was done my counterpart.  The pay was good, and I enjoyed the aspect of the job, they just get someone they can depend on and ride them into the ground, and discard them leaving the ones that don't carry their weight and praise and follow them.  I would stay away if your looking for a management job."
bad,"Phoenix AZ is in charge of all locations. Continuously change  expectations and have habit of only giving bad feedback. Exaggerate situations to make people look bad. Started out amazing but they have ripped every piece of joy out. HR is part of the problem, so no where to turn"
bad,"As a hauling supervisor you are responsible for the daily operating plans, including staffing, performance, and safety of your team. I was able to learn about the waste industry as well as managing a P&L from a financial perspective. Management was supportive, but made too many changes too quickly which resulted in lowered morale. The most difficult part of the job was having to be at low impact meetings that took away from your own productivity. In addition, often times projects were given to you with very little notice and an unrealistic completion date sometimes (less than an hour). The most enjoyable aspect was working with the people and making new connections with different government officials"
bad,Work hard and fast on the line when picking up the trash is what I learned and when your downstairs your picking plastic out of the cube has to be cleaned out noo plastic or metal
bad,"Got fired for multitasking , and your constantly been getting micro managed . The work life balance is good but other than that it’s not a great place to work at .  Who knew that trash can Be so hard ? The work was fairly easy but they micromanage to the extreme , you’re hard work Is overlook and it hard to catch a break ."
bad,I did not receive a lot of on the job training.  I had to be a self motivator.  When I applied for the job internally I was turned now even after working on the job and making improvements to their current process.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"This is a great money maker for someone just getting started. However, they bear down on the call center reps and keep changing the process making things harder on their front line, sales, & retention department. They hire managers that have no people skills and don't understand what we are going through on the phones but drive us to meet unrealistic metrics they desire. Hence less valuable client care can be provided  because the reps are trying to keep there jobs so we have rush clients off the phone causing many mistakes and client call backs."
bad,"Turnover was a problem with this organization. In the last 4 years they have cycled through 4 direct supervisors, 3 sales managers, and"
bad,"I have not been there long, but I don't like it at all. The hrs. of work is crazy, the trucks are trash itself (very bad equipment). I looking for a new job now."
bad,"From day one, there was no training provided, with the exception of online lessons.  Was tossed out into sales territory with no training on software program, territory or waste and recycling products.  Lack of training equaled company layoffs.  Culture is very ""operations versus sales""  mentality, no cohesiveness in offices.  Lack of accountability I believe is key to lack of success."
bad,Well I don't know how things are now with this company but back then all they want was for Simone to work hard an run the  routs  on time every day the gave good bonus too
bad,"Was a good place to work, until favoritism and discrimination came into the light. The union is strong but supporting it puts a target on your back, but even after everything ill still support the union."
bad,"Good place to work, employees are real helpful.  Downfall is the management, they are lacking knowledge and ability to make a day run smoothly.  They are open to preach safety, but want you to whatever it takes to get the job done so they don't get in trouble."
bad,"Lied to about compensations and promotions from day 1."
bad,"The pay is pretty good, Better than most places you will find. "
bad,"A typical day for a residential driver starts at 6 am, on the road by 6:45,  at the route at 7 or 7:15."
bad,"The pay was great, but this company is so highly micromanaged that they do not give you a chance to breathe. You can do a million things right and nothing is ever said to you, but the minute you make 1 mistake, everyone and their brother is scrutinizing you. It got to be so stressful that I had to leave. My manager did not know what constructive criticism meant, and was very rude right off the bat. They preached following their strict procedures but made it impossible to follow all of the procedures to a T and staying within your call time. And forget about vacationing - only one person was allowed to be off at a time. Also, no room for advancement unless you wanted to move elsewhere (I was told this in my initial interview!) And I could not make a complaint about my manager because all of the managers were so close-knit, that word would get back to my manager and she would make my life miserable."
bad,"management is poor, the trucks always breakdown, the pay should be better for the job you are performing"
bad,"This is a great company to work for as far as compensation and the company's overall values are great, unfortunately management has the ability to honor them at their discretions. There is little to no room for growth and their benefits are pricey and not very good."
bad,"Ever since the Allied/Republic merger, more and more benefits and perks were taken away every year.  No lunch, no health day, no Christmas eve or NYE off, no holiday parties.  Part of the attraction to the job to begin with was the benefits.  The culture still suffers from the epic Allied vs Republic internal struggle.  If you want a low level, low paying job to be in forever and never advance, if you like 1% annual increases, this may be the place for you.  "
bad,"The management is full of "" I don't have time"", ""It's not up to me"", ""It's not my fault"", etc.... The place is very unorganized and the management staff is not trained properly. They are so busy trying to pass the blame for things that the employees suffer. Also, trash removal is a dangerous job. The safety culture is non-existent. Drivers do whatever they have to do to get the workday completed. This is not safe for the helpers, as well as the general public."
bad,"I love to work and off on weekends, it works for my toddler and married life. I have opportunities to work weekends only if I want to and that is great."
bad,"Can't keep supervisors keep hiring outsiders who has never done the job, don't listen. Management didn't listen to there employees drivers don't have a voice."
bad,Equipment is horrible management is horrible expect to break down at least once a day and your lucky if you have heat or ac and good luck getting it repaired anything you write up will say pending for at least 3 weeks managers dont seem to care for the drivers been through 3 supervisors and nothing has changed all they care about is the route getting off the ground no raises only way to get a pay increase is to transfer positions.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,MOST of the management and co-workers are friendly and are willing to help you if you need it. The pay is reasonable for the job if you have work to do for the day. If you dont have work in your route for the day you will be expected to run a truck that isn't roadworthy and get stuck doing whatever nobody else wants to do and if you don't want to do that they will let you go home but they will take your personal and vacation time for doing so. It's not the worst place I've worked but certainly not the best either. If your for the worker more than the corporation you probably wouldn't enjoy working here.
bad,"The problem at this company is the trucks are horrible.  Every morning that I went into work, I had to wait on a truck.  Then when I got in a truck, the truck didn't work properly.  They would say that they have fixed the truck and they didn't.  I would be on the road driving with a truck with power steering problems.  I had friends that had wreck in truck because the truck had been written up and they never properly serviced the truck"
bad,Long Hours and high stress job.  Low moral at our division.  Very demanding.  Not much supporting help.  Nobody to fill in when you take time off.  You felt as if you could not leave early or take time off because the job would not get done.
bad,"Management will tell you what they think you want . Instead of the truth. Will hold you back till it suits them. Refuse to put me in driver seat, and tell me they are working on it"
bad,This company is a joke when it comes to certain things they need to get rid of all supervisors an build from the ground up but the wont happen with the turn around rate they have
bad,Republic Services isn't the best place to work but it isn't the worst either.  Most of the equipment they use is very dated.  Most of the trucks break down on a daily basis which makes your day longer and harder to do .
bad,To much stress not enough money.someone always yells at you.work hard for nothingthey treat there workers like trash.and the work you so hard for little to no pay.
bad,"It’s was a very physical job that got me in shape real nice but I really didn’t wanna make a career collecting garbage , other than that good management crew great coworkers and u could easily get things handled n HR department"
bad,company and pay are good but have poor management work day is busy and sometimes long. Plus side is your to busy to really notice the time you have been working
bad,"Long hours, if you get your route done, they expect you to help slower members, without asking you. Upper management is helpful and willing to work with the employees,"
bad,"Operations Supervisor at the Las Vegas area depends on what branch you are in. Residential  Supervisors will have a decent schedule. Commercial however expect a extremely long working day. At least 13 hours each day minimal. That would be considered a short day. You are on salary so there will be no overtime or holiday pay. All tools will be provided for you as well as uniforms, phone and laptop. When you go to the Supervisor training in Arizona you will be told not only by your piers but your Managers not to complain and to understand that Las Vegas is different and has to run differently than what they teach. This position would be considered a starting Management spot so you will do the brunt of lifting while you watch your boss as well as his boss have decent work days and pay to match. The average driver will with overtime make about 15 to 20 thousand a year more than you. This begins to wear on you as you start to average your salary to the hours you actually work. My salary averaged just at $18 an hour when divided into the hours I worked. The Supervisors who are happy are the ones with 20 plus years in who normally came from a driving position and already have time in service to make that $100 thousand a year plus the 5% bonus. But starting at zero and only making $73 thousand with 5% the hours just are not worth the trouble. Almost every other job will make more per hour worked than you. Advancement is possible if you are willing to wait a minimal of a year as well as wait for a position to open. Just don't count t on a person with time in to leave the company."
bad,"Everyone was great to work with, but company is becoming very corporate and loosing customers left and right.  Hard wen you don't have a say, changed compensation plan not in our favor"
bad,"At first work was OK, after the first month things changed. Management went of paper to see production was not physically their to see work being done. I worked with people that spoke no english. so work was hard to get done."
bad,Typical day was doing inside sales and account management. Was a busy day. Explaining contract terms and negotiating new contracts. Making upset customers happy again with doing business with us.
bad,"Managed projects to streamline the B2B transaction process with organizations whose commodities drive the organization’s success, including Caterpillar, Mack Volvo, and multiple Chassis Dealers. Facilitated supplier enablement, promoted Process Excellence and actively participated in purchasing and supply chain management initiatives. Diverse accomplishments include: Providing support for eBusiness strategists, technical teams, content developers, and marketing specialists."
bad,A typical day at work for me constist of working very closely with the field and the payroll admins. Helping and assisting them with any and all issues they have on a daily basis.
bad,Big company the managment didn't seem to care about the employees
bad,"Immediate boss was a pleasure to work for, but the HR manager was a pain to everyone.  Impossible to work for HR manager with the inconsistent standards set for employees.  Wrote up some people without reason and let others slide by for the same issue."
bad,They make you work ridiculous hours.  They keep adding more and more work loads on you with expectations that you will be able to do them.  Atmosphere is not like it used to be under the new management
bad,Long hours due to poor equipment. Management knows nothing about the routes other than what they see on a computer. Could be better if they had better trucks and management
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
bad,"When I was hired, they emphasized the importance of placing customer needs first and foremost.  As they implemented policy to strengthen overall efficiency of call quality, too many changes, too soon and too frequently shifted too much priority in reducing average talk time overall, versus delivering a quality customer experience."
bad,Things would be better if they paid more money by the hour .  I feel that they really need to take the time out to listen to the drivers and what they’re legitimate complaints are
bad,"Great place to work, friendly co workers. Laid back environment.  Management appreciated your hard work. Corporate was always willing to listen and follow up on any type of issues/concerns."
bad,"Spot drivers to designated area, pick up trash, pump water, supervise temporary workers, stock tires, cover trash with tarps"
bad,"Management makes all the dough while the grunts work their tails off for less than market wages. Non-exempt employees are excluded from any bonus compensation and receive less than 1% merit increases, even if you out performed everyone in your department, unless you are very close to management where you will receive 4% or more. Very unfair compensation."
bad,Very busy ensuring customer waste removal needs are met. The hardest part of the job is when nothing offered can satisfy a customer.
bad,It was a very structured an Balanced job.Everybody has a job to do u know ur place know ur job get what's asked of u do e an u do the required tasked ask an I'll be ok
bad,Not a bad job typical day is go in at 3 am get off around 2 or 3 PM  we are a union job but not every unit is union... got off all evening to take care family... offer many different insurance.. awesome pay good job if single married or have family.. they have roll off residential and front load divisions..
bad,"Worked on heavy equipment, learned how to operate equipment I never operated before. Didn't care for my supervisor that much because him and another supervisor had a problem and they would us the employees in the middle of there fude. Had great co-workers which ah few where friends from high school. The hardest part of the job was working around trash all the time. The best part was working with friends and family."
bad,"good working environment, poor maintenance, busy all day throwing trash bags while on routes, I learned a lot, hardest part is the long 14 hours for most people"
good,Its really not a job i would recommend to be completely honest.Your literally sorting through trash moving at about 20-15 miles per hour.I leaves a horrible smell.
good,The overall corporation is good to work for but the local management is in need of replacement.
good,its a very long day and hard work 12-15 hour days but you get use to it .very fast past with no room for error.must k now all city and rural streets.
good,"Team players and family oriented from ceo's to part time help. Very friendly atmosphere. Good pay, great benefit options. Most employees have been there for at least10+ years. You end up loving your job because of the team atmosphere and support that you get."
good,Could be a great place to work if management would listen to employees and take action. Weed out the bad who don’t want to work and keep the good employees happy.
good,"I would take between 85-100 calls per day and that included short sale calls.  It was very stressful and because of the requirements of the sales and the demands of my supervisor, I left because it was beginning to affect my health.  I was hired as a customer service agent but when we were required to take on sales calls that became too much for me."
good,"not consistent with hours, general manager promised you would be promoted within from section.  never happened broken promises.  the best part was the corporate deals they had available and the thanksgiving turkeys.  shop manage was good, gm didn't value his open and relied on false information from A Tech"
good,management didnt know how to relate to employees spent available funds on unneccesary activities company vehicles were in bad conditions Many of the high paying routes went to selective employees
good,"Every day meeting pick up a truck go and get that garbage house by house. I learn how to drive a side ,front and  rear loader truck. Roll of to. Management not good. Good co -workers. Hardest part pick up garbage house by house . Drive."
good,Management dont give a dam bout thier drivers.  Junk trucks/down all the time.  I worked two years for them I broke down for 5hrs in the heat of summer. I ran out of water.  No I dont recomend
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Too much work, not enough time to do quality work. Customer relationships are where it’s at. You need as much support as possible and the learning curve is pretty high. If you’re new to the industry you will need a good mentor."
good,Not a bad job by all means but just poor management I worked here for over 3 years not only was there no advancement but it was promised during interview
good,"Great company but high stress, long hours, and management is hit or miss. HR Dept is constantly under staffed and the workload is high.  Great opportunity if you are driven and single, but not much work / life balance if you have a family.   Beware of current Southwest Area HR Director, you should do as she says, not as she does."
good,"Very repetitious, very dusty and dirty environment, and most of the equipment is old and bandaged. The salary and benefits are not that great. Work and life balance are terrible."
good,"Pay is inconsistent and unfair (race/gender)"
good,"Depends on your role with the company, depends on your work / life balance. At every company, you have great managers, and bad ones. Up until the last 7 months, I have had some very good managers."
good,"The NA Team is a group of hard working professionals that are focused on engaging and contracting with profitable customers nationwide."
good,Good job but due to over supervision made stressful & big brotherish.
good,Gave company 18 years faithfuly and I have no regrets for that.
good,"Dreadfully long days that do not end when you leave and go home, you are always on call. Everything is a priority therefore nothing gets done because you are always forced to stop and start something new. Most managers just sit in their office and pass the buck to supervisors. If anything arises between an hourly employee and a supervisor whether it be work performance or any sort of disagreement, the supervisor is always considered in the wrong."
good,"Pay should be increased from ten dollars to at least 11 or 12 dollars an hour. That is the biggest part of motivation for the majority of people to keep them motivated to work and effectively. A decent lunch time instead of 30 minutes, 45 minutes. Gives people a little bit more time to get what they need and refresh themselves to go back to work. Managment needs to be better with communication. Work place needs to have more than just one janitor to clean. Its a very big place and everything gets dirty really quick. Workers can't do it, more cleaners to help out. More details about 401k and stocks and stocks. When it comes to the actual line work, it would work more efficiently and if there were more works present, and if the pace wasnt as fast. Of course you have to keep it a t a good pace to get through the day and load. But for everything to be effective and go right and properly, there has to be a proper and appropriate medium."
good,As soon as I was hired they changed my hours without consulting me. Management is not fair. They will let certain employees do certain things but will not let other employees do it. A lot of favortism here.
good,Typical day is 7 am to 5 pm. Proactive and reactive calls required every day with the majority being reactive. Extensive contract and price negotiations are required. The management team is closely monitored and regulated by corporate office. The hardest part of the job is price negotiations with customers that require account managers to hold price. My colleagues are the most enjoyable part of my job.
good,"The General Manager is responsible for leading one of the Company’s Business Units. Working in a matrix management environment, the GM manages an infrastructure team comprised of division-level managers, including Operations, Fleet Management, Sales, Finance, Human Resources, Safety and Environmental Compliance, and Environmental Engineering, who support the total operation of the Business Unit"
good,"Made staff work late and come in early - but did not follow same suit - had others in department spy on other which created hostility within department , people were not treated equally"
good,Fast paced work but not enough help to do the job at hand.Often asked to work more and more and no incentive to do so.Management knows the problems but refuse to correct them and thus you are left in a hole that you can't get out of.
good,I would've recommended working here when I started however it's all gone down the tubes in the almost two years I've worked here.The rules are always changing.
good,"Different locations have different types of environment."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Customer service front line services cause for stressful days. Supervisors unwilling to help representative by not standing up for employees and letting managers micromanage supervisors.
good,I enjoyed dealing with the public. Building was small and was above the garage/maintenance area so it was often noisy. The pay and benefits were poor.
good,"There are no challenges, most of the work is repetitive, and it is not a team atmosphere. Everyone looks out for themselves and the incentives given as rewards do not incite one to do a better job."
good,"I was a temp with this company for 8 days.  The job was very complex and I was told yesterday by the supervisor that he thought I was struggling with a project he gave me and that I was not up to speed.  He made a decision that yesterday would be my last day, There is a problem with the management in this company.  I sensed alot of disatisfaction with the employees and management for the short time I was there. Management seems rather cold and callous.  Not employee oriented.  Actually I would not want to work for this company.  The expectations are unrealistic and all in all working there was not a good experience for me."
good,"Process and file sales paperwork, including new accounts, service increase/decreases, address changes, etc.  "
good,good days meet new people good co workers the management need help i worked there to long waste of my time
good,Loaded trucks or whatever needed to be done. Was a 302 Leadman
good,Not a bad company to work for. Pay is good and good insurance. They have good training. Not enough relief drivers to be able to take of and go to the doctor.
good,"Due to mis-management from previous management teams; Trying to play maintenance catch up and repair on this fleet is limited by time, space and labor experience constraints. The current  management is under high level of scrutiny to reach goals. I enjoy a challenge, but without total commitment and accountability  from all involved the goals from this business unit will not be met."
good,"Corporate only doles out 2-2.25% to the departments for merit increases.  That’s it.  No other merit or COLA incentives.  Meanwhile managers and above get a non performance based bonus starting at 20% of their salary.  Note: non performance based.  There’s no career path other than management.  You do get to be a total slacker and keep your job.  So if you’re lazy, this is the place for you."
good,"Be there for a while . Started out ok then found out tell you what you want to hear to get you in the door. Unorganized,poor management. Only care about the bottom dollar. Just a number."
good,"Long hours until routes get cut if at all. The pay could be better but its the best in the area. New leadership is in town he,s cool but not sure were everything is going to end up."
good,Pays good. Hours are not that great. Management just cares about making themselves look good and looking out for a select few cherry picked employees.
good,"If you have a family it's not a very friendly work life balance. They have rotating shifts every quarter. Metrics are evaluated for this but senority always goes first. They give you offers to move up, but then makes emplyoees do it that shouldn't. There are a lot of clicks with management and there are those that are revengeful. If you dont like change, do not apply. If you can handle constant change and dont let things get to you even if its directed at you, then apply. Be cautious if you have a family though."
good,"I was with Republic when it was Allied Waste and left right as the transition started back in 2008. I was not paid well for someone who held a class B CDL with 12 years driving experience. There was major discrepancy between front load and residential side load drivers. My good friend (who recruited me to work there) was a front load driver in his third year when I started working there, made more than double my annual salary!"
good,republic services only wants people who will say yes and not buck  the system.  they do not pay personnel what they are worth. i poured my heart and soul into this company to only be treated unfairly
good,"Arrive at 3:00 till early morning hours, very repetitive work routine. Dirty work considering its garbage trucks. No home life for the hours there is."
good,"fast paced, get the job done, hurry up but slow down..."
good,RSG has been good to my family and provided me with a decent salary.   The employees for the most part are great to deal with in most departments throughout the company.  The onboarding process stinks and takes a terribly long time.   RSG does not necessarily believe in promoting within.  They will hire from outside the industry for GM roles or higher.  They will dangle a carrot in front of you and drag you along but you never really know where you are going or why.  All in all RSG is okay to work at however employee development is not a priority nor is work/life balance.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,My supervisor was very disrespectful the whole time I worked there. Nothing I ever did was good enough for him. That was the only reason I left the company.
good,"oversee equipment repairs done in a safe and timely manner, order supplies for equipment, order fuel and oils for maintanence, track repairs done on equipment"
good,"Nationally the company is a great place to work.  Locally the management team has changed and the culture has change with it.  There is more of a ""every man for themselves"" attitude and the team concept is no longer in place.  There is a lack of mentoring and personal growth."
good,they claim they are about their employees but they are only concerned about numbers and you are just a number. high turn over rate. lost alot of good employees due to poor management
good,I work hard for the coming but if you have a background they pick and choose who they wont.its hard work but it fun work i had a great time working for republic
good,Republic service is a great company to work for. However due to the lack of advancement its difficult to move up within the company after reaching a certain point.
good,Overall company is great - just local office not so great. Training and expectations were not cohesive. Office was extremely busy and no time for proper training.
good,"The most difficult part of this job remains that  account managers are not compensated for the work that they do but, rather, are penalized for accounts that they might lose, no matter what the reason. It is not a fair compensation as reps are charged with losses beyond their control, such as business closings and bad debt. This results in a direct loss of income to the rep. Established loss goal are not realistic to the revenue at risk based on account value."
good,"First time in a Call center. Thought I would be able to handle it but I was wrong. It wasn't a fit for me, but mostly I feel because for RS the call center is a new concept. They have a lot of bugs and issues going on that need to get worked out. Long hold times for customers equal angry customers. Other than dealing with angry people yelling about trash, the training they offer is amazing and the people who work there are great. Its a very fast paced, micromanaged, nearly no break having place to work."
good,"The company itself is great, and where they want to take the industry will be exciting but the local manager isn't on board with that vision and only pays lip service to the company culture and ethos. Patched together trucks, hydraulic spills, safety violations, no accountability. In a year or so it might be a great place to work, and I would definitely work there again, just not for the same boss I had."
good,"Started working at location in Lubbock (BFI) and it was great.  Management was great and job was fun and relaxed.  Transferred to Dallas where it was nothing by lying, tricking customers, and trying to get as much money out of customers no matter what the costs."
good,"was required to balance multiple jobs that varied from management to mechanic to accountant, backhoe operator, facility maintainer, metal fabricator, driver and many more. Site did not have a mechanic present for 5 years before me and equipment was in  bad shape, management would not allow the facility to be properly staffed and treated people unfairly, spent over 80 hrs a week at facilities to attempt to keep all things progressing."
good,All in all this was a great company to work for however the management was short on praise and helping you reach the goal you have set for yourself.
good,I would not recommend Republic Services Memphis Business Unit as a place to work. Very Stress Work Place. Very long hours without compensation. Distrusting work culture.
good,"Major Account Manager"
good,Wake up early in the morning go to the shop drive to route pick up garbage at stops on route. Hardest part about the job was all the lifting.  Enjoyed the hours and co-working.
good,"long hours and no help or support from management, spent many years at this company cause i love the work"
good,"Responsible for daily operations and sales support. Maintaining all reporting for routes and customer based and house inventories.  Instrumental in maintaining auditing requirements.  Responsible for maintaining databases and executing contract proposal, renewal, review, and execution. Responsible for all new staff including, posting of positions, interviews, orientation and on board staffing.  Responsible for maintaining all personnel, Department of Transportation, safety and accident files."
good,Never a day off. No home life. Work overload. 17 hour days are not unheard of. Not enough employees to complete job. Budget is not enough to complete work. Not enough employees to complete work. Pay does not match hours worked per week seeing how I work 7 days a week. Never a day off. Looked down at when wanting to take time off. Management is only concerned with numbers not results
good,Heavy Lifting
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Republic Services is a great company for benefits but terrible if you want a life outside of it. Typical 12 hr day collecting trash/recyclables...If you breakdown they ""try"" to get you help but if not you are out there until the day is done no matter what the hours. Trucks are maintained very poorly...they just fix it just enough to get back on the road and usually breaks down with the same problem within days and/or weeks. If you need to leave early for a doctors appointment or a personal reason they try to make it seem that you think your job isn't important. Like I said benefits are good ( if you're with a UNION LOCATION). Management at locations change frequently...easier to get rid of them than drivers. Cross training from frontend/rear load/side arm and rolloff is non existent."
good,After you get hired on it seemed like they would do anything to get rid of you if they didn't like you.
good,No advancement for women.  Management is a boy's club.  They moved us 3 times then suddenly laid off people.  Management is allowed to scream at people and not treat people with respect.
good,"New management took over  increased jobs per person, cutting people per shift making jobs unsafe to perform. Changed my whole outlook on the company. Great company just worked at a bad site."
good,Republic services corporate office should take a look at management and supervisors in Kerrville Texas things seem to be out of line and not up to Republic standards
good,"System and processes require demanding data entry requirements which take away from the sales process, Managing by data not performance, No resources for customer resolution."
good,Day to day you answer calls from customers about the lack of service provided by the company. You get tired of the lies they make you tell the customers. Not all management but some managers there bring there outside problems to work and there for takes it out on the employees. There is an unspoken thing about asking questions especially to the director. I was scolded by my sup for asking a harmless question in a meeting and the next day we had an entire meeting about why i raised my hand . They dont have work life balance and the office is boring they dont do anything for the employees. You may win a bounes but better believe its TAXED! Bottom line is money is good but its really not worth the trouble with the management. Also EVERYTHING is micromanaged !
good,"You are able to wear many hats while working at republic. People come and go quite often there and I believe it’s due to being over worked and lack of order. I worked there for about 5 years and was in love with my job. I worked many hours weekly and excelled in my work. Once new management comes in which seems to be every few months, they clean house as they see fit. Aside from being overworked and unappreciated, my coworkers were great. They all had the same opinion as I did though when it came to working there. I wish I could have stayed but I was let go because the new controller thought after 5 years of working well and doing my job as aspected, that I wasn’t qualified on paper. No matter how good you are at your job there if you don’t have a degree or a plaque on your wall, you get the boot regardless of your work ethic and achievements."
good,It’s alright but pay isn’t worth it. I mean it’s ok for like a first time job. But as a mother and running a household not for me. I prefer something with higher pay if I’m going to work all those hours
good,it was better company when i started but going down hill not properly fixing trucks. constantly broke down and not hourly pay. typical day is take this pile of a truck and do the route.
good,Lots of promises from the bosses and little results.  They would tell you that you can move up in the company but never do it.  Management talked to you like you are stupid.
good,"Republic services, is a good stepping stone job. But the equipment is junk, 60% of the trucks don't reach the DOT requirements. Sadly to say the only time there is room for advancement is either when someone dies, or gets fired."
good,"Good systems in place poor follow up on important items including maintaining equipment, do not follow up on issues that are communicated or have flexibility to help managers get the job done. They do have a excellent safety program."
good,"The job was great working with truck drivers, doing data entry, troubleshooting problems, maintaining records and DOT logs.  The position taught me patience, you have to have patience when dealing with people.  The hardest part of the job was staying to all hours of the night for the last truck and the most enjoyable part was the data entry, loved to do that."
good,They change the policy for the attendance in the middle of the year. Setting a lot of people up didn’t care that they told us one thing and changed it. Same with pay they just had different job titles but never increased the pay when they did they just reduced what certain people was doing. Management sucked nobody cares about the employee there no empathy to any situation
good,Company has a  lot to offer someone if management likes that person. I was a temp employee and preformed better than half of the perm employees but didn't get the same benefits. Management is petty and unprofessional. You thought high school was bad but go work here and you will think differently.
good,"IT's difficult to review the company on a whole as each location seems to run differently."
good,"No life in there your a slave to that job. One day off, management  very unorganized. Training is very bad. Over time is good. They didnt trained me well I had it to learn on my own. Theirs no communication there."
good,"While it may be easy to get hired there, it is a place for people who have nowhere else to go like felons and such which is a good thing. The break room has a snack machine and a beverage machine that often break down, speaking of breaks, they are not long enough at all. The warehouse where you have to work in has no heat and no air conditioning thus making the work conditions very uncomfortable for the minimum wage pay"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,The job itself is fun and easy once trained. Being able to sit and work alone is the best part of the job. However the hours and commute take a toll after a while.
good,"This job was very stressful and management was very hard to work with. You never got praised for the work you have done, but you definitely got written up if you did something incorrect."
good,Currently you are not guaranteed 40 hours per week. Consider pay to be under par. Management of the Jordan location is in way over her head. Other employees are why I stayed.
good,Customers are really angry and specialist are limited as to what we can do to correct their issues. Stressful when at peak times or new services offered.
good,"The work load was consistent."
good,Managers in my department had very large egos and were always bumping heads with one another. Lack of communication among managers. Employees and workplace culture is amazing. A lot of overtime.
good,"management will throw you under the bus and drive it over you. too much work is given to the drivers and then you are criticized when you take too long to do your route. they sell empty promises and treat you worse than dirt. I would like to lead into this with a positive attitude but management shows the favorites right in front of everyone. If two drivers commit the same type of fault then the same punishment should be given, that doesn't happen. the pay is good but should be better based on the work load. I won't speak for all of the divisions but this one needs over hauled."
good,"When I first started at Republic, it was a very enjoyable workplace.  Since then, management has become very poor, and the opportunity to advance in the company has become close to impossible.  Have taken a 20 hour pay cut over the last year, and my schedule does not permit me to live a normal, family livelihood.  Overall very unhappy."
good,"Although it wasn't for me some very good people with excellent benefits. Just need more training available to advance and do well, and training classes need to be used as it is an option. According to main supervisor and 2nd shift supervisor they are to supervise not train. So if you have experience it is for you and you will enjoy the many benefits, if not get some experience or apply to be a driver"
good,"It was the best of times it was the worst of times lol. I hated this job and loved it. I worked here for two years and lost a lot of weight,but I was so tired that I never had the energy to play with my kids."
good,Lots of potential but terrible management who are set in their ways. Best place to work is the corporate office in Phoenix. The office is nicer and none of the corporate politics that take place at the divisional offices.
good,Growing company that has a great culture and tremendous learning opportunities for the the waste management industry. Solution focused mentality for problem solving.
good,Long hours at times. Equipment is not the greatest depending on the vehicle your in. Supervisors seem to care at times other times not.Overall not a bad place to work but not the best
good,"Very good place to work for, good pay and benefits, worked fifeteen years there.all the peaple treated me great, would like to work there again. Had many good experiances"
good,Bust your tail off and management dont care unless your on there best buds list/drinking buddies need to improve on management
good,"Its a hard, hot and nowhere near rewarding job...but it helps pay the bills. There is nothing more to say but this site wants me to type more.. if you have a choice, do NOT take this line of work"
good,Typical busy small call center with limited resources that make day to day operations difficult and hurt overall productivity. The lack of management support in customer service is the main cause for escalated calls and customer complaints.
good,A typical day at work required driving and assisting in emptying garbage cans throughout the city of Fort Wayne. Our work was hard and it required us to be able to perform at a highly physical level.
good,hard to advance. long hours. very demanding mentally and physically. not very appreciative of many years of service.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Creating new accounts in a 3 State Area. Responsible for maintaining as well as creating new accounts.
good,The job is trash collection so there is really not much to expect. You get good exercise.
good,"Republics starting wage for Drivers is good but you will not have any life if you're a swing driver. So if you are thinking of applying to any jobs, be prepared that if you do get the job, you will have limited time with the family and you'll be putting in 12-14 hour days. You also will be given routes you don't know the areas of which on top of an already stressful job, that makes it much worse. The Sun Valley CA location is filled with a bunch of non-English speaking drivers, so it makes the environment very uncomfortable if you do not speak Spanish. Management is well what can I say...just management. There are Managers and Supervisors all over the place but to me it seems like there are TOO many. If you're a single person and you have your Commercial Driver's License I would say that its a perfect job...But if you have a family and don't want to put in 12 to 14 hours a day....pass on this company and look for something else"
good,Very busy multi tasking day.
good,Republic offers great compensation. The work/life balance is more work than life. The co-workers are great to work with which lessens the blow of the out of balance of the work/life. Hardest thing right now with Republic is the changes. The culture is being change. Sometimes the direction is a little unclear. Enjoy working with Republic because of the challenges that management gives you to accomplish and overcome.
good,the day started very early with saftey training for your self and public from inspections of truck detail to paper work organised and prioritation to details was a must highley intuitve decisions was a must and self awarnesss to weather and road conditions to safe driving practices and timely routines the most enjoyable part was to be able to be a self starter and acomplish intermingling with customers and public and have satifaction of day to day operations traveling some times long distances from dispatched areas for priorty customer pick up
good,morning meeting
good,"allied waste over all is a great company, that takes care of there employess, great benefits, fair wages. However the birmingham location has several issues they have to work through."
good,"The operations department keeps you on tour toes, busy and productive department. Learned to manage employees and how to create a more efficient and productive business.  Time management was the challenge as many task needed to be done at the same time.  Engagement with employees was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"It is a typical large corporate structure, Policies and procedures are typically based on the large markets. This doesn't always translate well in the smaller markets."
good,Supervisors were not qualified to in charge and one superviosr always had his wif visit him and they would spend alot of time together in the bathroom while work was being done and then he would never answer his radio.
good,"I took this job for the full time position only to find out that they were moving the call center to Arizona within 6 months.  I worked for 4 months, found another full time position only to find out they weren't moving the call center after all."
good,"Upon accepting the job, I was told my normal work hours would start 3:30am- normally no later than noon. Also I was told it was a recycle labor job. Since I've worked there, it's been a consistent 12-14 hour work day every day and done nothing but pick up residential trash."
good,Republic Services is a decent place to work but not a place to stay but for so long lots of management issues lots of favoritism from time to time and confusion happens often they claim to change it weekly but nothing has happened at this point.
good,"The work itself is not bad. You have no parts and no system to order or even keep up with inventory. This place is ran down and in major need of repair. You have 3 hrs of downtime at nights ,this is the only time any pm's get done. Management are nice people but do not trust what they tell you. Production only cares about a bonus and the maintenance mgr is just waiting time to get out. Always a power struggle between people.  They will leave you alone to run your shift but fail to tell you if yo u are a good mechanic or what they consider a A mechanic you are in charge of the shift. Alot of misconceptions go on in this place,I think the company is a good company however the Charlotte place is a hole that I would not step in. I took the job under false promises and am glad to be leaving after 7 months. These people do not care if you take your limbs home with you or not. Safety lol what safety,when told about safety issues or even implemented safety rules the plant manager literally ran a employee out of his office and was told not to come in his office again. Not how I would of thought a company of this magnitude would be ran.not sure why it even says plcs in description they dont even have a laptop.lol"
good,"Training, communication, accountability needs to improve overall from leadership. Structure on work processes within departments has too many gray areas and accountability amongst departments specially with operations is not reliable."
good,New management has been put into place.  The management above has threatened the lower managements jobs.    They are creating a culture of structure.   The company is trying to standardize it self across the nation.  The hardest part of the job is trying to get enough information on what the new directive is.  Communication is lacking with the new plans that are rolled out.  I like the employees that I work with.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Supervisors can't complete the crazy amount of assigned tasks. You would have to work 14 hours per day. Unreasonable expectations from cooperate. Too many departments creating policies.
good,"I work in the Chandler office in National Account and people are leaving every week. At what point is upper management (above supervisors boss) is going to step in and find out all the finger pointing and all the fingers pointed back at them. "
good,Always be on point..Republic services do decimate against ex convicts ...they will use you and also will pay you the lowest amount of money to work as a forklift driver...i was being paid $9.36 for operations of a forklift.
good,The area that I was in was shut down. they did not offer to move me to a different area. Just let our office go. The pay was established prior to them buying us out so not sure what their average pay is normally.
good,I personally changed the culture at this location and feel I put my stamp on this operation sorry to go but I feel the company did not support me when it was time after dedicating eleven years with the company.
good,"when I first started, there was a small amount of employees then as the years went on there was more and more employees hired and we took on more of a work load than we could handle, as the superviser started to have personal problems, the superviser took problems out on the employees. the superviser was great friends with the general manager so there for, the employees had no one to go to and talk too. several employees were so unhappy with the way the company was run that they quit. If you were on the supervisers good side then you were treated well."
good,"Drove for 8 years, two raises. Only Female Front Load Driver. Was given one of the hardest routes. Would not recommend to a female to expect equality."
good,It was a decent company but not the best compensation. Conflicting information between management and employees. Benefits were not equal to the work performed and we were always getting conflicting information.
good,I would like to see different territories of the company to get a full productive view of the company however I can only go by what I know. The views are very old-school and misogynistic. There is no tuition reimbursement so not much room for advancement.
good,As a sales rep you are watched and evaluated on multiple levels from local division through the corporate office. The culture is very stressful as they try to create sales robots by forcing to use their scripts to sell. After many successful years many leave the company due to losing the ability to have a personal relationship with customers.
good,I worked for this company for about a year and it was not conducive to getting advanced within the company.  Co-workers were not friendly and made it a stressful place to work.
good,Busy on the 15th and 20th of month.  Slow periods with little work but helped in other areas.  Company and management proved fun activities with games and prizes.
good,"High stress and high turn over with the drivers.  No room for advancement unless you get an upper hand.  The job was ok, but the customers did not like anything you did for help.  The company decided to move the calls to there center in NC and things got worse, due to that call center not following the information that our lead rep and our boss set up and this created more grief and stress for our small office."
good,"Being a driver at Republic Services is great! Great pay, good benefits and extra perks such as safety vouchers and free family events and Cedar Point."
good,long work days. high stress job. unreliable fleet here.work enviroment is sometime overwhelming due to the long hours.Benifits are decent but seem to change every year
good,Very stressful job.  Constant customer cancelations over increased pricing that happened at least twice annually.  Management was tough and out of touch with actual customers
good,"A decent place to work"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Good place of employment. I've worked here for 17years and it has had it's up and down, but overall it's been a good experience. Unfortunately the company is downsizing which will result in me having to find employment elsewhere."
good,"no team work here no support from upper management   hard to get techs to stay around. you train them and they leave to day jobs. never ending battle, drivers destroy you fix the drivers run the place"
good,"I liked working for the company, they had company events for the employees and their families frequently. Friendly environment and has good benefits in many ways."
good,"Was looking forward to being with this company for a long time but they decided to only have 3 call centers in the U.S. so I was laid off. Did pay a small severance, but not enough."
good,"I worked for this company for 17 + years."
good,"Terrible pay for such hard work. Poor working conditions, dealing with dead animals, inhaling all kinds of particles like paint, saw dust, ash. Also gets extremely hot as it is a warehouse made of metal."
good,"Loved the job of Retention/Customer Service it self but management is not helpful with your job and be prepare to do more then what you were hired for."
good,was not bad place to work until got new boss .several people have quit since i left.also some fired for various reasons. none of them not making sense on letting them go
good,"I learned the basics of Accounting, A/R, A/P."
good,Overall decent place to work.  Lots of leadership turnover as the corporate leaders rule with a tight iron fist.  Very different environment as most of the corporate trash guys aren't really open to feedback unless they can benefit from it.
good,"My typical work day begins early with a review of my daily route(s) and inspection of my vehicle to make sure it is DOT compliant. Once I review my routes and determine the most efficient ways of reaching my destinations, I spend my day getting to my assigned destinations, while keeping in constant contact with management to keep them informed of my progress. I also remain in contact with my co-workers to provide any help that I can in getting them to their target destinations. As with any job, retaining information from a source that doesn't have all the necessary information can be very challenging. However, I feel that one of the most enjoyable parts of my job is finding new and creative, hands-on solutions to these challenges which are presented to me."
good,Good place to work poor management.The pay was decent for the work. They take 30 minutes a day out for lunch you never have time to take.
good,Company has little concern for balance of personal and work life. Typical day for field operations is 11-12 hours and workload/expectations are high. Provides reasonable compensation and benefits but expects personal life personal life to be put secondary to work.
good,Sold new and maintained clients.  Developed by-monthly forecasts and budgets for management.  There was a disconnect between upper management and the field staff.  My co-workers who had the same position as me all worked in different states and I didn't see them often.  The hardest part of my job was the delay in responsiveness from management throughout the company for my clients.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the long relationship I had with my clients.
good,There is no work life balance and the supervisors are under paid.
good,I love my job and the environment.  I have learned a lot but I would like a job with more steady hours.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of buying parts, buying supplies for the shop and technicians, running various reports for management, and communicating with upper management about what trucks were down for service.  "
good,I enjoyed working there until Allied took BFI over. Work load increased to rediculous level.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Lack of Leadership/Management among the Route Team.....Inconsistent treatment of associates...job leaves no time for family.
good,Management had promise to move me off of curbside onto roll off driver position. They trained me for it and gave the position to someone else.
good,Front end is most often unorganized and when management creates an error or issues they point blame toward the drivers and other employees. Supervisors are rude and there is a lot of nepotism around the company.
good,"Honest and hardworking..loyal trustworthy.......respectful to my employees and work mates. Fair."
good,"Your daily schedule is the same. However your break times are never the same. And often they are 2.5 to 3 hours apart. You don't get a choice. You often get yelled at by customers for someone local not picking up their trash. Their billing system is the pits. It's very hard to use and you have to decipher the bills to see what was billed when and for how much. Everything counts against you and they regularly lower your handle time requirements without fixing anything Lightening (the system you'll do almost everything in) loves to crash and move really slow. This will count against you as well. The environment is becoming rapidly over measured. If you can find a job at Republic Services, make sure it's not in their call center."
good,Good place to work at and educational in the classes that it offers in its field but lacks management for direction and supporting of staff. Can use a face lift for management that needs to retire.
good,"they expect you to keep advancing from customer to sales, even if you don't want to do sales. there are only 3 paid holidays each year. enrollment in the 401k is mandatory, not optional"
good,"There if not much room for improvement, the raises are small, you have no bonuses. You are only recognized when you have done something wrong. When a driver has done something wrong they have no one to defend them they have to defend themselves."
good,Very large corporate company. Competitive and corporate environment. Employees are consumate professionals held to high standards. The excellence demanded resulted in a high turnover throughout my tenure.
good,"it's a good job if you can get hired, the supervisors have poor interview skills, they've called me 3 times for interview not knowing they've already interviewed me. good pay good hours but I question the leadership, if you get called for an interview try not to seem too excited they may not call you back they act like they want hire messy employees"
good,can be difficult on work life balance lots parts of the job are not structured well.  Certain areas have issues wit unions and very difficult productivity standards
good,Management plays favorites.  Gouge customers in pricing and lock them into contracts with annually rising prices.  Customer service is long distance call centers that often do not know the specifics of service in many rural areas.  More concerned with stock value and price increases than allowing customer service be the driver for their value.  Benefits are good but do not take a lower end management position as everyone dumps their workload down the ladder.
good,"The new management came in and changed everything, a bunch of red necks from Tennessee.  The management wanted everything done differently than what we where used to.  they sucked!!!!!"
good,Poor equipment. Pay not the greatest compared to other companies in the same industry. If your truck goes down and there is no spare truck they’ll send you home and force you to use your PTO days if you want to get paid.
good,What you get from this company varies on what location you are at. At our yard we were dragged along for months before being laid off. The option we had was to take a trash severance or transfer to another yard out of state immediately.
good,"For office workers:"
good,"was driver and had some health problems and when came back , was put in wash bay with promise of getting back to driving. was in wash bay for over a year and had to almost quit before they put me back to driving. then they didn't give me a route like they promise."
good,"You show up for work in the dark, get to the area you are going to work in, stay focused and aware at all times. You get dirty, cold, wet, sun burned and somewhere in the middle sometimes. You can trip and fall and get back up sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not so much. You kill snakes, rats, and spiders. You clean just to watch it get dirty. You make friends with some and some you don't. But never close friends."
good,There will always be trash.  Once on the road you are on your own which is not bad. But communication is challenging.  The weather is is stressful in winter and the trucks don't handle well  There are always 5 day work weeks even with holidays it is made up on the following Saturday.
good,My job was ok usally when you got there before clocking in you got a chance to or take smoking break. There was usally a good speech given to everyone before starting
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Unpaid lunches, even when you don't take a lunch."
good,"This job is very tedious and paying attention to detail was very important. We occasionally had company events planned around certain events or holidays to break the long, very fast paced and tedious days."
good,Would be willing to continue to work for Republic.  If there are job opportunities available when I move. Mostly work your own route. But the other drivers are more than willing to help if possible. Republic is going to hourly pay instead of production based pay.
good,Republic Services is a great company to work for.  The benefits are great. Health insurance  is  great. All employees have the option to select the package that fits their family.  Salaries are also good
good,It does not matter how much faster of a process that maybe better of an option once the company is has its process they do not want to change.   The hiring policies seem to only want tax deductible employees not quality.
good,This can be a great job as long as the weather is nice and the trucks run properly. 50 to 56 hrs a week. Most of the trucks are automatic transmission
good,The longer you are there the worse you are treated. They want to get rid of people that have been there a while and have knowledge for someone that will work for $8.00 an hour
good,"Good people to work with. Horrible management. No guidance, only negative put-downs all the time. No congratulations when there were accomplishments, no matter how great."
good,"The centerline of all problems is 100% management. No one knows what they are doing, they don't communicate amongst others in management. If I have a question about something, everything is I am not 100 percent sure, let me talk to this person and I will get back to you. You are supposed to be the manager, you are supposed to know exactly what is going on in your company. How am I supposed to trust you with my career when you don't know a simple answer to a simple question. And I don't mean one or two things, it is literally everything like they are about to pitch us a lie and they have to get their story straight. No communication period, but yet they are always walking the halls together like they are the cast of Friends but don't know about everyday operations. Almost everyone who seeks advancement was shortly put on a final on a technicality or fired within a week or two.  If you want to advance it is all politics. This is a great company to work for as long as you stay at least 20 miles away from the Chandler Call Center, aka the career finisher. Two of our supervisors, one worked for RS for about 6 years the other for over 20 years, both fired from this location."
good,In need of better organization for all departments and need better communication between the departments. More training needs to be available for both new hires and current employees.
good,I have no comment regarding my personal experience with any company that I may or may not have been employed by. Personal reviews of employers are often jaded with statements and comments that can not be verified.
good,The Company preaches one thing but practices something else. Upper managent is only worried about P/L and does not engage their direct reports. The company is a recent new comer to E&P and is finding out that the oilfield is a different animal than residential waste as it tries to apply its policies and practices to the oil and gas industry.
good,Republic is a big company with great benefits. There is a lot of turnover at all levels. Lots of hours with not much local management that can make decisions. All major decisions come from corporate which is very disconnected with what is going on locally.
good,This was a great opportunity to learn and push myself in a supportive environment. My supervisor seemed to care about my progress and provided opportunities to learn more
good,Contracts were a game.  Basically who could swindle the most customers into a contract that was very difficult to remove themselves from or their business.
good,"If you ever have a day that you work less than 10 hours expect to hear ""Are you leaving early?"" from someone. "
good,"Good personalities "
good,"Was in a accident and they fired me. They are all about safety which is good. But just watch your back, supervisors don't care to stab it. Wasn't bad tho."
good,I like working there everybody's friendly but it has its moments when it's stressful and you feel like your bosses do not trust your judgement or what you do out there
good,Enjoyed this job and raises which came with it. Management communicated with employees well. Had a chance to be involved in suggestions for better efficiency gains for the company to be more profitable. Physically challenging and the hours worked daily were long.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,It is a relatively easy job as long as you pay attention to what you are doing. Don't expect company to pay anywhere near what other trash companies pay.
good,"Unless you like sorting through trash on a daily basis, I wouldn't recommend this job. This job can be very gross and disgusting. In closing, the pay rate for this type of job is horrible as well."
good,"Benefits overall are above average. The weekly paychecks make managing a family budget easier. The waste business is recession resistant."
good,Republic has multiple divisions in the Northeast.  All are not created equal in providing service.  Their size and available resources allows them to cover a large area with good to great service throughout the region.
good,"It's a good company to work for, some great people but some so call rules are silly.  Instead of an email we take 30 minutes or more our of production time to huddle."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the work I do.  Greeting visitors to the landfill, ensuring payroll is complete and accurate, and watching the landscape change with the seasons."
good,Great place to work if you just need a job. Not the ideal place for a young person wanting to advance in pay or position. Also not for a family to support.
good,"will never see anything but 2nd shift, as long as you can do the job as fast as they want than things are good. No work life balance at all."
good,pay is good benefits are well long hours never home never no if u have a job day to day.................no job security needs to be more about safety
good,"This job is fast paced with long hours. The management was fair, and understandable. The hardest part of the job is working 12 plus hours 6 days a week."
good,This is where I learned to be a staff accountant. I also learned that I enjoyed a challenge through the opportunity to oversee 6 divisions. The Opportunity to grow was a slow process but achievable.
good,The management was always in flux and it seemed they never knew if they were coming or going themselves. A lot of their long time drivers were unhappy with the current state of affairs with the management and how they were operating.
good,"Co workers are great guys, the hours are swing/grave and are a bit hard if you want a family life. Benefits and pay are decent. Management needs work."
good,"typical day at work included meetings with management, customers, coworkers, and also going out door to door."
good,Great Company. The amount of work you put in you are going to get.
good,"My day began with time for work. I learned how to read blue prints, Use a Mig Welder, how to use the certain size tips, grinders, power tools, torch cutter. My supervisor was never around. I did not have any Co-workers. The hardest part of my job was not having supervisor was never there for any questions I had about the job. So I bought books to teach me the rest. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I got the chance to educate myself in this field and did awesome."
good,I learned a lot about garbage service and guidelines tha go along with the field.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,This company can do better if management has better training toward his employees. The supervisor I had in this job was terrible and abusive. This job is so streesful that can take you straight to the tumb
good,"Work days are always eventful. There are occasional celebrations for the many hours of safety that have been accomplished. Co-workers are like family, the good and the bad parts. Overall the company is very customer oriented and dedicated to safety"
good,The company has gone thru many growing pains over the years. It's gone from a family-owned company to the #2 waste company in the country.
good,"let me tell you, the best position in any trash company is outside sales doing roll-off in the construction field. No contracts involved all temp meaning your not wasting most of your week trying to find business that is not under contract ie competition holds their customers to contract by a) threats of lawsuit or b) just lowers the rate. Base salary in outside sales in below avg ie 30-34k annually. Benefits are very good only because of the large amount of workers that work for a Republic / WMI / IESI - Progressive."
good,To much work not any training.
good,"loved working at allied waste, one of the best jobs ive had and would have loved to stay but i had to relocate"
good,"I have been here for almost a year now and there is a ZERO tolerance for attendance, whether its your fault, a problematic car, or stuck waiting for a train. There is a lot of changes going on and some of them seem counterproductive, but its more a management decision than company policy"
good,"Very friendly and hard working co-workers. I learned about keeping up the maintenance on the garbage trucks then got promoted to doing their accounts payables. I enjoyed everything about this job, except the horrible smell of trash on a hot summer day. The hardest part was teaching myself everything."
good,"A typical day at Richmond Sanitary is always very busy, multitasking galore of driver issues and customer service questions pertaining to specific routes, and all the work needs to be manually generated before the end of the day."
good,alright work place. little comunication between staff. have to get used to smells of truck.
good,Reliable place to work management not so great try to tell u the wrong way to do something do to lack of knowledge. Trucks break down constantly. Most days on clock are sit and wait for mechanic
good,Better mechanics or more mechanics. Need to have more teamwork when trucks are down. We also need to have more pay or hourly pay at a decent rate. Also needs to work on safety with the equipment
good,Stay away management doesn't know how to run a company. They will work you until you have no life or suck the rest of what you have left. They don't know how to put routes in order. People lose there job because others don't know how to do theirs. One good thing I can say is the mechanics and shop are awesome no band aids they fix everything right.
good,Expects the most out of people.  Likes to hire people they feel can't get any better job just to overwork and underpay them.  Benefits are way too expensive for the area we live in and the pay  we get.
good,The job has great benefits and pay. The best part of the job is being able to get your route done on a good day. The hardest part of the job is having more to do than time in a day. The culture of the company is poor due to poor management and organization. Position can be quite stressful as there is often too much work to get done in a day.
good,Fast paced call center with potential to grow. You will learn a lot about the Waste Industry. The staff is very talented and makes it an enjoyable place to work.
good,"Worked here for several years and this environment became a very unfriendly one .You are able to work from home as needed and the benefits are good overall, Just unfriendly working conditions and the requirement to travel ."
good,I enjoyed my work very much at Republic.  Management and supoervisor need to get there act together in order to reassure drivers that the company cares for them.
good,There is no continuity across business units. Corporate makes unrealistic demands on the business units. Very demanding hours and no long term job security.
good,The management was earful and often made fun of other in front of staff. Made for bad moral and no trust. Co workers were great if you could get past the stress management caused on a daily basis of bullying staff.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,The work is good but with the Union contract lower seniority people get screwed. You'll have to work over 56 hours a week or you're going to get stuck working every Saturday almost
good,I worked in A different city when I first hired on with Republic Services and everything was great. I was wooed to take a Frontload position in a closer to home city by a previous manager and the job wasn’t bad except for the equipment broke down multiple Times a week and I stayed in a spare truck over 6 months my first year as a Frontload Driver. I tried to get back into a rolloff job (what I did in Previous location)and it wouldn’t never materialize! Then management revised the routes and added extra stops on my route and #2 route which made it impossible 3 out of 5 days to complete if we had any mechanical issues and the 3rd route was done by 10:30 Monday’s and 1pm on Friday when it was supposed to be equal across the board on stops. Then we would get fussed at for going over 12 hours when trucks would break. Not smart business. Not happy for our input falls on deaf ears.
good,Hard work . Alot of customers to service in a day. Need to complete your route. work in all weather conditions . Lots of times the trucks will breakdown putting you behind. So if you don’t complete your route you have to finish it the next day along with that same days work.
good,"Management says one thing, but expects another i.e. performance, safety"
good,"they dont care of ther mechanic like they should, they thenk the drivers are the most important of all ther workers, they treat there truck like nothing"
good,Fast paced job teamwork was a huge thing had a route to finish before time hit and the routes weren’t easy. Pay was little for how much we worked and under weather climates.
good,"unrealistic expectations on maintenance department. If a location has fired people in your position before you get there run, don't walk away. Corporations don't care about you just bonuses."
good,"Unorganized, 5 am clock in, low pay, always looking to blame drivers, to much not enough pay, always covering for other routes, gave nothing back after corporate tax cuts"
good,"its okay , better if you have CDL's licence  . being on the back of the truck, need drivers with better driving skills . also with reading better mapping skills, some drivers dont know how to read a map, helper have to show them the routhe"
good,"Very fast paced environment.  Work/life balance isn't the best, as well as working most Saturdays.  Workplace culture needs work, along with lower level employees not feeling validated."
good,"Ok workplace, friendly workers, work environment is overall good. Would recommend someone to work here but the chances of moving up in position seems impossible"
good,"Great company location in nc, Terrible in both tampa locations,tranfered from nc, All new management who don't know the industry.IF division was on track with company policy, I would hav e stayed till retirement."
good,"Good company to work for with Class B pay, would not recommend someone with Class A license to work for company as it only requires Class B.  Great job for younger person with minimal bills."
good,"too many jobs piled on one person, I have 3 titles and the harder you work the more management throws on you. Republic has great benefits but the stress out weighs this. I cant even put all my job titles in the header here, I had to delete 2.  Billing Coordinator, Scales house Clerk"
good,Days are a little stressful. Never know if people will show up to do their jobs. Trucks are of questionable reliability;.Truck issues seem to be the most pressing problem. Often loaders are overworked and stressed. Routes are little too large for one man loaders.
good,"There is never a typical work, same old daily routine at Republic Services.  You never know what the work load will be except for A LOT.  There is never a dull moment."
good,"Keep in mind this review is from someone who was working via the employment of a temp agency, which I do not recall the name of. This job was also worked a significant time ago, and due to the temp agency, I was provided with no benefits whatsoever."
good,"Republic is a good company for the right person they are good to their employees for the most part, but overlook the talents in their employees especially in sales, growth and account management."
good,management suck at this time unorganized and favoritism and being forced to stay out and get the cans unwillingly Chinese overtime you only get or got a raise if you were a favorite
good,"Customer Service, call center."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Working in the IT Department I found that my skills and hard work didn't pay as much as the men in the department who did what I did or had the same skill set as I. When I confronted a manager I got a smoke screen.
good,"Job I physically demanding, but pay is very well for hours worked. Great job for working outdoors if you prefer. Opportunity to be out in your community and be more aware of what is going on in the community"
good,"Multi tasking- Work load is very high. Pleasant people to work with. Learn cash, collection and customized billing for National Account Customers. I had over 60 accounts I managed monthly."
good,This company has over 35k employees. Corporate life is filled with red tape and limited opportunities to make things happen. Action is driven from many layers above. Management is required to take leadership training however a limited amount are held accountable or measured on how they are managing their people.
good,"Gathered and emptied trash and trash receptacles. Thoroughly cleaned trash bins and maintained clean work area. Provided professional customer service while interacting with staff and customers. "
good,"a lot of hours, high stress environment, very fast paced with a lot of cross functional responsibility, purchasing, h/r, dot regulations, hours of service, safety, productivity, retention"
good,Straight forward job.  I've learned that they are a growing company.  Management is pretty decent.  The workplace culture is exactly what you would expect for this type of service.  Nice coworkers.  Some of the quirks that come with a large company are difficult.  I genuinly enjoy my job.
good,If you can get into the union and drive commercial frontload the pay is amazing. The roll off department pays great as well. Be prepared to work hard if your are in residential or commercial rearload.
good,I don't like management very unprofessional and showed favoritism to other employees. As women of color I always felt very out of place and uncomfortable.
good,"very friendly folks, job is fast pace, trash moves along the conveyor belt and involves team work to help sort them into the right bins, prepare to get your clothes all stink up and smelly at the end of the day"
good,Learned a lot. A typical work day consisted of starting at 6am and going to approximately 4:30. Management was fair for the most part but there was a lot of favoritism from the dispatch. The workplace culture is cool for the most part. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rats and roaches. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning something new.
good,"Managers have no accountability. As soon as they are unable to delegate things to you, you have no value to them. Item's which employee's are concerned about are often overlooked, and even mocked.  Human Resources is also very little help, often defending management and patronizing employees."
good,Job atmosphere at Philadelphia location is toxic. Leadership only cares about numbers instead of returning a quality product back to the customer. Would not recommend
good,"good people to work with. Set schedule for office workers, Monday thru Friday. Pay is alright. They offer vacation time and sick pay and free service for employees."
good,"The management team here was weak at best.  They were all replaced promptly, so I can no longer have an opinion, but when I was there it was horrible.  I had 3 job titles for $42K a year.  But the personnel there were all like family, and at times it was a fun place to work."
good,"The ratio to employee's actually needed is very poor.  They are more or less run by One Fleet, an outside entity that lays the rules in the person to job ratio and it's not pleasant. "
good,I like my job looking to start a small business in the hot shot field so I can have more family time this company is really good as far as job security they great benefits and a 401 k the vacation time is the only issue I have with this company other than that great company to work for
good,"Good company, making big changes and the growing pains can be frustrating. Management is in-experienced  and the culture can be a tad fake. The training needs work and the supervisors need to take an additional course on leadership as most are new to leadership roles and have issues with assisting team members."
good,"Favoritism is the worst among supervisors . Worked long hours ,no family life .after 26 years of working sanitation I was told that I was finally moving up to a job I would love . Never seen that job !  For company short handed employees, I had to cover other area .then they brought in someone else to do my job and I was let go for not being able to do my job . The equitment you work with in this branch was wore out .so it was not able to keep up with the demand of the customer.they are loosing customers for the lack of . Over priced, unbalanced pricing ,lack of service to customers and upper corporate issues ."
good,"training was good co-workers were nice"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,This job has it all the pay and benefits only thing with this job is management cause. I'd they r after u they will find a way to make u quit or fire u.
good,They are a fair company who knows and follows all safety regulations. Their training was thorough and trainers were knowledgeable. Good experience for first timer in job in the trash business.
good,Typical day at work is an average of 10hr days.  Requirements for the job always change.  Nothing set on paper.  Lack of communication.  Not the most professional atmosphere. No structure
good,A typical day at work consists of repairing and  troubleshooting a lot of mechanical and electrical problems. I have learned how to work on all sorts of different industrial machines from balers to forklifts. I feel that management is very respectful and proactive. I work around some really good mechanics whom have taught me many useful skills. The hardest part of my job is having to work in the overwhelming amount of dust and debris. The most enjoyable part of my job is doing something that I enjoy and always learning from the lead technicians.
good,"Your daily routine consists of navigating through the city safely in a timely fashion while servicing every scheduled stop on route. You have to have the ability to work in all weather conditions, lift about 100lbs. and be able to judge weight fluctuations as you progress through your day. Management is friendly, easy to work with, inviting and helpful. My co-workers always worked together as a unit to make the job easier. The most difficult part of the job is lifting, pushing, and pulling extreme weight in most cases. The job does have a lot of freedom, no one is constantly watching you and its really enjoyable during the warm weather months."
good,very poor management here. enough said. I really don't have much to say besides it used to be a great place to go to work but became very Witch Hunting in the end !.
good,I really like what I was doing theres just too many changes going on only involving numbers.  The employees are lovely here.  I really would like to continue driving under difference circumstances
good,Started when it was ccc and then bought by allied waste and the merged with republic services..The bigger it got it lost the one one personal touch.. We were all numbers then and came in to a job and go home..
good,"I find this is a great place to work. You can make good money for your family, and they have great benefits, however, there is a lot of favoritism on the job and some supervisors can be unfair."
good,"Have enjoyed working with Republic Services in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex."
good,I was there for 2 years and made an operational mistake that was a terminable offense. I can understand that there are no second chances when it comes the the safety of a 40000 lb vehicle. The hours were long .It was a stressful job. Pay was great.
good,"Produce all complete deposition transcripts and ship to attorneys. Scan all exhibits and completed paperwork into company system for back up. File all incoming changes and signature page(s) with the proper courts according to State and Federal rules. Copy all attorneys of the changes and signature page(s) that were being filed with the courts. Assist the Scheduling/Production Manager.  Confirm all deposition the day before being taken. Schedule conference rooms for law firms in and out of town or state. Assign court reporters, videographers and interpreters to depositions to be taken. Enter all incoming deposition notices into business system and a daily planner.  Meet daily quotas."
good,If you can do the same routine over and over again this job is great for you. I am amazed to know how much work goes into trash carts. Nothing super special about the management team. Co-workers are pretty nice. There really is no big challenge with this job. The space given to do you job is great. Two big thumbs up!
good,My days at work here was great. I enjoyed working here because I knew it was all about help saving the trees the world. I enjoyed working with my co worker team working getting the task competed .My hardest part of the day was when employee do not show up for work
good,The job is demanding and leads to high turnover in all sales positions.
good,"Usual day would begin at 5am and would end at 7pm. Was responsible for safety, maintenance, payroll, and scheduling of 15 employees along with interaction with city council members in various cities to coordinate service to customers and to arrange volunteer assistance to community programs."
good,very busy days.  usually customer service department is understaff.
good,a fun place to work lots of things to do and no time for foolishness.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Company seems to struggle with communication with its own processes, very often directives are given to only be taken back with poor reasons why.  Makes many of it's employees feel processes are being put in place off the hip."
good,"The typical day at work consists of clocking in and immediately walking in to the plant. I would then go to the computer and start the plant from a main computer ,the drum feeder to the aluminum blower and everything in between would begin to run. From that point on I was expected to segregate material from a conveyor into the appropriate bin. If something jammed up, I would go inside and fix the problem.  From these things I learned how to stand in one spot for hours,  work with people from different origins and descents (some didn't speak English),  Fix problems as they arose, how to be a team player and all of this while practicing safety at all costs.  Management tells you that there is room for upward mobility unfortunately the years I worked there I wasn't told of any other positions I could move into.  Coworkers were probably the best part of the job and as we all got used to each other it became easier to understand them and work as a team.  The hardest part of the job is constantly having to work in an unhealthy environment.  Dust masks are provided as well as gloves, hard hat, and safety glasses but it didn't stop some of the dust from getting in nor does it stop needles from poking you or  feces from getting on you.  "
good,Strong focus on fundamentals. New focus requires talent assention based on industry experience.
good,"Not all supervisors and other assistants are trustworthy.  They act like they are trying to help, then stab you in the back.  If you do take a job with Republic Services,  be very careful about what you say."
good,My experience with Republic started out positive at first but it spiralled downhill with they bought out the company before it became Republic Services with called Recommunity Recycling.
good,It is not a bad company to work for but there training process is long and grilling. It is about a month before they will let you drive. They have trainers or behind the wheel instructors some are good some are rude. If you get a bad instructor management does not care.Nothing like spending 12 hours a day traped in a little box with a jerk. Equipment sucks most trucks in Tampa 2007 or older needs updated.
good,"I worked there for ten years, work saturdays after every holiday, pay is decent but didnt keep up with current rates. Left to pursue a career elsewhere"
good,Republic overall is a good Company no shortage of work. Fast paced all the time. Trash stops for no one or for anything for that matter. The people that work there are great and very knowledgeable.
good,"Management has no experience in the industry, so all they do is manage the number. Supervision fails to follow through on requested and complaint by the employees."
good,"Ive been with republic services   for 6 years now "
good,They were so worried about changing the schedule for pickups that everything became discombobulated. They had areas being done twice a week by 2 drivers because they didn't know what they were doing.
good,Great peers and follow up from senior management is great.  Drivers are very supportive and willing to support new managers that are being onboarded.  Fortunate to have this opportunity.
good,"Republic will use you up,burn you out,then fore you.All they re concerned with is their bottom line,they talk a good game about safety,but getting mechanical problems fixed comes last."
good,"Company is not bad, but incentive pay, which would not be bad if the incentives were possible to reach is set up to keep wages down. Only senior employees have reachable goals. Bennies are good except Vaca, which you may not be able to take  in summer months, or around holidays. (Senior employees hoard them). Call offs are common, so extra work is a daily thing, incentive pay keeps lower levels employee's wages low"
good,Great job to work at. Plenty of hours decent pay and all around great people. Worked here for over a year and changed my life for the better wish I could go back.
good,"Poor management, lack of maintenance, stressful, good pay but the poor management makes it difficult to maintain and stay. Maintenance on vehicles is very poor"
good,This is an ok company to work for. Behind in technology. Forward advancement is not top priority and no training program. Not very structured as far as big picture from Corporate.
good,Every job has its good and bads. Only pro I can say is you don’t have manager breathing down your neck every second. And it outsidework . Everyone different
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,The people are awesome there . But the job was unreliable. Would drive 40 mins to work just to be told I have no work. Some weeks I would work 50+ other weeks I would work under 20.
good,Republic service only good if u a truck driver/heavy loader operator or mechanical. I was at shred all on 43racine then went to 64th loop Transfere station. Where I’m at now !  The problem is they work u hard for little money . The raised once a year is 10cent to a quarter . So I’m at $13.07 a hr now but don’t have money for food or anything unless it’s a 5 Friday months.
good,"Great job, can be demanding and equipment can be difficult to deal with but overall the highest paying job I’ve ever had along with the best benefits in the waste industry.  Dispatch could be frustrating when I was there, but one bad apple shouldn’t have been allowed to spoil the bunch.  As above, maintenance on the equipment sometimes left a lot to be desired and supervisors could’ve worked together more versus sending mixed messages on an almost daily basis.  Overall though as far as compensation and benefits, Republic is hard to beat."
good,As a result of a restructure of management my employment was ended. Prior to the restructure my reviews were all positive. After the restructure it  was a constant practice to find fault in majority of tasks given.
good,"Operated rear loaders/rolloff trucks,swap out containers,dump and return containers,made deliveries,dump finals,filled out all paperwork,performed pre&post inspections."
good,Operation manager stresses you out on route times and doesn’t care about any of employees. Benefits were good. Equipment was not kept in good working condition.
good,"being a compost driver for republic waste at the time was hard work I ran a rear loader so I had to drive the truck to the stops get out run to the back of the truck through in the very heavy bags of compost then run back to the front of the truck climb in drive to the next stop and do it all over again, 400 to 500 times a day"
good,"Residential driver operating a front, side or rear loading truck. Prompt and complete waste removal on designated routes or as assigned by dispatcher."
good,"It was a good place to work"
good,"Republic Services is a good company with good employees, great benefits, and management.  The life/work balance is an issue, but overall the company is good."
good,Enjoyed working at Republic. I was transferred to a sight quite a ways from my home and on night shift.  I worked that for over a year and needed a change.
good,"I enjoyed working with management, the team and customers. Great working environment. Management always made sure the sales department had everything they needed out in the field."
good,was a route supervisor...long hours...trucks were not maintanied...upper management was not so good...i feel like i was set up for failure...not a good experience
good,It was a very good job. Co-workers was very helpful and nice. It's was very fast pace so you had to catch on quickly. The management was fair. It could have been better
good,A high paced job that requires travel of 50 or more miles each way to and from work unless you live in the tiny town located where the company is.  It is a cut throat company.  They have a semi high turn over rating.
good,"Due to high management turnover it was impossible to get an accurate yearly review, which determines your pay increase, if any. I initially started as a temp and management requested a position to be created for me so that I could continue my employment. I enjoyed my job and excelled daily. I had a exemplary personnel file with absolutely no disciplinary actions or write ups. On my first yearly review I was given a 2% increase (3% being the highest allowed) and yet I was fired, with no reason given, after a change in management. When I asked for the reason I was told by HR representative that they were not required to provide one. In the state of Texas, this is true. Because of their refusal to give a valid reason I was approved for 6 months of unemployment benefits. The location I worked for within this company had a work environment of ""who you know"" not ""what you know"". The benefits are wonderful, the pay is good but the ever changing management resulted in ever changing daily operation expectations."
good,I worked in the call center of Republic Service. I set up new services and canceled old ones. Took payments over the phone and settled disagreements. Received complaints and resolved them.
good,"This is a good company to work for.  However, as they are new to the large call center culture there are some things that have not yet smoothing out. some of the benchmarks for stats are not fair."
good,It is a trash call in complaint center and I didn't like answering the phones for old people who weren't happy with a smallest thing. I sis feel the training was sufficient but in the end it wasn't the place for me
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,learned alot about operations supervisor for several divisions within the company; learned alot about safety and environmental issues regarding trash services
good,"Can be a good place to work for a driver.  Good employee benefits, and a good union to work for."
good,no comment. I have no desire to post a review about Republic Services or any other company.  I have no comment on a typical day at work. Nor do I have anything to say about what I learned.
good,"equipment was sub par, the management was lacking in employee interaction."
good,good place to work due to union managers can use more training in people skills they preach safety safety safety but do not lead by example and when one works slow to be safe they are on your back to hurry up and finish
good,Job was consistent you are safe if you had a contracted prevailing wage town you didn't have to swing drive. It was a fair place to work for worked with a lot of good people
good,"Very organized, employee worked together to get the work completed in a timely fashsion. Flexible work days, pay was good. Work until job was completed"
good,"Never clear what  work will be  on any given day and no forward guidance. Lots of management people but little to no explanation of company  plans to deal with call flow or  guidance to workers.Not enough people to process  calls and order flow. Cust  hold time  consistently over  1/2 hour and many times longer, for months."
good,A company with a good vision of the future of  waste management but issues arriving at  the goal. The   balance  between  resource and   demand is not realized.
good,"Generally decent place"
good,"Republic Services can be a good place to work. 2nd shift was mandatory which I personally did not enjoy but overall the garage was very relaxed. "
good,"Very demanding. Needs consistent business practices. Customer friendly. Lacks standardization. Too many changes, too often. Outdated working conditions."
good,No Comment. Company is highly competitive within it's arena and was there to help employees during the weather catastrophes of 2017. Is working to increase employee retention.
good,"Pay could definitely be higher.I was fortunate to have had two great supervisors when I worked there. Both of whom I kept in touch with when I left. It's an easy Customer Service job, just didn't pay enough for me as a single mom supporting 4 kids."
good,Working here is very stressful and you do not get paid enough for all the stress and angry customers you deal with on a daily basis. You have to wait 90 days before you receive medical insurance.
good,i was in charge of maintaining an inventory for the mechanics to have supplies at all times.
good,"	Manage a team of employees assigned to me"
good,"I love a challenge and this job gave me that and more. I worked anywhere from 40-55 hours a week and very rarely did we have slow time. It made the day go faster. Typical day started at 6 am and ended at 4 pm. It would start with weighing the refuse trucks from the company and then open at 7 am for the public and contractors. I loved interacting with the employees and the customers on a daily basis. it was a friendly atmosphere until the company was bought out and new management took over. They started downsizing and replacing with their people, benefits changed, rules changed and that happy atmosphere went away as well. People were quick to throw others under the bus to save their own jobs. That was the hardest part of my job actually was watching the change take over and it was definitely not for the good."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,The company is a fair place to work; people are easy to get along with. Benefits are great and the vacation that the company gives its salary employees are awesome.
good,A typical day at work would be runing the day to day workflow by utilizing a team of 18.  I learned how to multi task while juggling 3 teams with different job functions.  The mamagement team could have been more supportative.  The culture was dry.  I brought team builders and fun fridays to help change the culture.  The hardest part of my job is not knowing the expetations and having to put processing in place to help streamline the workload.  It was hard not having a road map to follow.  The most enjoyable part of my job was empowering my teams to excel to greatness.  Stars were hung over each of their heads to remind them that a star existed in each of them.  Just look up!
good,"Taking calls in the credit.collection department. "
good,Actually I had  planned to retire from there;but after the merger with Allied Waste; things went downhill as far as I was concerned. The  management was pathetic at the corporate level and as the old saying goes...feces rolls downhill. They changed the rules as they saw fit. I actually enjoyed my job but it became very frustrating to me because they had idiots making policy who didn't know their backsides from third base. It was never dull there and I did learn a lot  while I was there. I miss my coworkers. The hardest part of the job was getting  done in the time allotted because they kept adding on to the tasks and not adjusting the time realistically. I have reapplied there because the old idiots are gone. I left because I felt they had done me wrong.  What I enjoyed most about it was getting the job done right.Plus they fed us very well. I never had a job I hated
good,management right now needs improving the most enjoyable part of this job is meeting new customers..the hardest part of this job is being slowed down because of traffic in the city
good,This was a great job and a lot of fun and relaxed to work here. Everyone was really nice and I loved what I did. Management was great and so were the employees
good,make sure you get everything in writing from the manager before starting work. once you accomplish what the hire you for they let you down without warning
good,A typical day starts pretty early.  I have become a much better driver in my time at Republic. The most challenging part of the job is the conditions.
good,"You must be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times.  This job is physically and mentally demanding.  The company has pulled all Local shops and they have moved to Youngstown, Ohio."
good,"-Process openings, cancellations, re-instatements, and service changes to accounts."
good,"republic services is not a bad company to work for there is only a couple of things .1 , to many supervisors that should worry about running their group not someone else's group . 2 , not a bad thing but to many safety rules hard to do your job over all good company"
good,"The guys are very friendly, the job can be stressful if you let it get to you. It is a very busy call center. Customers can be very grumpy at times. The office staff are friendly and very helpful in training."
good,looking to move up in my career. to be able to provide for my family all around to be able to not stress about anything work and come home without doubt to provide as a man
good,"A typical day at work was composed of getting in and going over all work load, making sure that everything had been covered and or that there was a plan to cover it. Customer satisfaction was a high priority and went hand in hand with our employees safety given the nature of the business. "
good,"The truth of the matter, when Republic bought out City Carton, Co. there was huge changes and many were let go. I feel the unjustly judge their employees. What one can do it may be the next person would get into trouble trying to do the same things."
good,"get your daily log sheet/maps/clipboard"
good,"They were bought by Republic Waste. This was a great job, great people and great managers. I would go back in a second if I could. It was a great experience."
good,to work there  is okay just the management makes it stressful. they are very dependent on safety and work relations between all employees. overall the job is easy but the people there make it stressfull
good,"Start times from 4:00 am to 6:00 am. Very long days with lots of paid overtime. If you don't mind working all the time and sleeping all the time when your off, this is the job for you.. Some days can be very heavy physically as well. But every now and then you get a nice normal day of work."
good,Working for the customer. It wouldn't be a bad place to work if some of the managers went petty. a lot of things that could be prevented won't if they were the leaders instead of in the mix.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Overall good experience great people to work with and excellent schedule great management team and employees work as team
good,"Were'nt consistent across the board in pay for everyone doing the same job, regardless of seniority.Not a lot of opportunity for avdancement"
good,"Work 9-10 hours a day. Tasks included shop work, as well as road calls, and some compactor repair. Most enjoyable part of the job was    keeping the drivers happy with my repairs."
good,"very busy, day goes very fast, you learn a lot of different things every day, a lot of turn around in workers, it has a good work schedule"
good,"Typical call center. Answer phones, answer emails, start and stop service.  The coworkers are either great or terrible, and supervisors are lazy.  No consistency between employees because there is no quality assurance team."
good,"Going thru numerous management changes, is making it difficult to know the direction we are supposed to go as a supervisor in the division."
good,Managing all sorts of different people enabled my team to look at operation in many various ways. Working as a team created a winning attitude and success that made us a better service provider
good,"A typical day was demanding because most of the time was out doors in all types of weather. Inspections and tank levels needed daily monitoring no matter what the weather would bring. Operating heavy equipment and developing employees were a challenge, but also had personal fulfillment."
good,It is okay place to work. Lots of big corporate politics and upper management really isolates themselves from the employees.
good,Family environment with supportive management. Just starting the change management process. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the different scope of the waste industry.
good,Good company with good benefits had some good and bad as with all companies Over all better than average but not excellent
good,"Good work environment, take customer calls to stop and start garbage services. Take escalated calls and billing questions."
good,"Hard to balance between work and home. Long work hours with MANDATORY overtime - working 12 hours or more OVERNIGHT - sometimes 6 days a week (4PM - 4AM). Supervisors would spend too much time nagging at one person instead of focusing on the group as a whole. They have great benefits and compensation is good because of the overtime but when the balance between your home life and work gets a little rough they don't care. The co-workers are great, its the upper management that has the issue."
good,A typical day consists of lots of telephone calls and emails as customers change and cancel services.  Retention is some markets is harder than others.  The hardest part of the job is not taking the customer insults personally.  The best part of the job is the co workers.
good,they have a great company policy but never follow it. Its all about if you're managements favorite and if you click up with the senior employees.
good,The work most of the time is fast paced.  safety is important to this company and there are monthly videos and discussions about safety and compliance.  Most of the co-workers are friendly and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is the repetitive movements and routes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being rewarded with cookouts and catering throughout the year and the monthly celebrations of birthdays.
good,"Great job if you have no responsibilites, no opp. for growth within company. Longs hours and no advancement.Management was never available for concerns or issues. Enjoyed getting paid."
good,4 or 5 am is a typical day. Stand up picking trash off the conveyor belt for long periods of time with 2 15 min(Unpaid) and 1 30 min(paid) breaks in between. Very Fast paced and interesting although some workers are lazy and management doesn't seem to notice.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"The waste and landfill industry is like  an other utility; all consumers need waste services for residential, commercial and municipal waste."
good,"Prospecting, following up with past RFP's, Great co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work Come and start with write and go on road call to repair truck on the side of the road."
good,"a typical work day consist of lots of driving, staying alert and safe. Provide customer satisfaction and creating new cliental"
good,Always on site mostly and at times trying to load and unload trucks
good,work starts at 5am and once your done your route your done for the day.
good,"Fabricating, fixing and maintain vehicles. co-workers were ok. management was good. hardest part of the job is dealing with the smell. Learned a couple of things with Volvos and Macks."
good,this was a great job to work for. management was rocky at times. the co-workers were good.
good,Good place to work. No room for advancement at local level. I do three people's jobs.
good,"Great pay and benefits. Employee safety incentive rewards program and safety oriented workplace. The hours however, do not jive with my family life."
good,"Every productive, always something to learn.  Employees were great to work with."
good,Co-workers excellant work ethic for positons for which I worked overcommitted multitasker.
good,Challenging and fast paced work environment centered around results. It is for the serious work enthusiast who is willing to put in long hours and be largely self-supervised.
good,.Create initial set up accounts for sales department as well as residential accounts. Assist with all billing inquires. Works closely with peers to resolve the customer’s questions or concerns in a timely manner. Responds to and may initiate outbound call to close the loop on general and routine residential and commercial calls. Enters service and route data into computer for billing and route scheduling purposes
good,"At first, this was an fairly great job with great hours, pay, culture and benefits.  But the company has no loyalty to either customers or employees.  So if your looking for a 1-2 year employment, I may recommend.  But don't anticipate this company as a career oriented unless you know how to drink the Kook Aid and keep it down."
good,A typical day was supervising a staff of seven. I learned how to accommodate different personalities. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part was leaving the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming a team.
good,Pretty good jobs outside enviorment good pay not soo bad hours
good,"A day at work consisted of a lot of back breaking, lifting, pulling. I learned how to pace myself and work out in the elements. Management were very by the book. I really enjoyed the people I worked with, they were very hard workers. The most enjoyable part was getting paid weekly and how much"
good,"Typical Day at Work: Driving to customer accounts, picking up containers, hauling them to the correct loction, replacing container when necessary and customer interaction."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"A typical day would be to review the P&L statements and analyze trends for both revenue and expenditures. During the month you would work on your flash projections for management, variance analysis reporting, and account reconciliations. Once completed you would be setting up your files for the next month end, looking at what has occurred so far in the month to see if you would hit your projections."
good,"Great company for location, compensation and job security. Somewhat perceived culture of a lack of respect given to those who have not grown up in the waste industry."
good,A good place to learn new skills and be apprieciated for doing a good job. No nonsense about keeping dead weight workers. It is now owned by Republic Services.
good,"Assisting customers in taking payments, answering billing questions, making sure that we service them properly and in a timely manner. Making sure that if services are missed, we take care of it right a way. Assuring customers that we are there for their needs."
good,"A great place to learn and excellent overhead professional mechanics to guide and instruct extern students. I really didn't enjoy the smell of garbage and insects that came with it, but overall team work was great."
good,long hours. nice place to work. job is hard work. benefits was good. pay also.
good,I enjoy working for republic but do not feel as though they care enough for there employees.
good,"A typical day would be to call customers for payments, some customer call were customer request for payment reminders. I learned that in customer service even in collections, if you treat the customer with respect they are more responsive even when they have to shuffle monies to make their payments. The management was always their to assist if you came across an upset customer. Co-workers were all easy going and very much like family. They hardest part of the job was to hear the hard times people were having. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I could make a payment plan to work for the customer and the company."
good,"This is a decent company. Nothing that is grand, but they are ok."
good,"A typical day would begin with checking landfill gas well to ensure they were working properly and that they were meeting the NSPS standards and also Republic Services standards. My monitoring requirements involved two landfills and almost two hundred different wells and sampling points. I learned a tremendous amount about the rules and regulations set forth by the government for landfills, mechincal experience for fixing equipment, time management, data management and technical report creation. I worked mostly alone unless I had to contact a vendor to perform maintenance that was out of my scope. I enjoyed working with vendors and other landfill engineers because they were full of experience and help."
good,I love doing my job i get along with everybody. the hardest part of the job is during hot weather where i work outside under machines and its extremely hot
good,Great staff of people trying their best. The industry overall is in flux with the economy alot of smaller companies are under bidding the two majors.
good,"The CEO is a micromanager. There is nothing he not aware when it comes to this business. When it comes to every facet in this organization, the executives are there to ensure the business is flowing in the right direction."
good,Hardwork and heavy lifting. Work in all weather conditions. They give out items to insure you are hydrated. Somedays they give out lunch and different items to employees.
good,Good job to have. can be pretty hard at times. you will find yourself very tired pretty often. long hours sometimes. management and supervisors are not always making the best choices but they do the best they can i guess. some things seem very unfair at the work place. some people work harder than others but get the same pay rate as those who barely work.
good,"Most large sites with multiple supervisors have a 9-10 hour day which offers a decent work life balance.  Smaller sites with only 1 or 2 supervisors should expect to work 11-12 hours per day.  "
good,"A typical day of receiving calls back to back. "
good,"It has provided me and my family with a great financial and insurance lively hood. Great vacation time,have grown to have many friends here at republic services."
good,"Republic was a great company to work for but none of the department have anything together anymore, communication is bad and they care more about activity. They over-work their employees."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"If you're single with no responsibilities, no family, and like overtime, this is the place for you. Otherwise say goodbye to your family. Pay is alright, better than most places, but you'd expect that working on trash trucks."
good,Good atmosphere busy at times .  Room for opportunities and advancement.  Must be able to work with vendors and be patient in the process for corporate to approve.
good,"Long work days, poor management communication.  The daily work day was long and tiring for the drivers; it still had a friendly staff.  The management team did not keep employees posted on most policies.  The trucks were in constant need of repair; due to corporate policy, the maintenance shop could not get parts fr; tom local vendors; they had to use one vendor.  This put a strain on truck repairs."
good,"I worked in the call center, taking calls from across the country. Some divisions were very good with communicating information to call center so call center agents would be able to effectively assist customers with any questions(that is if the agent even bothers to read the information the division provides). However, many divisions would not communicate with the call center, leading to repeat calls from customers. Management would try to call but the division would not answer(that was the most stressful part when you have a customer who was promised a callback and even management cannot give an answer).Due to this, and agents not correctly informing customers of pertinent information(fees with billing and service days),CRC II's and consultants got A LOT of repeat calls.  Hopefully the call center and the divisions get in sync soon, or else they will lose several contracts and numerous customers. For anyone that applies to this job and gets it: just be transparent with your customers(don't overpromise), and be detailed in your notes!!!"
good,Constant work flow. Short breaks. Work times change from time to time without prior notice. Management is very one-sided and do not understand demand of job. Benefits are great and co workers are helpful.
good,"You can make a living at this place with benefits but it is stressful, hard work in inclimate weather, either very hot or very cold. Many hours and overtime. The work is hard and dirty but honest. Sometimes too much blame game."
good,"I liked working there, made good friends, but there is no team work whats so ever! I felt that the Management was not up to par! It seem like there were people who worked harder then others but yet the lazy ones were praised more then the hard working ones! I felt like I was never appreciated no matter how hard I worked!"
good,"Had a lot to do, kept busy. Some of the staff was good, others not, but that's typical at most companies. Management could be indifferent at times. Didn't mind leaving."
good,Company went without much management for a while but its now coming together. Every day is a different challenge but when i go hone i feel like I have earned my paycheck. Dealing with temp agencies and people from all backgrounds makes it even more difficult but as stated earlier- you feel alot better once you start seeing the positive changes you are helping to bring.
good,"This over all is a good company to work for depending on your position.  As of late there has been more focus on corporate tasks than on the employees who actually do the very difficult work.  There is always talk about having a good work/life balance, however, nearly every week there is a new process that requires more of your time to complete on a daily or weekly basis.  Often times supervisors and managers work a minimum 60 hour weeks and are still required to work from home to ensure repetitive reports are completed on a frequent basis.  For hourly employees it is a pretty straight forward job.  There are some very tight situations that these trucks get into but all in all if you have a good safe mindset and take your time in difficult situation it's not a bad gig."
good,fast paced and long bad hours. good pay bad hours. no work life balance. managers always stressed. no orginization in upper management. make unreasonable deadlines last minute.
good,"It was a company that paid well but not fairly among others. If you worked hard, you will make less. What I mean by that is that if you are doing well, you will be assigned to specific ques where you cannot sell if you are in that department. Assistance was not always available, no team leads just supervisors that have meetings every 2 seconds. No advancement for at least 6 months in and that is only to next level availability. Culture was nice but just always felt like I was always on my toes. Employees came and left."
good,"start at 6 am. Check with early drivers, make sure all routes are covered. Request tomorrow auto schedule hauls. Start on review yesterdays route, make sure everything was serviced. Start on payroll. Dispatch same day service when sales or customer service sales that way. Check on hours worked per driver. Close route sheets in computer. Driver check in as they finish their route and come to yard. Make sure DVR is filled out properly"
good,"With the many changes the call center is experiencing the employees are certainly suffering with the inconsistent expectations set forth to employees. For one training class of 30 plus that all started on the same days, there had to of been 8 different expectations set regarding attendance alone not to mention other factors of the job. Say what you mean and mean what you say and stick to it. Communication is key."
good,"I can't speak for the entire company just the location where I work, But I want an opportunity to advance in my career and there is no opportunity at this level."
good,"I rather get paid by the hour instead of by the day, because  some of the days are long! You can finish your route in good time, but someone else have problem with theirs, you have to help them. The extra work and the money don't add up!"
good,"The pay while I was there was per day, no hourly. As long as you got your route done, emptied truck at landfill, and fueled and maintained truck each day you went home as soon as this was all accomplished. Left plenty of time for home or a 2nd job at the end of each day there. Had some incentives to stay late and help finish another route. Had some issues with the new management when they took over, but have heard that most of them are gone now. Would go back if still lived in area."
good,"I worked there for 7 years, i really loved my job but the last few years it micro managed way to much. Started treating us like we really didnt matter. No matter how long you were there , u were replaceable... "
good,"If you don't mind the smell of garbage, this place isn't terrible to work. its in fort worth off 121 at the land fill. The work itself can be messy but the employees are fun"
good,"made this job a reason too punch the clock and roll out,the work is as all jobs but the pay scale benefits the package,,trash somebody has to haul it away,,"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,the work was pretty easy if you do know how to weld. They were steady for pay checks and it was pretty relaxed place to work.
good,"High expectation of employees with regard to the number of hours worked. "
good,A typical day stated at 3:00 a.m. and ended around 4:00pm or later depending on road conditions. My co-workers are all great people and I enjoy working with all of them! The most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers happy!
good,Allied has a good mix of work and fun to break up the days. Work with customers non-stop which can be hard sometimes. Sales goals were expected to be met. Great benefits and office culture.
good,I loved working with everyone. Everyone is real kind and works well together.
good,"constint work flow"
good,"Great position for training in computer skills, education in recycling and trash disposal services."
good,I did customer service in this position at Allied Waste. I answered the phones and filled orders. I assisted clients of Allied Waste and assisted administration with whatever the need was at the time.
good,"always working no breaks day go by fast "
good,"productive and busy workplace with great training, nice work environment and surrounded by good people ""customer service related"".  The general public that you deal with can be very rough, offensive and sometimes extremely angry.  Must be able to push aside personal attacks from customers and work through to the goal of completing the call with first time resolution."
good,The best thing it was my supervisor and my team the metrics were terrible they kept changing the best thing about the job was they had unpaid time off during the day. I work in the call center in NC
good,"A typical day at work was dirty and greasy"
good,"Typical for the industry"
good,Drove a sanitation truck on a assigned route to pick up customers trash and dispose of it at the landfill.  Worked with little supervision and was able to run my route the best way I saw fit.
good,"same as previous basically...loved the job, loved the people, loved the work, no problem with long hours and sometimes weekends but in the end there was no loyalty from the company,only me :("
good,Good employee engagement.  Free lunch when safety record was good.  Holiday lunches...employee engagement activities throughout the year.  Annual employee picnic with many activities for the entire family.
good,Your job description changes every year and with it your yearly compensation.  The company constantly tries to find ways to get the employees to do more while changing the pay structure so that you earn less.
good,Great company if an applicant is looking for challenges and the opportunity to learn various LOB (Line of Business). I have been given the opportunity to learn multiple lines of business which lead to advancement and personal growth.
good,"The atmosphere is stressful, unorganized and unpleasant at the moment. However, management has an action plan in place. The area that I am in doesn't have much opportunity for advancement."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,The other employees are good to work with.  Drawback is that it was over an hour drive each direct to work and back.  Insurance provided was really good.  Job is very repetitive.  Trucks seem to be in good condition.  Management was okay to work with.
good,I was here for a short period of time because it was thru a temp agency but I enjoyed it. I really wasn't there long enough to have any bad experience. It was all positive
good,The location and position I had was enjoyable but also like any job had it's daily challenges.  There are many positions that one person can fill in if you are willing to.
good,"its a job , management is needs to be more on one accord , overall good job good pay , building is nice and they are trying to make it more comfortable for  breaks with the gaming systems"
good,"They had a very good benefits package.  Being such a large company, corporate was so massive you would see changes to your daily routine created by somebody that had no idea of you job and what it entailed.  It was a very dirty job.  If you just want to be a drone, then more power to you."
good,"Generally good company to work for, with good people. Yet, this will likely depend on which branch you work for. As long as you are dependable and work hard there is room for growth."
good,"taking calls non stop with sales, accounting skills, complaints etc"
good,"great benefits and lots of locations. second largest trash company in the united states. some bosses or direct supervisors are really great and helpful, others are not."
good,I've learned that there in another world out there when you are dealing with trash and recycle services. The worst part of my job is trying to commit to a customer that they will be serviced on a specific day and the trash truck drivers do not take care of their work properly. That can make u a little unhappy. The most enjoyable part of my job is my supervisor. I love her. She is an amazing person. She is a very positive person that keep a positive vibe and with that my job becomes lighter and lighter everyday.
good,"In this position I acquired knowledge of the everyday functions of a trash hauler/waste removal company. I had a very full and fast paced work day, always on the go."
good,Very busy company that services a lot of the city. Learned unknown territory as I became familiar with service areas and was able to advance from customer service to operations to sales in a matter of time by working hard consistently.
good,Awesome job. Trash trucks come and dump their trash and we sort thru it removing the plastic from aluminum put the plastic in one area and the aluminum in another.
good,"set breaks/lunches. you can't go late or it takes you out of adherence. unscheduled breaks are frowned upon. "
good,"My Time at republic services was a great learning experience. Coworkers were great to be around and encouraged hardwork, However I was not a huge fan of management."
good,"I think i could've had an outstanding career at Republic services.  However, the lack of direction halted my growth.  I had and still have the tenacity and will to achieve success."
good,Overall the company appears to be a great company to work for. The problem I had was upper management not backing the supervisors in front of their employees.
good,"My experience with Republic was as a New Business Growth rep.  I succeeded in sales skills, but was unhappy with the industry I was in.  I wanted to feel more fulfilled in my every day work life and feel like I was helping others and giving back.  My reason for leaving was just that, however, I do feel my time there was generally mostly positive in that I learned new skills and grew as a Sales Professional."
good,"Extremely busy in the call center. The phone rings from 8am to 5pm. You are rated on your Average Speed of Answer, Abandonment/dropped calls and 80% Service Level. The Fuel and Environmental fees are confusing to customers. One is constantly attempting to save accounts from cancelling due to quarterly rate increases. One must have the patience of Job to work in the Call Center."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Worked through many changes, worked with many great people. Management works hard to keep a positive workforce and to promote within in the company and the Republic way."
good,This is a good place to work. It kept me in shape. But not to happy with the hours of work. You would get paid by the day. So I worked about 55 hours a week and no extra pay for that time.
good,This is a good strong company but advancements in the accounting field are limited unless you have an advanced degree.  Operations jobs are plentiful and do offer a good career path.
good,I had some of my best professional training ever at Allied Waste and enjoyed it.  It was a very competitive office where the only major issue I had was the management pitted all sales Ex's against one an other
good,The company has great benefits and loves to give employees overtime opportunities when it is necessary. Management is always glad to help when the can.
good,this place had bad management when I worked for the but over all great place to work and very family oriented for a company. Decided to go back to old employer
good,"favoritism, but if employees can get past that the pay is excellent! "
good,Fast pace work environment with overall average rating in general. Great staff and fun crew to work with. Convenient location on bus line. Great duration of break times due to heavy physical work.
good,Good work and life balance. Company cares to cross train employees in different departments but that does not mean you will get to advance in your career. Good job for a paycheck but not to make into a career.
good,work on hydraulic problem. engine repairs & PMI oil changes.
good,"Answered telephone and entered customer information for new residential clients, documented complaints, etc.  Management focused on numbers of calls you can take and resolve per hour/ per day. Not great communication between dispatch and customer service."
good,It was a Good place to work .great benefits excellent retirement plan. It was sad the i have a personal problems. And I am not from VA.and it was very hard for me to adapt my self to a new state.if Republic Service.will have a location in Central N.Y i probably been working with them.
good,"The position did take some time to master, however once I better understood the necessary systems to create quotes and record customer information and interactions, the position was mostly about customer service resolution to maintain strong relationships along with driving new sales."
good,I'm working through the temp and I'm trying to get on a worker for the company so I can get the benefits and change up my schedule bc I no the route and I'm fast worker to this type of job. I like but I'm looking for a spot to take over this temp position I got the people skills great communication and good behavior in public. I give my work a 100%
good,"The beginning of my career with Republic was great. I worked their for a total of 7 years, however towards the end there was so much red tape, they are moving into such a corporate culture. You seek an answer from your boss and they don't know because they were never trained to work on the systems you work in, or you need guidance on a situation that maybe doesn't fit into the black and white box that the policies were written for and no one has the courage to make a decision for fear of retaliation. Your manager won't go to upper management for whatever reason and there is no contact with corporate at all. Upper management is quick to shake your hand and smile when they make their once a year visit but they don't really care about you or your performance."
good,"If u are looking for job stability this is the place to work started out very dedicated to employees after each year little to no raises job advancement does not exsist "
good,"Always offer overtime, management wasn’t so good but job itself was good . Fast paced and friendly. Provided what needed . Great pay and good hours !!"
good,"I had a few great managers while I worked for this company. They were pretty understanding when it came to family/work life balance and my job wasn't hard at all.  My manager allowed us to work on our own as long as our job was done.  "
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Republic was a fun place to work.  I learned a lot about people.  The work place culture was mixed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get a customer approved for something that the management was to busy  to approve.  A typical day would be on the phone taking calls and solving problems.
good,some of the management is in the wrong field and is in the position cause they have a degree. just because they have a degree doesn't qualify them for a position
good,i enjoyed driving third / first shift. driving around for commercial trash pick-up. really enjoyed my job there. staying busy out in the area. getting the job done properly.
good,I really like working here but the shifts could be better organized for men and women with families. The hours I work are from 4:30 pm to 3:30 am typically with overtime to include Saturdays. It is tough to work this shift and contribute at home when supporting the company 6 days a week.
good,Enjoy the people I work with Republic Services I love the work physicalness of it the benefits hard work but with good Rewards excellent insurance with great pay
good,Call Center environment with great team players I have learned so much from many people  I really don't have much to say about this job except that management likes to micromanage the team and question everything and don't even read he response.
good,Was an opportunity for learning safety procedures and employee expectations. The most unsatisfying thing about the job was the low pay for a good employee.
good,"Worked long hours and traveled long distance to job."
good,"A typical day starts with a brief meeting and pre-trip of your truck. The days can be light and heavy at times, even though you already know your area it's hard to predict what it will look like until you get into the area. Some days seem very long and you might not get any help with it. The management seem to put lead drivers into a position which they have no knowledge of what leadership means. Now as far as the flaws I can say it is a fairly easy job to have. If the days were shorten, the lead drivers were more helpful and you were given better pay I would recommend it to everyone."
good,Republic Services had a great staff and enabled me to become a better mechanic. The staff was nice and I had everything I needed to complete a job successfully.
good,"Love work there, mangement and office people are great.My co-worker are like family to me.I most enjoyed driving, love to drive."
good,I learned multiple programs in my short stay.  My most enjoyable part was my contact with others within the organization. The hardest part was figuring out what to do next.  Not a lot of training.
good,"Depending on the workers and work load of the day,employer and employees must manage to get done in a timely fashion on that day.Sometimes very stressful but always professional.Management changes frequent and sometimes unannounced. coworkers for the most part productive and good spirited in stressful situations Many daily obsticles so the end of the day is the hardest part as it must be complete.The most enjoyable part of the day is working as a team."
good,Fast paste U have to focus or U will lose a body part such as fingers but overall it's good U get vacation days that's always a plus the hours are manageable
good,"Job wasn’t very bad at all, just dealing with the landfill nastiness. Went through a pair of $200 boots in 3 months and they only help you out with $125 reimbursement. Smelt bad by end of day and touched things that I really don’t ever want to ever again in my life. Wasn’t my cup of tea for sure. Management always forgot about me and I never received my safety bonus at the end of my 90 days. So got screwed out of $500."
good,"Great local team, but corporate seems distant from regional office."
good,had to pre trip and post trip the truck  every day get my sceal and the hardest part of my day was dilling with trifete and the most of all I learned a lot
good,"Great place to make money I get paid around 1,100 a week, I start my shift at 4:45 and I go home by 4:00 / 4:30 pm"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"My typical day at work consist of alot of data entry and problem solving. I have learned team work, liability, trustworthy, and being on time.  The management here is good.  My co-workers are friendly and respectable. I really do not have a hard part to my job, but if i have to say that something is hard, it is the transition and career change that I am seeking. I enjoy enter acting with my co-worker, and helping the customers."
good,I enjoyed the work that I did there it was very rewarding. I really enjoyed helping the customers with there issues and solving them in a timely manner.
good,I felt that Republic Services was overall a good company to work for.  There is lots of opportunity for advancement which I took advantage of.  Benefits were excellent.
good,Good company to work for..lots of different job opportunities. Good wages and benefits. Ive worked for republic services for 25 plus years..republic service is a safe place to work for. Safety is number 1 priority
good,"Open store, set up register, assist customers. Do the day-to-day books. Full-service fuel. Oil changes, rotate tires, wash and detail vehicles. Order supplies. Schedule appointments."
good,Typical shift would be communicating with public and assisting them with great customer service.  Learned to operate computer based cash check out system.  Assisted all customers leaving airport.  Job was easy to learn and not hard to do.  Lot of downtime as you were only as busy as airport flight schedule. Shift hours are not for everybody and takes a while to adjust to late hours.
good,The hardest part part of the job is dealing with the supervisor and some  neighborhood are too nasty and nobody care about your self some extra work everyday with low over time paid
good,My day would start early and end late.  I met with customers.  I drove all over South Jersey.  I got along very well with co-workers and management.  It was fast paced.
good,"Very stressful, constantly adding more work.  Management will give you their work duties until you can't keep up.  Policy states in their  job description that management can add to you  job duties if they feel there is a need."
good,"Lack of long term local management makes it tough to build a foundation on which to work from."
good,"I loved my job and my coworkers, but management and lack of compensation help to bring the job down overall. Eventually it wares you down and you have to leave."
good,"Prospecting new customers so help them get the best value for their waste service needs"
good,"they do not train personnel properly, they need to review and redo their operations for shop and dispatch. They also need to be more hones with people when they hire"
good,Drivers are dedicated and ensure tasks are performed.  Local Management team is dedicated to planning effectively and efficiently to meet or exceed business objectives.  Team is also dedicated to supporting new ideas and processes.
good,"Had busy and long days until I finished my route, learned the importance of customer service, management wasn't  too organized. co-workers were great, Picking up the heavy trash in the sun with a long route ahead of you. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the route done."
good,come in see how much trash is on the line catch up from last shift some workers were great others not but have to handle professionally management liked my work
good,"The people are friendly nice place to work, very boring. No company picnics or holiday parties, low pay, no room for advancement."
good,"The pay is the best thing about the job.  There is no place to go once you are there.  Its a good ole' boy mentality and if your not in the inner circle, you better be happy where you land, because that is where you will stay."
good,Good job fast pace management can use some work but other than that good job. Finish early can possibly go home and still get a full days pay and you only work 5 days Mon-Fri.
good,amazing place to work. training is sporatic at best but co-workers are willing to help. adequate tools provided to perform your job. Supervisors in the mechanic shop are top notch
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"If you are a quick learner, conscientious about time and performance, this may be a great opportunity for you.  Tremendous opportunity for advancement and a fast track for those who meet the mark.  That being said; if you arrive late for work, take long lunches and are not ready to give your best - this is not your company."
good,The work is steady and boring. Management will put you aside if youre not in proper clique. Status was a clear line drawn in the sand. Theres no grey area.
good,Around chemical smells and trash winds clogged up my sinus and I had a sinus infection the whole time I worked there. Even my car filters had to be chaged every 2 weeks.
good,"Job is based on customer to company relations"
good,"at republic services the people there were good to work with, every day I open up in the crew out the departments. which was over 100 employee, I learned can be challenging to work with so many people on a regular basis, but it was more good times than bad. It hard to stay on track when they change management so regularly. I like most of my co- workers, they were good to work with, trying to adjust to new management, talking with employee caching them up to be safe and productive."
good,"Co-workers were great."
good,"whenever customers called infor repairs I was there as soon as possible to repair equipment, most of the time they were easy repairs sometimes there would be harder repairs that took more time. when i wasnt doing repairs on sites I was taking care of preventative maintenance on equipment, painting, welding, or just housekeeping."
good,Good it’s what u make of it..will always let u work and make money. Like any driving job it has its ups and downs but u get out what u put in.. be prepared to work
good,"Worked at republic for 5 years. My family and I got an opportunity to move out of state so we did. I was led to believe that I will be granted a transfer to our new home however with one day left before we were set to leave to our new home, the door was slammed in my face and I was left without a way to provide for my family at our new home. No real reason given... So, be warned! I do wish I was still there working for republic."
good,When I left the company I had more than 5 years experience in different trucks and abilities. And they where starting off new driver the same amount of money with 0 experience. That mad me and a lot of veteran drivers very mad.
good,I have learned the meaning of work we are helping with the recycling. I have never had a bad run in with management. the hardest part of the job is working outside.
good,Great place to work. People are good at what they do their. Keep up and pay attention. The supervisor was my only downfall. I didn't want to go into full depths .
good,Great DM benefits are wonderful close to home flexible with work shift . offers employee safety events to boost moral great place to work overall fun employees
good,"Hard work and no time for error. If you have a family this might not be the job for you. Schedule change not day by day but every 30 minutes. If you don't check before you punch out then you might come in at the wrong time. Always check."
good,this is a great place to work and get good advancement but the pay is not much for all they want you to do. Also you can get promoted fairly easy if you are there every day and on time.
good,"I like it here but I have personal reasons that require me to relocate ot Iowa Des Moines area. I excel wherever I go. I strive to meet corporate goals and normally achieve or exceed those required goals."
good,"Set up new accounts, sell Residential and Industrial Services ex: Refuse services w/recycling. Sell Temp. Roll Off Boxes for house clean out jobs, take payments, order request, data entry"
good,Worked there had no problems. Just some health issue with my appendix...went back after issues were resolved and my job position was filled.
good,I worked for Republic for over 5 years and enjoyed it for the most part.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,It was a very consistent environment but very few areas for advancement. Prefer fast paced environments so it suited my needs well as far as productivity.
good,"Customer service, taking money and mail logging it all . taking 100 plus calls a day."
good,Wasn't giving the necessary resources to be successful. Problem solved on a daily basis in order to get the drivers out on the routes and to get the customers serviced. I learned to be patient and make the best of the resources that you had available. Management wasn't supportive enough. Co workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was not being able to have enough equipment to get the job done. the most enjoyable part of the job was working together to reach our goal.
good,Great place to work but we did not get the training we needed.
good,Days at this company are long. On average I worked 5 12 hour days. The pay is good because of the OT. My time there was unpleasant due to a manager that is no longer there. They offer nice safety bonuses and lots of safety training.
good,"Good company as a whole but management in my region was horrible and you needed to be one of the ""crew"" to do well and not always hassled.  Enjoyed my time with this company but do not recommend the West Texas area if the same management is still around."
good,Standard O&G environment in remote locations. Good equipment with reliable support. Plenty of opportunities to work as much as you desire. There is room for improvement in the training and operating standards area. Zero training after the initial 30 days and SOP's for operating the equipment were sketchy according to our customers expectations.
good,Working at Republic Services was an enjoyable experience.  I was afforded an opportunity to work with all companies.  A typical day included servicing customers regarding disputes with service.
good,"Enjoyable, very corporate relationships. Operations oriented and facilitated. Cooperative management and understanding leadership. Unionized environment."
good,At times this place could be a great place to work with great people to  work with but at times it seems that management and corporate were seriously out of touch in how what they did effected the people in the field.
good,This is a stressful job. There are many positive things about the company. They have benefits for the employees that are worth while. There is very little room for advancement.
good,"Union shop, didn't see the purpose of the union.  Union contract was not good, no raise on year one, year two raise and medical raised and same for year three, so still made the same as year one.  will need to buy some ""shop tools"""
good,"Good place to work, very high paced. Flexible hours and okay co workers. The position keeps you on your toes and it makes you not want to be on the phone all. Customers are very pastionate about"
good,Company overall is a great company with great values. Direct management was ineffective which led to poor morale. Lack of department staffing and skills with no development plan or accountability.
good,"You have to fit in the in crowd, and if you don't they make very hard on you. They pick certain people and create job titles for their favorite people."
good,"This was a good position if it did not relocate to Charlotte, NC...The work environment could be better the customer service place could have been maintained better."
good,I go to work. manager 45 people then I go home. I do qci s check people in check people out the I do payroll the I go home. hard part they add more and more work
good,my career is very important and criticial to me and my family typically speaking ive learned that im going have sat backs but we all fall and we also get back up and now i understand my lack of understanding about my active behavior with the laws of the land
good,"The benefits are good and the pay is competitive but the upper management is out to cover themselves, No room for advancement, and very few paid holidays."
good,This was another contract position but I enjoyed working with some of the employees there. It was not stressful or cutthroat. And the bosses were great.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Working at Republic might be the worst experience i've had. You stand in front of a line that is moving about 20 miles a hour picking recyclables out of people neighborhood recycling bins.
good,"The benefits are great ,however your days can be long depending on which route you get. Most of the equipment is up to date. The pay is average"
good,"Good company to work for except,unfair management,if for any reason they don't like you they'll build a file on you till they get rid of you,even if you go above and beyond the scope of you job description."
good,"Lots of hard working, friendly, nice people.  However lots of change both in direction and staff.  Lots of re-orgs and lots of outside consultants that actually dictate work load"
good,Management could use a little human feelings. i am a hard worker and try to learn much as i can so i can move up in the company..
good,"was able to work independently "
good,"A typical day of work is hot, manual labor, hardest part of job is being up and there at 5 am and not knowing what time you will be off work each day."
good,I enjoyed working there but no room for advancement.  The company did not promote within. The payroll department was not busy.
good,"Repair any and all equipment writen up on the drivers vcr book and run roadcalls if needed, perform brake jobs,driveline repair,electrical repair,and body repair. I have picked up more electrical knowledge since my employment and understand more with the systems we run and overall. The shop foreman is a great man who will listen to ideas and ways to improve production and will also advise ways to better yourself and make your job better. My coworkers vary in experience and we all work together to complete the tasks needed to get the job done. The hardest part of my job would be electrical reapirs to to the constant debris from the garbage and wear and tear on the vehicles, the companys we use have made several changes to improve there wiring harnesses to prevent damage but it's still is a constant issue. The fellowship you get from the people you work with and the guys from other shifts we pick and play every now and then to keep the day moving in between jobs."
good,The people you work with are great. The work day is generally in the range of 7-5 with the exception of drivers and techs. Office is small but welcoming.
good,A typical day at Republic Service was getting with the site manager to see what accounts she wanted me to work on for the day. I would get the accounts updates back to her by the end of day.
good,"Long hours some nights, culture hard to change as drivers are use to things being done a certain way, get to travel a lot to different cities that we service"
good,Ok place to work the management jumps to conclusions before investigating anything. Just keep your nose clean and all will be well. Hours vary season to season summer long hours winter is short hours. Finally got new asl trucks for the trash side of the business.
good,"Working there was good for me, they gave me an opportunity to work full time for them. Work with good management also in good condition. The made sure we were in good condition in the field."
good,Love the workers there hard working I learned a lot there my jobs was doing some of everything from rolloff to running the platform driving heavy equipment to loading and unloading trucks
good,Good job but managers will violate the labor contract and not provide essentials to perform your dutys sucessfully.34 days on my new route and didn't see 1 day all the way through.
good,Great company but our branches office manager was rarely there which left the supervisor in charge and she was horrible. She didn't do her job and any time anything in the office went wrong it was someone elses fault.
good,To stressful of a job no coordination from management same drivers get certain vacations days of during holidays while others have to work equipment is unsatisfactory
good,On the most part the job was great until I transferred it started out ok but after a while management problems  if your not with them your out like me
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"It was a good company to work for. It was very family oriented. We would work long hours with each other, the general managers was connect with us by being involved with us for company picnics."
good,Good place to work. Good benefits. Could have a chance to advance. Flexible hours. Overtime was available. Holidays were paid. At the time they gave safety vouchers.
good,"It was a nice workplace,they put safety first and then everything else.           One of the most important things I've learned at Republic Services was to be a driver for everyone else meaning being a very defensive driver."
good,"Good company to work for if the culture fits. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement, and they allow freedom to make decisions on how to help your clients in the best way."
good,"Republic Services is an awesome company to work for. They have a great safety program and provide all the tools needed to get your job done. The one thing that I had an issue with, is that I transferred to a yard that was ran like a small business. Utilized the ""Good Ol' Boy"" system. It wasn't about how well you did your job, it was all about whether or not management like you. "
good,They changed the way we got paid three times and the time that I work there what happened that was my biggest issue to me it is still one of their biggest issues
good,was a great place to be a technician. being a supervisor changed the playing field. Had I had the chance to do it all over again I would have stayed on the floor as a technician.
good,"Working in the oilfield has its perks......the frustration with republic is that the head folks dont know much about processing fluids, its frustrating when the people in charge have no idea what they are doing."
good,"I like working for Republic "
good,Average week at Republic Services for myself as an employer for three years wasn't an easy accomplishment when it came to getting hired. I gained great achievement at Republic Services earning hard wok and dedication to my job title from waking up at 2:30 am to 2:30 pm . I'm privileged to have learned the ability to succeed in any type of work environment from heavy machinery to technical work such as filling out documents for inventory and computer work for storing documents etc.
good,It's okay but management is for management and they will do whatever it takes to cover their own back and put it all on you even if it's obviously there fault now with that being said I did truly love that job I just couldn't deal with their nonsense and being accused of stuff I never even done they do not care on who they put the blame on as long as it's not on themselves
good,"Each location is dynamic and has it's own culture. However, when implementing different policies and procedures, the Leaders don't do well with the ""Sniff Test"". Many don't fly low enough to find out the impact it will have on employees before implementing. Change is inevitable and will happen, but your most important component in any organization is your people. You have to understand some of the negative aspects some of the change will have and attempt to eliminate as many issues as you can before they arise. "
good,"Too much favoritism in this place. Not what you know but who you know. Met amazing people working 6 years here. However, at the same time, I met a lot of people I wish I didn't. I am only leaving because night shift for me is making me miss out on a lot of important moments in my personal life. And the possibility of going to day shift seems like a long time."
good,"Managing and opening the site that I work. The hardest part was if something occurred I couldn't call anyone because of my hours. "
good,"do not need to worry will always have a good job, steady pay, set hours for first shift and second shift, lots of work plenty of time to break when needed,"
good,Training could have been more inclusive of all of the call types. The overall customer experience is not always top of mind. Some employees are not as concerned about the customer as I am.
good,work here for a long time then new management came in and guys morals went down and now on wanted to talk or be at work.could have been better if it was not a lot of but kissing in office
good,BFI was a fantastic Company to work for as I entered my sales career BFI gave me great training to help me succeed. Management was flexible and listened to ideas to help grow within our marketplace. Hardest part of the job was learning they had sold the company to Allied waste in 1999.
good,"not all advancements are fair many are given on personal relationship levels"
good,"good job, good pay, great schedule. holidays off are Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years. Overtime isn't mandatory but they usually give double time."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,My own supervisor was amazing to work for but when a supervisor of different departments tried to step in things could get rocky. My department just had to let it roll off our shoulders.
good,"Republic Services tries to be a quality employer, but compensation, training and opportunities for advancement are weak and could easily be much better."
good,"A typical day of work consist of over 10 hours of work, Continuous meetings, conference calls and in house problems, limited the time to supervise and ride with the sales team."
good,it is a hour drive to work and a hour home. you put in a 10 hr plus day. the job is stressful because you are expected to do a 2-3 hour service in one hour. you are working on running equipment and trying to be safe about it. They tell you that you are not expected to learned the job in 1 year however you get chewed on when you forget something about the job. you work off a check list that is  not correct of the service you are doing.. the learning curve is massive on the equipment if you are unfamiliar with the equipment. the most enjoyable thing is watching all of the cogs of the landfill come together to get the refuse delivered to its final rest place.
good,"working in the trash business is hard work & long hrs anywhere but this is the better of the company's out there. there big so they can offer decent pay & benefits yet they don,t micromanage to the extent of the other big trash company,s."
good,Yes I enjoy working at republic !I also enjoy the people I work with....I would like to go further there learning all I can about what u do & what I can do to improve the work force....
good,Very long hours a hard job if you not use to hard work and very long hours it's a tough job and supervisor talk to you like your nothing they don't jus get the route done
good,Very competitive industry.  Great upper management required to foster individual growth and overall division success.  Not sure about current leadership team.
good,"This is a great company to work for, however sometimes it's easy to hit a cap in opportunities available. Not always a clear path for growth here in every department. A great place to earn some first years of experience in your career though."
good,"Job is satisfying, just expect a lot of hours working short handed.  Oversee drivers and find ways to keep customer meet customer expectations.  With less hours this would be a great job."
good,"The trash industry is not the most glamorous industry, however it tends to be lower pressure than retail.  I enjoyed working for this industry and would go back again.  That being said, I have not worked there for 5+ years and therefore please do not take much stock in this review as things may have changed."
good,"The work place culture is supportive and well rounded."
good,Customer Service is a fast pace job. You talk to a variety of people with a multitude of personalities. You have to be able to adjust for each call. Knowledge of the organization and the service/product is very important
good,"This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The people that they hire are team oriented. The atmosphere and work environment is competitive, but at the end of the day we all realize we are on the same team."
good,can talk to anyone about anything.  They do as much as they can provide a good environment for their employees.  they are fair and have a really good open door policy
good,"I worked at Allied Waste for 16 1/2 years. My job involved municipal contracts, environmental waste, collections, and commercial sales. I also helped in acquisitions the company went through"
good,"The Leadership staff, takes on the role of extended family, and avail themselves to you, if you take the initiative to share. I truly feel they have my best interest at heart, and will always push me to my potential."
good,The hardest part of the job was the workload. However it was very rewarding when able to assist customers and bring about a satisfactory outcome. The best part of the job was the wonderful co-workers.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Excellent place to work and grow in your career with ever changing products and services designed for the customer of today.
good,"This was a pleasant place to work. The hours are typical office hours, there wasn't anytime I was asked to stay late and the staff is relatively nice. The management is usually understanding and the responsibilities are consistent from day to day. The work load is usually light and the most difficult part of the job is the verification of information which can be difficult at any company."
good,I would like to say republic service is a good place to work and will teach u alot of things bout life like a learning experience with the real world.
good,This position was fulfilling because I was able to meet other people and work in a friendly environment.  I enhanced more skills in Customer Service and learned the business aspects of waste disposal.  I needed more stability and structure in my profession.
good,Republic Services is an exciting and great company to work for.  The company nation-wide (ranked number two) in the waste industry.  They offer many opportunities for employees to grow and advance within the company.
good,"Many co-workers and city officials were great to work with."
good,"As a welder your hours varied greatly, sometimes going in at 9am, other times 3pm. As a PM Tech your hours were 3pm until job complete, sometimes as late as 4:30am. Typical days were spent welding on trucks and dumpsters, or performing an average of 4 PM inspections and all associated repairs per night. The management was average. The coworkers varied, but most were friendly and eager to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job was some of the major repairs to the trucks. The most enjoyable part was everything but the long hours."
good,It was a great opportunity to learn logistics processes and gain experience. Employees and management are easy to talk to and always helpful.
good,"fast past, but a great job overall. the pay is low at start and it smells bad, but the day flys and the smell grows on ya. the supervise push you a lot! they do try to build a friendship and are pretty successful with their employees. the main management at the time were mildly racist. i love running the baler, luckily i was one of 6 people who could."
good,"Spent most days answering incoming calls. Was assigned to special projects on occasion, including data entry and outbound calls. Worked with an excellent team."
good,Good company. Great experience. Great with offering educational programs to better knowledge to advance throughout the work place.
good,"Up early am,report to dispatch for daily assignment inspection of truck,service customers"
good,"A corporate culture without the emphasis on customers, they just numbers."
good,"Early mornings and long hours"
good,"Take inbound and outbound calls from waste customers, received payment, emailed, copied and fax proof of payments. Set up new service; reconnect service, order new and replacement waste receptacles"
good,Allied Waste / Republic Services is a leader in Waste Stream and Recycling Solutions.
good,Great and different work place. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"Day would begin around 7:30am. Once we were all situated we would have a short sales and customer service meeting. As part of the sales team we would also provide customer service to our valued customers. Everyone worked together to get the job done. If I wasn't available I had everyone cross trained so they could handle my client and the same went for myself. I really didn't find any part of the job hard. Challenging maybe! The most enjoyable part is seeing a satisfied customer, knowing that you where able to satisfy there needs and concerns"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"I have learned a lot working for this organization, i've been able to develop a comprehensive understanding of Accounts Recievables."
good,Republic Services is a good place to work and I have learned much about the sales process.
good,overall Republic Services is a very good company to work for.Very good pay.
good,"starts at 5am and ends anywhere between 5-10pm"
good,"repaired containers, took inventory of containers, repair trash trucks and roll-off trucks. good management. supportive co-workers. hardest part of the job was obtaining material for said repairs. great learning experience in fabrication."
good,"good pay and benefits, country setting, not by any big cities"
good,"Started as temporary worker, hired as full-time permanent worker after a year as they went through a transition of leadership."
good,"This job is generally easy going with the same duties everyday.You must know how to navigate different websites to find information about vendors, to call them for records."
good,"Working in waste management services, you will always have a job. Trash will always be around."
good,It was a good place to work until I got a job that paid more and a chance to move closer to my children.
good,As a driver the job was very demanding. There were a lot of good people there. The hardest job physically i ever had.
good,"a typical day of work would be answering billing questions, answering and directing all incoming calls, filing, reviewing contracts for keying errors, establishing and keying new residential customer accounts."
good,Picking up hazerdased waste in the city of broward county and takeing it to the dump.
good,"If you have never worked within the garbage industry, it is very difficult. However, there were many team members that were very helpful and some that weren't. Overall it is not a bad company to work for at all."
good,Great place to work temporarily.  Safety always a high priority in their eyes.  Flexible hour if as needed.  Room for advancement after 60+ days of work.
good,"They will work you to death for $13. You will not advance here at all, other workers will make sure of that. The work environment is very toxic and will stress you out"
good,Fast-paced environment requiring full attention to detail and safety. Work life balance is sometimes a struggle when attempting to service all our customers in a timely manner.
good,The bosses are great especially the night shift supervisor.  He was very understanding of women in the industry and did everything he could to assist me in getting used to an environment.  One that lady-like ladies aren't used to...  that would be me.
good,"No raise on pay rate,frustration, and constantly short of employees. Not proper and enough equipment to work with. Very unsafe to work in that type of enviroment. Alot of problems that should be solved."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Good company but lacking in benefits that other companies invest in such as tuition reimbursement, maternity and paternity leave, childcare options, volunteer days, and facilities that make an employee proud to work for the company."
good,"a very fast paced work environment and safety driven company."
good,"Republic is a great company, but there are some things they can definitely adjust to accomdate their employees. Salaried & hourly employees should be treated the same."
good,Good place to work. Management rolls stuff downhill and no takes accountability for the faults. The supervisors throw each other under the bus to save their own hide.
good,"Actively building a contact center for customer service. Lots of opportunities in the customer service area, drivers, mid management, including the Landfills and Transfer Stations."
good,Great place to work. The hours can and will be long and depending on how far your yard is from your house it can be very exhausting at the end of day.
good,"I enjoyed my job and most of the employees.  As Dispatcher I was challenged daily to get all done, which was quite a bit in a day.  I have learned to do things the right way the first time.  Culture was great, I learned many things from diversity of drivers.  Hardest part of the job was the constant changes in policy and having to constantly cover others errors.  Most enjoyable was the growing friendships of 14 years with my drivers and their families."
good,"Working for Republic Services was a great experience,  it gave you opportunity to self assured,  taught you how manage your time . Pay could have been better , over all not a bad company too work for"
good,"My overall experience was a good one, I was with the company for almost 9 years. Worked in management most of my time with them. I worked in a few different departments in customer service. I did not like the way I am leaving the company but I know I left doing and giving my best to make a differences.."
good,i worked on a garbage truck and it is not for the feint of heart. lots of honest hard work and very labor intensive. the job involves early mornings and hard work all day. while its hard work its something to go home and feel proud of at the end of the day. as a civil servant you are treated with respect and admiration by the community and there is something truly special knowing you doing something for them
good,each day may have something different. There is not a lot of pressure and no micromanaging. Nice place to work if advancing is not high on your list of goals.
good,"I don't always agree how contracts are placed with customers and how they are treated in the future, i am not able to keep the customers i sell and this is an important part of the business and future sales"
good,This is a great company to work for that has really good benefits. Unfortunately as the company grew their value of their employees decreased. I missed the old days where employees were seen as people and not disposable.
good,"Spent alot of years here. Was a good place to work, but time consuming. Very good shop, and equipment. Good training, and work advancement. Can easily spend many years here."
good,"Work for 8-12 hours just pulling security, doing surveillance and reports every hour, and have to be at the gate waiting for the employees to arrive for work"
good,I worked at both the local and national level for Republic and found them to be the best of the national waste contractors. The corporate office eventually imposed too much control over field sales people so that rates and contract terms could not be adjusted.
good,"I loved working at Republic Services. I think they are a great company, and do great things for their employees. My reason for leaving had nothing to do with the company as a whole, but more because of a manager who had personal issues with me and took them out on me during work. It got to the point where she was causing major issues with my job, so I took the opportunity to leave my job, and go back to school."
good,It was nice working with the mechanics on the trucks and order parts. It was so much paperwork and imputing on the computer I was finding my self behind schedule!
good,veryfast paced and hard work generally working along side a driver in an truck collecting waste sometimes helping the driver to backup and directing traffic
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Truthfully some other Guy usually got to do part of the job that I thought was mine which did hold me back.  The H R that sent us temps and new hires were usually clueless in terms of matching skills and attitudes to the work environment which was outside in the environment. Rats and rattlesnakes are included and this should be stressed: You kill your own or don't work outside AT A DUMP. In Tx they should be using TWC and/or the ADP pay card so that they are not limited to labor ready drug heads.
good,"I clock in and am working hard by 6 AM every morning. I start taking calls at 7 AM regarding anything and everything trash related. Whether it be late trash pick up, placing orders for customers who need to rent containers, special house pickups , answer billing and general questions and even training new employees. Everyday is a hectic and busy environment but I always excel in keeping up with the workload and even volunteer for overtime."
good,"This company was a very nice place to work, I enjoyed all of my co-workers, and we had a management team that understood that the drivers are the backbone of the company. The benefits are good and the trucks are well keep for there age. Republic services culture is SAFTEY. They are always making sure to keep that at the top of your mind. I am sure that was the reason that never had any accidents while driving for them."
good,This is a good place to work.  There is lots of Corporate game play and rules that come down from the top that must be followed locally that don't work all the time.
good,"Allied Waste was part of a merger with Republic Services, Inc. The company overall is a great place to work if you are seeking benefits and advancements in specialized fields. However, having the ability to exposed yourself to various aspects and/or areas of the business would be beneficial as far as creating self value to the company and creating potential opportunities.The culture is highly focused on safety and a positive customer experience that differentiates the company from competitors. "
good,"Very busy all the time. Management is great, fair."
good,"It was all about the customers before safety. But when you got injured or in an accident, then it was all about safety. Pay and benefits were pretty good. Management didn't care of dangers and tell you to get the stop anyway. They always changing stuff and expect too much."
good,"Very good company to work for, good pay with ok benefits. Very demanding company and expects a lot out of their employees. As a supervisor I was expected to work long hours and sometimes 6 days a week."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company until there were 15-18 hr days 6 days a week. Asked them to hire more people and try and limit the ot  only to be told no, they were not willing to work with me at all."
good,"A typical day at work is handling heavy inbound calls, setting up /canceling services using clark county records for verifying ownership,  Answering inquiries regarding renting roll off dumpsters, setting up empty and returns of dumpsters."
good,"good job, flexibility, caddy office workers, perfectionism is almost required. lots of diversity, take long time in making ANY decisions"
good,"The co-workers were the best part about working for this company. We have a fantastic team where you are surrounded by love. There is some gossip from upper management in different departments. customer services is extremely strict and is a tough environment to work in. As long as you have dedication to work and passion for what you do, you will be set."
good,fun work place did a lot learned a lot everything from diesel motor over hauls and diagnose of the issue lots of electrical experience from this job re did plc boxes witch control the hydraulics.
good,"Republic Services is an industry leader in U.S. recycling and non-hazardous solid waste. Through our collection operations, recycling centers, transfer stations, landfills and landfill gas-to-energy projects, we focus on providing reliable environmental services and solutions for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Republic and our 32,000 employees believe in protecting the planet and applying effortless solutions to our customers’ recycling and waste challenges."
good,"Atypical day started at 0145"
good,"great bunch of guys to work with hours were great, fast paced and great workout environment learned a lot about sorting plastic and the different kinds"
good,"The company itself has great potential.  We are the largest waste and  recycling hauler in California.  Typically I would deal with service issues (missed pickups, damages to property) or lower competitive bids.  My job would be to maintain the business through my personable relationship and swift resolutions to customer concerns.    Because of my ability to swiftly handle customer needs, I often found my self probing for additional business from satisfied customers. I learned to follow a ""T"" cold call approach with each account I would visit.  This approach - knocking on the doors to the left, right and behind the client - allowed me to put up numbers that would rival most new business reps.  My co-workers often praised me and my efforts.  As a division were often in competitions with neighboring divisions and often won because of my numbers.  The hardest part of the job was managing the size of the portfolio given.  I was responsible for over 1,200 accounts.  It was very difficult to make proactive visits while handling the pressing matters at hand.  The most enjoyable part of the job, was enabling clients to become more eco friendly and showing them ways to divert waste from landfill making the world a better place."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Republic Services is a good company that pays well and as long as your driving record stays clean you can make it a career. There are high expectations for productivity and safety is first.
good,"Company morale was good but with a company changeover, job loss and new hire freeze presented tasking responsibilities on others. Not much advancement opportunities. Frequent customer service care training and safety meetings were presented."
good,"life of a Trash man isn't easy. there were a lot of dangers but when keeping that in mind, it was a fun job there was my driver and me the ground man. we would go from stop to stop picking up, and meet a lot of different people. the hardest part of the job was there was a lot of heavy lifting and having to constantly watch your back. but when  cleaning up such a huge area it gave a sense of pride."
good,"Company has a high turnover rate due to the difficulty of the job, and pricing becomes an issue with many of the smaller clients."
good,I enjoyed going to work at 2 or 3 in the morning because it was peaceful. I could get a lot accomplished in the mornings without much traffic to deal with.
good,"Republic services provided a wonderful opportunity for me. The work was fun and the people were amazingly friendly and rather helpful. My initial experience with them was to excel and really learn the job so that I can be effective. Unfortunately, the training provided was minimal and I was left to my own accord to make due with my past experience. This was great but not enough to enhance my position. Although it was a great atmosphere and great people, the abi;lity to get the help needed was hinderd and mostly because we all had a job to do and it was hard to get influential help. Anyways, I give the company a thumbs up and wish them success."
good,"Overall good company to work for, Consistently works on making advancements with programs and processes."
good,6:30 until the Job is complete
good,If you want overtime this is the place. Very dirty job. Co-workers are excellent.
good,Nice stable company with nice perks an benifits for hard workers.
good,"The refuse industry is a difficult pill to swallow at times. Weather conditions, road conditions, and other drivers make it difficult at times to complete the job safely. You always have to be on the look out for potential hazards. This company does a great job or training and teaching their employees about safety and their expected work duties. Unfortunately I was not able to continue my employment with them for reasons I wish to not discuss in detail. I feel I was wrongfully discharged but the decision was not of the local regional management it was a corporate decision. Trust them when they say they have a zero tolerance policy it is exactly that zero tolerance no matter the circumstances that lead to the incident. God himself could cause an incident and they would still follow their zero tolerance policy. I miss this job and the financial stability it gave me while I was employed there. I was on the verge of gaining more responsibility when I was let go. All of my local management team fought hard for my job but Corporate had no part of it. I recommend this company and just suggest that you make sure you never ever accidentally even if it is beyond your control never ever violate any of their zero tolerance policies."
good,"Good place to work, opportunities for advancement were difficult to come by. The pay was good along with an excellent health care package. The equipment was unreliable and that was very frustrating at times."
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits, would like more paid holidays. Wish they paid incentives along with hourly pay.  The work hours are long but time goes by fast on work day begins"
good,"Can be very challenging, depending on assignment and seniority. Various type vehicles, CDL-B required. But once settled in can be great (at times). Comradery between employees can be great. Along with pay and benefits, not a bad place to work...."
good,"I think republic is an awesome place to work,, no comments or complaints what so ever,, they care for your well being there's always work,, the managers have an open door policy it's awesome"
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything taken care of in the time you have. You are always shorthanded and never have all the equipment you need.
good,"A typical day at work, was that I would gather information for the morning meeting and speak out on the state of my department. Review purchase orders and plan the night shift duties. I learned a lot about excel spreadsheets, and how to manage employees. The management that is currently in place are fairly new (lees than a year in place) and do not know that much about the equipment that they are responsible for. The hardest part of the job was that I found it difficult to get the present management to understand the complicity of our equipment. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the employees, training them and taking care of the needs."
good,"Do your work, be safe, good place to work, the trash business is one of the most dangerous places to work but the pay is pretty good, once you get past the smell, just always be on your toes."
good,Just remember its hard its not easy because of the heat not the company THEY are great! Just be careful not to work to slow. They want fast work with all backgrounds. Felony friendly. Temp 2 months then so become apart of the company.
good,Good pay just management needs to be fixed. Late hours. Workers and drivers are great to work with. Bad part working in bad weather. Customers are great on the holidays.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"When 1st started worked well with manager and worked well with co workers."
good,"This is a customer driven company and the days can be long, but overall it is a good company to work for. The company is strict on their safety policies and on their customer service policies."
good,Good company that has offered many opportunities but at times gets in it's own way as they forget who they are.  Are they an IBM or a garbage company?
good,"Early morning start time and long hours for driving in all conditions of traffic."
good,They were underpaid but have since went to an hourly pay which is much better. There is always a wedge between management and hourly employees which I didn't care for
good,"Daily operation of a garbage tuck with different operating PTO functions."
good,some of the management is hard to deal with but other then that the job is not that bad. the pay could be a little better then what it is. also a lack of communication from management
good,I work in a fast paced environment.  I take much pride in taking care of our customers.  I enjoy selling our services to new customers and managing existing accounts.
good,The call center works very hard on their culture.  Some managers are more engaged than others.  The culture in the call center is warm and encouraging. Their communication with the business unit could be improved. The sales department can be brutal and overly competitive.   Sales goals for outside sales are unrealistic.  Outside sales is the hardest job in the business.  Constant rejection and being under bid by local competitors.
good,Republic Services is a good place to work at. The Union there gave the workers great benefits and made sure everyone was happy as so did the management at Republic Services.
good,"This location has gone through so many management changes that some employees may not handle well or get advancements very quickly. The benefits though are more than just insurance and retirement plans. They hold family events, have a tool allowance program, give out safety awards and more."
good,"I believe republic waste services gives employees a opportunity to make a decent wage to survive. "
good,"There's really nothing to say about this company,  besides that they are the biggest trash service company in the US. You can start as a helper and work your way up to supervisor, but that takes dedication and really hard work."
good,The accounting department was a great fun work environment with great management. The work culture could sometimes get tough when having to interact with other departments.
good,"I worked for Republic Services for just over 2 years. In that span, I was tossed between Customer Service, Sales, and Operations.  Wherever there was a need I was asked to go fill in.  While it was nice to be needed, it made finding a rhythm hard at times."
good,"Contacting current clients to maintain a client base.  Managing clients accounts whether its problems or assessing current services to assure client is getting the best services for there business. ."
good,"Pick up residents garbage daily, minimum 300 stops a day. Long hours no lunch break, 4 weeks paid vacation for being there for 20 years. Salary should be higher for being there so long."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Good company to work for. They listen and understand most of what all employees deal with on a day to day basis. Equal opportunity to advance in the company.
good,Weigh vehicles by and electronic scale connected to a computer to determine the weight of solid waste brought to Landfill. Make cash or charge entries into computer. Prepare daily reports and deposits for the Billing department. Keep building and weighing equipment clean. Manage a high-volume workload. Prepare and balance bank deposit. Perform radio communications with site operators.
good,"All in all its a great place to work.  However, the pay grade should increase for the job that we do.   I get to meet different people and work with the community which I love to do.  Everyday is different."
good,"It is an awesome place the company treats its employees great.  I would be welling to return as an employee.  the daily collections quote is 60 calls per day, I've reached 70-80 per day"
good,"Meeting the needs of the customers on a daily basis."
good,great place with a very diverse culture. The hardest part of the job was leaving the company. I loved it here ! but the wages were just too low
good,Over all the short time to work for this company a very typical day at work what you learned is to go with the flow the management was very good the co-worker also work very good team to works the hardest part of the job is learning the new system the most enjoyable part of the job it did not change very much.
good,"I have the opening shift. This begins with filing the previous days manifest paperwork and verifying if other papers were filed correctly. Turning on CB radios and transferring files on the PC. I scale trucks inbound and review their load and verifying all signatures are there to accept the load. There is also coordination and communications with the trucks as well as the operators on the landfill. "
good,Gd company to work for doesnt seem to be an chance to advance in company
good,"Viewing and editing if needed time and attendance records for 150 employee's to prepare for the next weeks payroll run. Maintained and update hourly and salary paid time off calendars. Data entry employee's new hire information, all changes to existing employee's into the HR system. Maintained employee's confidential files.  My boss was a caring generous individual and my coworkers are like family. It was great being part of a working team."
good,"Fast pass to get equipment out to the sites to get them up and running.  Critical to the business."
good,"Check the system for any pickups, schedule the pickups, up-date online route schedule, review drivers' paperwork with they come in, enter data from route sheets into system. run and distribute route sheets for the next day."
good,"I have worked for the company for 10 years and have learned so much while there.  I will miss it. My day to day was filled with many different types of trucks and different types of waste, from recycling to construction to residential and others as well.  I had the opportunity to work with a lot of great people and also customers.  The hardest part of the job was leaving.  The most enjoyable part of the job was how much I learned while I was there so I can take that knowledge with me in life."
good,"Open-Door Management style, empowered to go out and succeed at your job, with lots of focus on driving and personal safety."
good,"Great compensation initially"
good,They have the best Driver training in the country. they provide weekly saftey meeting also after route training sessions to help keep the drivers ahead of the game.
good,"great place, always a steady work flow. have learned about hydraulics here. great co-workers. work requires most of your time. work about 55-60 hours a week in the summer time."
good,Loved my job and everyone I worked with.  Every time you had a question they were right there to help.  I  sad to leave but moved back home.was very
good,As an Operations Manager every day presents different challenges. At any given moment things could go from good to bad when equipment breaks down or employees do not show up for work. I have to think outside the box to ensure the current days work load is complete. I work with some good people and one of the things I have learned is that it takes a team effort to get everything accomplished. The most difficult part of my job is finding time to sit back and get an overview of the days occurrences to be able to plan for the next days tasks.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Allied Waste to say the least was an interesting line of work.Although, the work was disgusting at times (it was retrieving residential trash)i met a lot of interesting people throughout my routes.My management at Allied Waste was good, problem being they went through to managers. Every time i would get used to one there would be a new one.My co-workers although many did not speak English they were an interesting bunch of guys. The hardest part of the job was learning my routes.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the community and being outdoors in the fresh air."
good,"Refab. truck bodies insde out, Learned hydroulics and how to run it, Met some really good fiends til this day."
good,"I have specific training in front line leadership, employee relations, operations management, purchasing, project management, facility management, and working with sensitive information while maintaining confidentiality."
good,i services custermore while driving a front end loader they are agood company to wook for
good,"The days ebb and flow depending on the time of the month, billing and service consistency. Management could be a little more inclusive, and open with situations. Work load is fair."
good,Republic it's a good place to work for if your a worker.... company treats you fair they have decent benefits management team is okay. Marietta Division.
good,Money decent and good benefits job security location decent great retirement plan health benefits affordable and job environment safe work 6 days if you decide too but not required
good,"Seems as though when down to the wire, bailout was last resort. Company lost contract and employee gratification came to a stand still and management abandoned the crew."
good,A typical day is overwhelming most of the days! You must have the ability to be  problem solver and a negotiator to pay invoices in a timely manner. The supervisor and co workers are helpful in helping you to success. Supervisors notice your hard work.
good,I really enjoy the people who work in my territory. The atmosphere and team I get to work with are a really great group of people.  You get to work for a large company and get the perks that come along with it without it feeling like you are just a number.
good,"A good company to work for.  However, I did not want to relocate so upward mobility became challenging. The corporate office is in Phoenix and I wanted to stay in Houston."
good,Republic services in Texas was a great place to work. Safety is very important and training to complete your work load was always provided. The management were always there to lend a hand and help you to better understand the job process. The supervisors and co workers are courteous and professional.  My experience with Republic Services Tucson was just horrible no leadership no training and no team player skills. Very unorganized and no professional leadership or skills. I  do not recommend Republic Services of Tucson.
good,Good place to work. Ability to work remotely and make your own schedule. Autonomy and the uncapped commission plan. New business is pretty hard to garner
good,I was working there for an amount of time it wasn’t that bad to work there but the salary wasn’t that good to take care of you and your family.But thanks to republic services.
good,"When i was there the management wasn't doing the workers right but. now that the change has been made in management they have gotten better.they still need better equipment"
good,I have seen many supervisors and GMs come and go which have made it frustrating as a driver because of the constant turnover . I have expressed my desire to move positions away from driving but feel that the ladder to move isn’t clear.  The introduction of cab cameras have made it less desirable to work here because management  will micromanage from the computer and write up drivers. They should be out in the field and talking to us . Maintenance has never been great. Trucks down for small issues because common parts are not in stock and also poor quality repaid sometimes from the shop.
good,I think you should be a little more lenient with drivers sometimes a job can to be very stressful just my thoughts but i wish i was still there. When I was an employee I wasn't given a chance to keep my job not to blame anybody but myself but I wasn't given a chance or even a commitment letter after 6 years of service I was angry. And then come to find out that the general manager was under investigation and was terminated and was free
good,"Republic offers competitive compensation. They believe in safety before anything else. They provide all uniforms, boot allowance and safety gear. Trucks are kept in good repair."
good,Manager catered to younger generation.    Manager recruited from previous employer instead of promoting with in.    She fired one girl to hire on another young girl from her last job.     She played favorites
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"My work was interesting with good variety and the ability to learn about emerging environmental technologies. I really liked the staff I worked with and thought the organization did a good job promoting a positive work environment. The benefits and additional perks provided to employees were very good. On the negative side, the Supervisors and Managers are under tremendous pressure to maintain compliance with H&S and environmental regulations and be profitable without receiving the necessary capital or support from Corporate."
good,Some policies changed for the worse over the time of me being there-seemed as though changes would take place almost monthly and sometimes not for the good-pay is good though
good,Good benefits The drivers are great!  Small office in Corsicana and management lets the females (there are only 3) but the two with tenure bully the third.  They run the place mamagment is a joke as far as the office.  These women are  horrible and will team play they are the team the third person is on their own.  Good luck if your’re a female a male may have a chance.  A shame because it is actually a good comapny just a vad experience in the Corsicana office.
good,I had an 11 year career and enjoyed what I was doing. Seemed they did not want to promote at the location you were at. They wanted you to move and get promoted. Love the direction the CEO was taking the company but local management was clueless about real on the street operations. I worked with a lot of strong team members and would recommend this as a place to work if you want a stable career with out advancing unless looking to relocate.
good,Great place to work.  Enjoy the development opportunities.  Could use some improved training programs.  Work life balance is not always followed as strongly as it is promoted.
good,"Most of where my Collection Manager experience is from.  Constantly busy and the days went fast."
good,no information at this time. I do not wish to do this review at this time.i worked for this company for over twenty years that says it all.Teamwork all teamwork.
good,"You report in for work with gloves, hard hat and safety vest in any position that requires you outside the office. These gloves would be replaced quickly if holes appeared in them. You line up on a conveyor belt and pull certain material off the line, but all positions have a safety e-stop to cut the line if you see a danger. Despite a rather high turnover rate, people are kind as long as you work hard. At times groups would be sent down to the floor to sweep up random material that falls from the machine, often when there had to be a pause due to a quick repair."
good,Great leadership but there are manual processes that take up too much time. The metrics in place are not easy to be met within a 40 hour work week. Management is working towards getting things corrected but most of the employees are overwhelmed with their work load. There is no vision to add additional roles to alleviate the work load.
good,Good place to work and to make a career. The thing you will have to get use is the smell which can be tolerable. You will defiantly want to have a wide variety of tools including hand and power. Also have a wide variety of sockets from 1/4in to 1/2in and 1/4 to 1-1/2.
good,The work was fair. The yard was very big and had a lot of trash. It was my job to pick it up before my shift was over. There were also four other people working with me as well.
good,"Kind of hard to comment as I was there when it was Sunset Waste.  The sales manager was great, the call center manager was not.  Overall enjoyed working there with the exception of the call center manager."
good,"If you can get past the lack of training, it is a wonderful place to work.  Very fast paced job.  Management is not the greatest there.  Lots of corporate structure."
good,"I was only a temporary worker so it is hard for me to be judgmental.  I don't have enough time there to make a proper assessment. There seemed to be a friendly atmosphere.  There is lots of drivers.  I was looking forward to one of those positions, but is unavailable at this time."
good,"A typical day at Republic Service was making sure all routes are covered and all containers were dumped. I learned the true mean of team work. The culture of the work place was very pleasant. The hardest part of the job were co-workers causing conflict. The most enjoy part of the job was the team-work Front load driver shared with each other,"
good,"Buena empresa ,pues permite a los empleados estudiar"
good,This is one of the best companies to work at if you wish to find somewhere to get an entry level position and be able to move up quickly. They love to train within.
good,Benefits and compensation are one of the best.  Rated 2017 employer choice of the year.  Room for advancement.  Great executive leadership.  Would work for again
good,Hard work but provides satisfaction that you know that you did a good job. Great management team that allows you to run your business without much interruption.
good,"The company is great but there is so much restructuring done, it felt unstable.  You never feel secure in position.  The company does try to promote within."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,A great company invest deeply in employees work experience . provided tool to train you in a successful position with opprottunity of advancing with in the company
good,"Back-bone of the sales department aiding with all sales functions.  Never the same day twice.  Requires strong computer skills, good written and verbal communication skills and a willingness to help."
good,"Never a dull moment, fast paced change environment.  I had the same title for the past 9 years, but never felt I had the same job from one year to the next."
good,"-Prospecting new customers and managing current customer"
good,A typical day is a very busy from the moment you walk in till punch out. I have learned the hard work does pay off and that the customer comes first. I worked with a great sales team.
good,A good company to work for. Pleasant group of employees.  Good benefits.  Great company events that encourage employee and family participation.  Pay scale is in line for industry.
good,This job is good paying but the management is horrible. The work to home ratio is pretty good. Some days are long days and some days are shorter. Most of them dont appreciate their employees.
good,"I like my job but there are no advancement opportunities. Job security is not a given anymore. I have good people to work with and management and I work well together.I would like to retire here but I have to look to my future. The only downfall is that I can't leave the office for lunch or take breaks, have to work most all Saturday's and it is hard to get someone to cover for me when I want to take days off."
good,"Reviewed drivers logs and made sure billings were correct.  Input drivers loads, times, trucks, etc."
good,"They try to make it a fun environment, and also try to accommodate each employee. They try to help with what they can and give you feedback on your work."
good,"Pre-trip you truck"
good,"Working with BFI taught me the benefits of driving and customer service corresponds. The company aloud me to advance to lead driver. (As a woman). For that privilege, I am grateful."
good,"Graveyard shift would start at 4:00 PM and typically end between 3:00 AM and 4:30 AM. I learned a great deal about waste management and the industry's role in sanitation. Management in the maintenance department was fantastic and my manager was a stand up man with a phenomenal work ethic. The team was very accommodating in regards to the employee's life/work balance. It was expected that every person was to honestly perform repairs and inspections to the best of their ability and adhere to a fairly rigid standard. The maintenance team was a great group to work with and were quick to help with any task. Working on garbage trucks was a learning curve and required the employee to develop and iron stomach in order to perform inspections and repairs. This is the simple truth of the industry, but shouldn't deter anyone attempting to seek employment in waste management. I feel the most enjoyable aspect of my position was the great atmosphere of co-workers and management I was surrounded by. I highly recommend Republic Services as an employer."
good,The company is a futune 500 company so when they took over it turned into a great place too work it went from kaos to kick-back and fun with regular safety meetings and customer appreciation bbqs. Tauhgt me alot about building not just a company but a successful company
good,Republic Services was my first serious job. I gained some much experience dealing with difficult customers and employees. Even though the company has job security and pays well it is a dead end job.
good,"Dispatching for Industrial line of business, assisting other departments through the day. Data entry for end of day completion. Learn the workings of all lines of business with the ability to crossover when needed in all lines of business."
good,"good place to work, good pay lots of overtime available many job opportunities. employees are helpful and friendly. management willing to get out there and work the same job as you."
good,"Team was great, I will miss them, Good Hours and management was caring and supportive. I would recommend this company to work for. Family friendly atmosphere."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Was a good but weather plays a big part in hours worked . MANAGEMENT is okay. Learned how to deal with different job site conditions. Dealing with contractors. Working outside and going different places every day
good,"I love love loved my co-workers- we had such an amazing team. Pay and benefits were great also, if my scheduled would have been able to be adjusted I would have stayed,"
good,"Positive environment to work under. I learned to work as a team and be more productive. At first the job is challenging because of the different lines of business and different cities, but once mastered it's fun and relaxing."
good,Typical day is in and out of landfill 6-10 times. Laid back atmosphere. Pay could be better but benefits are good. Safety is very important at all times!
good,"A typical day was handling a customer, that did not get their trashed picked up in time or at all!"
good,Company vaules employee's and respect every employee they have. My only issue is raise and promotions to current employee's there is a very small annual raise and it doesnt even cover the cost of living increase each year.
good,Very busy I always was learning something new and never a dull moment. Other drivers and management were very nice. I was always able to get out on the road very fast when I clocked in.
good,"Had a good time, but the lack of resources of personnel made it hard to retain good people. The company tries to hire people who have some technical back ground but end up getting less then desired people to work for them."
good,"customer service for garbage pick up. had to keep the customer satisfied to secure accounts. drivers help and was very knowledgable of route.the hardest part about this job was that these were backdoor clients.but when duty calls, one must do what one must do."
good,"Great benefits, typical vacation offered, fair compensation.  Management turnover seems to be fairly high at times, which creates a challenge when trying to understand the company's vision since there can be quick changes in leadership."
good,Drivers and staff are wonderful great place to work/ Hardest part is the long hours. You build great relationships with staff pay and benefits are good. I learned to be a great team leader if you want to be a driver company provides great training
good,I love driving and dealing with the community. I would have a route to complete I had a helper also witch made the job much better.
good,"Very good work place,but same of the bosses not to good.co-workers are cool to work with."
good,I work in a call center to a typical day is taking inbound calls from customers all over West Michigan. I also respond to all the incoming customer emails. I am also data entry part time so my afternoon consists of entering orders from our Door to Door Sales team and processing prepayments.My co-workers are what have kept me at Republic Services so long. We are like a big family and we always help each other out when needed. The hardest part of my job dealing with irate customers. I am very good at turning around the situation however it can be quite the challenge. The most enjoyable part is interaction with customers and knowing I can make positive impact to their day. My Manager has always supported me at work and my future career goals.
good,"Challenged to grow organization and control costs while providing excellent customer service.  Greatest challenge was to make sure equipment was maintained and reliable under tight budget constraints.  Employees were great to work with on a daily basis as they were hard working, caring and driven to succeed.  It was great to see the Division improve and a culture develop where everyone cared and enjoyed coming to work!"
good,"Coming in with a positive attitude.  Report to supervisor before shift began.  Perform pre-trip and post-trip inspections to ensure safety.  Co-worker interactions.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was maintaining safety for me, co-workers and customers."
good,Very exciting industry with many working pieces.  Company has many knowledgable people and offers tremendous training to the people they bring on board.
good,A typical day at Republic services is never dull and far from typical. It's the kind of work environment that is very gratifying and exciting. The challenges in many of the repairs keep it fast pace and fun.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,I really like the customers and enjoyed meeting with them I had a very good relationship with the customers and the service that they required at Republic Services.
good,"My typical day at work would constist of answering calls about customers garbage services, ranging from missed pick ups to paying their bills."
good,in at 5:00 off at 4:00 every one got along was a family atmosphere
good,"Assisted other drivers on routes, Collected trash daily from residential areas, Operated truck mechanisms for loading, compressing, and dumping garbage, Able to perform pre-trip and post-trip inspection of vehicle, Able to read route maps with use of coordinates and use of GPS for directions, Follow all safety procedures, Maintains accurate records of pick-ups daily. The hardest part is working in all four seasons. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I have a steady job."
good,"Most enjoyable part was , my co-workers, they were happy to be there, there were excited to come to work."
good,"As night shift supervisor always worked over 60 hours a week. Had over 80 hours in a week twice.  Needed new A/C equipment."
good,"Winter sucked, hours were cut, didnt make enough to cover expenses so i left. the people were great managers were great, the only reason i left was the commute to and from work was long and with the cut hours in winter it just didnt pay enough."
good,"Job security.   Garbage is not going away.   Not a huge amount of people in the field.  Too much work for the few employees that there are, then when you take vacation time you’re extremely backed into the next month."
good,It was a good place to work. I learned more skills there. I enjoyed and got along with the people that i worked with. I worked on the garbage trucks; it was a smelly job but i enjoyed a job well done.
good,"Not paid enough money to live on. Low raises per year, got 21 cents last year. Arizona is a right to work state, so they can pay you low pay. If you work in Nevada (right over the bridge) you can join the union and make decent money."
good,Republic Services has an excellent Safety culture and is driven to succeed in both customer experience and efficient operations. I was both challenged and encouraged by a mentoring leadership team.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this company, it's very busy but you feel fulfilled by the end of your day. You're constantly communicating with other departments and customers which ultimately leads to the customers satisfaction."
good,Work is for reclamation/ sortation so if you don't mind the dirt and odor it's a good fit. What drew me to this was the recycling aspect of the job I am a firm believer that we all need to do our job to reduce the carbon footprint.
good,"My experience with Republic Services so far is average. I am consistently busy, but not challenged. In my location, there is not a set guideline. I know what I have to do and as long as it gets done I am good."
good,"From entry level to upper management, all levels of advancement are attainable and achievable. Training on specialized equipment ranges from proper time schedule to rushed depending on the requirements needed for any position. Was promoted from entey position, evaluated within a timeframe, and given promotions and pay increases. Was recruited by upper management into a management role and given full range of training and ability to perform on my own with little oversight. Compensation plan was fair and work environment enjoyable in management role."
good,Republic Services was more a customer service company but now it seems as though the customer is not so important. The company is a good company to work for but could be managed better
good,Good place to work great hours. Just hard to move up in the company and it took over a year to get a raise. Sometime work was real slow had to leave early
good,Overall a very good company to work for. Many challenges and fast paced with the occasional lag time. Everyone gets along fairly well. I would recommend republic services to anyone who wants to get into the trash industry.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"I would very much like to stay but school is not allowing me to work full time. Love my coworkers and job is not too difficult. We could eat at our desk, we get paid time off, company allows you to miss and is lenient about tardyness."
good,"Good job good people just need something closer from home , driving 40 min there and back takes a toll on me especially during winter season ........."
good,It was a great job overall it's just the position that I was in they didn't want to give me more in salary and I have been there for 12 years. They will work you pass the time that you are scheduled for.
good,Good place to work but no advancement opportunity . I generally enjoyed my time working there. Felt like a number and easily replaced.. not alot of positive feedback
good,the drivers are all friendly and the company is a great place to work. It is alot of date entry they are a little behind times with the technology.But overall; they are a good company and seem to care about their employees. They try to to different things within the company to show their appreciation
good,"fast pace company good enviroment to work refuse trucks are hard to work"
good,"Company is trying hard to be greater than WM.  Just be sure the management is not looking to just step all over you to get to Phoenix.  But if you find that good division, they will help you succeed."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"Fun workplace to work with a lot of issues with in the company , all the equipment is jacked up , lack of communication and i been lied to quite a few times"
good,"I enjoyed working for Republic service, if nit for personal reason I would still be there. My supervisor was very helpful and very helpful. Wush I could go back there."
good,"team environment"
good,"The call center is undergoing a major call center change process, which is critical for managerial success and the professional development of for frontline employees. while there are challenges with any large call center, the forecast is bright for this Customer Resource Center"
good,"Scheduling meetings and travel accomodations"
good,Republic Services has given me the opportunity to operate multiple sites with increasing responsibility.  I have managed all aspects of the business unit from A to Z.
good,"I had my time there to learn more skills and knowledge..There's very long hours but it all pays off at thee end,the security there is not that well but overall great job."
good,Some tools such as diagnostic software is not available which can make things very difficult to troubleshoot and diagnose. The service department employees were very willing to help out with all jobs. This is a fleet shop so you will be able to learn about your drivers whom are actually your customers.
good,Garbage industry is what you make of it.  work hard and you will succeed. Be a slacker and you go nowhere. Its hard work some days and easy on others.
good,"Lots of variables depending on the time of the month, collections  and  updated billings went out at end of the months so it was a little bit more pressure. The difference between the states and taxes was a bit crazy as each state is different. Big change in management when I left but still good place to work. My co workers were the best part of my day."
good,"Good job when properly managed. Excellent benefits such as paid vacation days, personal days, holidays, 401k, etc. Hourly pay is good. Very stressful setting though."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"I have many job opportunities with this company over the years. You can go as far as you would like with this company. The company has changed hands since I left, so I am unsure how it is to work there now."
good,I really enjoyed working with my manager. The work/life balance was great. My department was probably the exception to the rule. The disappointing thing was there was not a lot of room for growth and it appeared it was easier for them to hire from the outside rather than promoting from within.
good,"You arrive early every day. your responsibilities include a pre inspection of your truck and equipment, also coordinating your route. during the day you can expect to encounter many customers, it is important to maintain a positive working relationship with all. then you drive your route safely and efficiently as possible. you must come into the day rested and focused. do your very best to be independent but ask for help if needed. co workers are good go to people when you need advise so a good working relationship is a must. Then at the end of the day post trip and any necessary must be completed and then see you tomorrow!! lol"
good,Great place to work and advance in a career. If you work hard and show up for work every day with the intent to do your best. If you have a positive attitude with management and your team. You can go far at this company.
good,"enjoyed working there as a temp. people were friendly, and helped if needed. had your own space to work in."
good,Driving a commercial motor vehicle can be very mentally draining when working long hours 5-6 days a week while working in all kinds of weather conditions. The work was very physically demanding and the work days were long. I did not mind the hard work or long hours but better employment came my way with General Motors.
good,You are up early in the morning need to drink lots of water .The sooner you get to work the better the day may be for you.You go out and do your job with safety on your mind being safe is key.
good,"My place is good to work but I want a better job to make more  money and  I doing my job done respectively  my coworkers ,and respect the policy for my job"
good,Do to the recent purchase of the location i was working on. There is still a lot of improvement to be made especially with management. Other than that it is a great place to work fast pace full of adrenaline plenty of work if you are willing to work.
good,Republic tries their best to keep up the moral but customers make it very stressful and not all supervisors care as much as others. Seeking new employment because I feel like I have more to offer
good,Great place to work and paid well.  Public company so they expect you to hit your goals and if you don't you are out. Higher priced vendor in their market so gaining business is a little tough.
good,They keep you on you toes about safety first. Everyone is helpful and it is seen. Most days the earlier you start the earlier you get off. Uniforms and washing is provided every week. Most weekends off. Paid holidays and vacation and personal time is also given.
good,"This is an excellent company to work. Hard to move up in the company, but the pay and benefits are great. The people are awesome to work with. I would recommend this company."
good,Learned many things working there. Great work environment. Attended many different types of safety meetings. Benefits were great. Real close to home. I recommend working there.
good,"On my way to work every morning, I usually brain storm and think of what I want to accomplish on that day. Upon arrival, everything usually changes with so many moving parts. I've learned to work in an environment that is very fast paced and enjoy it to the fullest. I have been blessed in my career with Republic Services. The management teams have always treated me with respect and have motivated me to continue succeeding. The hardest part of my job has been leaving a team I have built trust with. I've enjoyed my job to the fullest from day one."
good,there are days that can be stress fulll and other days that are laid back very good company to work for they treat you farey and management is very good people to work for
good,simply put you do your job then go home.  if there is an opportunity for overtime it will be offered and you can accept or deny. the pay is great for the work you are required to do.
good,Pay was good but you will be working all the time. Just like any other business there is good and bad. Just deal with it on a daily basis and go from there.
good,"Call center sales environment 8-5 schedule normally.  I learned to work with customers to fulfill all their needs and uphold brand, value, and reputation of said company.  The most enjoyable part of job is the commissions when there was no caps on commissions."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,No complaints. Great place to work. Provide the proper training for employees to do their jobs correctly. Room for advancement and positive work environment.
good,"Typical day would collect residential trash for over 25,000 homes. Its difficult to be an affective manager with a shoe string budget."
good,Great company to work for. All departments have great communication with one another. Very friendly coworkers. This is a company that has advancement opportunities.
good,Very good job they joke a lot at work they are will to train you so employees can move up the pay is very good. the only thing I didn't like long work hours I remember getting off at 5am and I went in at 3pm
good,"A good place to work and learn,had  good co-workers learned a lot, work atmosphere was good,sent you to training often,recognized  when job was done good ."
good,"Worked here 10 years. 5 on  residential and 5 on commercial.  Easy automatic trucks, great benefits and newer equipment. Union shop 8 - 10 hour days on residential and 11-13 hours commercial.  Other big companies pay a little better,  but this yard you'll have a better life style.  You can get done really fast and go home early.  Lunch breaks, good benefits, and OK pay. Management is OK. A few hot heads but what job dosnt. Over all is easy as long as you get the python trucks in residential or your in commercial."
good,"Learned to run landfills and to deal with customers"
good,A work place where I was able to get a look at corporate America and see the future goals that I planned for myself. A great place to interact with very professional and friendly employees
good,It's a great place to work.  The people care for each other and look out for one another.  There is always work to be done and there is never a dull moment there.
good,Can operate all trucks listed at workplace. Company is good to work for. You build muscle while building relationships with other coworkers.
good,"This was my favorite job ever.  Good Pay, No recession in this industry.  Customers are good but helping them get rid of the waste and yet show them how some of  it can be recycled is a teaching job as well.

good,"I begin my day at 8:00 am and end the day at 5:00 pm with an hour for lunch, since I am the only AP person in the Revere location, we have several divisions, I am very busy most of the time the day goes by very quickly.  This is a divsion of the Corporate Office which is in Phoenix."
good,"This was a place that help advance my skills as a leader, without the authoritative position. I had my difficult times but overall as I was learning, and trying to keep up my part of the social contract with the company; I wanted more challenges. This would have to be the only drawback for me; with not being given the chance to advance and be recognized as a person in positional authority; to enhance upon the leadership skills. I fell ill in April 2011 and could not walk or use my hands I had chronic Rheumatoid arthritis. I suffered with the form of arthritis for 5 years before it became chronic. They tried to help me out at work, by letting me park near my truck, until the one day I could not even get dressed for work, this is why I said the job was a secure job/ but advancing opportunity was a motivational factor I needed also. A new drug saved my life called Humara, this is a self-injection medication. I am walking again in the gym working on flexibility, and I believe I am now ready to get back into the work force, as all of this had afforded me the chance to go back to school and get a degree, to go with my many years of leadership experience."

good,"Answering customer concerns regarding trash service needs; I have learned to balance time between calls for additional projects such as collections and complete paperwork for new accounts. Management has an open door policy and help you with any concerns or problems you may encounter. The co-workers are friendly, helpful, and full of life. The hardest part of the job is being on the phones constantly. The most enjoyable is working together as a team."

good,Great Company overall.  But they are going in the wrong direction when it comes to there operations supervisor.  They are hiring supervisors with no experience and that is placing unwarranted stress on the drivers.  It's sad because we are suffering with supervisors that could care less for what we do.

good,"Advice to Management"
good,By far one of the most challenging jobs I've had but I loved it.  Every day was different and it consisted of problem solving on a daily basis.  You truly are tested daily on how to overcome obstacles that are out of your control.
good,Many employee lunches.  Fast paced.  Safety oriented.  Open door policy. Busy all day with data entry. Small teams for office staff. Environment could be better.

good,"I managed 170 routes (225 employees) daily which included 12 operations supervisors. It was most enjoyable to see them grow and develop through a solid coaching and development plan. Republic always encouraged a culture to promote employee development and engagement (surveys, recognition, awards)."
good,Always learning. Moving consistently to help customers. You’re  helping you coworkers when you finish your rout. Equipment is always taken care of by you and the michanics.
good,I think Republic services is a pretty good job for entry level positions. I'm just looking for something else with higher pay. If it paid a couple dollars more I would stay
good,"Republic Services puts an emphasis on safety and rewards its drivers with safety bonuses.  You have to start early and work 10-12 hour days, but that still leaves plenty of time with your family.  Garbage is a dangerous job and that is the most stressful part of the job."
good,"Typical day starts early and depending on customers how long it takes to finish route, normal day is about 100 to 150 customers. Most of the time the day is ten hours and sometimes more depending if you break down or not."

good,quick paced job picking up trash on specified routes through out Ohio West Virgina. its a good place to work if you can handle driving all night and picking up heavy bags of trash.
good,Working at RS for a year I had nothing but positive interactions with all managers and coworkers.  The head of the building was approachable and always available to hear ideas or concerns.  They try their best to mitigate the drudge of the corporate scene with themed days and fun events.  The pay is more than fair with fantastic benefits.  As long as you can show up to work consistently and make an effort they will try work with you on whatever is going on in your life.
good,"The place is good and the job was interesting for sure, all the people there great to work with and safety is the most important and keeping the vehicles in good shape was a must."

good,I came in with the goal of knocking off the Top 20 delinquent accounts. I made my collections calls to continue to keep our daily sales outstanding (DSO) as low as possible. Though every day was a challenge it was always something to look forward to. As for what I enjoyed best was seeing our Top 20 list being resolved.
good,"I really enjoy working for this company,  The work is always steady.  The supervisor is always on hand to assist whenever you hit a road block that you can not overcome.

They are really big on safety and gives safety rewards"
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"The job itself is easy, but angry/frustrated customers make the job unbearable most of the time. The compensation is low and employees have to apply for government assistance to make ends meet. Overall, its a great job if you really need one. The hours are better than most call centers. It is not the worst job to have, but it takes a lot of patience to deal with 90% furious customers all day."
good,I liked working there it was a good job had a good supervisor and a good work enviorenment  I would work there agan if given the chance but there customer service dept left houstn

good,Great place to work. Fair management. Opportunities to be promoted from within. Lots of opportunities if you're willing to relocate. If you do not buy into the Republic way it is not for you.
good,"I am an extrovert and may be one of the few who enjoyed cold calls, both over phone and outside visits. With an go getter attitude and understanding a ""no"" is not rejection,  it mostly a "" not at this time""is what makes it challenging, and you successful. "

good,"Awesome job, great pay and benefits"
good,Over the years the position changed and the job required more and the company wasnt willing to pay for extra job duties.  Stressful at times and long days.  Some evening events.

good,"Working for Allied Waste I was a supervisor and I took the escalated calls, filled in on the phones and did the accounting."
good,"A typical day a Republic Services for me is clocking in, and prepare to take my first call, which was always smooth. At that time I was always there before any of my team mates,(we shift bid every 3 months) and  was always happy to see their smiling faces. Working for Republic has taught me how important waste is, even recycling. I worked under 6 different supervisors after i got out of training. Seems as though it was every 3 months or so I had a new one.(not because of shift bids)Really wasn't a huge problem, because i knew that i'd adjust eventually. The directors and their supervisors were always friendly though, if that counts. I must say the company is very diverse down  the specialist. To me that makes the job easy because we have several tenured agents, bilingual specialist and floor support to look to for help, there isn't a hard part about the job at all. It was most enjoyable to have team mates and other coworkers that don't mind helping and at the same time have fun as we learn."

good,"Constant work flow, cubicle setting. It's hard to pin point on one item learned - not a day goes by when you do not learn something new.  Mixture of co-workers. Not a lot of in depth training so trying to accomplish issues oneself. The company as a whole is very communicative - not so much in our department.  New supervisor who most of the time treats us as Robots"
good,"great work place, safety is always important working with different companies and learning the difference in recyclable."

After working the for over 8 years, the company merged and my department was moved from Sun Valley to Santa Fe Springs (Whittier area). The position was too far from my residence.

good,"My day was at a fast pace and enjoyed working with all of the co-workers. I learned that the Republic is a great place of business."
good,"A normal day was at least 10 hours with a Saturday involved every 5 weeks. The environment allowed for additional knowledge but generally not through training. The Senior management was professional but I had three bosses in 2.5 years. The hardest part of the job was receiving phone calls and e mails well after the end of the normal work day. As an example, as the Commercial Operations Supervisor the day began at 12:30AM and usually ended around 11:00AM.

good,Nothing bad to say .  Republic is a secure company with big reviews.as with all companies there are many good things but there are also thing that could use improvement.
good,working here is hard labor and not for the people looking for a typical 9 to 5 job but very fun place and enjoyable if you want to be outside and working with your hands.

Lead 15-person sales team in engineering creative methods for revenue growth. Engendered a work environment streamlined for productivity and creative thinking.
good,"Overall good people to work with as far as fellow co-workers/drivers. Industrial (Roll-Off) dispatch pretty much runs the whole show in the Lewisville location. If you are one of the favorites, then u have it made. The slackers & the whiners get the best of the best (routes & equipment) If you work hard but don't kiss tail? Then be ready to work your butt off and be ready for more when done with route. Expect to have the worst routes with even worse equipment, constantly breaking down. Highly stressful. Job not so bad but management make it harder than it hasto be."
good,I loved working at republic services. I feel like they truly care about their employees. I unfortunately had to leave due to unforeseen circumstances but it all happened for a reason.

good,"I would have to say the hardest thing about being in the trash business is dealing with the weather because regardless if its raining, snowing or 110 degrees outside were out there. They do treat you well and make sure youre okay through the day."
good,One of the best managers I've had working in HR.The leadership team at RS are always so helpful and want you to succeed! I have met wonderful colleagues and look forward to learning and growing with the company!
good,"This is a great company to work for. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement within the company. They also have great benefits. Also, there is a lot of opportunity for professional development."
good,Enjoyed working at this job.  Team work was key and evident daily. Enjoyed interaction with customers on daily basis while performing my route and other duties.
good,It’s a good place to work. If there are issues with truck others step up to help and get routes picked up. Superviser set the pace for the day but are willing to listen to any ideas you may have to better the company or help get work day completed.
good,"With only a few exceptions at this large company, the managers and employees were very fun to work with."
good,Typical day is do your pre trip on your truck do your route safely then come back when your finished and do your post trip and go home to make it short great place to work at for those who love to work outside
good,Working hard pays off at Republic Services.  Great bonuses and commissions. However a lot of competition in the open market field. Staying on top and a lot of dedication is required.
good,"Even though Republic is a large public corporation, my experience has been more positive than most large companies.  The hiring process was smooth, well planned, and the communication during the process was excellent.  My on-boarding from day one through the month I have been here has been professional, thorough, and appropriate for my experience level in the industry.  I am looking forward to a long and successful career with Republic."
good,There is never a dull day. You will have an new experience daily. Your co-workers are very helpful and don't mind teaching new things that may arise. I look forward to each day of work.
good,"Company does care about enployees. Management took care of us well. Fun place to work.  The calls were  pretty steady.   I was laid off, but would work there again if I could."
good,"Heavy work lots of driving the whole day requires a lot of physical work , we pick up garbage, I'm getting tired its a very dirty work, trying to move on to a better position but I'm stuck where I am that's why I'm looking to different place to work"
good,"The Call center was a very positive environment to work in. Calls ranged from pleasant to angry and irate sometimes but the management at the center worked hard to keep us positive and let us know we were appreciated. We were awarded with ""cake day"" the last Wednesday of every month to celebrate Birthdays and Anniversaries. They had lunch served for major holiday's and ""cook-out's"" for us usually twice in the summer. On busy days calls could be very difficult and customers very difficult to please but we were encouraged throughout. I wish they had not moved the center."
good,Start the day by routing my route for the most efficient way for production. Pre trip truck for safety and repair any needs. Drive to specified stops haul trash to landfill. Return to the main yard.Post trip the truck. I was responsible for the safe operation of the truck. Went through many safe driving courses. Received many safety awards for safety. If I broke down for awhile other drivers would help as all routes where to be complete every day. Any Questions or problems management always ready to help. Hardest part was the weather. There are no snow days in this industry. I love driving and have been driving various types of vehicles for 35 years. Like the independence of having to be self motivated. I spent 18 years there.
good,I enjoy working for Republic Services as a customer service representative.  Every day presents new challenges including escalations and problem solving.  Working remotely with large corporations and maintaining service expectations is a very satisfying position.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"I wanted to learn a different type of customer service and that is what I learned. Not all was bad, some was a very enlightening and good experience. The attendance was very flexible and took time to get use too. They really like doing thing for the companies and helping out with many different request from the customers and their families"
good,"Hard but fair work, team players on the yard very helpful to the new guys and the hardest of the job is to learn the route in which the manager is very helpful.The most part of the job is that you are off every weekend."
good,My co-workers and the customers were the best part of the job for me. Pay was comparable and benefits really good. Workforce reduction layoff because of the loss of a county contract was the reason my employment ended.
good,Great place to work! Excellent management and opportunity to advance!

good,My typical work day was getting up a 3am and being prepared for a load of work no matter the weather conditions.
good,"I haven't been at republic long but thus far I'm having a good experience. Management is good, very competitive in salary, hours are long but its something I'm use to. Diversity matters here as well as the employees."
good,"The company is fantastic, and I have a solid management team. It's a job not a lot of people want to do, and it's hard to find good workers."
good,Great benifites people would help if you have any questions about your work but the bosses will give you the last word it's there call if they fill you need help then they will send you help.
good,"On a typical day you'd start early in the day 4-5am, get done around 2-4pm some days a little later. It was hard work but the pay was much better than any other trash companies."
good,I loved working for this company. I left only due to them closing their call center that was local to me. They did however provide transfers but I was not in a place to move far away at that time. Pay was great for customer service. I felt like you were treated as a individual and not replaceable.
good,This company takes really good care of its employees. The benefits are really good and the moral of the employees seems to be high. They have great company functions like bbq's and award ceremonies. The swing shift is a little rough for me and my family but overall a great place to work.
good,"Working for the Republic Services Operations Division in several capacities has allowed me to gain more knowledge of divisions operational side of the business.   This is a fast-paced working environment with a diversity of cultural backgrounds.   We have a strong management team who I believe will continue to guide Operations in a progressive positive direction."
good,I believe Republic Services is a great place to work and a great work environment. I really enjoy going into work and working with the peoples I work with. I have learned a lot about the company and about what they do from the inside out. It is a great experience.
good,My co workers are doing a great job training and making sure  i understand what and why I am doing all tasks. My manager as been most helpful also. Things are going well.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,Republic is demanding but the pay and environment is great once you get into the flow of your job it's a breeze some days are harder then others but it's a group effort not and individuals
good,Allied Waste offer competitive pay and a decent work atmosphere. Work is physically demanding at times. There are opportunities for advancement in this company.
good,"coworkers are very nice to work with them, family,work for republic is another way to discover the world , communication,rewards and appreciation when good work is done"
good,"a typical day at work was always fast paced and i always had something new, i learned to work good and excel under pressure.Management was on top of all regulations and all safety rules were updated frequently.My co-workers were friendly and willing to teach.The hardest part of my job was the smells and extreme heat.Most enjoyable part of my job was fast environment ."
good,every day i got up looking forward to going to work my coworker was fun to work with and easy to work with and i knew just about every boddy on the rought but the harest part of the job was jumping in and out of the truck
good,Work for me is knowing that I give the customer good service. What I learned was safety first and alot of defensive driving. Management is there for us. I love my co-workers and we get along great. The hardest part of the job is the physical work that goes into the job. The enjoyable part is working hard to satisfy our customers.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Republic Services, great experience both professional and personal."

good,I like what I do but I am looking for a better Income I don't blame it on the company just the Economy the way it is.. right now I am looking to move to Oklahoma trying to fined work before I move to another State..
good,Not the best place for job security as all work is based on contracts with various cities. This was not made clear to me when I accepted this position. You are also not paid OT.
good,Republic services is a great place to work. Great people there. Job training is wonderful. Company is really big on safety which is a great thing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the employees. Great group of guys I have every met.
good,Beautiful company but there's no room for advancement if you are a African American I was a very hard worker and enjoyed my job got employe of the year
good,Management sucks be ready to do other people’s work and be ready for management to not care about you at all If you are a hard worker you are definitely going to get screwed over at this job

good,All the hours you want. Decent work environment. Depending on job could be perfect fit. Been with company theee years. Never any problems with management or other employees.
good,The company usually compensates the employees as they deserve. Parts and equipment are usually readily available making it easier for employees to do their job. Supervisors can be very strict at times.
good,I love the interaction with employees and suppliers.  I love dealing with aerospace parts.  People were great to work with.  Management requires daily updates and meetings but that is the corporate world and I didn't mind it.
good,Great place to work definitely fast-paced always busy and always nasty if you like the smell of trash this is the job for you staff is great and they are good
good,"Call center is small and quaint, colleagues are friendly and personable! Typical day would be anticipating the customers needs, signing them up for residential curbside collection, explaining the beniefits of recycling."
good,"Open Scale house for business"
good,Co-workers there knew how to work as a team. Very physically demanding but better than joining a gym. Was able to use same truck everyday. Was able to do the same route every week.
good,"I truly enjoyed the Call Center  Experience I received at Republic Services.   I enjoyed every minute of my experience with this company.  Every aspect of the company was a delight, the Managers and my co-workers.   GREAT COMPANY!!!!"
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone that I came into contact there at Republic Waste,as en employee there I felt apart of a great team on a daily. No man was an Island and you were always included on how to become a better team partner not a player but someone who was valued in order to keep a great company afloat."
good,It was a wonderful place to work great benefit package. I first started out in Johnston and then the company moved out of state it was a longer ride but still enjoyed it even though I had to get up hours earlier to commute
good,Reputable company a person would be proud to work for. Lots of guidance and help from management. Co-workers seemed personable
good,"Processing of scale house ticket closing, cash balancing, money transfers, cash handling and various other billing responsibilities. Management is understanding and always willing to assist in answering questions and helping with billing software. The most enjoyable part is the people I work with and the ability to use my savvy math and accounting skills."
good,unfortunately this was not a permanent position with the company they where only looking for temporary help which did not give you room to grow with the company
good,"Good People"

good,"What I enjoyed about working for this company was the interesting thing you find. Everyday is something new, so your never bored."
good,i loved my job there.it is what i like to do.the benefits were good.
good,Working for Republic Services was a good experience for me because they frequently offered overtime as well as weekends. The company would offer pay increase for those who worked fast and efficiently. They would also offer snacks and water bottles for the workers. I liked working for this company because we went to different locations daily and the work sometimes varied.
good,"I learned a lot about customer service, my favorite part of the job was being able to help the customers and solve their issues. hardest part was irate customers on the phone"
good,"My co-workers were more like a family here. I met some really good people. Management wasn't very supportive, but co-workers were. I loved the team environment."
good,Company was a great place when I started but then everything changed when the decided to look at selling the company at the end
good,"Great job. Friendly atmosphere, great support team. Must be able to"
good,"each day different "
good,The typical day for a route driver is just get on your truck and do your route. No one will bother you to where you can stop and get a something to drink. Its just you and the truck doing your job. you finish your route and the get to the yard and go home. The communication within the company is not great. there is a lot of delay in communication. Due to lack of communication you can have a long day or short day and you cant really plan ahead. 
good,"I was fortunate to be able to work in a small customer service department and office. The working atmosphere was great because there was a certain familial aspect to the management style and really genuine down-to-earth supervisor. The people in the dispatch were really amiable too. Even though they were bugged by us CSRs with special requests from customers, they always tried their best. Our office only covered about 4 cities in California though, so I wouldn't expect the same feel from the big conglomerate offices in Phoenix, AZ and elsewhere."
good,Good company to work for. Company has ups and downs but overall a good place to work. Have incentive programs and company picnics and events. They also have great benefits!
good,Was a employee for 10 years in mocksville love the company love the other employees everything was good till hickory took over an the manager there thinks he's better then everyone and the the maintenance supervisor that came from new Bern is really bad I was let go over something that I didn't see the night before was told to train a new guy and get a truck up republic is a good place to work at as long as you are not in the boon mocksville or spruce pine because it's ran by the hickory very bad people
good,Republic has a lot of incentive programs and do a good job showing appreciation for hard work. They offer competitive wages and benefits. They are a national company and leading the country in paying back to their communities and sales.
good,"upper management outsourced 800 jobs right after I became widowed I would not recommend their company ever."
good,I would just like to say this company will not hire people over fifty I do not know why they claim to be not bias but they are!!!!!!i have tried very hard to get my friends and family hired but since they are over the age of fifty they are not Hired!!!!!!! I thought that Republic had got in trouble about this years ago and they had changed????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
good,"People are great but it is a 'corporation' focused on shareholders and stock price.  Lacking innovation and a lot of 'good old boy' type management style.  Could be better, but average for most of today's corporate America."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Allied Waste of Page is a very small division of Republic Services who purchased Allied in 2009.  All of my co-workers were fantastic.  We all had our jobs to do and we did them well, with very little management.  The hardest part of the job was having items thrown at me, doors slammed until almost off their hinges from a very aggressive ops. supervisor.  He was made to undergo anger management courses and then quit in approx. 2011.   The best part of my job was the interaction with customers and building friendships with co-workers.  I enjoy talking to people, so customer serv. was a strong point.  The company has wonderful benefits."
good,"My Superior offered little training and did not know how to manage people or the workload. Favoritism was rampant; if you disagreed with the General Manager you were terminated. There were many management terminations in my time there. It is the kind of atmosphere where if you bring up a suggestion for improvement, you are criticized for not implementing the change sooner. The GM clearly has no people skills; being a GM means working with people, not just knowing the trash business"
good,start my day at 4am did a pretrip on my truck and take off and go pick up an open top catainer and take it to the land fill and dump it and take it back to the location i got it from.. i would make 4 stop a day monday thru friday and sometime saturday if the holiday fall during the week....
good,had lots of fun working there learned alot about equipment here
good,We were very busy most of the time but it was enjoyable and we all worked together. We had the best health insurance benefits of any place I’ve ever worked. The teamwork was the best part about being there.
good,Sometimes I have days when it's a lot of trash in the street and some days when it's just a clean street. The days when it dirty on the streets with trash I will have to pick it all up and dump it if it's by the trash can. The street didn't have any trash by the the can I just dump the can and Keep pushing
good,"Management needs a little improvement but the environment is great, safety is the talk of the town, and machines are well kept. Pay is good as well as benefits. You will be enrolled in a teamsters union"
good,I worked for the company for 21 Years and loved it. Would go back if I could work locally without relocation. Worked in the Chandler AZ call center the last 6 months I was there and loved it as well.
good,good job benefits and paid time off but saliries are low and work enviroment are good my current supervisor and manager are cool and excellent people but the general manager is really bad as a person and boss
good,Very upbeat environment. You learn more every day interacting with internal and external customers. Communication needs improvement among management and staff
good,"1. A typical day at work is non stop"
good,"Loyalty is big with me and the fact that i worked for a company almost 20 yrs and they decide to go a different route with customer service and i traveled out of state and lived in a hotel for months to train others and they did not keep their promise of having options/positions available for me, not professional.  either offer something and keep your word or don't offer."
good,I have no actual review as I still work there and enjoy the atmosphere. There is plenty of work to do and plenty of opportunities to learn. More opportunities to promote.
good,"Work volume does provide work/life balance. People are great to work with. Management not always clear on expectations allowing the employee to understand expectations of the job to be successful. If you enjoy interactions with others on a daily basis , this can be a fulfilling job. I would suggest getting expectations and goals outlined in writing"
good,Republic is a great company to work for if you like the industry. Of course you always have to follow the corporate culture but if you want to advance you definetely have the chance
good,"I loved this job!  Unfortunately there was no official employee hand book and the call center Manager made up her own rules, and because California is an at will employer, there was not much any one can do."
good,I enjoyed working as a data entry clerk. I enjoyed learning new things and speaking to difficult customers. We retrieved records for attorneys for different court cases. I entered all the information into the computer system on who and where to retrieve the records from. Some people were difficult when they would refuse to give any information but I always handled it with care and got the information needed to send the subpoena to. I worked quickly and efficiently.   
good,"the haredst part of this job is dealing with difficult and rude customer's you couldnt let a customer walk away dis satisfied so whether or not they cursed you , you had to work to meet the customer's needs"
good,love this place but had double standards that i could not keep up.
good,Relaxed work place... Not knowledgeable management.... too muh gossip
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,The typical day was very busy. I learned a lot about different city laws. Management was okay . The job was very easy. The enjoyable part of the job was the drivers and the customers.
good,My day included being responsible for a commercial route ensuring all customers were serviced on my route and to ensure as well any operating issues with the equipment were documented and corrected.
good,"i was release from my job last month due to an accident that was out of my control, the saftey gaurd were not avalible on they motorized vehicle i was using ."
good,Some of the upper management do not respect the employees that are under them and good work isn't recognized by the top managers. The company as a whole is good to work for mostly.
good,"A no nonsense workplace where safety is paramount.  Day to day I would be in the field training, coaching, observing and refining my sales team in our Priority Based Selling system."
good,"Time goes very fast, very fast paced, but management is the best, the hardest part is waking up early but the most enjoyable is a fun atmosphere everyone is down to earth"
good,"While a typical 8 hour work day is out of the question for most everyone who works here, it was mostly an enjoyable atmosphere to work in. Free ice cream every Friday and lunches/ dinners provided regularly. Relaxed atmosphere and easy to work with managment"
good,collector for government accounts as well as East Hampton were I kept the DSO low. I than transferred to Virginia were i handled several division as well as trained all on the new system.
good,"Republic in general is a good company to work for. In my opinion they treat their employees great and offer really great benefits. They have great benefits.  Every day was fast paced and that made the day go fast. There was always something new to learn every day, how landfills work, how trash trucks work, how recycle is taken care of.  There is just way too many things to mention that I learned there.  All in all this was a great work environment."
good,"Republic Services is a great place to work. Unfortunately I would much rather work at a different location other than the location I'm working at now. I love the various benefits that the company has to offer. However, the environment at my current location has, in my opinion become toxic and is a negative environment to be in."
good,"Very good company culture, on cutting edge of the industry."
good,the management was very hard on the employees and the turn over rates where very high due to this fact mostly.   Pay was good and overtime was plentiful. You where required to work overtime with little to no notice.
good,This is a great place to work however the pay is low if they raise the pay a little more people would not leave they really show you that they want you there
good,There is no such thing as a typical day of work.  Every day is different and unique. We service over 100 customers every night and run between 23 and 27 routes.  As a supervisor you always have to be flexible because this is an ever changing environment. Basic understanding of routes and the city is a very important aspect of the job because you want to set up the most productive routes possible. On the same lines you must know your drivers and their capabilities.  Like every career it’s what you make of it.
good,The company is solid and invests in its employees as much as they invest in it.
good,"Answered inbound telephone calls, Assisted customers with payments, billing questions, and concerns regarding services and billing."
good,"A typical day at work was keying contractual waste service agreements and data entry work. I learned a plethora of skills for advanced administrative tasks. The management was great. There was no hard part of the job, but there was plenty to do though. Lots of busy work which was great for me. I love being busy. The most enjoyable part about the job before the position was eliminated was the safety personell and the other staff members. She definitely made coming to work very interesting everyday with her personable attitude and humorous personality. The supervisor over the customer service reps was outstanding. She taught me 85% of what i needed to know for the job. Great asset to the company."
good,"These people really have their act together. I was on a temp to hire contract, and once my time was in, they agreed to hire me. In the meantime I was still looking for active full time work. I was hired away from this company with compensation I couldn't resist."
good,Great atmosphere. Fun and energetic people. Management staff very professional. The most enjoyable part of the job was the game of earning and winning new customers.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,collection for 4 different locations-commercial collections
good,Awesome place to start a stable career.  I miss it alot.  If your a hard working individual and love all weather types and like advance in a great company to work for Republic Services is the company. I can’t really say nothing bad about the company
good,The company is pretty good and a nice place to work for. I been here almost 2 years and already received a promotion and raise. The pay is great and benefits are pretty good. Overtime every week!!
good,Its a great place to work and you dont need to know everything coming in. They will teach you if you dont know. Management is very easy to go to and there is always HR if you have problems
good,Great internship program. They worked hard so you could understand the company with presentations from different departments. Provided check ins and a mentor.
good,Republic Services is always concerned for the safety of their employees. They are always looking for ways to give back to their employees with contests and prizes.
good,"Over all Republic Services is a great company to work for, Its just the Daytona beach yard that I was in the management would have there favorite employee and I could not work there like that. I was use to everyone being treated equal. So I parted my way with Republic."
good,"republic service is a great place to work,its been a number of years since ive worked there but at that time it was certainly a great place to work,i would recommend anyone"
good,"Working at republic has been rewarding, management is fairly decent and understanding, you will work 45-52.5 hours a week, one of the perks is that it is a union position and you receive free medical, you will bring home between 900-1,200 a week depending on how long your route takes you."
good,"The managers were awesome, they actually care about their employees and customers. While I worked in the Grants Pass office, we had major changes in the pay scale, and services offered to our customers. Which created a major increase in work for us, but the managers knew that, and made sure we got the hours we needed and did all that they could to help us out. I would reccomend them as an employer!"
good,My day at Republic was very productive from start to end. I worked with a group of team that was like family to me. We all came to work and accomplished our tasks whether it was alone or with some assistance.
good,"Other than consolidating my position to outsource the work overseas, the company had a genuine focus on it's employees to make sure they were working to promote from within the company."
good,The company likes to promote from within.  Better paying positions will require a degree and time in rate.  Starting pay in administration and operations is marginal but as noted there is opportunity for advancement.  Could spend a little more money in employee engagement to build stronger intercompany relationships.
good,"This place is magical. I regret leaving this place. The job culture is upbeat and positive. Management was attentive, available, and supportive. I wish I could go back."
good,Great job to have. Work is meaningful and fast paced at times. Managers pay close attention to their employees needs. Assistance is always available when needed.

We have to deliver and remove large containers all day long from construction sites to stores to compactors from restaurants. We then complete are day with a post trip inspection.
good,"I am a new hire (3 weeks) and so far i am quite impressed with the training. The people i have worked with so far are pleasant and quick to help out as i do need it. I am in Bridgeton,Mo. learning the Republic way of driving safely. The instructor answers any and all questions our group is asking. So far a great place to work."
good,"good company to work with, good opportunity's. Good benefits good time off. Company is very employee oriented. Company has several employee outings each year."
good,"Great pay and advancement at Allied Waste. People are all very professional and willing to work as a team."

good,It can be a great place to work if you are willing to put 100% into it. Challenging and it can be stressful at times. Great benefits and compensation.
good,typical day at work could be hard and fun or just straight hard you can learn a lot based on the driver you with  management is okay workplace same the hardest part of the job is trying to dump the trash and keep up with the truck enjoyable part is the conversations and riding the back of the truck
good,"Be ready to go to work, check fluids  be safe  it was a lots of fun I made a mistake but it was a good job most of the people there was like family our goal was to get the job done, slogan Not on My Watch"
good,Salary and job security is on par among marketing firms. It was a very fun place to work and had excellent people. Also in downtown Minneapolis which is an awesome city. If you are interested in agricultural marketing this is a great place.
good,"Managment team is on point, excellent co workers who put up great team work. The hours are decent, though I wouldn't recommend any overtime due to Chinese overtime pay. For example: 15 hours overtime is only like 70 dollars extra pay instead of time and a half. The routes are a little over whelming doing 2000-3000 stops a day. Sometimes you don't get a lunch which they still take half a hour out of you pay. Some supervisors are more understanding than others and willing to help you in any way, while other supervisors are just basically there for a pay check. Mechanic team is one of the best in the business, as well as dispatch team and secretary. The pay is also by day not by hour. I really like the company as a hold due to staffing, benefits, team work, guaranteed hours, etc. But I would fall in love with it if they made a few changes for the team, especially the drivers who's out the going hard in the field."
good,I learned a lot working for this company. I was tasked and pushed to better myself both in life and at work. I met some great people that are still my close friends. I can not say enough about how good a company this is.
good,Everyone was very helpful. A very nice and friendly work environment. Very flexible hours. A very good experience. I got work according to my schedule outside of work. Supervisor was very understanding and worked with me.
good,"Repaired all containers, structural welding on all rolloffs, front and rear loaders, responsible for all shop welding"
good,"I love my job, I work with a great group of people.  I give 110% all of the time.  Love taking on new tasks.  I enjoy working with different trucking companies and the drivers that come into our facility."
good,"Great company, but with ALL companies, poor management. Very young management at the location I worked at with no trash experience, only a college degree.  Communication was a HUGE problem, in that, they didn't know how to speak to you, only at you. If the local company would follow the rules of CORPORATE the company would be better. Corporate doesn't know what's going in Houston because they are located in Arizona."
good,The job is plentiful and OT there with no problem!! Plenty of hours and plenty of work. They need more help and the benefits are amazing.
good,great people to be around everyone is trustworthy and dependable. leaders lookout for you as long as you do your job. Long hours but well worth it
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"I enjoy working for Republic Waste services, but I am interested in opportunity for advancement. Working for this company is interesting and they have great coworkers that are willing to help each other get the job done."
good,Great people to work with. They look out for their employees.the hardest part of the day is the throwing 20 tons of trash.this job will help you get into shape they try to bend over backwards for the employees
good,A typical day at work is loading and unloading trucks. Putting up material. Keeping the place clean. So it can be a safe environment.         What I learned is how to use forklifts. How to work in a fast paced environment.                                                                                    Management. They are nice caring for there employees. They the type of management that will get out there with you to show you how things should go. The co-workers are the same way. There a team they work as one you need help. They will come and help. The hardest part of the job is not having space to put material. It's a recycling plant. So some times you get over stocked and you have to make space. The most enjoyable part of the day is when management comes and tell you thank you for your hard work.
good,Management is something that i pay attention to as far as professionalism and integrity. I have always put safety before everything and will continue to strive to be the best in everything i do.
good,A typical day in the operation department was full of multi tasks  that keep you busy during the hole shift
good,"A typical day would consist of pre-trip equipment inspections, details of route that would be worked for that particular day. A difficult part of the job would definitely have to be dealing with the smell and handling the waste containers themselves."
good,"a typical workday consist of assisting customers with the trash removal service . ensuring the customers receive the best customer "
good,"Great place to work.  Evening shift required no management, so we were on our own.  The job wasn't stressful."

good,I like working for Republic Services. Hopefully I can move up and further my career here. They have good benefits compared to others. I think it could be structured different in regards to career advancement though
good,Great opportunity. Great opportunity for advancement. Excellent opportunity for aggressive energetic self starters. Great opportunity. Company has a solid vision and executes successfully.
good,Best company i have ever worked for if i am being honest.  Unfortunately there is a huge gap between workers and leaders with little to no mentorship path for aspiring folks such as myself to better there leadership abilities. Therefor leaving me to venture elsewhere. Outside of that fact....This company is so absolutely great.
good,The company is great to work for. You have great benefits. And the atmosphere is relaxing. It is hard work but once you establish your own flow then the job is easy.
good,Good place to work....like going to work...work at night....great atmosphere....casual.......laid back.....good management....like going to work everyday
good,"We are assigned 5 or 6 boxes to pick up on our routes each day.  We are encouraged to work safely, and coworkers are always eager to help.  If we finish our route early, we have the opportunity to help others, or get extra boxes assigned."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed
good,"Best company I've ever worked for, hands-down. Management is understanding and works hard to make it the best possible work environment. Only complaint I have is the hours. Though the overtime pay is good, I prefer to work days and spend nights/weekends with my family."
good,They are doing away with my job after over 20 years and so that’s the only reason I’m looking for work.  My husband is self employed (Grading Business) and it will be best fit for me to work from home as much as possible.
good,"As the assistant operations manager I had to make sure that all the employees were up at there stations working safely, Safety was a very big thing with Republic Services and I emphasizes this in daily meetings. with the team."
good,"so policy and process change to one day to the next, aren't fair if you wanted to go to school or having fmily issues, the peers are awesome to work with but management is to much micro, and they can't really assist you , a lot of it depends on how they feel about you"
good,"Another day, another dollar. Working at Republic Services was all fun and and games... literally, there's a game lounge in the area. The workplace environment is fairly good for the most part, there are some weird and pervy folks that work there but, they're easy to spot for the most part."
good,"Perfect working conditions, pay not sufficient for my expenses. Great work environment. No hassles. Fast pace, behind the scenes. Employee relations are exceptional and paid holidays help keep stress levels down."
good,"Republic Services is a great place to work.  If you can show up on time, be safe, have a great attitude, and do your job, you can move up in the company."
good,Highly Recommend as compensation was well and training was complete. I would recommend this company to anyone with a Class B license. Well organized and fun.
good,Great place to work if you life a fast paced environment. Very relaxed atmosphere to the point of being able to listen to music on headphones while working. Once a month they have a free cookout for lunch involving hotdogs and hamburgers with a few sides.
good,"my typical work day consisted of checking in drivers, keying productivity, putting away phones/keys, calling customers when needed, helped cover shifts when needed. My job was real easy and I was 100% a team player. Did everything that was asked of me, plus more."
good,"Loved my time with Republic, wonderful place to work and wonderful co-workers. Was very saddened when they moved their call centers to non-local plants."
good,"A great place to work gets repetitive at times but fun and interesting none the less. Maintenance manger is a great guy fair and honest and a leader, do your job to the best of you ability and you will be taken care of fairly."
good,The culture was a fast paced call center. Inbound calls coming in to the call queue. Individual metric system was kept by management.The workplace was busy but friendly.
good,"I loved working at Republic Services, it was a great job with great people. Unfortunately my position was eliminated. The upper management was very helpful and the new General Manager is awesome"
good,"Overall I enjoyed the people and the music atmosphere, however the training could have been better if I was switch different trainers. It was hard to get used to different training styles. It would be better with just one style and the same process."
good,"A typical day at work, pre trip 2 or more trucks to cover who ever its not showing up to work that day. What I learned is that always safety come first at any given day. Management have to much work on there hands some days they don't have the time to take care of some ones work problems. Hardest part of the job is other drivers who don't realice how difficult it is to slow down a truck with 8 to 12 ton load. Enjoyable all co worker help each other out, and get along with each other."
good,"Going through changes for the best."
good,"This facility has previously been plagued with failures from both ends of the spectrum which greatly affected everyone.  Having seen the tail end of the failures in 2016, I can attest many changes were implemented across all levels to turn those historic failures to successes.  2017 is going to be the year for great success.  Many new trucks were provided, money for much needed maintenance, driver positions filled which are paid some of the highest in the state of Texas and, full management staffed properly. Drivers were previously working very long hours with very little balance in work/home life which can cause for stress and poor job satisfaction.  Drastic measures were implemented to ensure drivers spend as much time with their families when not at work. The rise to the top is reflected by reports from the area.  People are noticing Plano for the good and not what was previously.  Customer service has vastly improved resulting in less MPUs, less complaints and a positive reflection of how Republic takes care of its customers.  Safety remains a top priority for everyone and it is truly an individual effort but as a team we promote heavily.  You are only as strong as your weakest link.  I have read the other negative comments and can attest this is not the Plano they worked for previously.  Changes do take time and if patient, they will come.  It takes great effort and constant vigilance from everyone to make that happen.  Success is not overnight.  People often fail to get the big picture and realize this.  Be part of the solution and not the problem and we will go far!"
good,Woke up at the crack of dawn prepared to work the rest of the day away. Management was good. The job was not hard because I had tons of experience.
good,"Very challenging, but rewarding job. Everyone is like family. Way too many hours to work if you have young children, but excellent pay."
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed

good,"Reporting to the main office at 7:30 downtown Atlanta.  Preparing for the day and leaving for my territory.  Cold calling certain days of the week.  Rest of the time was spent with customer retention and appointments.  A lot of pressure from Sales Manager each day to meet your goals."
good,"I thought I had the job I was going to retire from. Then, along came a bigger company, who ""MERGED"" with us. I was gone on severance less than 2 months later...."
good,I learned It's all about the bottom dollar. There are no employees just statistic numbers. As long as you don't make any mistakes you can go far after a decade or two.
good,new trucks great co workers nice routes.
good,Still in training. I said I'm still in training they helped me a very much. They want nothing more than for me to succeed and be a great asset to this company. They have plenty of money to share.

I'm teachable and willing to learn new business applications within a requested time.

good,"When i worked for Republic for 22 years i enjoyed the job alot, I worked with ex-police officers who taught me  how to do Security alot better. Upper  Management was great never had a problem. Workers where great got along with everybody. Hardest part of the job was cov ering 6 and half blocks of responsibility every night, Also doing odor patrols as well.

good,I worked in a call center. We took non-stop calls. We dealt with a variety of issues. For the most part the job was fun. The hardest part was the supervisors would not back you up with the customers. I loved working in a team environment. If it wasn't for all the regular employees the day would of been boring.
good,Excellent place to work at. They care for their employees and make sure that you are happy in the environment. They literally become your family and want you to succeed

good,"i loved working there if you can get use to the smell. co-workers were great the job was awesome and the benefits and pay were great but i would have to say as a multi million dollar business they don't give you much time to adjust, the owners where ever they are said my work was professional in every way and done it well but my productive level was low so Im sorry but we are going to have to let you go."
good,"Work starts at 6am.  A typical day at work can start off with a garbage route that consists of 770 to 910 customers to service.  There is always a possibility of a route being split between 5 drivers due to staff shortage.  It usually takes between 7 to 10 hours to complete a route.  "

The job was great, the management was nice and straightforward, and the coworkers were fun to talk to. I really enjoyed my time there because it was typical office work, like answering a telephone, renewing customer accounts, entering data into a computer system, making copies of things, and all the other things that a typical office setting would do and have. If the business was hiring now I would love to be working for them but sadly they are not hiring."
good,Republic Services looks out for there associates and they make sure that they have all that they need to do there job and get ahead.
good,managment needs to get it together but overall great place to work. I really like the fish dinner they give us on holidays
good,There is no typical day at Republic.  Everyone works as a team to get the job accomplished.  Managers work with each employee according to their job qualifications.  The co-workers are team players.  The hardest part of the day occurs when we're unable to complete anticipated production due to breakdown of machinery.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when management provides social events in appreciation of employees.
good,"Every day was different. once I got used to the work. it is a great job. It will keep you healthy unlike other jobs."
good,"Working 10-13 hour is a typical work day."
good,I loved working for Republic it was the one place that I excelled and learned that I can follow my potential. I can go the distance. My coworkers were the best and it enhanced my skills and show me that I can go on...The hardest part was that I had to leave it due to medical issues..

good,"A CSR at Allied Waste will take between 50-100+ calls a day from customers with billing questions, missed pickups, service changes, and special requests. I've learned a lot about the waste industry and how waste affects us as a community. The management is wonderful and very understanding and helpful. My coworkers are great, everyone gets along and we have a very homey work environment. Everyone acts their age and does their job and there is NO DRAMA! The hardest part of the job is dealing with very irate customers who sometimes have requests or issues that CSRs can't do anything about because we don't drive the trash trucks! The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to quickly and accurately assist people with questions and concerns that they didn't think there would be a resolution to."

good,"The CSR's feel more like a family, yes the call center work is not a ""fun"" job but your friends make it fun. If you can make it passed the few old people that complain their trash hasn't been picked up by 9AM then you are good to go. great insurance and pay"

Great culture encouraged by an equally great management and HR team. Enormous growth opportunity for the focused. I actually got promoted after about 2 months.

good,"A typical day at work was non stop intense action to meet quota for the day. "
good,"The job itself is challenging and not for the light hearted, but the benefits and the work atmosphere more than make up for it. The job is rigorous but the company takes note of hard work. The summer tends to be more work due to increased hours because of the high volume that would come into the facility. The company and superiors would do their best to make the job as comfortable as possible. The managers would often to small things like providing ""freezes"" on breaks that contain electrolytes and water readily available to the workers on hot days. There were annual cook outs. Even if the job itself was very tiresome and somewhat repetitive the co-workers always made the job enjoyable.  The company provided work clothes and safety equipment for all employees. They also paid for the first pair of work boots. (redwing)"

It takes a special breed of person to be a residential helper and you are on the front lines every day.

Once i got used to it, it wasnt so bad. I also directed outside public traffic and our trash trucks to proper locations and learned how to speak over a radio to my fellow employees. Never a dull moment here. All employees and management were kind and helpful. Awesome experience!! Great job to have."
good,This position primarily consists of repairing front loader containers.  My success at this position requires carefully planning to ensure that all ready line standards are met for every size with some front load compactor containers which are completed in a timely fashion.

And for management they are better than any other call center I work with. They listen to your opinions and suggestions on how to make changes to better our working experience. And I seen them actually do it.  This is a place I wanted to retire from because within the company you can expand to different jobs but unfortunately I’m moving to a state republic doesn’t have job offers.

good,"I enjoy the face to face contact with my customers. Many of them have become my friends. I love the customer interaction getting to know there needs and coming up realistic solutions to solve there problems. As a manager I enjoy the challenge of coming up with new ideas to increase productivity to reach a team goal. Going above and beyond the customer service is what brings the customer back. Establishing a good rapport with them tends to bring a since of respect between you your co-workers and the customesr. I have fun doing my job, even when the job is not so pleasant. Learning to listen and not just hear them, lets the customer know that you care. One would be surprised that even when a customer is aggressive, the more control you have over your attitude in staying positive, they will become subdued. In my career, I have be taught to do the occasional self reckoning. Feel good about what your doing and know why your doing it. When your happy it shows on your face, attitude, body language, your speech which will in turn increase your career advancement"
