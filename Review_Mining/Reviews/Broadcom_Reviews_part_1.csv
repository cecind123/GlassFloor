rating,review
bad,"Terrible Company and will get worse as Broadcom implements their ideas. Poor management, No team atmosphere. No one was willing to share their knowledge for fear of competition and getting laid off."
bad,"Lack of communication and objectives caused decisions to be made and then reworked constantly "
bad,"Cost cutting is the highest priority for the company, at the expense of productivity and time savings for the employees. Free tools are used instead of tools that cost money."
bad,my contract was cancelled due to a bad manager and horrible team lead. Everyone is out for themselves and between that and the scandals i have no intention of ever going back
bad,Was a bad place to work management goes behind company policy and makes their own rules HR is a joke because they know of violations but do absolutely nothing hours are long and no work life balance basically a Chinese sweat shop you work till you die brown noses move up but dedicated employees move nowhere  a very hostile work environment with no chance for advancement in any department unless you are family or blood related the company got bought out now I hear its worse.
bad,"Broadcom is a great place and culture to work for. As a group, we work very well together and with a family atmosphere. Very flexible schedule and no micro management style."
bad,"There is no loyalty at this company.  They operate on a 1980's corporate raider business model.  Wall Street loves it, but it treats employees as expendable items."
bad,This was a daily contracting company that would give you work to do for a few days than nothing for a period of time. Does not look out for the people that work for them.
bad,"I will highly recommend anyone to not join the company as there the work culture is pathetic, flexibility is not up to the mark, no learning environment for freshers amd managers are a lot of mis-managers in every aspect."
bad,"workplace culture is good , Benifits were good , the company was fare on compensation for the short time with the Broadcom management when they took over the existing company (CA Inc.)"
bad,"Poor management. "
bad,the culture and environment alone were stressful let alone the fact that you have to wear a clean suit constantly. and my departure was done in a very unprofessional way. My supervisor was a good supervisor that was put into a bad situation and I don't know that I would come back if they asked me to.
bad,There are numerous problems involving favoritism and extortion of power within the supervisor department and operator department of the facility. If you end up in the wrong area with the wrong people the changes of making it past three months are slim.
bad,"There is only one good thing about Broadcom, your compensation."
bad,"if you are willing to be treated like a child, then this is the place for you."
bad,"You will be terminated at any time"
bad,"Broadcom is a company where if you don't know someone above you, you will never move out  from operations. Basically you have to kiss a lot of butts to get a better job at the company."
bad,"you can never disconnect from work and you can expect to be contacted while off too."
bad,I was there to look at the planning systems and make recommendations.  VP of Ops did not think it was necessary to change so after reporting my findings to the CIO and one of the controllers I packed up moved on.
bad,Current Security and Office Services Management in inept and recent personnel decisions have caused us to look for other career opportunities.
bad,No teamwork or input from others.  Leadership is dictatorship style and managers micro manage.  Lots of fire drills with no flexibility or work life balance.
bad,"As long as you don't work for Ops, it is a nice place to work for. Stay away of any job under Operations."
bad,"Broadcom pursues the most minimally viable solution to anything.  So if can be done manually and they can save a few bucks eliminating a tool, they will.  They discourage process improvement and innovation, the most important thing is milking every last dollar out of everything.  Prepare yourself for unnecessarily difficult work that could be easily automated.   You will spend more time on mundane nonsense, then actually solving problems and improving the business.  Career progression is also discouraged, and training's are not provided. They have a strict no back-fill policy, virtually eliminating upward mobility."
bad,"The engineers I worked with are amazing people. The leadership at the upper levels have seemed to lose their personal connection with its people. Director level and up.  The direct managers were wary of making any decision or offering and opinion that fell outside of what the director desired. His connection and communication was (as expressed by about 90% of the people there) oppressive and bullish.   "
bad,"Almost as bad as working at a call center.  Drama, immature employees and biased advancement selection. Used to be a decent-ish company to work for, but now overrun by incompetent temps and overconfident, ignorant supervisors. The good hard workers get shunned at raise time while the people who do nothing more than run their mouths instead of their tools are promoted."
bad,"Broadcom has too much stress and work, no work-life balance, compensation not very good compared to the amount of work in the WLAN BU. So much work it makes ppl sick and ill."
bad,"Beyond good compensation, interesting technical work in an uncommon chip fabrication environment, and fellow engineers who are mostly friendly, easy to work with, smart, and talented; there are not many other desirable attributes to working for FOPD that I can identify. I concluded after a few years that the work environment/management style was neither encouraging my best individual effort nor fostering my career. This may be a good place to start your career as a recent graduate who needs some experience or to close out your career."
bad,"Broadcom pays a good salary and gives very good stock options."
bad,Job work /life balance is ok. Compensation and Benefits are good for a large company. Job security are ok as well as job culture.
bad,"The culture of the company is still startup-ish with a lot of delivery pressure, but also has the bureaucracy and politics of a big company. Work life balance is a little difficult to achieve but you are surrounded by a lot of smart people."
bad,"When I first started at Broadcom, I was very happy and it was a great place to work.  Intellectual Property (IP) theft is a high concern in the Semiconductor space, however over the years Broadcom continued to take a more aggressive approach to combating IP theft then I was comfortable with."
bad,Good Job Environment and good to leanrn new IT technologies but there is no job security
bad,"High pressure work place where expected to be on call for 24/7. Compensation packages are competitive but $/hour not great."
bad,"Most engineers I encountered at broadcom were competent and enjoyable to work with.  Everyone was very relaxed about flex time, and there was never an issue if you needed to step out of the office for a bit.  Work had the potential to be varied, and depending on your manager, there were occasional opportunities to learn new tools and skills (time permitting)."
bad,Not a goal oriented but a Typical Profit based company with no long term vision.   No job security even for best performers.   It is a name sake US based company moving verticals to offshore just based on zero threshold.    No centralized goals for the company to move on.  It is mostly based on the immediate supervisor dictatorship.   Not a great place to work.
bad,"Very aggressive project schedules. Bare minimum changes are done one previous designs. Due to tight schedules, any kind of redesigning is discouraged. No investments in innovation."
bad,"1. Learning Opportunity is good."
bad,"we work all from home, so this is not the best place to discuss and have a balance with your family."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was the daily interaction with people. Co-workers made the environment more pleasant. My job at Broadcom was basically to ensure the office was running as effective and efficient as possible. What made it difficult was the different directions that management was going without any overall outcome.
bad,Sr. Manager and team is under tremendous presser to deliver. Not a fun place to work. Lots of tense meeting and lots of work to do. Team doens't care about people.
bad,"CA Technologies was acquired recently by Broadcom, and the change is constant. Your experience depends on your team and management. It's difficult to know what or who is leading, and although I think the end result will be good, the morale is getting worse by the day."
good,"Work load is heavy most of time. Not much time to learn and not many people willing to teach (I was very lucky, I replaced a full time engineer and was given some time to actually learn rather than test like a robot.) coworkers are fine, but the managers have to be chosen more carefully."
good,they just think money could buy every thing.  It is not right. good thing is that there is not too many meetings. bad thing is you will be depress there
good,There were a lot of benefits for the staff before the acquisition but after that the whole work environment changed and benefits wer removed. Working was under strict surveillence and the freedom was lost.
good,Poor management and work culture. management is very shallow.
good,"Day at work: Very political culture."
good,"At least for me, work rating was not only based on my performance. "
good,Shareholders and stock price are of upmost importance.  focused less attention on employees and work/life balance.  Used Bonus/performance as the only method to drive employees.
good,"As the title mentions, there is more to than just playing ping pong mechanically,reflexively or re actively  for fun. It also provides a non reflexive, non reactive  thinking environment to bounce ideas around just like the sensitive plastic ping pong ball to be productive in a fast paced environment."
good,Place use to be real great to work at until new management made some decisions that’s caused the workflow to be very slow. Several Supervisors suck up to get ahead . Hard work is not recognized only sucking up. Management in general is a mess no communication and rules are made up after events occur. Most perks that we had are gone and not coming back. Promises of moving up in the company are never really considered .
good,"The compensation, benefits, PTO are very good"
good,Supervisor is good at working but very bad at speaking to people in a manner that tears u apart limb to limb and pushes every button that you have.  Doesn't let your opinion stick or let you speak period.
good,"People are fun to work with. Uncertainty is always there about job security. Work life is balanced."
good,I have nothing to say about the company. Challenging company to work.
good,"Nice place to work, however there is some insecurity about the job constantly"
good,"The peers you work with are great. The pay and benefits are good."
good,"In November 2018, Broadcom acquired the company I worked at for 36 years, CA Technologies.  I was terminated and brought on as a 'transition' employee, and my employment ended on June 28, 2019."
good,"The executive management is focused on profitability and serving the investors.  This is great as a shareholder.  As an employee, you will likely get shares as part of your compensation. "
good,When i started it was a revered company to work for but it was purchased and the new management was not the same.  The company outlook is to make money not be exceptional.  This to me was not the culture I was looking to stay in.  My manager was extremely flexible and allowed for working from home and was very encouraging.  Since the day I started we began to transition our infrastructure to a new Colo datacenter and hand off our responsibilities to an outsourced company.
good,LSI started as a fun place to work.  Great projects and co-workers.  Over time the management became less stable and believable.
good,"Work is fun and relaxed at broadcom."
good,Great place to start career and fun place to work for interns.Lots of new cutting edge products and you get to learn a lot and it prepares you.
good,Agressive company with dynamic environment. Offers great challenges and rewards are decent. Need to maintain work life balance here otherwise you will sucked up in the job
good,The company has experienced great growth in my time here. There promises to be many more changes ahead and lots of wonderful opportunities for continued growth.
good,Learned a lot.Gained expertise in 3GPP mobile wireless protocols.
good,"New task request is a new challenge to improve my career skills. Silicon company require real time tools. Timing issue is the first priority concerned. For example, 3.4Mbs high speed I2C interface to silicon, USB interrupt transfer between PC and micro-controller, read/write silicon with interrupt events. Design window base application with real time approach. Expertise real time system design with software tools and consumer products."
good,"Overall Broadcom is a great place to work. Depending on the area and shift you work your supervisors could be great or not so great. The pay is not where it should be, especially living in Colorado. The average pay should go up at least $3-$5 per hour. I will say it was much better to work here when it was Avago.  alot of the cool extras have gone away. Also they drug test now, which wouldn't be a problem except we live in Colorado where Marijuana is legal. Before Broadcom, management didn't care what you did on your days off as long as you didn't use on your workday or on site, which I get but now you can be fired for smoking on your day off."
good,"Not a lot of work to be done, a lot of nothing major to do. Slow paced."
good,FOPD department does not treating good for contractor. Salary or full -time employee is good. The management does not treat contractor good. Seems like unfair for contractor to work there.
good,"Job work / life  balance is comparable to other large corporations."
good,"Hard work is not appreciated, specifically when it comes to the logistics and L1 technician branch. Commitment to your job is not appreciated there. They would rather lay off a proficient employee, and keep someone who is unprofessional solely because he was getting paid a dollar or two less."
good,"While some of my days where busy from start to finish, there were many times where I would be stuck begging for work, but the higher ups would just ignore the requests. I on many occasions was told to do work that would just be thrown out and then have my job threatened because I was not working on important items. The job boasts great vacation and benefits but it is hard to negotiate any time off with these managers"
good,"I learned lots of stuffs here."
good,This is a very fast paced industry that requires quick thinking and the ability to juggle multiple tasks.
good,Lean aggressive environment.  Strong management.  Systems and work processes are not the most advanced but okay.  Co-workers are helpful and supportive.  Hardest part of the job is the aggressive environment.  Most enjoyable of the job is my role in coaching employees and managers.
good,"Good place to learn new skill."
good,Its good to work. Salary is very good and office is also good.There will be good learning curve and will have the fair opportunity to work on different aspects
good,Work life balance is good here. However the technologies and work culture purely depends on the project you work. Few are using latest where are few are using still old technologies.
good,"The business unit I was in was a great place to work. The company at the exec level is driven by  financial  objectives."
good,Typically worked around 47.5 hours a week while processing and pulling orders for customers. Very good working environment with other members of the shipping and finished good teams. Worked would vary from extremely busy requiring 12 hour days to very slow days with little to nothing to do.
good,"I really appreciate that the company allows flexibility in your workday and unlimited PTO. My co-workers are easy to work with, and I feel supported by team leads."
good,"This is a big company with a lot of employees and good benefits."
good,A typical work day at Broadcom is 8-5 and can be fast paced at times.  The environment is very friendly with a nice cafeteria and gym on campus for employees to enjoy but can be very business oriented and seem stuffy.  The offices seem too spaced out with only 2 or less people per office.  I would like more of an interactive environment.  The most enjoyable part of the day is the people in my team and working hard together.  If you have a good team here then you will love your job.
good,"Learnt quite a lot about the formal verification process."
good,"Broadcom has a good compensation system compared to its peers, however, the work/life balance is not great."
good,"Good place to work and learn. "
good,"Typical work day was busy, which was a good thing as it made your days fly bye. I worked in office services but had no real management to push you in a positive direction. That was probably the hardest part, trying to improve by taking classes but had no help. The most enjoyable part was the interaction with the co-workers."
good,Broadcom offers very high quality of work. The people are friendly and one has a lot of freedom to choose what one wants to work on. Salary is compatible with high end semiconductor industry.
good,Poor executive performance; challenging job; nice co-workers; many many meetings.
good,Evrything was good. Except was appointed as contractor and becoming permanent is very tight
good,No opportunity for growth.
good,Please refer to my work experience at CA Technologies. Broadcom was only a Transitional position for three months due to the acquisition of CA Technologies
good,On many occasions I did a lot of overtime and couldn’t spend time with my family. I also felt that with the amount of work asked of us the pay wasn’t equivalent.
good,"The company is financially run to hit quarterly targets.  Very focused on short term results.  The expectation for finance is to meet forecast with minimal variance, and to close the books with no issues.  No benefit to additional proactive, ad-hoc work."
good,"benefit is good, work life balance.every day not busy and follow the group process. company has very good immigration policy. "
good,I enjoy working at Broadcom because of my friendship with my manager. He tried to be the buffer between me and upper management. I would recommend for people to work at Broadcom
good,"Not applicable, Broadcom acquired CA Technologies, terminated a large percentage of its employees, and retained most of the remaining employees for temporary transition."
good,"The server business was a great idea to enter, but they cancelled the project and let all the good people go."
good,Broadcom is nice place to work. You get a chance to work with sharp minds and always on edge of technology. They offer good compensation and benefits.
good,"Typical day at work is busy all day.  Workplace culture is very bad."
good,"The company is always buying and selling other division. every year we had layoffs. Classic broadcom use to be a great company but after Avago acquisition, everything went down"
good,"Great place to be a shareholder, not so good to be an employee!  Was a great place to work before merger.  Now it's all about numbers and share holder return."
good,"Overall temp job was good. Gave me all the experience I needed in order to become full time with Broadcom."
good,The work life balance at this company is very low. There us a lot of strees working extended hours at this company. The job is unsecurity.
good,"Pretty good. I worked as a summer intern and they had an easy going management style, interesting projects, and flexible hours. Would definitely work here again"
good,"Good company to work for. Good work-life balance, but too many consolidations in the last two years has had a negative impact on employees' morale."
good,"A good productive based company having good culture worked on as a intern with a good management having strict dead lines to deliver , As a fresher learnt lot of things"
good,"It  software and hardware"
good,"New Broadcom management brought in some good changes, but also swiped out some good people.  "
good,Good place to work. Great team and team culture. Driven. Several Market leading products and opportunities to work with great customers.
good,"Interns get to work on actual everyday projects that regular employees are working on, hence you get to interact with lot of people. Company has a good number of technically strong teams. But management is not so great . Company can do better."
good,Broadcom has a Quasi-startup culture with a good environment to learn. There are great people to learn from. I worked with a very supportive group.
good,Fun work place with supportive team. People are friendly and co-operative. Poiltics at upper layer at management.The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my teammates and learning from them.
good,"Heavy workload during project time"
good,Really like the company. Day to day AP processing. I've learned a lot from this company. Everything was great. Everyone in the company was really nice. We had potluck at the end of every month.
good,"I am currently working as a part-time contractor of 20 hours a week but was originally hired as a full-time that only lasted 2 weeks before there was a department change. There are no current reqs for full time and no opportunities here for me."
good,"The company provides a good work life balance and good work environment for it's employees. Employees usually get a lot of freedom to implement their ideas and thoughts. Not too much workplace politics and engineers are usually busy with projects to work on."
good,Broadcom has lots of talented engineer but higher managers are not so strong to be able to lead the company
good,"Great company to work for with good benefit, flexible hours, competitive technology and multi-culture environment"
good,It's good place to work with pleasure engineers with pretty good manager.
good,It was a good experience for me. As it is my first company I have learnt so many things here.
good,"Very helpful team and manager. Very easy atmosphere to blend it to. Good colleagues, great learning experience."
good,"- Nice environment to work"
good,Challenging  role with hectic work schedules. adsdfs hggfhgf kjkkj
good,"Will recommend working at the company. I have immensely learnt about technical knowledge, co-workers are good to work . Hardest part is being able to cooperate with every one at the same time. Learning curve will be monotonously increasing and a challenging job."
good,"There are always good things about a big company, mostly the benefits and perks, but when it takes (seemingly) 20 people to get something done that you know could be done more efficiently, it's frustrating."
good,"• Working as Software Quality Assurance/Certification Engineer at BROADCOM, a semiconductor based wired and wireless communication company from MAY 2010 to till date"
good,"I only worked for Broadcom for 3 months, following an acquisition. During that time, they were professional and seemed organized. "
good,"My experience was prior to the Avago acquisition, things have likely changed since then. Recommend looking into the CEO's currently take on IT before committing to this company. Entire IT budget was slashed by 50% with multiple layoffs which was major reason I left this company."
good,The work was stable and relatively easy but any recognition for extra effort goes mostly unnoticed and improvements to a process are relatively slow. The 12 hr shift with 3-4 days off a week were really nice though.
good,"A learning environment, but in all companies there will always be a slight disconnect with managers and engineers and supervisors.  It is a competitive environment."
good,I enjoyed working for Broadcom. I was challenged by the level of responsibility and scope of work. Then the acquisition of Avago changed our path. All Operations was moved to Malaysia
good,Benefit is ok. pay above average. but most of coworker is greater than 40 years old. not very aggressive. good for people who wants a stable job. fixed bonus.
good,"Overall, they just got an engineer from other company without training engineers. People there are not open to exchange idea."
good,"Company culture is OK, depends on your manager,"
good,The organization is driven by business not by technology. It is sort of franchise system. Overall corporate performance  might be prospective by merging software companies rather than chip companies. I am wondering if the existing products can sustain the competitiveness in the future.
good,"high learning curve, environment provides a lot of learning to be done, engineering teams are really organized and well structured, there was loss of vision between engineering and management operations."
good,Broadcom Corporation is a big sized company. Enough opportunites to grow and also has a decent compensation plan.
good,"An interesting job with a great knowledge learning experience, amazing work atmosphere. Though work-life balance and fun activiities were less"
good,The upper management make all the decision of who will get the good compensation and rating.  The direct manager has no input for your compensation/rating of your work.
good,"this is the first time i have worked a graveyard shift and this shift at broadcom is very relaxed and easy,  however, if you are thinking about working graveyard at any place i recommend you think really hard about it."
good,Broadcom WLAN team operates like a start up.  Lots of work.  Good technology.
good,"I worked as a Intern for 8 month and really enjoyed my tenure. I was responsible for testing various chip and assisting engineers, but given the opportunity  I started coding and developed application which was appreciated by everyone. I will recommend anyone to work with this company at any point of career."
good,"Would really enjoy working for Broadcom again. Management was fair, always opportunity to advance. The company really cares for and takes care of their employees."
good,"Broadcom culture is to run lean. Don't expect much from Broadcom, they care about numbers and nothing else. It's an okay place to work if you don't expect a fancy office. Not a place I wanted to work for."
good,"If you keep your mouth shut and do the bare minimum you will keep your job. Suck up to management to get ahead ,slow paced job no real job advancement. Lost a lot of perks and don't see them coming back with the clowns in charge at the moment."
good,"If you had problems with co workers whom were best friends with the supervisors you wouldn't get any help from your bosses. They would edit time cards so upper management wouldn't get suspicious. Then in the case of harassment, if they were apart of upper management they would block your opportunities for advancement for reporting inappropriate actions or advances."
good,"When I start my shift, I was given a number of job requests from Engineers.  I would test those job requests according to Engineers' instructions. At the end of the shift, I would notify or update my report on what I have done during my shift to Engineers and my manager.  The job itself was enjoyable, I work with minimal to no supervision and I'm very comfotable in this kind  of work environment."
good,"Depending on your role at Broadcom, your experience will be either be incredible or miserable. Most of that is due to poor management in some departments; Otherwise, it is a great place to work. Good benefits, good work-life balance (for some). The good jobs there are great, but the jobs within a poorly managed department will have you de-motivated, looking for a new job."
good,"Comprehensive training programs"
good,long hour of working. no vision or bad vision of Sr management team at least for mobile platform solution team.
good,"Good place to work if you are single. ""Unlimited vacation"" means you will be lucky to get two weeks off during the year. Management has a habit of canceling leave with little notice."
good,A company which focuses highly on execution and deliverables. Work hard and party harder environment. Excellent engineering and sales team.
good,Broadcom had an excellent vacation program before 2016.  Enjoyed working with other campuses in North America. A very technically oriented company.  Project intensive with high expectations and goals.
good,Always encouraging good teamwork. People work together well and solve problems. People are professional and kind to each other.
good,"As the Sr. Manager, Global Real Estate for Broadcom Corporation I directed all the real estate services throughout North America, Europe, and Asia for one hundred three (103) facilities..."
good,We tend to know a lot of new things from the expertise people over here
good,Work was long and hours were good benefits were good the peers you work with are good people dealing with engineers could be a little hard to deal with due to the language barrier but manageable.
good,"Good compensation and benefits. Not very much socializing at the workplace. People keep to themselves. Overall, great place to work if you just want to come in, do your job and leave."
good,The work environment is challenging with talented staff.  Success is rewarded well.  The design team is internationally distributed.  Management is committed to maintaining leadership position.
good,"The company is primarily focused on non-organic growth, choosing to expand market reach by acquisition and innovation in small niches. This makes for a very nimble and agile company that responds to constant change while maintining customer loyalty."
good,I found Broadcom to be a good place to work.  The company culture was varied as there were several acquired companies working together but overall managed strived to make it better.
good,they also provide company shuttle in the 22nd station and bridgeport locations. the most enjoyable part is that you can do work from home but i think depends on the team.
good,Exceptional place to work with a lot of intelligent to ask help from. Need time to grow within the organization and requires patience. THe work life balance is a little out of whack but the compensation is very good right now.
good,Broadcom is a good company that is located in Silicon Valley with lots of experienced enginneer and managers. They have the state of the art of technology in semiconductor industry.
good,Used to a good place to work. Not anymore. Cut cost for everything. Less R&D. Pay is good compare to other companies. Company main goal is make wall street happy.
good,Working at broadcom was a great experience. Got to connect with amazing and very talented people. Would love to work with broadcom in the future. Good benefits.
good,"The team works closely with each other. The work environment is nice. But the location is a bit far from the Skytrain, and only a few public transit gets there."
good,"Had an amazing time working in the 60GHz 11ad project. "
good,Good company with lot of talented people. I did my coop work and learnt lot of new stuff. Flexible work hours as long as the things get done on time..
good,"I had a great time in my internship at Broadcom, and was able to learn everything from the ground up. The fellow staff were accommodating, and the flexible hours worked very well with my unpredictable class schedule as a full time student."
good,Helps in learning new dimensions in your career. Work culture promotes aggressiveness and productive work culture. They provide good salary and benefits.
good,"Broadcom, the best part is most of divisions work like a startup. Their typical model is to do everything (hardware/SW) that is needed to design a chip in one location."
good,"Nice work place with lot of focus on technology and deliverable s mixed with entertainment and parties. "
good,"Structured management position of administration team. Performance evaluations based on the needs and expectations of VPs and Directors. Administrative trainings and team buildings for immediate team as well as event planning of campus events. Sponsored special campus projects such as battery recycling, CPR training and building emergency plan."
good,"Broadcom is not the place it once was. The stock has the potential to do well, but given all of their current layoffs, the employees don't have any job security."
good,Great place to work/intern. Very nice people. Extremely good place to intern and learn for an student. Good cafeteria !
good,"Great place to work with many opportunities to learn and network with brilliant talents."
good,"Broadcom has a lot of experienced engineers, not many entry-level engineers though. The company is going through merge and lots of people left the company recently."
good,Good people to work with and state of the art wireless technology.  Design and creative people are out of the box thinkers
good,Great company to work for. That is why I have been here for over 8yrs. I will recommend it any day. Enhanced my analytical skills in a team based environment.
good,Broadcom is a fast paced company that requires the very best out of each employee.  In my time with Broadcom I was able to make some life long friends and achieve things that propelled me further in my finance career.
good,Worked with many brilliant engineers who taught me much about the industry. Some managers bogged down by politics and nepotism. Overall a good company to work for.
good,"- Good place for students to intern."
good,Good company with a strong engineering culture and nice benefits.
good,Management has high expectation and expects everyone to go above and beyond their on their efforts.
good,Broadcom is a great place to work and learn from others. The place is diverse with people from different technology background.
good,My manager was active in my learning and growing as a programmer. Most interns are masters students.
good,Manager and coworkers are extremely knowledgeable and friendly.
good,"Job Description:"
good,Nice manager and colleagues. Technology is not that great but is OK.
good,". working with customer issues"
good,"I had pursued my internship in Broadcom as ""IC Simulation / ASIC Verification Intern"". I was responsible for simulating the designs at various abstraction levels and maintaining overnight regressions. I got the opportunity to work closely with design and verification teams for error-debugging and functional verification. During the course of my internship, i learned UVM-SystemVerilog Test Bench development, perl/shell scripting and got exposed to the industry standard simulation tools like IUS, VCS etc."
good,Great people
good,The company runs 24/7 and has offices all around the world. We support nearly 15000 employees.
good,I joined at the time when Avago was acquiring Broadcom. Hence there were lot of layoff and instability. But the team was amazing and management was as helpful as they can
good,"the environment is very friendly , but the communication could be better. the project planning is not made with everyone involved.  very good team building"
good,"A typical day at work consists of responding to unplanned down equipment and working on PM's. I work on assignments that are complex in nature and require judgment, initiative, and technical/specialized knowledge to resolve problems and/or develop recommended solutions. I effectively complete the established procedures in a precise and efficient manner, with strict adherence to the documented process and procedure. I use the importance of understanding of robust data driven solutions and key performance metrics utilizing the existing data modules (SQCS, CMMS, data mining/management skills)"
good,"I worked here as a project consultant through my affiliated business school. Therefore I don't have enough insight to rank or give comments on the culture, management, etc."
good,"Lots of freedoms, but a very feverish pace of work. If your group does well at there job and in the market, you will be reworded well. Very nice campus."
good,You would be working with some of the brilliant minds around the globe.The work is fast paced and maintaining the work/life balance is often difficult.Exposure is great and you would get to learn a lot from your peers and management.
good,"A great place to work until company was sold to Avago."
good,"day to day, i love my job, I was an operator of tools, then moved on to being a tech with in a year, great place to get started in the industry.  However advancing is not so good when it comes to wages.  Quarterly bonuses have been cut as well."
good,"Good to work with talented people. "
good,Broadcom is a great company to work for. The learning and technical exposure one would get is highly valuable. Fun and Open culture.
good,I have a great management and team. I enjoy working here. I share and learn knowledge from each other. I love to stay with this company but unfortunately our product is not price comparative with our competitor the company decided to close our division in Markham Canada.
good,"Nice place to work with huge technology happenings always."
good,"here you will have aggressive startup goals, but with great corporate culture. "
good,"Supportive colleagues"
good,"High quality of engineers keeps everyone on their toes."
good,The salary and benefits packages are very good. The work is challenging and there is always more to do. Schedules are tight and most projects and teams are under-staffed with good engineers. They do make good products.
good,"except they got hammered by qualcomm"
good,"Great company and culture. Tough city to have a family in, but great place to live in as a single person."
good,"Great place to work but once business slows down they will start cutting any temp workers. Company cracks down on attendance more than work ethic. as long as you show up, the company is happy. If you work here I highly suggest that you always show up and don't work so hard that you burn yourself out and need to call in for mental health days, or your days here are numbered."
good,"Good place to work in terms of stability . Main problem of company  - too many aquisitions, sometimes people do not correspond the required qualification, because jumping from one project to other and similar management problems."
good,"Ideal for growth"
good,"Broadcom is a challenging place to work where much is expected from you, but the compensation makes it worth it. One is expected to put in a considerable number of extra hours, but it is recognized when the customer is pleased by the work of an individual. I was able to hone skills in new areas as well as apply my many years of experience to the tasks given. The best part of the job was working with those around me in the office, all top notch professionals."
good,"If you love semiconductors and everything that makes them tick then this is the place for you! The company is filled with thousands of brilliant computing geniuses and advanced mathematicians.

good,"Learned a lot about techincal knowledge"
good,Fun place to work. I worked at Broadcom for 1 year as an intern.
good,"Broadcom is a good company for people who like to play with technologies.  However, the top management lacks of visions.  They had committed lots of strategic mistakes that are gradually eroding its technology advantages.  At the engineering team level, you usually get good teamwork without much politics."
good,Moderate to fast-paced environment.   Great co-workers and most management.  Good variety in duties.
good,"Hectic, fun and challenging at all levels. Great benefits."
good,This company has allowed me to implement and expand my set of skills. My manager is hands-off and allows us to complete our work without reporting to him on a daily basis. I favor this type of management because it allows me to dedicate myself entirely to personal assignments rather than accomplishing mundane tasks like writing up a daily report. This review is entirely personal and does not reflect all Broadcom employees; in fact there are several managers that do implement a very hands-on procedure. The most difficult part of this job is communicating. Engineers often disregard my requests and do not find time to respond until it directly affects them - in which case it becomes urgent for all parties. I do enjoy
good,"Broadcom WAS an amazing company to work for. Recently the management change and work slowed down. They are only worried about being competitive, hours were cut and benefits started to dwindle. Any “perk” that Broadcom offered started to disappear. They used to take care of employees now it seems they couldn’t care less."
good,Great company to work with. CEO delivers. People are collaborative due to division bonus opportunities. Bonus payout scheme is well-defined and generous. Business units are lean so there is less bureaucracy. Employees affected by RIF are given months ahead notice so they can look for internal or external career opportunities. Managers are authorized to recommend RIF'ed employees externally.
good,"This job requires the ability to work for 12.25 hours straight, getting anywhere between 10,000 to 30,000 steps per shift depending on the area. The job as an operator involves working with multiple tool-sets that range in difficulty from easy to learn to difficult. Some tool sets take two to three weeks to learn where others take six to nine months. You must multitask at all times in order to keep up with the fast pace."
good,"Everything depends on the project you work on as teams are spread across the globe and may require long work hours."
good,Broadcom was known as LSI when i joined them and was a very enjoyable place to work. They took very good of their employees and generous benefits

good,Innovative company; great place to work. Good people to work with. Very successful company with great achievements and high expectations.
good,Good company to work with. Lots of opportunities for the freshers. They have great working hour flexibility. Most of the management decisions are taken from HQ in US.
good,I was an intern so I can't tell much but since I have known the company I have seen many layoffs including some of my friends. The company is a stable company but work for me in that company was pretty boring and I think this was my case since I was just an intern and helping out a test engineer.
good,"The entire time there, up until the last six months, was great.  The work was challenging, and each day there was something new.  A lot of work was accomplished."
good,"Provide flexibility to work/life balance, great colleague and working environment."
good,"Very good:- "

good,Good company to work for.  Good benefits and support. There is alot of support work and diversified areas to work with.  The CEO has eliminated a lot of the useless paperwork (like vacation).

good,Provides good compensation and benefit. Overall has maintained a good management team and workplace culture over the years.The hardest part of the job is 12 hour shifts.
good,"This place is volatile in terms of the job security.  There is very stiff competition in the company's market, hence they have to roll out new product as soon as possible. Work culture is good but people don't work on innovative things quite often."
good,I worked with good people.  AWS work schedule was not conducive for family but it afforded 3 and 4 day weekends.  12 hour shifts are tough especially nights.  Management was fair.  Learned a lot over my career.
good,"Broadcom is a company that has a lot of talented engineers and they usually works very hard. The benefit is realistic and fair, the new managements take good care of hard-working engineers."
good,Broadcom is a company that focuses very much on their engineering and technical aspects. As someone who is coming from a business background I found it difficult at times to share my creativity.
good,Productive int the sense that the company finds balance between serving clients and daily well being of its own employees. This helps drive productivity even higher.
good,Leaning towards shareholders benefit only. Reduced investment in R&D. Help the industry by investing in R&D and broadening ecosystem by helping new companies.
good,"The alternative work schedule is a big plus in the work-life balance.  Some compensation policies discourage good workers from trying to move up."
good,"Fast paced, given responsibility, great place to learn many technical areas. Because of acquisitions and M&A activities, sometimes the workload can be heavy, and direction not crystal clear to all."
good,One of the few large companies left in the Orange County area. Great work life balance. Excellent benefits. Loved the team I worked with. Top class engineers.
good,"Nice place to work with decent pay and pretty good work life balance, depends on manager though."
good,"It a very high standardised place to work,"
good,It's been a very good job and most of the supervisors really try to support operators. Very little micro-managing and willing to flex schedules for school. I've been there nine years and there are many who have been there much longer.
good,Overall a good company to work for with highly talented work force.  Change is always happening and can be overwhelming.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people in your immediate work group.
good,"I have been working at Qualcomm full-time (More than 3 years)"

good,"Learned  lot of thing, such as managing work-life balance."
good,Everything was nice until the buy out. That when this place really tanked. I think I would still be there today if they had not got bought out.
good,Strong high technology exposure with an opportunity to develop systems/solutions in a fast paced environment. Company growth was faster than the operating methods and procedure development. This offered challenges not usually seen in a mature company.
good,"Work hard, play hard.  You get out what you put in.  Great group of hard working people.  Company is being bought so culture will change along with G&A cuts."
good,"Innovative technology and good work/life balance, very nice working environment, friendly coworkers, free soda and coffee;"
good,"A typical day in current position would start with me checking my e-mails and seeing what would need to be done for the day, or if any hosts need troubleshooting in the data center. I would then make sure all the hosts are up in running and periodically check on them throughout the day. We would usually get new equipment to rack, power, and cable in the data center. We would first need to plan out where this equipment would go (ex. what rack/section/location) figure out what cable it would need, and find out what circuits we would hook them up to. Once we find that out and get it done, we follow with the engineer to which the host belongs to. We would make sure everything is good on their end and make sure it's up and running. I've learned a lot since working as a data center technician for Broadcom. I have learned how to installed servers, all different sizes and brands ranging from Dell to HP to Isilon and learned how to cable them as well. Also learned how to troubleshoot Cisco and Brocade switched. Management has always been helpful when it comes to walking me through a process I might not understand, and will go into detail to make sure we are on the same page. I get along with my co-workers very well and we work on many projects individually as well as together. The hardest part of the job may just not understanding how to troubleshoot new equipment that comes in that we may not have ever worked with before. Times like that is when troubleshooting or installments take longer. Most enjoyable part of the job is learning and soaking up as much knowledge as I can."
good,At Broadcom I had a great opportunity work with some of the most talented people in the industry.  It was truly a unique experience to see a company steal a way market share from its competitor in such a short time.

good,"Perform carrier certification for ATT and TMO"
good,It is a good company to work for with an above average work-life balance. I worked there for more than 10 years and went through several layoffs.  The company seems lack of vision.  It made too many failed acquisitions before it was acquired by Avago.

good,A typical day at work begins with checking out emails and making sure all validation reports are in place. The learning is great here since we are working with industry experts.
