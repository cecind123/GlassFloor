rating,review
bad,"Bad environment, leadership is only worried about numbers. No work life balance and not fair treatment. No equal pay , very disrespectful when u speak on unethical practices"
bad,They don't know how to treat staff....the only thing that is important there is the drama....the manager was rude and didn't seem to care to be there most times.
bad,"YUM! brands is a terrible company to work for. They don’t care about employees or managers. All managers are over worked and underpaid, overlooked and unappreciated."
bad,Management is horrible. You do not get a raise even if you do what you’re supposed to. They act like they’re above you in life and customers have no respect for you as a human being.
bad,"Burn it down and re build it....don’t understand why they keep past there inspections.."
bad,"I would never, will never, EVER recommend this as a friendly work space. The employees are rude, the managers sit behind their phones most of the time and leave everything for everyone else. and the humiliate you in front of customers when you try to explain to them something is wrong. they hang training over your head and taunt you with it, and they put off things they swear up and down they are going to get around to but don't until you quit."
bad,"This place had really horrible management, nobody wanted to work. Every 5 minutes the workers would go outside to smoke a cigarette. This job is very unprofessional"
bad,"like a highschool, management was lazy, understaffed and overworked, the GM made unwelcome advances on me (i was 17 he was 35) and corporate + district manager swept it under the rug. the hours are never set and ever changing and the pay so low it’s not worth it. especially with literal trauma happening and everyone turning a blind eye even after my mother called the district manager and corporate."
bad,Ehh.. it’s alright but nothing to make a career out of. Work environment varies depends on manager every manager has their own way of doing things. Poorly executed with how things are expected to be done again depends on who you work with.
bad,Taco Bell and KFC is a fast paced work environment that requires a lot of patience and customer service skills. You are overworked and poorly paid in my personal experience.
bad,"This is an okay first job, it’s just not something you can make a living off of. Management is the worst part but this is a good job if your still in school. It’s just not a career."
bad,"packing orders 8 hours a day "
bad,I’m a very hard working young lady have been working in the fast food field for 7 years very reliable and dependable also very outgoing and friendly have great customer service and communication skills
bad,KFC was the worst place I have ever worked in my life. The management is made up clowns and they don't know how to properly run the workplace. I don't understand why they have such a hard time running a place that a six year old could run.
bad,"The Most awful place i have ever worked at. the other worker do not follow code, they do not wash their hands, they are not nice and dont clean the area so the building is disgusting and the pay is awful overall a terrible place to work."
bad,"regularly scheduled full time hours on paper, but when paid, was docked excessively for breaks we were not allowed to take. "
bad,I worked at this Pizza Hut for lack of any other jobs in the area...We ran the store as best we could with what support we got from Corp Yum....which was not much more than telling us everything was always bad....I don't recommend working for Yum unless last resort
bad,"Absolutely ridiculous rate of pay.  Works out on average to be a little above $6 an hour.  It is a turnstile job, especially now that they do contracted at-home positions.  People are even more like slaves now while their big CEO's rake in the profits off the dumbed down and highly unhealthy population."
bad,You will be given a task and then told not to complete it. A week late you will be reprimanded for not completing that task. You do not get a chance to explain your self before being written up management has zero idea what they are doing
bad,"No real development so desperate for employees an managers that they break there own policy about family members one shift was caught giving away product an was just moved to another location an now is an assistant manager. The training traveling manager never around to help with new policies, the area coaches or districts never or hardly ever CV kme stores as example my store had review in December by old area coach new one still hasn't done one. No accountability among higher manager staff frustrating job but your guaranteed to almost be unfixable if your management. They have shift who always discounts money's off an unable preform as a shift but still shift."
bad,My experience at taco bell was horrible. I was able to learn everything fairly easy becaude I had to show myself everything. I was hospitalized due to having two heat strokes while at work within a month apart from each other.
bad,"Too much drama, poor management, dehumanizing work enviroment."
bad,"I always got my things done right after closing. I would end up helping other employees just for things to do, cause I dont like standung around doing nothing."
bad,learn to make Taco Bells orders. Love the friends i made there along with the recent customers who always put a smile on your face.Bad Attitude Managers.
bad,"Although YUM Brands promotes the environment and workplace as an ""employees"" first workplace with the change in leadership this philosophy is seldom followed.  Basically they regard employees as a warm body filling a seat."
bad,Upper-management were not open to ideas on how to make stores run more efficiently and compensation that Pizza Hut pays is pitiful and embarrassing.
bad,Management leaders were unfair and not giving an opportunity to develop and learn business. Employees complaint to management excessively. There was no fun working in a hostile environment.
bad,Horrible management which made the environment dreadful to work in. Talking to other drivers and cooks was nice though. Pay is low for what you do. Don’t get breaks. It’s based off of if someone orders or not. Very rushed.
bad,I would recommend no one ever applying or working for Taco Bell it is not a good company to work for  they treat you unhuman and uneducated I only treat you with such disrespect and untrusting
bad,"A typical day of worked required a lot of energy physically and mentally to make sure the store was running properly as there was not a lot of support from higher up managers. Objects and store machines would break down constantly leaving a dangerous work place including no heat, broken exhaust fans, broken fryers, tiles, washrooms, etc. They take great advantage of the staff by not having a lot of people working at once but also being a very high demanding job in making sure you're serving customers but cleaning, and doing many other job tasks at once with once again, no help or support. If you tried to do something on your own the RGM would give you heck for even trying. The only enjoyable part of my job with serving the customers as I enjoyed the encounters with regulars and customers who were understanding of job. If there were any issues with customers I was able to resolve the issues with no further problems. "
bad,I would enter the place and it would be filthy from the previous shift but I did not cook unless I cleaned my kitchen I hated that they didn't prep for the night shift
bad,"Though I did get hired within two days of applying, the management was terrible. Even when this was my first job, I wasn't properly trained. When I ask questions or a more detailed explanation to do my work properly, I wouldn't get a clear or proper answer. Sometimes I don't even get my 15 minute break, I only worked there for a little over a month."
bad,This auburn ma location was the worst place to work ever no communication at all no positive feed back all negative if your sick you work threatened to be fired for trying to call out with a fever or throwing up rgm carol Harvard worst part of Tbell KFC period
bad,The managers that ran it weren’t professional at all. They know that they are powerless but not with the hiring process. So they don’t try keeping some people that should stay but not making a decision for a team that work together and is a team. Or firing someone that told them every step of the way that I wasn’t leaving and then terminated for what ended up her making the moment to make a spiteful choice.
bad,learned on how to talk to people- worked while i was in school. lots of hours to choose from. a lot of friends worked there- they hired anyone.
bad,They never work with you on your schedule . You will have to be there when they say even if you ask off . I personally had a bad experience here I worked here 8 years .stayed because I needed a pay check .
bad,This is.a job for.teenagers. customers r rude. Staff are underpaid. Not all employers there.were bad. Seems alot of employs got away with not.being a team player.
bad,"It was over a decade ago, and I have hopes that management has changed!"
bad,"I worked at Yum Restaurant support center in the IT department for 10 1/2 years. There were huge layoffs and 2009 and I was affected. They now continually layoff people. Instead of keeping the best and brightest, they keep the good ole boys. If you like playing politics, you'll love it here. They have a few people who are the 'darlings' of the organization. Those few 'stars' are continually promoted. Not based on merit, but how much they rub noses with upper management. Too many games, too many Yum cheers, and not enough honesty."
bad,As a new employee there I never got the proper training. I was always in trouble because I did not know how to do anything because nobody had taught me. My manager never helped me when asked for it. She always stayed in the office and either talked on her phone to unknown people or cried for unknown reasons. It was very chaotic there. Every just would run around and nobody stayed in there designated area they were supposed to run.
bad,"The management was aggressive, managers fought between each other and would often yell at customers, they wouldn't cooperate with schedule and often kept us there later than scheduled."
bad,"it was a good first job for someone who needs the extra cash or just has bills to pay, however the people there are not worth working with unless you like drama"
bad,"love my co workers"
bad,It was a hard day of labor and not being compensated for it. Hard to keep employees motivated. Very long hours with no breaks. Hard to keep up with making orders because not appropriately staffed.
bad,"Upper management expected unrealistic goals that the general management forced to the point where half of the store quit. Nobody can make 36 tacos, 40 burritos and 10 drinks in under a minute and 45 seconds. The store was also constantly understaffed, there were many times where I had worked alone with a shift manager for an entire shift."
bad,"I liked my duties at this job i just wish everybody was on the same page there at that time. I cooked my chicken and and prepped my food, cleaned up at the end of the day and went home."
bad,Way too stressful for a high school job and management was not understanding in the slightest about sick days or school time. Wouldn't recommend as a first job.
bad,Management doesn't trust employees. There is no work life balance and you're expected to do the job and on call schedule of 7 people with only 3 (after the others all quit).  Unless you work at the Yum HQ in Kentucky you miss out on many of the perks and it appears you won't be considered for advancement.  After 3 managers in as many years it's apparent they have no overall strategy and attempt to implement untested infrastructure into what should be a stable environment.
bad,Work environment favorable but work life balance very compromised. it gives you great experience with clients and employees .
bad,"I really enjoyed my job until corporate sold eight of our stores to franchise then we lost raises promised, benefits decreased but costed more, lost college reimbursement, changed rgm from salary to hourly back to salary in one month still owing us money. Lost or half bonuses changed..... I will not get into the fact you became your own tech if something broke and the lost of labor hours had caused a major turnover in crew members. The new company motto is less is more."
bad,"This Company does not hold true to who they say they are when being recruited or on-boarded. Yum prides themselves on Culture and People Development, but when it comes down to it they have poor Culture Leaders and poor People Development practices. Additionally, if you're not one to appreciate regular change than this company certainly isn't for you. Because of the mass amount of consistent change, the organization lacks clear vision and struggles with alignment from the top down resulting in lack of personal development, confusion in work assignments, wasted time, efforts and resources thus leading to poor employee engagement. As such creating an environment that lacks transparency and trust."
bad,"long and exhausting hours of work.  management preaches taking care of people but not driven.  Company has good benefit package, offer free lunch, paid vacation and holidays"
bad,"the corporation itself is a good place to work for, they provide vacation pay to full time team members offer insurance, etc. Have incentives for making things better. The down side is most managers do not follow through with the corporation's wishes and procedures they want to follow. Not too many people know the meaning of the word accountability, and to keep personal behaviors out of the business."
bad,"TERRIBLE!!! wage is horrendous for doing so many hours, it is so physically and mentally draining DO NOT RECOMMEND. waste of time working here, not good"
bad,Paducah KFC taco Bell has absolutely no family values what so ever and it is not a friendly environment staff very hateful all managers but the GM were amazing but the GM was rude mean and had no family values
bad,"Place is not friendly, they don't honor hours assigned.The managers were not respectful to the crew members. Overall, wasn't the best first time job. May work better for seasoned people."
bad,"The KFC/Taco Bell I worked in for up to two years was sadly like watching a car crash in slow motion. Problems built up over months, issues sprung out of the floor like unkept weeds, and the management never seemed to improve. Rules are disregarded on the daily, and the physical/mental wellbeing of their employees is hardly noted in any of their actions."
bad,"I've stuck with it for almost 4 years while i was in college, most of the managers are pretty bad. They don't know how to call for chicken or anything."
bad,It was a job till I found a better one. Had some good managers and some bad ones to. Just not the job for me had to find better haven’t been back since I left
bad,"Could do an much aprovement with staff, Great food but very stressful at times .. Not enough staff and not even support that should be there if you want to have a strong team,"
bad,Horrible management. Doesn’t think about others only cares about what’s good for her. Doesn’t work around outside schedules like dr appts or death in the family
bad,"You learn that it's the company's standards above customer satisfaction. Quite contradictory from the Colonel's original vision. Managers would either side with customers that caused commotion or with co-workers of the same race. And it wasn't just me but a few others who felt the same treatment from playing favorites. They will take advantage of your willingness to cover shifts. They allow this. And they allow entrance level employees to do managerial tasks like full inventory and maintenance of machines, with the bare minimum wage and no benefits. No chance for career advancement unless you know the store manager."
bad,Horrible managers. My managers were changing every week and each of them had different rules and approaches. Staff were not kind to each other and severely underpaid.
bad,"I walk in and clock in go to the back get prepared for the shift by counting the safe, making sure everyone is where they need to be, and counting the food. I have one of the cashiers count a drawer and put it in their name and we prepare until rush hits us. After rush we prepare more food if needed, stock, clean. The hardest part of the day is dealing with the managers constantly yelling at you while they are standing around. However the most enjoyable part of the day is that you got through the day with nothing drastic happening(hopefully)."
bad,"Some of the people working there were awesome. But the head boss is lazy and over all mean person at times. Not a safe job, poor customer attitude, bad work vibe. I have PTSD, i found my friend. Dead from a suicide, and was threatened to be fired cuz i couldnt do my job for a few days. I couldn't talk to people. And even tho im technically disabled because of my PTSD i lost my job."
bad,It was a good company to have communication skills development. I started with this Org & developed my skill in public speaking & communications.
bad,"The managment is awful. People that actually come to work and never miss work are unappreciated and don't get hours, yet the people that are constantly late and always miss work get the hours. The GM is rude, belittling and disrespectful."
bad,"Working with yum brands gave me a lot of experience in physical work and production, however it was extremely limiting in advancement or paying employees proper wages for the amount of work that we were required to do on a daily basis. We felt that the wages were not enough for the volume of attention that each store required as well as the customers. management was often poorly handled"
bad,"Owners do not put much care into the store. It’s falling apart and nothing is ever done. General manager works only days during the week and is not flexible with hours, giving all the unwanted/night shifts to young managers still learning how to lead shifts."
bad,Crew was very immature and unorganized. It was really embarrassing to have to hear the manager yell at someone every day. My last year of highschool did not need to get anyone stressful.
bad,"Very slow customer service, employees acted with lack of respect for the customers and many issues would occur during work. Management wasn't the best some barely spoke English so they let anyone get away with anything. The general manager lacked respect for his employees."
bad,"Nice people, poor work/life balance.  Company is growth focused.  opportunities to advance may exist."
bad,"Constant infighting between brands and corporate.  Poor technical leadership from people who were at company forever yet unqualified for the positions they held.  Chew up skilled, new people while legacy staff positions itself and plays political games.   Data Center outsourcing was a disaster and had to be reversed.   Promoting unqualified secretaries to leadership positions led to much resentment, poor decisions, and eye-rolling."
bad,"Please only apply to work here if you can read minds and don't mind being told that leadership will walk over your dead body then KFC US the the perfect place to work. I loved working here until it started to feel like I was in a prison chain gang, the leadership is boys club of a certain pedigree only."
bad,No work life balance. It is exactly what the stereotypes lead you to believe. There are some excellent people there but you honestly can't trust anyone.
bad,I worked as a receptionist and the mangers always made me do the washing despite the fact there were other receptionist they would always make me do it. I got food poisoning from there from the staff meal which lasted 2days . The pay is terrible. If you are under 18 I wouldn’t recommend it since it’s minimum wage. They also send you home early and tell you not to bother coming in to top it off. Overall it’s the worst experience
bad,"typical day was stressful... "
bad,"As the GM, P&L, inventory, sales, and strong leadership. How to run my own business. Could always count on them, most of the time. New and always training. New hires. Holidays"
bad,"Hardly any customers which means no tips for the server. Managers were constantly changing for dumb random reasons, one manager even gave employees a hard time since they were teenagers. The new manager even cut my hours to barley nothing."
bad,Could've been a fun place to work but fast food is hard and it's hard to keep the restaurant clean. Long hours and late night shifts. No work/life balance.
bad,"At the time I worked there, the organization was primarily corporately owned, I hear now it has been franchised out. The job was extremely difficult, and above store leadership had little support with hiring, HR, LP and operations."
bad,"The atmosphere is great, very exciting, the employees are all amazing and love their jobs. The managers are a bit too relaxed and it makes it difficult to stand out and be noticed. The work was not very challenging and was very easy to learn. I would recommend this place to anyone that doesn't mind a more time consuming pace to reach the executive team."
bad,Everything was great until they sold us off to an outsourcing company.
bad,Need to pay more money to employees! All the employees not just management. Moolah Cash deNiro Clams Scheckles Green Benjamins Jacksons Franklins pay!
bad,"I would come into work, change into my uniform, and proceed to go to the cash register to clock in. If none of my favorite coworkers are there that day the whole shift would be a nightmare."
bad,I did not get the proper help from upper management at my location. Training was substandarded and resources were limited.
good,At first when you get there it’s easy because you had time to stock and get orders together but during lunch and after five things started to get a little over whelming and people are yelling and just expecting you to do so many jobs at once.
good,get to work and make sure night crew has actually done their job. have a assistant on a power trip. hardest to deal with is don't know how day to day is going to be. I love my co workers they are great
good,"Management was amazing,at first. Then, things begin to change. It's a huge popularity contest. Doesn't matter how many hours or how hard I worked, the offers and promises made were never followed through or kept by upper management.  When a person is passed up not once but 4x for the promotion promised 8mos prior, drive to continue working overtime all the time and going above and beyond to help, dimished quickly. And none of.the new management has the time in or the appropriate training to even have the title. Very disappointing."
good,The job didn't to except the fact the there is a life out side of the job. It is always under staffed which makes the job much harder and way more stressful to work at.
good,Working here was quite hard. Management don't care if you get screamed at even if you did nothing wrong and for £4.20 its not worth it.
good,"No day is the same,  some days are easy while others become difficult,  all depending on the staff? "
good,"I typically worked the drive thru because how fast I could move the line. I also had to multi task by taking orders, taking money, making drinks, and boxing chicken and wedges. the goal was always to keep it green and I usually could keep it green the whole time. I cleaned the hot boxes out at the end of my shift before clocking out, that probably was the worse thing to do because you would be getting burnt while trying to clean it since we cant turn it off til we have no food in there. the management wasn't that bad but also needed improvement and people who actually take control of the place and run it smoothly."
good,"Extremely poor management, they choose favorites, they expect you to kill yourself on idiotic schedules such as working until close (4am) and coming back in at 8 am. They allow drama such as fighting verbally and physically."
good,"Working at KFC/ Taco Bell was my first job, I used to work Taco Bell, at the beginning it was alright but then I started to train people and to be by myself, it was okay, but sometimes it got mad busy and I was by myself being forced to do things quickly and good, and also had to get everything done for both sides, I was a 3 stars employee but I quit when I got a new better job."
good,"I was under appreciated, under paid, and over worked. I was a cashier so I was told I would only work at the window, but I would work at the Taco Bell like sometimes."
good,"A typical day at work consists of taking orders, prep, and cleaning. I learned that business is business and the management shifted a lot. I've had about 4 different mangers and I've been there a year. The hardest part of the job would be the our slow days. When it's slow we have no orders and when we have no orders we clean, we prep, and we do nothing for hours. Overall it was good experience and I've met a lot of good people working there."
good,well advancement is hard with this company. you have to know the managers for them to like you. and be able to move up in the company.... its a good job for begginers
good,Management was constantly leaving us unattended and overwhelmed. There was never enough workers scheduled for all rushes. Management was also taking away hours by clocking out is out for “lunches” we never had
good,It was a good place to work except for always being short handed other than that I have no complaints up until the change of general managers and getting threatened to be let go cause of not showing up to work with a dislocated knee (a doctor's note had been provided excusing me from work for two weeks)
good,"Employees come and go frequently, it being a fast food restaurant ts hard to have a constant dependable staff. Being a shift leader, it can be difficult to keep up when my staff keeps changing."
good,"A typical day at work included..."
good,was fun but with long hours overtime not paid according their payment system management and building relationship with co-workers
good,the management think they are better than everyone else so they boss you around and dont say thank you to anything
good,I honestly love my job. What I don't like is being consistently under staffed. And having to do the job of sometimes three people it exhausting. Working over 50 hours isn't fair.
good,It is a good place to work for part time. Easy to learn and fun co-workers. Had a lot of good times and it is hard to leave but I would like to start my future as a CAD designer.
good,I started working here when I was 15. I saw an ownership change in my time there. It’s an easy to understand job that teaches common job roles well. Just do what you’re expected to and you should have no problems in this business.
good,"here you fight for your hours, you do good and keep times good with good customer service, youll get better hours. however if you slack have 0 effort and show up late or call out, you will be taken off schedule based on how you acted."
good,"KFC is a good job to start from for people that are coming out of high school. It’s a great way to get started with independence as a young adult. At KFC in the opening shift your job is to prep for the day followed by shocking, next customer service ."
good,Its ok if u dont have children and can work any shift. If u have children its hard cause they dont work around your schedule. Work environment is ok must of the time
good,"I worked at YUM for a year, the entire time I was there i was left running a location without help, worked more than 55 hours a week. and was always told this was normal"
good,"Due to the nature of big corporate restaurant chains, Yum! Brands KFC/Taco Bell, had very low management procedures, opportunities or chances. Good for basic income. Not good for Career growth."
good,"When your a teenager this job is kind of perfect. The management they had when I use to work here weren't all nice. Some were disrespectful and some were the nicest people you can meet. A typical work day here was that you move and don't take a break until it was your break time. The most enjoyable part of this job was serving the customers, I don't consider this job hard."
good,"The most peculiar work culture I ever observed.  Annual reviews are done by your peers rating you, your manager has nothing to do with it, and all it takes is one anonymous person to rate you poorly in one small area and you are ruined.  Everyone must go through store training, I was almost completed with it and the new President decided everyone should start all over.  I was right back to square one with the store training, and had just attended it.  This ""start all over"" idea had to have been discussed long before implementation, but telling those currently attending store training to ""hold off and wait for an announcement"" never happened.  Tried to voice my concern for this and was heavily persecuted by HR.  If I was fresh out of college, I would say work here a few years to get some history going, but get the heck out as soon as you can find work outside.  Not a keeper job."
good,"bad management"
good,"i worked for pizza hut while I was in college in the summer. I wasn't completely interested in career advancement there, so I do not have any complaints that there was no room for growth. As far as management goes, I have no complaints."
good,Great entry level place of work. It's a great place to work if you can handle the fast pace!
good,I'm a extremely hard worker very reliable do not like missing work have a great personality just love a challenge.we do anything to complete my task when giving the goals i have to make.
good,"Ofcourse at a fast food joint, your going to be facing all types of customers, even the stupid ones, for me there was so much i could take before i blew up. If you have great patience with people and can work fast this is the place for you"
good,It was kind of unprofessional and I didn’t like it that much and everybody was quitting and it was hard for everybody to work because they was all new and didn’t know what to do
good,Don't be the employee who stands around not doing anything. Show up for your shift. If your gona be late make sure to call and inform your shift lead.
good,Lots of things to be done but a friendly work enviorment overall. Never boring as it was pretty face paced. Usually busy and coworkers lended a hand to each other to get things done as quickly but effiecently as possible.
good,"if you are hired be prepared for constant moving daily changes in policy. up and down shifts and changes of the schedule daily and every other day. "
good,The recognition culture at Yum! is very strong which builds a fun culture amongst teams.  They have a strong focus on educating and growing it's employees.
good,"There is a massive amount of work assigned to just one person; at times you could be running the drive thru, taking money, pouring drinks, serving people and making the meals all while trying to keep the timer under 150 seconds an keeping side orders and cookies stocked up which is really hard and you are often spoken to by customers like you are stupid and you can't do anything right, this aspect of the job is the hardest."
good,"It is a descent company. 50 - 60 hour per week. Life work balance could be challenging. Company are making effort to improve, however the deeply rooted culture from the field itself could prove to be a challenge for the company to improve overall."
good,"I learned overall operation of business. From customers end, inventory, payroll, hiring/employment, procurement, maintenance, termination, training and development, promotion, increasing sales and profitability."
good,"a work day consist of greating and serving customers, food prep, cleaning and cooking food. learned to work in a fast pace envirment, great customer service skills and food quiltiy."
good,Very stressful and micro managed. Work/ Life balanced is talked about but does not exist. Schedule expectations continue to get more ridiculous. I have been told on multiple occasions that I am expected to work during the busiest times which tend to be late but then required to work in the morning 2-3 days per week so often you only have 8 or less hours between shifts. Often asked to help other locations when struggling leaving your restaurant to understaffed.
good,Great place to learn how to execute customer service and belief in people.
good,Workplace is fast paced and needs leadership skills and allows people to move up quickly with determination. Variety of locations open to move around in.
good,Kfc is under payed and lacks employee benefits. Not so motivating and self driven. Most employees do not like working there because the management is poor and there is not benefits
good,I had to a lot as a cashier. I had to clean the lobby and the bathrooms. I had to make sure the condiments were always full. I also had to prep food when I had no customers. I helped make customers orders also. I really enjoyed when a customer makes me laugh it makes my day.
good,This is a very click-ish environment and they are understaffed in most of their areas so you will wear multiple hats.  I wasn't impressed.  Convenient to have cafeteria in building though and there's free pizza all the time.
good,It is good working with kfc but when it gets busy it is very difficult to deal with the situation.  But the good thing is i have learned the ability to work in a fast paced environment to set dead lines.
good,I find it less stressful to only focus on one brand at a time. The hardest part was when others would call in or come in late & you become short staffed & get behind . Meeting their speed times were very hard to maintain if this occurs.
good,Spend most of the day behind a computer or in meetings.
good,It is a good place to work. Co-workers are friendly and the company has many employee focused programs.
good,"Ever since PHI decided to franchise most of it's stores, the entire brand has gone down tremendously.  Most of the franchisees just care about bottom line and people, standards, and integrity are lacking."
good,"'Fantastic environment to work with great people!!'"
good,"Business needs to be more productive and pay employees more, especially GM and AGM. 30-40k for AGM is low. Fun place to work though. People are nice. Food was fun to make"
good,Working with the YUM! Brands Inc. I was manager for 3 different locations in Florida. I learned how to handle different confidential payment methods over the phone.
good,Good work. Nice coworkers. Easy work in food service. I was a cashier food preparer and closed restaraunt. Was there for two years and left on good terms. I would work there again if asked. I was a hard working employee. Very close to home. Flexiable hours.
good,It was a good place to work but I was in high school at the time and in a lot of sport activities and they didn’t understand with my schedule but was a good place to work while in high school
good,Ineffective leadership was the downfall of this work experience. There was no support from upper management. No standards were followed by anyone on any level.
good,the hardest part of the job was when the line would get backed up at a certain time everyday some orders will come out wrong and will we have a lot of complaints
good,It was ok to work for till new management came in. I ended up having to call KFC headquarters to get changes made being the head cook. Always at work night and day never had time off.
good,"This restaurant was located down the street from all the college drinking places and movie theatres.  It was very busy on weekends, which is when I usually worked."
good,It was a great job for someone young living with there parents but I am a 18 year old living on my own so I need a bit more in my salary. I’m look for a new and better job with more hours and a better pay
good,"Easy competitive great employees and managers, learn everything as fast as possible.. I would consider working KFC/Taco Bell again. Great service job need 5 stars"
good,"easy job to maintain while you're in school "
good,Always busy occasionally slow. The work atmosphere was okay. Mangement was alright. Overall the job pays well for a high school student looking for something part time.
good,Good environment.  Everyone has been there a long time so not alot of opportunity for advancement and no one wants to retire even though they probably should.
good,"It's been many years, so I don't feel like my review will be of any relevance. I would work for them again, but I am 2000 mile away from there now.  I would encourage any programmer to try there."
good,"I started at KFC as a teenager and worked up over several years. This job served me pretty well through high school, uni and beyond. As a teen it was a fine place to work, pay was lower than some places but there were always hours if you did the job well. Experience varied greatly depending on who the store manager was at any given time. "
good,"Wasn't the best place to work, but it was great for gaining new experiences as a newcomer to the working world. Made some friends, but the work is hard and it's always super hot."
good,I just feel that quality performance goes highly unrecognized at this company. Exceptional employees are not given raises ir promotions even after year of service
good,"this job was good for balancing school and work since it did not require much commitment, you show up produce food products while maintaining a clean working station until your shift is done."
good,"I cleaned lobby and restroom, took order from customers. made the food and packed it."
good,at work I use to clean behind other team member a lot but I didn’t have a problem with that because I would want me area to look messy when it’s on my time .ive learned that working at a fast food it’s about having good community service. I like the work culture because I like working with diverse people. The hardest part ab the job was being pushed to do other team members jobs and having to do mines at the same time. Only time I enjoy myself at work is on break and when the employers get along and when we were on track making the customers happy.
good,"It was a very stressful job, but it was a good starter job for being 16. Taco bell was my first job and I felt like I grew a lot there with the taco bell crew."
good,If you aren’t constantly high you’ll do fine at this place. No one really expects much from anyone in these kind of places so it’s not hard to stand above the rest buy expecting excellence from yourself.
good,I worked mostly at night as I was in school. I really enjoyed the night shift. The managers were really laid back and friendly. It was at night when I got to mostly help with cooking and that was pretty fun.
good,"Could be worse could be better. Some departments seemed to really enjoy their groups, mine unfortunately wasn't one of those. But there are good departments."
good,"with management changes and recent layoffs it is not a positive environment. it is impossible to move up out of the payroll department. the environment is full of back stabbing and I would not recommend this position. However, other departments in YUM are fabulous. Excellent  work life balance and compensation."
good,"Cultivate a culture of engagement that attracts, retains and grows the best people.Amazing company culture and communication! There is great recognition of hard work by employees. I had visibility to the impacts of my projects and was able to understand other projects going on around me"
good,"you can only get lazy teenagers to work, its 90 degrees in the kitchen, management shirks their duties to shift leads.its cool if you like babysitting"
good,I loved working for Yum! Brands. They were my introduction to working as an engineer in the field. The only problem I ever faced was being bored because I finished my work very quickly and was never given any projects even when I asked for more work. I think it is a great place to work and most people would enjoy the casual lifestyle.
good,Nonstop work. Fast pace environment. Need to be able to be quick on your feet and have a good memory. Great people to work with.
good,"Fast paced, diverse hospitality customer services,  food practice and cash bonus. Manager in charge of store will be the key to success."
good,"I was surprised to say that I enjoyed my work. It was simple and felt like the entire crew was family. Hours were flexible, and easy to adjust if need be."
good,This was a very enjoyable experience.  The director of operations really knows people and takes care of his own.
good,Lots of families and children who are happy. Managers are always around and happy to give you extra help in training and completing tasks.
good,"follow protocal , responsible for repair and maintenance of 17 stores in 4 counties (on call) .daily maintenance of equipment and property on a scheduled visit and emergency call when dispatched .keeping record of parts for repairs , parts iventory and equipment on company vehicle. attend meetings and supervise sub contractors when dispatched . meeting and education with company management ."
good,"great Starter Job, not ideal for long term, no real room for advancement, salary not commensurable with job duties"
good,only working 1 day a week due to cut backs. working very hard to make up for time lost. co workers are very helpful. love being with people and talking with them
good,Solid growth potential and a good place to learn do's and dont's .
good,I was required to take orders and clean my area. I was also required to have the customer service and put the customers needs first.The cleaning involves mopping the floors doing the dishes clean the tables sweeping. I also had stock meaning getting beef lettuce tomatoes for people working a lot. I was also required to be able to make the beef chili and red sauce.
good,This work place is very disorganized. The manager isnt very helpful. She has favorites and she lets them sit around on her phones and not do anything.
good,There was no control on staff people always call in sick. Leaving the work place short staff. The had their favorite people and advancement was very difficult.
good,"A typical work day would be answering phone calls and taking orders for Pizza hut and Kfc. After 6pm, the calls are over whelming and impossible to take breaks in between. The people working in the company or very friendly and helpful."
good,"I worked long hours, learned about the management of Taco Bell and KFC.   Everything had to be quick and on time, very time managed. I got along with all other employes as well."
good,"Good companies; advanced quickly and completely ran all operations for all 3 companies for at least 1 location sometimes 2 at a time.  Became training manager, Manager of months many times"
good,"A day full of fast paced food preparation and customer service keeps one busy throughout the day."
good,When I was still employed at KFC/TB each day was a bit different because I could work in the drive thru some days and other days I would do something different. The management was not the greatest because they weren't always doing their job.
good,I learned rhat to be a good cashier u have to ask people how their day was going and how everything was how good was the service and to make sure that everything was done like sweeping or restocking the stuff of making sure the bathrooms were all set up I loved my job.
good,Have to be quick getting orders out always busy short workers it can be a little stessful always all going on but somdays are good when things are in place
good,"I have worked for Yum Brands for 7 yrs and could say I enjoyed the extra privileges during my employment."
good,"Fast pace work environment, easy to learn the methods of kfc/toca bell, friendly work staff and management, great for teenagers just starting out in the work force"
good,I enjoyed my time there. However it wasn't a fit. The building was falling apart as was the parking lot. The owner has zero interest in renovations as in his words the place is dying.
good,"We had some management issues in my time there, but conflicts were always resolved quickly. It was a place that took care of its workers as well as making the customers the number one priority."
good,I currently help all the Pizza Hut stores in the US with any software or hardware issues they face. Currently working on my bachelor's in Finance
good,"It was a stressful environment to work in because people in the Drive-Thru are at the mercy of the cooks and if they don't do their job efficiently, it hurts the drive thru customer as well as the cashier."
good,It was fun they had a lot of benefits and discounts ..and they pay a okay amount even tho they struggle to give u a raise I was there for 2 years and never got a raise but overall is a ok company
good,"Great Company to work for. Audit and evaluate staff development and training programs for compliance with corporate and facility policies and procedures, contract and applicable statutes, standards and regulations. Ensure success of all new menu item roll-out."
good,"Great for a start up job, would be ideal for anyone who is willing to work long hours and overnight, students who want part time and further careers."
good,I worked as a delivery driver. The job was very fun. The co-workers and management were great. Job was very easy and laid back.
good,A typical day at work involves first reviewing daily numbers before visiting the stores.  Also review Customer service responses and follow up on any customer issues/complaints from the following day.
good,"As a General Manager for Pizza Hut, you eat, sleep, breathe WORK! Its very hard to have a life outside of work due to call ins, customer complaints that need to be handled immediately, etc lack of preparedness that comes with Managing a restaurant. The hardest part of the job was always dealing with employee drama. Restaurant business seems to be the worst case scenario. The franchise seems to have a great plan of action in running these, but its very difficult to apply these tactics. The most enjoyable part of working for them is definitely the money. They pay good."
good,"Everyone I worked with were helping and understanding, i didnt run into any issues until the around the end if my time being there, I can discuss what led me to leave that job."
good,"Для студентов отличное место, кто хочет совмещать с учебой. По карьерной лестнице тоже можно подняться, но если тольуко сам захочешь. Никто тебе ничего предлагать не будет."
good,Working at Kentucky Fried Chicken/Taco Bell was an okay job. It requires you to work rapidly and interact with your fellow employees as well as customers. It can be difficult and stressful at first. Don’t allow yourself to get overwhelmed. Do your best. Treat everyone kindly and don’t allow anyone to mistreat you.
good,"Had baby and it was hard working 50+ hours per week and being a good mother, changed career path. full service manager schedule changed weekly , hard to keep employees but this job was over 23 years ago"
good,"Overall hard and very stressful due to poor management. A crew member knew more about there job then they did. I would work there again I would just prefer better, more qualified managers."
good,If you can handle stress and don’t get hurt easily then this is the place for you I recommend choosing your hours well when you first start here. Good luck!
good,Fast food is a fast paced job and you have to learn quick and adapt to your surroundings as well as work together to achieve success. Also have to be able to communicate with other co-workers to be able to get the job done.
good,"It's a great place to start. As someone who had no previous work experience, it got me a step ahead when I moved onto my more serious jobs. You learn the basics to general fast food customer service."
good,"Didnt really have a good working ethic treated employees poor and didnt have a good working environment more of a democracy of anything with the boss upset half of the time, working there was not a good working experience but they needed a good working bilingual person so i applied."
good,I'm just happy to be working again. Just dishwashing helps myself with paying for stuff. I like the job I have because I dont have to hassle with customers or food.
good,Its very busy on most days and not enough people workin always so you have to work harder so unless your very active this job isnt for you especially if you are a sandwich maker you need to be fast and remember all the things and be able to multitask. Not an easy job for TB line.. easiet would be cashier.
good,I mainly worked in the drive thru and our days were typically very busy. You must be able to work well under pressure and in a fast-paced environment.
good,"Some terrific people and culture, but you work a lot and in the end I didn't think it was worth staying."
good,"The job itself was great but had very poor management; no loyalty from the administration, makes you question your job security; not much support for advancement opportunities."
good,I am always looking to prosper my career.
good,The employees at this company were the best. It did eat up a huge portion of my time for not much reward. Most of the managers cared about the employees and were willing to work with them to resolve any problems or concerns.
good,"Definitely gained experience in multiple aspects."
good,I was always on the clock.  Many days i opened and closed the store. I learned how to do inventory and the best way to handle customers. I loved my management team and the people i worked with were the best people i have ever worked with. The hardest part of the job were the long days and not being home with my kids as often as i would have liked. My favorite part of the job was working my peers and taking care of the customers.
good,"great christmas parties, long hours, fast paste job. good training program, awesome teamwork, hardest thing about the job is the dinner rush,and cleaning at the end of the night,"
good,"A typical day at Yum would be being surrounded with a bunch of mates working hard being yourself and making our customers day. "
good,"Overall a great company to work for. Most management is on board with a work/ life balance. My co-workers in every department that I worked in were great. Unfortunately, the company downsized, or I would still be working there."
good,Enjoyed my experience with this company and the skills i gained.
good,"KFC is a quick paced job, rarely slow. I have learned to double task, and be quick. Hardest part of the job, is the make sure all customers are happy. Easiest part of the job, is the cleaning, stocking, sweeping, calling chicken, dropping fresh food. Management, they’re super good with what they do, some are really lenient, some are tough! Workplace culture? KFC is fun place to work at, it’s like happy a family, but you always need to get your work done."
good,Its a fun fast paced environment that is team oriented. Working in a two in one restaurant was never boring and there was always something new to add to the menu.
good,Great place to work Because it was a good  environment stay busy so time went by fast and also a great locationThe manager also was a great manager he made sure stuff is there and we have everything.
good,I really liked working there the pace was good the customers were nice. I learned that i could work long shifts. Management was awesome they always made me feel like i was a part of the team the hardest part i think was doing the truck I'm short so putting things on the top shelf was hard. taking care of the customers and cooking
good,"I really enjoyed working here for the few months that I was there, mostly because the environment was mostly friendly and everyone got along. I would recommend this to a friend."
good,The work is call center first. You do deal with information technology. Unlike typical call center work this job is unscripted meaning you have to have a decent memory or great note taking abilities. This job is not quiet or slow by any stretch of the word so be prepared for noise and a fast pace. The leadership are willing to help where they can however on some occasions metrics drive what can be done.
good,"Despite Yum amazing culture, I believe people will still follow people."
good,"Great place to work, strong culture and results oriented."
good,"China business drove past success. Culture a focus in  communication, though real substance was spotty. Yum had to sell off all restaurants as top management too focused on marketing and ads, not restaurant operators."
good,"Yum's culture is well known and is amazing.  You will make life long friendships while working here.  The only downside is that if you get into an administrative role, it is difficult if not impossible to move forward within the company."
good,No day is the same. Every day is a new day to learn and be challenged. I get to help others be a better person and build a career.
good,Yum! Brands has been a wonderful employer.  The company has competitive pay practices as well as unique benefits.  There are many additional benefits such as wellness and flexibility.
good,"I am in charge of the daily operations of maintenance for all corporate Long Island Taco Bells and Pizza Hut. Repair and maintenance of all kitchen equipment including ovens, grills, freezers and walk in coolers. Troubleshooting and Repair of electrical circuits, and re-wiring of equipment. Repair of all building repairs drywall, plumbing, flooring, painting and lighting repair. Responsible for maintaining inventory of truck and warehouse, ordering, invoicing, billing, and scheduling. I am also the lead on the maintenance department safety program, and HVAC training."
good,This was a fun place to work. Each day was a new experience and I truly felt like I went to work with family.
good,I worked as a food and service champion meaning I prepared food and  took orders one of only a few to be totally flexible in positioning
good,"complete restaurant operation observation and build on opportunities, enable and train the team in every step. To ensure customer interactions and satisfaction level is in place. Also review Ordering and inventory on daily basis."
good,A great place to work... dedicated to personnel growth and culture in the workplace.
good,"Good for a first job, entered as an entry-level food preparer at 16 and advanced within 2 years to a shift leader. Hard work and being available gets you a long way."
good,"A typical day in Kfc tacobell was always face paced but also very fun.  You couldnt have a bad night without the crew or manager making things better, great place to work for."
good,As my first high school job it was a good way to get some extra money. The pay was above minimum wage by was by no means enough had I been out of school.The management needed improvement when I started and had started improving right as I changed jobs. The staff was 60% drama filled highschool kids 20% rude adults and 10% decent people. I met a lot of great friends there. Hopefully alot has changed since I switched employers.
good,It’s was way too stressful to work here around some employees. I was promised a 9-5 shift and it didn’t stay consistent to that. Also had to deal with some managers not doing their jobs. I enjoyed being able to see the customers smile
good,answer phones adding time for employees and adj pay and adding direct deposits completing reports and running programs also processing an terminations
good,"Stressful environment with little job security, 50+ hour weeks consistently having to go back and finish the mistakes of jr manager with poor training"
good,"A typical day begins with reviewing KPIs ( Key Performance Indicators) from the previous day. Allows you to set goals for the current work day."
good,"Organizing the office, keeping all directors and staff members up to date with work.  Making sure the entire office had everything they needed so each employee could do their job efficiently."
good,Everyday you cam in either opening or closing I learned how to read the board and run the line. I learned how to work a cashier and work the dishpit. and I learned how to do a manager count a little
good,My days are spent constantly busy which I love but I need a new change of pace. I’m getting married in 6 weeks and I’m just about to start a new chapter in my life and I want to start that chapters soon.
good,"Fast paced, time management skills, there is never not anything to do. The work is enjoyable and the pay is good. There are a lot of food handling and safety requirements that are necessary to follow."
good,"We all worked together as a team, we became a second family and so it was easy to be productive and fun. Working here opened up many skills I didn’t know I had like organizing, communication skills, multitasking and more."
good,Poor managers for the most part. Most of which do seems like they need to be their. Staff of fun to be around and talk to. Not very good communication with management.
good,"The message and culture that is presented can be different than what the managers practice. "
good,Good food just thinking about it brings back memories of all the hard work that you put in but you know at the end of work week it get really good paycheck good conversations
good,I like wirking at KFC/TB. Was challenging and worth it to learn everything so I could get promoted. Boss was hard but fair. He was also a nice person.
good,They value the culture they have created - keeping it fun and focused on employee recognition.  They make sure to recognize even for the things that may get overlooked but are still important to the individual.
good,"Learning experience, meet new people and get to all work together and make a good team. Communication with costumers gets easier, and fun to learn a lot about one"
good,"Still work there , only issue is the wages honestly , had fun there for a while. Great management, was in training to become shift lead i just honestly didnt like the pay."
good,this is a very good place to work at it gives u the ability to learn how to multi task move very quickly and make customers happy i myself believe it can build your working skills
good,YUM Brands brought a fast pace environment that gives you a chance to meet different people and leave a great impression on the company and ensure repeat business.
good,Yum!Brands is a stable company. The work is rather strenuous at times as attempting to train diverse personalities can at times be difficult. Employee turn over is rather high in this industry so training can at times be extremely repetitive.
good,"Good to work. Good to grow. Salary is good & forsee your growth very soon, secure company to work in. definetly a go ahead to join this company."
good,"Yum! Brands is a great place, where your results are the most valued. It is all about how you get your work done and not about from where your work is created and submitted. Very flexible work environment and very community focused."
good,the are that i worked in was a franchise .and it was little rusty compare with yam inc
good,Good company to work for. I retired from Yum brands in 2016 in dec of 2016. The company has downsized its company operations which has in turn lower current jobs.
good,"Overall good organization. However, I was involved with groups that were sold off and culture changed.I would consider returning to Yums. Was good because I like a job with opportunities."
good,"I wouldn’t like to work for franchise in charlotte, I had to work for fullenwider for a year by force because my store became franchisee hated everyday of it doesn’t matter how much I did they still ask more and made me work 70 hours a week. But corporate if you know what you doing and if you have good staff it is great. Also in corporate you are on hourly salary so let’s say you have to work extra because of same employee drama you still get paid for the hours you work. I I recommend to work for corporate highly because of great benefits too."
good,I give it a thumbs up!👍 there is a opportunity to grow in positions. Also its beneficial to have as a 2nd job. I enjoyed working with him brands company's
good,Working with YUM! Brands at Taco Bell was an amazing first job and I’ve had great experience doing so. Not only did it prepare me for a fast paced working environment but it also helped me evolve as a young man.
good,Can be a fun place to work. Depending on management and other coworkers.  Low pay for a lot of work. Very rarely do you not get in trouble for calling in sick even when company policy states you need to not work.
good,"Always busy"
good,Though I didn’t work at this Restaurant for long I got to enjoy my first job with people who took good care of me and taught me the importance of interaction and communication while also giving me time to adjust to the workplace.
good,"They had just created a benefits call center of internal and external clients (employees).  It was great to be part of the growth. I learned so much about benefits, within the HR department. Management was great (at the time) understanding, considerate and taking care of their employees. The hardest part was to learn the unknown; since due to my inexperience  and no knowledge of benefits. But due to my desire to work with this amazing company; I leaned very quickly. What I enjoyed the opportunity of advancing my career."
good,According to company's code of conduct we are not allowed to take tips from our customers as it will lead you to dismissal
good,"Extensive learning being a start up"
good,"Learned a lot from other co workers and managers, prepped orders, cashier, managed a variety of stores and made employees schedules and trained new and old employees"

good,"Outstanding training programs, people are committed to deliver great customer expire cues by providing great product At. A great atmosphere."
good,i worked there for almost 2 years and what i have noticed that walk the talk was missing over there.
good,"I had a pretty decent experiences and the culture is really good based on principles that can be used throughout my career. The company can really be cheap on investing in assets (like many QSRs) but at times they can be very generous too. Depends on leadership ! Long term vision is neglected and the company is way too concerned with immediate profits and quick returns for shareholders. Long term investments take time and do payback in the long run but ya, there is a dip in profits when you do this."
good,"This job was a cool, fast-paced environment. Everyone had to work together to get the jobs done. The only thing that was frustrating was the amount of hours I was allowed to work."
good,"I worked at KFC/ Taco Bell for 2 years, and it was one of my favorite jobs I’ve had. Training is excellent here and it took 1-2 weeks to get a good grip on how the job is done. Very relaxed environment and friendly managers who are willing to work with an employee’s schedule. Being a line cook there helped me to become more able to problem-solve, get lots of work done quickly and efficiently, and work under pressure. Would definitely recommend it to a friend."
good,"i worked for KFC in the Yum.inc it was a fun place to work with plenty of opportunity to grow.  Although the pay was hard to live on, the experience opend other doors for me in the food industry."
good,"KFC/Taco Bell was one of the most fun experiences i had. Everyday was something new and fun, challenging other team members to see who could be the quickest, helping customers constantly and consistently.....just overall a great experience"
good,"This company lives a recognition culture and recognizes the importance of developing employees. Every manager I had was very flexible and supportive of getting me the experience I needed. The whole benefits package is great. The work is demanding, but that's to be expected at any corporation."
good,Very challenging task to handle and got developed very good skills to drive result with various tanning program and was in top 5 performer in country
good,"It's a good start for young people who are just getting out and learning the workplace, and while they don't have a lot a benefits they are flexible. I've worked at Taco Bell for almost two years and it's not perfect but the people I work with get you extremely close to perfection. Like all jobs it has its drama and gossip but it's not a bad place to start out"
good,I started as a Assistant Manager and move up to a Franchise Growth Leader.  I had lots of opportunity to move up.   I worked with Yum Brands for Twenty Two years
good,The organisation believed in me as an individual.They afforded me the opportunity to learn and develop my career.Furthermore the management encouraged me to pursue a degree education and assisted me with my studies when it was possible and relevant for them to.
good,"The culture and direction YUM brands is going is top notch. This is a great career for anyone who wants to learn and throw themselves into their career."
good,Yum! has a great work environment and is constantly looking to improve based on feedback.  I had the opportunity to do various positions from leadership to training and human relations.
good,"A fun place to work and people are creative and hard working. It has the best food scientists.  I enjoyed working there and made many friends. There is opportunity to travel and advancement. They have good benefits and salary structure. The culture is really good, however, it can be very political and is competitive.  Mid managers need work. Too often they are placed in positions without having people or managing skills. And some only think of their next advancement rather than their team member's personal development.Top level management is really great and motivational. It is a good company to work for, however, you have to learn to navigate through the politics and competitiveness."
good,"Very busy job supporting several directors and managers. This position was very detailed oriented. Several managers could have managed their own calendars but expected busy admins to administer it. I always went home thinking about the details of the next day/week, therefore I usually stayed late to get a jump start on the next day. I did learn a lot about scheduling conference rooms and meetings using Outlook. Having an onsite cafeteria was nice. Good company to work for."
good,"Always something going on.  Like any company, it really boils down to what you make of it."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Management is very helpful and always a happy and cheerful environment.
good,The work was interesting and I was given the tools I needed and the space and time to learn.
good,I enjoyed my time at Yum!   Decent salary for the work required   Flexible hours and getting to work with quality people.  Seeing happy customers made it all worth it
good,"Consultancy completed in South Africa for new franchising opportunities, worked with local branches as well as Yum! International. Quality professionalism and a great opportunity."
good,"Everyone was very nice, and it was very creative work environment. A lot of camaraderie! My supervisor was great. There is an on-site cafeteria, bank, gym, and child care."
good,Good place to work I would definitly refer my friends or family to go work there. It is local in my area and its a decent place to start to get your foot in the door with limited work expo
good,"-there was a time at work I got a compliment for having fast service ."
good,There is a constant flow of costumers towards around the end of the week.On occasions other days can get a little hectic as well. I don’t prefer fast foods and I’d rather work something like retail.
good,Fast food restaurant with the opportunity to move up in the company lack of decent pay and benefits need more hours and workers that pays attention to detail
good,"It’s a good job and has advancement opportunities, the hours can be crazy sometime but in all a decent schedule. Salary is decent but can be stressful if you have a family."
good,"fun place work."
good,"It’s fast food. So like another fast food place around. Friendly crew, fun. Pay was like any other pay at a fast food restaurant. Got to travel to help other stores"
good,"I have worked with this company for 10 yrs it was challenging to get people to commit to coming in there shifts, if didn’t I had to work the double or stay till 9pm when the dinning room closed but it was the way it was. The people that were dedicated as I was were wonderful."
good,I feel I had to many responsibilities and not enough breaks to regain strength for the many tasks that were required of me. Management was nice but a lot times we grew to busy for the cook to take a break and that stressed me to the point that I had to go to the hospital.
good,"I came in one morning and this polite girl handled my order so well I can't wait to go back. Her name is Bella, she is very outgoing and polite, almost felt like I was at home. The restaurant was very clean."

good,"Being friendly and fast is always the key. "
good,"While it was demanding and hectic, it was enjoyable and the best part of the experience was the people!!  Whether it was your co-workers or your customers, everyone was polite, helpful and respectful."
good,My time at Taco Bell was brief but joyful. My co-workers were hard-working and my manager was very informative. I am very content with what I was paid in regards to my wage.
good,"kfc was great and i loved going to work every day.  I really miss the atmosphere there most but i never look back,  Great benefits great training, great peers"
good,Yum's culture was great.  Great place to work and great location.  limited advancement opportunities.  matrix organization with many levels of management.

good,I enjoyed this job till the end even though I was always working and missing out on things with my kids the people were wonderful to work with.
good,"Busy, it's easy to have a productive day and not be stressed at the end of the day. Management was understanding in work/ family balance. Co-workers were great. It was hard to leave the company during their transitioning process. The environment"

good,Very fast pace. It didn't matter your length of employment you would learn something new practically everyday. I never became bored because with each day brought a new challenge. In my particular Accounts Receivable department we were all team players.  The hardest part about my job was two different close calendars it made it really hard to schedule time off with my family. The most enjoyable part was when we would do our quarterly celebrations / outings as a whole in International Control.
good,"This was by far my favorite job over the past several years."
good,I learned management skills and gained valuable skills but I left due to poor management. I started as day shifts but when they hired a new supervisor I was bumped to nights and then 2-3 times a week she texts me asking me to come in early because she wants to leave early or if I'm working with her she asks to leave early putting me in a difficult situation and then she'll go to employees and tell them that I don't think we can handle it without her in a negative context. Lately I have started saying no but I would go in. I stay late when people don't show and I have a weekend job so the manager tries to bully me into taking a shift that I had scheduled off weeks in advance.
good,"i would walk in to taco bell, enter in my code and started my shift. i had a fun time with coworkers and with the help of the team we met our goals for the day."

Would work along side crew in which ever was needed such as food prep or customer service rep. Hardest part was being on ones feet for 8-10 hours a day but would also be the most enjoyable due to always being active.
good,Very friendly great training available the energy within the establishment if you can find great people willing to work for you very exciting company to work for great benefits.
good,Solid culture; very good people to work with; they care about their employees; good involvement within the industry.   A lot of reorgs over the past several years.
good,"A typical night shift at Taco Bell would be coming in counting the money in the register, making sure u have the right amount to start off with and then for the rest of the night all you would have to do is take orders, clean up the tables and floor in the lobby and clean up the bathroom, lobby and restock before you leave to close."
good,There were many times when we needed more people working because of the amount of customers coming in. The management needed work and there were times when the management was unfair to all workers.

good,I had good and helpful people around me. I always felt safe and secure. I was only Working at this company for two months but the experience was amazing and gave me the opportunity to let go of fears about working. I had awesome managers really wish that I didn't have to relocate would have loved to stay longer.
good,KFC taco bell is a great place to work I work there close to a year and I loved it you will have ups and downs anywhere u work but overall a very good place to work
good,"The cafeteria area was amazing, you could get breakfast, lunch and even dinner to take home.  In my area you walked in to fresh fruit, breakfast snacks and you could eat that was free before you even went to the cafeteria. There was plenty of seating and televisions all over.  The co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The job was not stressful at all, It was a wonderful place to work. You could wear jeans and tope that are respectable.  It was a very relaxed atmosphere and that to ME made it an easier and more comfortable facility to work for. It was just a great place to work."
good,I loved working at Yum.  Senior management was awesome.  Lots of recognition. Salary and benefits were comparable.  Flex hrs were great.  They reorganize about every 4 yrs so be prepared to be laid off like me 😢

good,"I loved working here for the years I was employed. Lots of fun events, rallies, team events and training. I learned my work ethic from this company. We work hard and played hard. I miss my TB family and I'm still friends with many. Long hours, work life balance is tough. The more money you want to make the more responsibilities you need to take on. But there are only so many hours in a day. My heart will always belong to Taco Bell."
good,A typical day at Yum Brands is very laid back. I worked from home and in a cubical.  I learned you have to be very self motivated because you do work from home. You are in charge of your own schedule and getting your work done.  Their is not anyone watching over you making sure it is complete.  My managemetn and co-workers are very nice. They made me feel very welcomed.  When my manager is Los Angelas would come in town.  We all would go have dinner and catch up.  The hardest part of working here as an intern is not knowing if you are going to be working here permanantly or not.  I learned that you could try and work your hardest and still not be hired on if there are not any openings.  I did not have very much face to face interactions with people and found that to be diffecult sometimes because I am a social butterfly.  The most enjoyable part of working here is having such a laid back schedule.  I enjoyed the projects that I was in charge of also.
good,A typical day was very ongoing.  Management was very understanding and down to earth people.  I learned a lot about the fast food business.

good,"I started out at Pizza Hut (Yum Brand) in 5-15-2012.  I just wrap up my G.E.D. certificate and needed a job.  When I started out as a driver my first day was excited.  I quickly became the leader in the delivery field at my location.  After that, I gradually became a more dependent driver with my intelligence an education.  My hard work showed off and, I received more responsibility at the store being a leader.  I'm a proud to be thankful for the management team at my job who guided me through my fist couple of months at the job.  The most enjoyable part is to be paid for my driving."
good,"I loved this job.  I loved being a manager.  Unfortunately, the company was franchised out and when YUM stopped supporting the LJS brand, the benefits disappeared and the money disappeared.   You can't do a 60 hour a week job for 30 hour a week pay."
good,"a typical day for me at work was busy busy .."
good,"I left for Walmart because Walmart paid more, but I liked KFC better. unfortunately, for reasons, the company closed the store in Miami. the staff were great to work with and the manager that hired me was a good guy, honorable. the hardest part of the job was employee discipline when one was naughty. I don't like being ""mean"". The most enjoyable part was the Sunday church crowd."
good,"Loved the servant leadership model...  Yum! was good to me over the years, no complaints.  I was given opportunities to grow as a leader and the workplace culture was always positive."
good,fun and quick place job for a new to job worker. I was able to get in the job quick and easy and showed great talent to other employees and customers daily.
good,Being my first job it taught me much about the jobs to come. Making sure you were always on time was key for the store. If you’re late it causes a domino effect on lunch schedule or work schedule. First time I knew that a job could be fun and be a second family. I was in charge of the chicken being prepared and ready to serve at all times. Started getting knowledge on Taco Bell to help when it was busy. Help cashier when it’s extremely packed.
good,"i worked for the one of Yum's pizza hut franchise areas and it was not a bad experience, the job was a good pace for when i was working in high school and i did not feel taken advantage of but there was an issue when it came to the lack of communication and planning out a work week as we had no way to contact out manager about days off except for writing slips of paper and leaving them on his desk which lead to a lot of times our days being not noted on the schedule."
good,The Yum culture allowed me to participate in a way that gave me a sense of autonomy and creativity in my work while still feeling like part of a team. All meetings were handled by staff that had great communication skills and were able to make us all feel like part of a team that worked together in order to accomplish our goals .  Colleagues were a joy to work with.
good,"I worked here for a year, and I got injury at that place on 23 jan 2018 after the end of my claim. There were given me just 4 hour shift in a week. I dont know why they were very bad to me. thats way i left that job because I cant servive just in 50 dollrs per week. I used to work here 30+ hours per week."
good,es muy buena opcion para los estudiantes ya que son muy flexibles en los horarios
good,Overall yum brand is a good company to work for.I have worked for them for ten years and it has it's ups and downs but had to leave when area coach was change they come in bringing there on people and looking over the ones that's already there that can be promoted.it really all about the leadership that you work for and under and it also depends on yourself.

good,"The one thing that sets Yum! apart is the culture. Unmatched, unrivaled, amazing culture filled with high-caliber, high-achieving individuals from all over the world."
good,"Yum! Brands is an exciting, fast paced company that claims to put people first and drive a ""customer maniac"" focus.  It still has a improvement to make, but overall there are a lot of people with a ""give back"" attitude and a help one another soul."
good,"Over all it was great job I ever had."
good,Excellent place to work.  Management and staff are very knowledgeable and friendly.   A group of professionals indeed!

good,I like working for KFC is easy and very simple. I have excellent co managers and excellent employees. I’m always hitting my 40 hours and at times I’ll receive time and a half.
good,"Good company to work for, unfortunately they franchised all but two of their companies out.  Franchises don't care how the restaurant operated they are just wanting to Make money."
good,"Great place to work in a family environment. Lots of moving parts, fast pace and great owners to work with. If you enjoy working with food and not afraid to get your hands dirty, this is for you."
good,"Although, this is my very first fast-food job experience I can honestly say that this is “ the best, (by far) job experience I’ve had.” I have worked with big companies and Tacobell helped me be a better person both professionally and personally."

The hardest part of the job is communicating with too many vendors but to be friend with your manager and upper management is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"17 years with the company. I cried when they sold to franchisee. I started there as a team member and advanced to General Manager before leaving, my career was long could be stressful but for the most part a balance of life was good."
good,"YUM! Brands high quality safe food is a main corner stone in its foundation. Employee training and accountability are key to the daily execution, across thousands of units and locations.  Company owned units versus franchised units creates a challenge for consistency, however, the organizational structure has adjusted appropriately. The marketing efforts for new and existing products are very effective driving the business, including operations. Wage rates could use a lift, but its a fun culture work."
good,"Yum's brand is a very successful corporate role model. The CHAMP had helped the managers or supervisor to appreciate the subordinate. with the positive thinking and motivating morale, people are working more efficient and they will treat the work as their own business. people are taking care the work or work place as their family. "
good,"•	Processed orders for Pizza Hut,, Taco Bell, Long John Silvers, KFC and A&W incoming calls for Menu Board items and office supplies via fax, ,phone, mail delivery or e-mail."

good,"A typical day includes Arranging new starters schedules, Preparing them for there exams and ensuring there trained to a high standard and follow procedures. I have learned that some people learn in different ways and how to manage the different learning styles to suit each team member or manager best. The management were very good and gave me lots of responsibilities out of my job description to enhance my skills and to learn new ones. The hardest part of my job was the long hours as most of the member who needs extra training was done after hours. The most enjoyable part of my job when my trainees passed there exams and became excellant team members."

good,The only problem was the GM if he/she knew how to run a store maybe the employees wouldn't quit so quickly after being hired. The Arlington location is great otherwise. I wouldn't work here if you get frustrated easily.

good,"I've been working here for a year now and it is amazing working here, hours and scheduling are very flexible and everyone have work ethics which encourages other to work harder."
good,"Probably the hardest thing on the job is to maintain good timing on orders and not have customers wait a long period of time when days are very busy. Everything else is very easy such as cleaning the place, making and packing the food and more."
good,This job was fun. I enjoyed everyone that I worked with. Yes it got busy at times but I love working under pressure makes me feel like I’m in a competition with myself.
good,"A typical day at work for me consists of store opening at 9;30 AM every day Monday - Friday.

good,"I really liked working here because the team all worked well together and we all became so close to each other like a Taco Bell family. This was my first job and I think it's a very good place to work for a first job, because it teaches you to have responsibility and experience that you will need to have in the future. When you arrive at Taco Bell, the first thing you do is greet everyone with a smile. Then you clock-in (when it is time). Then you go the chart that explains what position you will be working that day. (Ex: front counter, drive-thru, line, etc) If you are on frive-thru or front counter, you will have to ask your MIC (manager in charge) to give you a till and you have to count the money and make sure it reaches a certain amount, and then bring it into the register counter and punch in your number for your register. You would then get a break after working for two hours. (10 minutes break or 30  minutes break). After your work day is done, you then take your till and count all your money and make drops into the safe after recording how much money was over the original amount. You confirm you money summary with your signature and then you go and clock-out for the day. And you are done."
