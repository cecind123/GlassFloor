rating,review
bad,"Worst safety environment to work in, do not care one least about safety. Everyone is mostly concerned about moving up the food chain instead of getting work accomplished. Management is horrible and clueless on how to manage. HR department is even worse. The only enjoyable part were the people that worked in manufacturing(non management). Now if you looking for a company not to accomplish much in a working day(slack around), THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE! Like I said management is not smart."
bad,"TERRIBLE management, high turn over, and employees are treated like children. Everyone is hoping things get better with MercK. Vacation time could be better as well as employee appreciation. SAFC is Sales Support is by far the most hated department"
bad,"Management provides no incentives other than to keep your job. No bonuses or stock options (an occasional popsicle/ice cream). Career development severely lacking, no opportunities for going to conferences to keep up on technology to bring back to the company...hence the incredibly outdated equipment and procedures. It is amazing how they are still hanging on in this really fast paced global world. Bottom line is they get the employees to do all the work with very little to work with (eqiupment wise) while the management reaps the benefits of low production costs. This model would be OK but there in no employee investment, and employees are companies greatest asset. If you want to grow in your career, work here as little as possible and jump on other opportunities if they come. Very autocratic company that does not involve or value the opinions of the employees. If you are vocal and have a different point of view...this most probably will hurt you in the long run.  "
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work for this place. Management is bad and the equipments and building is outdated. The company is not willing to fix anything.
bad,"Very Slow Management, do not appreciate your hard work and will remove any contract people without giving them formal notice."
bad,"The company is very poorly managed. They have an attitude of ""everyone is easily replaced"" so there is no attempt to keep good employees, thus the pay is far below industy standards."
bad,"Long hours, minimal pay but good to gain experience.  Buddy based system."
bad,"I am not sure how a company with no real vision or strategy and with the same business model as Montgomery Ward is actually still in business in this day and age. They were great before the internet but this company continually fails to innovate or change. If you are scientist, work in their labs for a few years for experience and then move on. They have surprisingly good benefits, but that is the only perk."
bad,Only thing I enjoyed at this company was my coworkers.  The management staff were power hungry and made things personal versus professional. ThetOnce yo
bad,"Place is great for someone fresh out of college.  Take it at that. 99% of people get burned out within their first 6 months, while being pushed harder and harder."
bad,"Slim to no chance on being permanent or promotion. They hire and fire so much the people who train don't do a good job because they are fairly new themselves. Most of everything, you figure out on your own through trail and error. There is favoritism as well as nepotism. Their are people there for five years still temps with same pay as day one with no benefits. You have to wear uncomfortable work shoes."
bad,"I worked at Millipore for three years. It's a tough place to work, promotions and pay raises are based on who you're friends with. I would recommend finding work elsewhere if you can. They cancelled my health insurance, laughed about it, refused to reinstate it, ended up laying me off after I complained."
bad,There are way too many rules and regulations. It was like being back in high school. They micro-manage every aspect of every job. They do not pay their employees very well.
bad,"An extremely fast paced environment with heavy workload on management. There is a top-down approach to management which often times doesn't address the real issues on the ground. Coworkers  are good for the most part but there is lack of team effort at times."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of being productive. The company's productivity expectations are set too high for the employees who handle dangerous chemicals. Management lacks effective communication with employees. Co-Workers are very nice to another but Aldrich also has a high turnaround with Kelly Temp Services. Management hire who they want to hire based on other reasons besides work ethic and seniority. The hardest part of the job is dealing with racism. All of the managers, supervisors and HR is white. They refuse to promote black employees with the experience and education to the top. They feel threatened by black people, you are not going to get hired if you speak up  and have disagreements with the rules they create. All the rules are word of mouth and are inconsistent. "
bad,"Profitable company focused 99.9% on numbers and 0.1% on employees growth, development and personal lives. While I was there, the organization tried to get into a FDA regulated operations without much success due to the nature of the upper management in not investing upfront which was needed to upgrade infrastructure."
bad,Sweatshop.  On air-conditioned buildings to work again .  Excessive heat  Long hours . Too few people doing all the work while other stand around and get away with it .
bad,Most of your time and energy is spent on politics instead of getting the work done. The work paste is very slow. Their products are very mature so not a lot of room for creativity
bad,Designated activities. No diversion in routine. All systems in place. Overall very systematic. No challenges in actual work but in working conditions in offices.
good,"Empresa de pequeno porte, fácil localização. "
good,Great people with poor management the guy looks for the negatives in everything...the job is easy to perform if you have basic computer knowledge and can learn in a fast passed environment.
good,"ros"
good,The job is pretty decent and fairly easy to do. The work is mainly with chemicals but the company underpays its employees alot.
good,The benefit packages available are quite nice and competitive with other places of employment however the salary compensation left some to be desired for me. My supervisor was easy to work with and had an open door policy which made it a nice place to work and my peers there were typically helpful with daily questions and tasks.
good,"The hardest, part of the job would have been the people that were clickish and clannish.and  that caused rifts between employees and the management staff, that should not have even existed between one another! In the end I learned how to separate myself from certain people that were not in my circle of co-workers. pretty much if you could just separate yourself then you can make it any where"
good,"If the company wasn't moving production to Ireland I would be staying, as of December 2016 the plant will be closing, and jobs will be lost."
good,"company is good but culture need to develop. "
good,Employee receiving a lot of responsibilities from day one and are given the opportunity to solve problem in their own way.
good,"Customer Service technician for National and International calls"
good,The work the company is involved in is phenomenal when it comes to science. Everything else is sort of blah. Too many layers of management and a high turnover rate.
good,Supervise operators.  Management participation is dismal.  Workplace culture is poor.  Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that what we manufacture is positively impacting lives.
good,"I was working as Intern for the US team. Assisting both customer and scientist both work on oracle based software..scientific  assessment of research paper based on sigma product.Analysis of sigma products eg- Chemicals,Scientific Kits."
good,Sigma is a chemical company trying to be a Biotech company.  They are risk adverse which really don't work in Biotech.  People tend to stay there all of their career.
good,"As a midwestern company that leans conservative on spending, investing on employees, and keeping up with the times, Sigma-Aldrich has some problems when it comes to keeping employees engaged and keeping processes and people up to date."
good,"Overall I had a positive experience with the people at Sigma, tho it came to an impasse, when I was given a Sigmotion (an internal term for a promotion without compensation or a new job title)"
good,"There's not a such thing as a ""typical"" day at work and I really don't want to be completely negative about the company because I don't have experience in any other department other than packaging so I'll decline to comment about some of the tasks, management & the department overall. My co-workers are pretty interesting & they help the day go by a lot easier than it could be."
good,"Otherwise you risk being forgotten about, workload can also be very heavy strategies put in place to address workload issues often didn't last long, most colleagues friendly & helpful."
good,"No tempo de serviço aprendi como realizar um melhor atendimento, aprendi um pouco sobre importação. Não tive dificuldade, era um ambiente agradavel de se trabalhar."
good,"The job(s) I performed at Aldrich required you to work independently for the most part. Some days you were ""under the gun"". Other days were a little more bearable. Co-workers are cheerful and friendly for the most part and willing to help when needed. Safety is paramount at Aldrich, especially considering the materials dealt with there (ie. many types of hazardous chemicals). They greatly stress Process Improvement at Aldrich."
good,I was displaced due to jobs being eliminated within the department. I worked with the company for over 21 years until our department was eliminated. I would have stayed.
good,"A typical day consists of getting set up, going over safety tips because of the environment. In this field i learned to go over basic procedures and safety guidelines i also learned how to go over paper work processes for quality control purposes. Management was decent but not as organized as it could be, and i had a good team of co-workers, everyone worked together and made sure as a whole we were safe. Hardest part of the job is meeting quota with having to weigh open chemical. The most enjoyable part was just being around good people and getting a chance to experience something different."
good,Good place to work plenty procedures to follow and employee training is of the utmost and I enjoy working along side my colleagues
good,"Good place to work and most of the comments are sa before. "
good,"Production of biological buffers, working with industrial dryers, centrifuges, Vessels, and diaphragm and centrifical pumps. Work within a small scale r&d lab testing unfinished and finished products in house."
good,"Work ina 12hour day, 4shift cycle consisting of 2days 2night shift.From start of shift to the end of shift your kept going which makes the day go fast. We manafucture different types membranes for the medical/bio/pharmaceutical,brevage industries and I am a process technician in millipore."
good,"Too stressful to work and get low pay. A lot of Lazy people work with over there, so it is hard to work by yourself and nobody care beside you. The boss seem don't really care about you. He cared only about productivity."
good,"équipe sympathique"
good,"Great group of people to work with"
good,"Atmosphere conducive to maintaining good exercise habits as there is an outdoor walking path with plenty of greenery.  Not a massive ""2000 Strong"" type of call center. Smaller than most."
good,picking stocking piling shipping and packing pharmaceuticals and chemical products.
good,"The problem at our Teutonia site was a complete lack of communication. Operators didn't get their compensation on time, Management lacked in the general responsibilities."
good,"l environnement de travail était agréable , mais la liberté d'action limité et trop structuré "
good,The current CEO does not respect the scientists (the bread and butter of the company) and panders to the business employees.
good,"I worked as SAP Hana BW Consultant, Worked on HANA Studio,Involved in SAP SLT Replication"
good,"Process chemicals on small and large scale to cGMP standards. Cleaning equipment on configured chain. Daily checks on scrubbers, chillers, cooling towers, vacuum pumps, effluent tanks, demineralised water tanks etc. Sampling of product. Problem solving  and fault finding. BA team member and forklift trained."
good,I don't really have much to say on Sigma-Aldrich as shortly after they hired me the business was acquired by a major German pharmaceutical company called Merck.
good,"Still waiting for the project allocated for me                  "
good,It is good company for less experienced professional.Working hours are slightly painful.Overall it is a good company to work.Good salary.
good,Management want company to be drug discovery and not contract manufacturing
good,"typical work day was very busy, hardest part of the job was keeping up with the assembly line. scanning the products to the correct carrier.running the line."
good,"When I worked at the Jaffrey site I felt the expectations were too high as assigned by the corporate office."
good,"A good company to work with if you get in to a right team, however some teams have too many limitations & less opportunities to learn & explore knowledge."
good,Less interesting place to work since the merger.  There has been a shift of power from St Louis MO to Darmstaadt Germany and the new corporation is keen to outsource to India and Manila.
good,"Ótima empresa reconhecida mundialmente."
good,Good company to work for however challenging when it comes to advancement from a temp to a regular no matter how much one reaches far beyond the daily numbers or not.
good,"Answering calls and questions, assisting employees, chem trek calls, emergency calls on a global spectrum. Fast paced environment where you need to be sharp and on your toes."
good,Sigma has been a great company to work for. They are constantly shuffling their sales force to ensure they are getting the correct mix.
good,"Sigma Aldrich cuenta con un clima laboral muy bueno, sin embargo la administración de MERCK está haciendo que poco a poco ese clima laboral disminuya en cuestiones de calidad, es por el ajusto y reingenieria que actualmente viven ambas empresasd."
good,"Empresa con gran compromiso con su gente, altamente recomendable"
good,Millipore Corporation was bought out by another company after my employment.  This was my first job out of college and I learned many aspects of being in the workforce from this position.
good,"This company is a good one. It provides its employees with benefits, yearly raises, paid time off, and sick time. this company has allowed me to be employed for 22 years."
good,"Very productive and safe workplace which prioritized worker safety above all else. While I was just a temp, I felt very welcomed and quickly assimilated to the work culture."
good,"Millipore was a nice company to work for,people all very nice.The company changed when Merck bought Millipore and are outsourcing everything and everyone they can. I suggest staying away or you will be looking for employment too."
good,"Managing key accounts, by visiting costumers, discussing their needs and potential products that could be beneficial for them; by handling all requirements needed by the customer. Handling quotations, and specific enquiries and general enquires with regards to my accounts. Selling and promoting products and services to customers."
good,Nice people who care about you and the advancement of your career.
good,"The day starts with a maintenance meeting where equipment availability for repair, calibrations or service is decided. I then prepare any permits to work required so that the equipment is safe to work on."
good,I first started working here back in 1990 I worked here for nine years then joined the US ARMY and came back after I had gotten out and worked another two years I liked working here they have a good family attitude about them and they have so many different job areas that you could learn and your are also given the opporitunity to further your education. I worked all 3 shifts that they have and still would prefer to work first shift.
good,Overall good company with good values and a nice work life balance
good,"Weighing chemicals, in each unit. Assuring accurate and proper chemical weight, and packaging of each unit. It was a good experience to have, it was quite interesting. But a lot of heavy lifting and heavy work."
good,great place to move around departments it is a plus if you have a chemistry background. do no be afraid to apply. The interviews majorly consist of situation and behavior based questions.
good,Never a boring moment. My day was full from the moment I stepped into the office. Sometimes no moments to breathe. I learned to use the fork lift. I worked with a lot of paperwork and spread sheets.
good,2 Shift operation. Some operations and equipment need modernizing or updating. small storage spaces and areas for the production requirements. Good people to work with and for.
good,"Aprendi muito com a empresa, pude fazer um trabalho focado e conquistar vários clientes. A empresa dava liberdade para criação das estratégias de vendas, assim como fornecia ferramentas importantes para alcançar os objetivos."
good,Fair compensation - excellent for a college student starting out. Because this was so long ago this review may not be accurate for today. But I did enjoy my work. It was just a little mundane.
good,"Being so stationary in a cubicle with no opportunity to move or stretch, and only a 30 minute lunch to catch your breath, does not fit my personality or work ethic."
good,Meet great people everyday.  Interesting equipment to service.
good,"This is an excellent job to learn about the pharmaceutical manufacturing business. They are very goal oriented and train you very well in cGMP and how to run a custom active pharmaceutical ingredient business. They do not give very good raises however, and do not want to give praise where it is ben earned."
good,"Sigma Aldrich has recognized the need to reinvent itself as a research supply company. This is very positive but has brought changes far too often for the sales force. Changes to product focus, areas of accountability and even the compensation plan. From a corporate level these initiatives make sense but impact the financial security of those in the field selling the products."
good,A typical day at work begins at 10:00 and involves a packing system based on productivity. Expectations are stressed daily for rate to be made. I've always been a team player but this job has expanded that. I've also learned to ensure the quality of my work is above expectations. Management can be frustrating sometimes. As for co-workers we always have those who go above and beyond as well as those who don't. I have been told in every review that I consistently go above and beyond to help my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is not moving to different areas of the warehouse to be cross trained even though I have expressed interest numerous times to both my supervisor and warehouse manager. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have a secure job
good,"Way too many shipping errors to vital customers overseas made by the shipping manager at EMD Millipore in Hayward, California. She just laughs it off when I request feedback or status reports."
good,Research and development opportunities were astounding. I joined Sigma immediately after graduation. There was some turbulence in the beginning as direct supervisor lacked diversity training.
good,"Your day is pretty straight forward, you go in, report to your work station and do your job. Good employees in there and relatively friendly. Current management is rather racist towards some hispanic people though."
good,"not very sure as I was only there for three months and that too as a consultant, seemed to be a good company but young workforce was missing. Great if you want to stay in STL."
good,"Sigma-Aldrich is an ok place to work.  The benefits were good but salary compensation was weak, at best.  If you are IT they employee the latest technologies so that's always a plus.  Very scientific company."
good,"Great work environment where independence and problem solving abilities were highly valued. As in most companies, management decisions were made based on personal relationships rater than the best interest of the company"
good,There were two shifts days and evenings. they were twelve hour shifts. I learned to follow procedures in doing the chemical process. Working there had to be a team effort. Every move we made was radio transmitted. The long hours in the heat was the hardest. I enjoyed working with the people.
good,Busy days with great opportunities for job improvement. Good benefits and the ability to work between different departments and enhance training.
good,"This was my First full time job. It has good benefits, good starting salary but hard to move up in the maintenance dept. very good work/ life balance with over time if needed."
good,"Depending on workload I either work as an operator in the bays producing chemicals or type up procedures for upcoming chemical production. As part of writing procedures I have to communicate with several departments, procurement, shipping, billing... So having good communication skills is vital. Some analytical skills are needed in determining reaction completion but most tests are conducted through the quality control or development departments. Management lacks communication from department to department making start dates and starting materials hard to obtain. My co-workers are knowledgeable in the positions and are helpful. Most work is done by yourself but if help is needed someone is available. The hardest part of my job is the schedule, it is a rolling schedule and is very hard on my home life since I have small children at home. At work the schedule is also frustrating because it varies from department to department leaving us at times without support from other departments. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my procedures produce a quality product with little to any problems."
good,I enjoyed working here for 14yrs. It was fast paced but the work force were lovely. The majority of  management staff were  very approachable and helpful.
good,"Management were sometimes bias, only those they like even if those people worked sucked, wasn't always fair and HR knew this but seemed not to be able to do anything about it."
good,"Innovative products and a clear market leader.  They offer the highest quality products in their space.  Okay, I am just adding words here because I can't move past this page this a certain number of characters have been entered."
good,"It was a fun, stressful and interesting experience. Learned a  lot about work environments, culture and relations. I would definitely recommend whoever is qualified to work there."
good,"Lots of great people, interesting job.  A typical day involved making or purifying biochemicals .  Challenging work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers I had the pleasure to work with for many years"
good,I worked at Sigma Aldrich full-time more than 8 years. You can develop and move within the company. Highly experienced management and it's a friendly environment.
good,"Grandes  experiências  adquiri nessa  empresa,  só tenho a agradecer a oportunidade ."
good,Overall a great place to work. Production has vamped up so there was a lot of changes being put in to affect. Only thing that made me leave was the shift changes.
good,"management is nice, hands off allows you to express your skills, more direction on goals and deliverable would be helpful.  resources are available to complete projects, cross functional teams are very receptive to supporting projects."
good,"Wide range of job opportunities, quality co-workers, older facilities, upper management is approachable, conservative approach, work life balance is good."

good,"I was happy working with the company. we had free lunches for our meeting usually.People I was working with was fun and amazing.Our entire team was very productive to meet clients needs, always even if  it was on short noticed."
good,"I love working at Sigma Aldrich my only problem would be the heat. Air conditioning is needed throughout different area in the warehouse , I love the diversity. but it should be a lot easier to learn new tasks here..."
good,Wonderful place to work with great people. Celebrating 350 yrs in Business. Very fast paced organized company with lots of dangerous chemicals incoming and outgoing daily. Lots of training and job advancements within the company.
good,"Great experience excellent benefits.  Left for different opportunity, I would be happy to return at any time.  Great people, good managers and an excellent education reimbursement policy."
good,"This company prides itself on hiring the best scientists capable of developing and providing the highest-quality products available in the scientific research community, and they deliver on that mission."
good,"Millipore a été ma plus belle expérience. Pourtant salaire petit mais les primes n'ont cessé d'augmenter, et les évolutions au sein du poste, de plus en plus possible. "
good,"I was responsible for handling all the international shipments to France Subsidiaries. The hardest part of this job was if one of your colleges was on vacation, you responsible for handling all of their responsibilities which was overwhelming at times. I multi-tasked and execute these requirements without any delays. Enjoyed working with my former colleagues in the International shipping department at Millipore."
good,its a fast paced work u get to learn lots of task an meet all kinds of new ppeople some days are very rough depending on the work load never a boring moment
good,It was nice working for such a great company which gives employees the opportunity to grow and also provides employees great benefits. I had the opportunity to work at this company for six years all three different shifts.
good,Dynamic workplace.  You will need to be adaptable to change as it is part of the culture.  A fast growing organization that is bottom line driven. I enjoyed working alongside  my colleagues and always looked forward to a new challenging project.  The most enjoyable part of my job was supporting the members of our team and keeping everything organized.
good,would recommend the company to people. I have great respect to the operators at Millipore. I give it a good ratting. great location
good,This company is a productive workplace to work at. I work around positive people and motivated people who are eager to learn anything from the company. The hardest part of the job is it can be slow but it depends on the work that is being allocated.
good,"Assembled and installed components using various tools to complete assignment. Packaged finished items and separated "
good,"Closely follow MSDS and safety procedures for distribution"
good,Really fun different places everyday new costumer learn a lot. This was a different job but i did love it
good,"Lavoro dinamico e vario."
good,"Very busy, firstly read emails for any changes that may have occurred.I pick sequences from our customer orders database and place these together on runs for each ABI3900 machine/ARK-NG."
good,Great management and employee welfare. Encourage learning.
good,My typical day include managing my Strategic Account and Assoicate Teams. My Strategic account team work wth our high dollar accounts. I also supervise switchboard and mailroom employees. I consistently work on process improvements and working with our sales reps that covers those account.
good,"Sigma-Aldrich is a great company to begin your scientific career. It is easy to switch to many parts of the corporation, as long as you are just starting out in them (such as marketing, procurement, etc.). Advancement is difficult due to its conservative culture and long time employees."
good,"Nice place to work,management is really nice,they are little less on pay compared to other major companies."
good,"I loved my time with Sigma-Aldrich. Although it is a bit slower paced, the sales team had a familial environment where you felt respected and taken care of."
good,"I enjoyed to work with children,caring and teaching them. I learned about the tools to use for their development skills. As a team worker , we helped each other as needed. The management staff were perfect. The hardest part of the job was the closing and the most enjoyable part of my job was the time I was playing with children &teaching them."
good,"Bonnes opportunités de formation et d'évolution de carrière. Pas beaucoup d'opportunité en logistique, activité sous-traitée à un prestataire de service."
good,"I worked at Aldrich for 7 years at their Sheboygan Falls plant. It was a good place to work but at times frustrating. It was a 24/7 schedule which meant 12 hour shifts. One day you could work the entire 12 and the next mabye 2 and spend the other 10 looking for the correct tools or trying to fix the machinery. Management were o.k. for the most part, if you left them alone they are not hands on. There were no difficult or hard jobs, just repetitive lifting, and EXTREME BOREDOM! I enjoyed working with my coworkers they were all friendly and that is the part I miss the most"
good,"I loved working for this company. It is a large company with a huge global impact, yet I was treated with respect and admiration and not like another number or drone employee."
good,"This is a global science and technology company with a passion for"
good,"Sigma Aldrich is an excellent company to work for that truly harnesses an exceptional and diverse working culture. Sigma provides well-rounded compensation and benefit packages. However, communication is definitely an area of improvement, specifically from the C-suite to lower level roles. In addition, the company operates using multiple systems that perform the same functionality. Therefore, this causes double and in some instances triple repetitions of the same task, hence decreasing productivity and efficiency.."
good,"Great place with interesting people. Management was open minded and kept employees updated with decisions that would affect their work, encouraged employees to continue their education by attending seminars or conferences."
good,"very good platform for learning, friendly environment supporting team member.  enhanced my skill."
good,"8 to 9 hour I work here depend on work load, "
good,The internship with Sigma Aldrich helped prepare me for my career within supply chain by assigning a project that allowed me to work daily with the planning and purchasing teams.
good,Working at my personal work station packing different sorts of chemicals. Using all sorts of hazardous stickers as needed paying close attention to the product so it can be packed accordingly.
good,I have learned a lot about being safe and clean while working with different chemicals. Also the management staff and co worker have your back and will help you when in need.
good,"I enjoyed working with this company, it offered me the ability to communicate with people other than my age group. It also offered me the chance to build skills that will affect me for the rest of my life."
good,Working at Sigma-Aldrich is an honor and one of the premier places to work in the St. Louis area.  I have met a lot of different people with many different backgrounds and educational levels.
good,Sigma-Aldrich is a great place to learn and understand the life sciences market. I recommend this company to everyone.
good,I was able to obtain 3 different positions within the company and all of the positions were very different which gave me the opportunity to learn.
good,"Sigma-Aldrich is a leading Life Science and High Technology company. Our biochemical and organic chemical products and kits are used in scientific and genomic research, biotechnology, pharmaceutical development, the diagnosis of disease and chemical manufacturing. We have customers in life science companies, university and government institutions, and hospitals and in industry. Sigma-Aldrich sells to over 160 countries & operates directly in 33 countries and has over 6,000 employees providing excellent service worldwide."
good,"I would sorty all the morning mail into mailslot and then load up my cart to go around and deliver the mail, stamp all outgoing mail to go out, sort all interoffice mail, cover switchboard and reception for breaks and Lunches. the management was wonderful to work for. and the co-workers were great and we were all reazlly friendly. the best part of the job was the co-workers and the people and dealing with them as I am a people person"
good,I enjoyed going to the different places to work and learning new job skills and meeting and working new people
good,"Sigma-Aldrich was a Good Company to work for.."
good,Got to pick all different sizes of orders in a pharmacetical company. Was introduced to go into rooms where substances were in the huge freezer rooms. Again Co-workers were always helpful unlike the immediate supervisor.
good,Hard Working And Help Other Also Worked OverTime And Work A Lot On MyOwn And Was Very Good With Warehouse Production
good,I would put on all my personal protective equipment. Identify my chemicals to be weighed on a scale. The chemicals would be weighed in bottles and capped to be shipped to customers. After every order i would do my paperwork to ensure accurate numbers. Communication between co-workers would be important to ensure the right chemicals and right numbers of product is correct. Taking off and putting on all that ppe after every break and lunch or meeting is very time consuming and difficult. Moving from a different station everyday made the job enjoyable because you were never doing the same thing.
good,"Included Process development of the synthesis of new products from lab scale to kilogram scale. "
good,A very diverse work force.  Company is doing allot of system changes and is transferring their shared service from the US to India and Manila. I learned how to communicate with a large diverse nationality.
good,Started my career in chemical operations with Sigma. Good employee training program with strong support form group leaders/management. A great place to learn a new skill set and hone your skills.

good,"I learned a lot ,but the most important thing was we were a real team,and cared about each other ,and what we did as employees.management was good they let us run the show for we were the ones doing the job.the hardest part was saying good by to all thous great people I work with for so long.Too be honest the best part,  I enjoyed was being part of something more than just a job,and you did it every day with pride."
good,"J'ai pu apprécier grand nombre de postes au sein de cette entreprise"
