good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations.

The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations.

The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations.

The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations.

The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations.

The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations.

The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills.

bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one.

bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing.

bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee.

bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place.

bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee.

bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place.

bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee.

bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.

bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
bad,"Unfortunately, the mission statement ""great place for employees to work"" is false.  ""A great place for physicians to practice medicine"" may be true, but making ""a great place for patient's to receive care"" is contradicting."
bad,It's a terrible place to work there you will not get any raise and you will barely get vacation. Plus they do not care about your employee health.....
bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.

bad,"Like a factory, not for everyone,if you like same thing, day in day out with no challenge,Boring,Unhealthy, uncreative, rigid, unrewarding place to work."
bad,"The culture in this company was very unwelcoming for a new nurse. They were constantly bashful, negative, and unfriendly. It made me very afraid of my future as a nurse and questioned my degree due this negative environment. There was no management, nurses were expected to take more than 6 patients at a time and even the charge nurse had 8 patients at a time, it was really a chaos and very unsafe for patient care."
bad,"Absolutely worst management and administration, its a wonder the place is still open. They hire underqualified directors that have absolutely no education to oversee educated doctors and nurses. HIPPA violations and infection control issues at nauseum. Directors publicly insult staff in the presence of peers and patients. Directors have no knowledge of HIPPA regulation or JACO regulations. They are only worried about image, not if patients are being cared for properly. Directors actually tell their nurses if they don't play by their rules they will go after your license. The only nurses that stay working there are the ignorant bottom feeders that no one else wants."
bad,HCA is the absolute worst employer for any social service positions. Pay is ridiculously low and not competitive with other companies. They do not value employees. No room for professional growth. They do not have any concern for your health or personal wellbeing.
bad,"I choose to not write a review as every employee has a very different experience , some days were harder than others some days you had over 20 patients others you had 7"
good,HCA as a company is an over all caring and wonderful company to work with. I worked at several HCA hospitals and would gladly go back to one. The workplace culture at each facility was somewhat different at each one but overall is one of caring and wanting to do the right thing for the patient and the staff.
bad,The employer cheated breaks. Management did not care about unsafe work loud. The HCA well l known to terminate older employee. HCA management is very poorly manage they don't respect employees and treat them very bad it makes it clear the there just go to work for a paycheck I had a very bad experiences working there Good Sam. Knowledge is not valued in  the company. Just go . to work and keep quiet sense of atmosphere.
bad,Poor advancement opportunity. Hire outside rather than promoting from within. Poor pay. Poor management. No education to help gain knowledge to advance I  company.
bad,This is a for profit hospital and it showsl you never have supplies and other things you need to take care of your patients. The statf is rude and not helpful.
bad,"If you like cliques and being treated as if you are nothing then this is the place for you.  Lure you in with fake profession of being all about the Christian faith, God first, Family Second and Work third.  That's not the case whatsoever unless you are at the top of their food chain"
bad,its been a while since i was there but they dont care about you at all. lack of care for patients as well i enjoyee my co workers mostly and they patients.
bad,"Stressful, disorganized  and unsafe work environment .  They have absolutely no value to the safety of the staff .  Poor organization.  Major turn over."
bad,Struggle to make the management hear your day to day challenges. The leaders fail to demonstrate that they care to their employees. No Life and Work Balance exist!
bad,"Typical understaffed, overworked. No one cares about anything because they gave up a long time ago. You're not aloud to bring up problems or suggest improvements because that would mean there is a problem, and they don't acknowledge problems. I've seen the most determined, motivated people come in and soon enough, they look like a zombie."
bad,"Working for HCA is fine till they inform you, That you don't meet productions standards, You would think your fired! They promote you to fire those that do meet standards, but complained about lack of communication from management."
bad,"Expect long days, early mornings and lots of evening and weekend engagements. Do not expect any thank you's, accolades or encouragement. Be ready for unrealistic goals and high expectations. Be MORE than okay with an incentive bonus that sounds great on paper but NO ONE EVER HITS IT! You must love reporting to multiple people with little to no management skills. Feel free to request help, but do not anticipate being backed by anyone since this would be in opposition to their upward mobility and butt kissing. If you LOVE politics, i.e. 26 year olds with no work experience, newly minted Master's degrees and rich parents getting highly overpaid executive positions in lieu of experienced, tenured, mature and experienced co-workers than you will LOVE this place. Oh and let me rave on the benefits...2 weeks is it! Earn those PTO and don't expect a vacation for a minimum of a year."
bad,I would not reccomend working for this company. A lot of people have been layed off or leaving. Organization is not able to keep up with the changes. Unorganzied and dysfunctioal.
