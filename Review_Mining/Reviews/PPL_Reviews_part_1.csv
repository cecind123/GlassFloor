bad,"Didn't work there long. I had to move, but $9.00 a hour for in home health care to a MS patient that couldn't walk or really do anything for herself wasn't enough money."
bad,"Pay is horrible. There is no chance of ever getting paid more then 9.40 an hour. No benefits, no paid vacation, no nothing extra for the nurses that actually do a great good. It’s ok if you don’t have real bills to pay."
bad,Poor culture. No support and extremely judgemental people work there. They preach building good culture but upper management surely does not practice it. Not inclusive at all. Would never recommend working there.
bad,The ladies at PPL have no personality they will put you in a job where you are treated like absolute trash and no one cares at all about your issues or being targeted at the workplace by racist blacks
bad,I didnt gwt paid all my money and i done more then i was paid to do .they was rude when you had to call them and the caseworker was really rude and didnt listen to what you had to say about the job and the person i was taking care of
bad,I worked for ppl if you're late or make a mistake on your timesheets this company don't care if you have bills to pay they hold your money for two weeks don't do anything to help except say I'm sorry ma'am. Smh will never recommend this company to anyone
bad,"A challenging role lack of Senior support - if things a re good they carry on with no acknowledgement but if wrong they will make a complete meal"
bad,I was very happy when my assignment ended at this job. I was hoping that they were not going to renew my contract. Everyone is scared of the boss and he is rude to the employees. Would not ever go back there again.
bad,Working for PPL Corporation was an interesting job. My responsibilities was answering the phone and assisting clients with any questions they had regarding their PPL bill.
bad,A typical day was poorly planned out. Do more with less and even when you think management will back you up they will not. This company will terminate you even for doing what you feel is acting in the best interest for publics safety while responding to emergency calls. This company will set you up for failure even if you follow there rules which management do not even know. Stay away and if you do go make sure you have back up plan.
bad,Horrible place with reorganization’s every 12-18 months and complete replacement of mgmt getting worse with every change. Current leader soulless shareholder out for his own wallet and doing everything to cut costs to sell business while grinding staff to bone. Hates certain depts because he doesn’t understand them and praises complainers who are real root. Cult environment where if you come over from healthcare practice you are hero even if weaker qualified than others and not able to contribute. Awful place and grave concern for disabled community they’re supposed to help
bad,"No vacation days, no sick days will not pay over one minute per shift. No 401k you have to clean up behind all familly yembers in or out of the household plus pets"
bad,Total incompetence from wall to wall. This is a perfect example of a company in a downward spiral.  Unfortunately the ratepayers will wind up footing the bill when the bottom drops out.
bad,This companies IT department went through 4 re-organizations in a 5 year period. Two of those the company made all IT employees apply and interview for their positions. The last re-org the IT department went from ~230 employees down to 150 after roughly 80 employees didn't get past the interview process. They started laying off employees last October 2018 and continue to this day. A person without a job was either left go right away or put on a TSA (temporary service assignment) where you did your old job until no longer needed which could have been 3 months to the end of 2019. The culture and management is so bad that employees that actually got re-hired with jobs are running out the door and they are filling those positions with contractors.
bad,"Pros"
bad,A typical day at work has you jumping through hoops reacting to the latest issue.  Workplace culture is undesirable and attempts to improve culture seemed to have back fired.  Vision is lacking.
bad,"procedural health matters not dealt with correctly."
bad,WARNING!!!...If you are hired as a TEMP do not even think for one minute that you will be hired on as a PPL employee in the future. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. Despite what they may tell you it will not happen. Your emotional roller coaster ride will begin from day one. So if you except a TEMP position and think for one minute you will be hired then strap yourself in and hold on tight because you're in for a very bumpy ride.
bad,"When I first started management was made up of long time employees with experience in different positions and it seemed like a good structure."
bad,"Company has zero concern for the well being of employees. Only concern was cost. Company eliminated dedicated training for employees."
bad,Where I worked seemed that there was a conspiracy to get rid of people that were there long to save money by hiring new people at half rate of pay. Overall PPL gets a negative review from me.
bad,"I worked for PPL for approximately 1 1/2 years. I noticed that Management was not secure in their positions and were moved frequently sometimes with no notification at all. This made it extremely difficult for new employees in new departments. With each new boss came new goals and ideas, only to come in and realize someone else in your department was plucked from their job and relocated to another department or offered a severance package. The job you bid may not be the job your in two months later. There was no stability in my department. Jobs were left as is with no updates from relocated or departed employees. Training was next to impossible due to work load and deadlines and lack of people to provide training. Tracking documentation was just as frustrating caused by frequent movement and left as is."
bad,"I worked at PPL for little over 3 years and I won’t ever consider going back. The management is very poor since it’s based on favorite not qualification. If you want to work there, prepare to be fake and have brown nose to get good treatment. Low moral company which shocked me to see a great company like PPL has such bad and low morale culture."
bad,co-workers are good people but new management is not easy to work for. The easiest part of the job was being a lineman. The hardest part was putting up with all the unneeded micro-management
bad,I love work for the co and only left to stay home with my kide iv have worked from the co 2 time and have doun my job ever time i lile the co a lot th
bad,"Typical work day we cleaned the plant and work spaces after the mechanics completed their jobs. We learned about the plant while assisting the mechanics and electricians. The hardest part of the day was dealing with the noise level of the plant, spiders, and working around coal dust."
bad,"I dont think they care to much for their employees, they look at ypu as just a number and easily replaceable.i felt like they didnt listen to any of my comments or concerns"
bad,its a good organization of govt of Pakistan but there is now much employment i mean over employment  so the seller y are not comfortable and the work is also not special so i want to change it when i found a little bit better opportunity and ppl is proving every thing like health insurance and ticketing etc
bad,Was happy to move on to further my career I would recommend this company to anyone who is just starting out there's not a lot of room for advancement but it does make room for opportunities
bad,The goal is perfection in all job duties. All work is constantly monitored by supervision. Anything less than perfection will result in a coaching session. Benefits are slowly being reduced.Staffing is usually below minimal requirements.
bad,"If you bring new ideas or insights, keep them to yourself. They don’t want anyone rocking their boats! Good pay, vacation time, and benefits.  Some great employees, but they don’t feel appreciated."
bad,Management lacked ethics.  All they were concerned with was cutting the budget and no concern for the people working for them or the job. The whole air in the department was very tense
bad,The manager was horrible! The morale was extremely low and she didn't care to do anything to boost it. Not only did you have to clock in on time but you also had to sign a sheet at the managers desk and still make it to your seat on time. It was just a lot of added and unnecessary stress. The actual phone portion of it was not too bad except for the irate customers but that's expected.
bad,Horrible place to work and I was there 13 years. Would never go back. Management is horrible and definite favoritism. Things are not equal within the supervisory area and you are treated a a child and robot.
bad,"Once submitting payment time cards to PPL, it seemed you held your breath just hoping you would be paid on time.  Not a reliable payment corporation.  Just don't plan on pays always being on time."
bad,"Engage with new using new technology, but struggle with getting any support from higher ups. Seem to be reluctant to fully embrace new ideas that go against the norm. Have also watched department continually change but direction is unknow to employees."
bad,"paid was not competitive. no benefits. no pay increases.  Bonuses offered very hard to meet goal. only 1%of employees met it."
bad,"The culture at PPL is horrible.  There are very few people there who won't stab you in the back at the first chance they get.  It seems as though they look for the biggest a-holes they can find and make them all managers or directors.  In my time there, I saw numerous people join the company and leave within 3 months because it was so horrible.  They made a much better decision than I as I stayed much longer."
bad,"The job was a fun experience to get to see alot of attractions and making sure Customers were happy, but the job and management was all over the place. They had no control over situations, always making us employees look bad when it was their faults. I only really learned how to work a cashier and make customers happy, but cooks were sending out non cooked all the way food. its a good job if u want something simple but to have to be all over the place and not getting the satisfaction of the worker you were showed to be was the worst part.Then your not guaranteed to work every event and then when they need u to work on short notice its a write up if u dont come in, you barely get a 5minute break, theres no benefits, and you have to pay for your own meals which for a pretzel is $4, and a burger is $10"
bad,"Very bad employee culture. I worked as a contractor, they treated me very bad. I find out their behavior in this particular department is very bad and unacceptable."
bad,Terrible restructuring micromanagement more time explains actions then getting to perform job. Terrible utility company. Terrible utilization of assets
bad,"The company has split into two, cutting jobs, eliminating a work force with a median age of 50 and creating leaner companies with the same amount of work. Currently hiring to refill positions that were cut."
bad,"PPL used to be a great place to work.  Then they decided to bring in a consultant to improve corporate culture.  Sadly the culture declined precipitously after that.  At the time of my departure, every person I knew was counting the days till retirement, looking for another job, or whining because they had not other job options.  This included first and some second level supervisors."
bad,Needs to offer more job opportunities for personnel. the most enjoyable part of the job is the involvement with the costumers and being a part of storm duties.
bad,"Velice kolegiální a vřelý přístup při zaškolení. Častá vzájemná výpomoc, při nakládání zboží v závislosti na velikosti nákladu."
good,No comp for OT and no work life balance. Morale is very bad among employees.
good,"Most enjoyable part of job was caring for the elderly couple in their home and getting to know them and their family as well as"
good,"Stressfull, earnings are important only.  There was no effort in internal transfers. Senior management broke a good culture where everyone worked together."
good,"In by 8 am. Electronic badge access. assigned computers and location. Phone lines are opened immediately, and work begins. some days are okay, other days you have deadlines to meet and you can be bombarded with other agents work, especially when they are randomly terminated. the holidays like thanksgiving were acknowledged, and some agents wished others happy birthday. one hour breaks were a blessing to build back brain power after talking to customers most of the helping to fix whatever the problem was and 15mins break as well, although you don't always get your breaks."
good,Tough time to be at PPL.  Lot of transition and cuts.  Will be interesting to see where this place is in 5 years.  A lot has changed in the last year and a half.
good,"The one good thing about being a customer service rep was if i did get an irate customer who was yelling and cursing at me, I was able to say ma'ma or sir please calm down or i will have to terminate this phone call."
good,"The company is cash-short and can't make ends meet. They have already sold off a few business divisions to help raise cash / lower debts.   People are being offered buy-outs, asked to leave, force to leave or are over-loaded with the work from others who have left.  There is a revolving door of critical core individuals who work for 1-3 years then leave for better jobs. There are dozens of antiquated business systems that are not Intuitive and are ill equipped to handle modern day life.  It takes 9-18 months to really learn these systems but people aren't sticking around that long. Supervisors and managers play musical chairs, never really sticking with the same job long enough to effectively perform their jobs or be held accountable for their actions."
good,"I prefer to not enter Review information, including"
good,"Professional clicks and bullies.  If you are not part of a click, or favored by some, you basically go no where and are professionally bullied.  Great pay and benefits, which locks you in to work there, decent amount of work and training, but you feel awful working there as an individual.  You basically wish your day was over before you start."
good,A good job if you want to work long hours with little appreciation
good,i learned a lot..
good,It was ok working for them just didn't see the office people but talked on phone but other than I done my job.Stoppes working there because client became to combative
good,Too many layers of supervision; the military model.  High turnover as a result.  Changed from a hybrid of utility plus competitive to 100% utility without notice to employees or comment.
good,Productive and challenging work; enjoyed going to work; enjoyed working with other employees; need to work on higher and middle management being consistent with company's goals and objectives
good,"At one time employees felt valued. I believe that is no longer the case. It has become all about the bottom line, shareholders, and Wall Street."
good,"Hands down, my best IT job in the past 28 years - I've been at PPL for the last 20!  While it is definitely the best, that is NOT to say that the environment DOESN'T need some adjustments."
good,Pokud budete chtít sklad ppl zkusit.. Doporučuji Olomouc. Skvělý kolektiv lidí
good,"Supervised attendance, work orders, call volume, interviewed and hired new agents. New programs and procedures. Co-workers were helpful at times. Hardest part of job was not being able to help all individuals due to lack of interest in job. Mentoring and Coaching agents was the most enjoyable."
good,My primary daily functions is being available to customer inbound calls. I enjoy my co-workers.
good,"Worked for the company for ~31 years in all aspects of Nuclear Operations. Saw many good and some not so good times over the years. As older plant operators are retiring or otherwise leaving the company, newer and less experienced personnel are being put into positions that compromise the maintenance and operation of the Nuclear Operations. Local Union personnel are treated as simply contract personnel and not as valued employees. Managers are trying to do the right stuff but lack the experience and technical knowledge to make the right decisions."
good,"Good salary and benefits, but not good work/life balance. A lot of politics and red-tape in some departments."
good,Working for PPL was a great experience for me. The pay was exceptional in my opinion and the flexible schedule was even better. The best part about being a PPL employee was that i got to submit my owm tine sheets so i knew without a dou t that money was otw to me.
good,"I learned it was an okay job. I just took care of my grandfather. I did a lot of his running around to pay bills, cleaning, and cooking. I did the things he could not do as in lifting. I would get his oxygen tanks and return them as well as pick them up. I did all he needed and I did his grocery shopping and running in various stores."
good,"it was a good place to work "
good,"Typical large corporation.  Nothing spectacular about the organization, benefits, culture etc. Good compensation for the Lehigh Valley.  Very stiff culture, not one of those ""cool"" places like Google and such.  People who worked there or knew people who worked there years ago assume it's an amazing place to work but it's not particularly.  People like to start early but it's mostly empty by 5PM."
good,"overall it was a good place to work. I personally wanted to stay with ppl, however talen energy bought our plant from ppl. so in order to keep my job i had to go with talen."
good,"I did not feel satisfied with the level of responsibilities I was given for the title and position I held."
good,I have been at PPL Electric Utilities since 12/2012 to present and out of the blue they decided to end my and several others contracts. They new that this was coming and PPL Electric Utilities and Hansen Technologies could not come to agreement. These sort of decision need to be made with the people in mind. We are the ones that help the company keep going.
good,"I don’t think enough positions were even considered to be filled from within and I think that more could have been done to remove my job title from the union contract, because it doesn’t fit into any bucket within it."
good,"i would have to take my patient to the store,to docter appointment, cook,  clean for him.i went in at 7:00 in the moring and left at 3:30 we would talk ."
good,"PPL Utility was a good place to work at one time. When they split into to different segments, the culture changed. Managers who were in positions for decades were either forced out or saw their position posted and were not invited to apply for their own jobs."
good,"I enjoyed the work, but the hours were long during a planned outage."
good,"My day begins by greeting my co-workers, grabbing a cup of coffee and firing up the laptop. Upon catching up with email and voice messages, it is time to prioritize my work for the day. New jobs will be found in my inbox and previous work would still need to be completed."
good,"Working for a utility there is a sense of stability.  PPL also made it easy for employees to move around and experience different aspects of the business.   However, with stability and lack of a truly competitive industry, there is a sense of monotony."
good,"I liked working there, felt as if there were no advancements. The team operated as a family. If you needed assistance employees were willing to help. Good place to work if needing something to support."
good,I enjoy working for PPL as a Market Researcher. I get to interact with many different departments and be part of cross functional team where we share interactive ideas.
good,"The factories that they send you to say Temp-to-hire. But you have to know someone in the company to get in permently. They tell you 90 days Temp, but has known to go longer."
good,This is a great company to work for. The management and co-workers are nice.
good,"Great place to work if you want an extremely structured environment.  Things could get stressful because of how project due dates were driven by business and not by velocity.  Developers were forced to adjust and compensate for this, but the developers I worked with were great people and it was always a team effort."
good,Awesome manager/team. Difficult for individual contributors to move around company. Didn't gain a new role even after applying for demotion positions.
good,"Excellent manager, but very difficult to move between roles for an individual contributor. Could not get a new position even bidding for a demotion..."
good,Fun workplace with very supportive immediate management and peers. This created an environment in which each of us could grow and develop. The nature of the ever changing marketplace led to the encouragement of creating new and fresh ideas. Every day was rewarding and challenging.
good,"The place I worked for through PPl was a good place , people were nice and helpful. The managers were good.  I did not see me working here for a long time.  I found another job."
good,"I took care of a special needs child, I took her to all her doctor appoints, I feed her, gave her a bath, played with her changed her diapers, helped her with therapy."
good,over the years this company has changed to a great one to a mediocre one upper management do not understand the job you have nor care about its employees
good,Its okay but they need to improve.Pay more in have more hours.In more customer's.Have health benefits in vacation pay.They dont pay much.In need steady work schedule. In appreciate they employees.
good,"Good job if you are lucky to have the right manager or supervisor.  If you're unlucky to be in a department where management is in constant flux and expectations changes almost daily, it will be very difficult to know if anything you do will be judged favorably."
good,Great place to work.  Great for flexibility!  The people are great to work for and they monitor the clients and assess monthly for any care they need also.
good,PPL can be very complicated! They do NOT offer any kind of benefits at all! You can not work over 40 hours without getting the extra hours denied. The family I work for is VERY flexible
good,"I enjoyed the challenge of the positions I held within the organization"
good,"Too much upper management turnover gives feeling of not being sure where you fit in. Many new managers in a short time each with a different ""vision"" for the department leads to a lot of drastic change"
good,A typical day at work is working along side residents and management to make sure the building recreation centre is running smoothly and meeting the expectations of those who live here. Providing customer service and programming to all those who use the facilities is an everyday task.
good,I enjoyed looking at the utilities' return on equity and the need to submit a rate case to the state commission.  I learned a lot about the finances of the company.
good,I have worked at PPL for a long time. I am happy with most of my career here. I have taken classes at a local college which were paid for by PPL. They have also sent me to various conferences.The most enjoyable part of working at PPL is the coworkers. Lots of team players. The hardest part of working here has been turnover in management.
good,"Too many people involved in a decisions making implementation slow if not completely stalled.  Company is generous in salary, benefits, volunteerism, philanthropy and causes."
good,"Good place to work. The comradery between workers and their immediate supervisors was strong so long as there was respect between the two. The most difficult portion was outages. That was 14-15 hours/day, seven days per week for one to five months. Most people got along well. There were times when management made decisions that did not resonate with the plant, but they were still followed. I learned the processes for getting work done at a nuclear power plant and coal fired plants. I learned how to look up different prints for different systems in order to determine equipment location. This was utilized for tag placement in order to isolate equipment for repairs or maintenance. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how everything worked together. Having been trained on a PWR (pressurized water reactor) in the Navy, working on a BWR (boiling water reactor) was very different. It was also fun learning how to work on coal fired plants, especially the new scrubber systems and how they help make drywall."
good,"Great place to work, good people. Enjoy working there, just they do not grow your salary to the market. If you are looking for a place to sit down enjoy at a steady pace, then its for you. If you want to great your salary to meet your skill set, I don't think it will work as well for you."
good,"Deep heritage, solid reputation with public, Performance oriented, people, process and technology priorities to serve customers well with high level of operational efficiency"
good,Was a great place to work while I was there.  I heard they do not allow people to work from home as often as they used to. Some managers may be more flexible though.  Great benefits and a cafeteria in the downtown office.
good,I was owed a check for 7 weeks after working there almost a year and it was about 3 weeks before anyone started to call me back. It took an additional 4 weeks to receive my pay. They need a better pay roll worker.
good,"Overall great place to work.  Operationally, a bit behind the times and bureaucratic.  Slow to change.  Overly sensitive to stakeholder ""needs.""  Seems to be a place for Boomers & Millennials.  Gen-X seems to be caught in the gap.."
good,"PPL encouraged moving to different jobs, which allowed learning many aspects of the business."
good,"In all working was good at PPL, however as time went on the introduction of H&R changes led to decline in manager/supervisor/hourly employee relations.  Consequently the production and attention to detail were affected.  Employee dedication rapidly declined and so did production and customer service.  The corporation did keep up with new technology, and advancements in customer service that way, however the above mentioned changes off set much of those gains."
good,Cant  just say of a bad day just that maybe someone just having his or her bad day when they came to work an it rubb off on to the crew..I can say anything other then that..
good,Good solid company and career.  Held a variety of interesting positions in various locations.  Loved working with people inside and outside the company.  Voluntarily retired in good standing in May 2015.
good,"I spent the majority of my time creating and updating our 5 year budgets for the company's Gross Margin and O&M Expenses.  Then, throughout the year, I would compare the actuals to what was planned and explain the variances.  Most of the management was very easy to work with, as were the majority of the co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was sometimes having to fix other people's mistakes and the best part of the job was successfully meeting a deadline."
good,Learned about budgeting at a utility. Enjoyed management.
good,While working here I had the opportunity to learn about various topics related to the field. Everyone was open to questions and having meetings to discuss their role.
good,"The company is great - wonderful intelligent people working there, and lots of perks. What you should take into consideration is that PPL is also a very large company - as a consequence of that and management's decisions, they have lots of contractors, and people either don't push themselves for work, or are overworked and new projects always piling up."
good,Difficult to become full time employee because they only hire the best. This means you work with top tier talent.  Performing job duties can be difficult due to poor leadership and the most strict and prohibitive change management I've ever seen.  Company as a whole is great...unless you are in IT.
good,Overall my experience working for PPL was one of enjoyment and fulfilling work. Team work was the key to getting projects done on time and I found it easy to work with other teams across different areas due to the constructive culture we tried to love by.
good,"Transmission group embarking on an exciting plan of work."
good,"worked mainly on graphics and signage jobs but also participated on events across the country, mainly golf tournaments, helping to set them up, assist in the management of these events and then take it down. "
good,"i love helping and providing care to the people who need it. The work environment was good, flexible schedule, and good management. The work was a little difficult but rewarding"
good,I enjoyed the work as a supervisor and a software trainer. I liked the fast pace environment.
good,"Working 6am - 3pm (4pm)"
good,"Customer Service can be difficult no matter what the company, with a utility there is additional stress as you are providing a product that is essential to daily living. The management is supportive and there is very fast advancement if you are a motivated employee."
good,It would be nice to have higher pay and benefits . Besides that ppl is s very nice company to work for . Hours are good and everyone is so helpful and polite
good,"I worked with some great people. PPL gave me some great experience and knowledge. I appreciate all they did for me in 8 years and both positions I held. Unfortunately I was commuting over an hour each way, and after 5 years and personal home issues, I decided not to continue the commute and found a job closer to home but had to take a large pay cut."
good,"Maintain electrical distribution system.  Learn how the distribution system works.  Co-workers are great, but upper management needs work.  Best part of the work day is being outside.  Worst part is being inside."
good,"Working at PPL is great, it is not tiring at all and the people are great. The only problem is they are very strict and do not pay much which is why unfortunately I will need to look for something better."
good,PPL Electric Utilities offers a positive work environment and opportunity for both professional and personal growth.
good,"Call center - tethered to phone for 8 hrs/day"
good,"PPL is great if you can get in as a permanent employee.  I started out as a contractor and then was moved to what they call Specific Professional. This is basically a temporary worker working directly for PPL, not through an agency. There are upsides and downsides to this.  As a Spec Pro, you get partial benefits, the most important one being health care.  Their health care package is top notch.  The downside to being a Spec Pro is that if budget constraints become too tight, you are the first on the chopping block.  This happened to me twice there.  Benefits for permanent employees include paid vacation based on your age, and a company matched 401 K"
good,Good place to work. Compassionate for employees. Flexible with the schedule. Equal opportunity employer. Competitive wages. Convient locations. Helpful.
good,"I love working with people, and my patient and her family are wonderful people to be around. They're so welcoming and I'm really fortunate to be able to work with such nice and understanding people. My patients husband is technically my manager and hes really respectful and doesnt hover. I would have to say the hardest part of the job is getting attached to the patient and watching their health decrease."
good,"	Managed all correspondence between office staff, management, and clientele."
good,"Every employee was required to speak multiple languages, including Russian, Mandarin, Spanish, and others which I no longer recall.  It made the atmosphere very invigorating, as it afforded employees the opportunity to become very well acquainted with people from other backgrounds and cultures."
good,"Offers great benefits"
good,"Granted I'm an IT consultant that works for PPL, but I do find that it is a great company with a lot of great/knowledgeable people.  Everyone I have interacted with from Management to co-workers are always willing to help when needed."
good,"overall a nice place to work, lot of emphasis on respect and community involvement. Unfortunately it is becoming like most large corps- a slave to the share owners and analysts , and a board  and executive team that gets compensated WAY to much over what their employees make."
good,"Updated training annually. Good Pay.Depends on which department you worked in.I was in Field Services.Working offsite was enjoyable.As long as you showed the job was done efficiently and proper,they left you alone."
good,"PPL is an awesome place to work for. Management is great, very understanding, and really very flexible. I loved working there. Excellent experience overall."
good,"I loved working for the gas Company.  I spent over 50% of my time with law enforcement pursuing fraud and criminal charges.  I enjoyed working with the PUC in Harrisburg, PA."
good,"PPL was a great place to work and build a career. There was lots of opportunity for advancement and you could chart your own course within the company, but that was years ago."
good,"Maschinen einrichten , Material/Qualitätverantwortlich"
good,"I acted as a DATA MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST."
good,Good company with a great track record.  Fantastic pay and a good benefit system.  Only drawback is opportunity for individual growth.
good,The organization understands the need for a balance between work and life. Compensation and benefits meet or exceed similar industries. Hardest part of the job was so many outages that placed the organization in a constant reactive mode with no time for organizational improvements.
good,Great company to work for. Management and Co-Workers are very nice.
good,"Team work to assist getting work done.  Management has open door policy to get guidance and direction to better assist you in advancing."
good,Set your own schedule as long a s work is completed.
good,"Good company.make sure u turn in slips on time if u want paid! ..u can do a lot of ur hours and work related things thew the internet ,..............."
good,"A typical day involves answering phone calls and emailing customers about payment updates. I also work within the accounting team to assist with the delivery of programs and to ensure that all of our financials are recorded correctly and filed appropriately so that we have records of every transaction. The team at PPL is very  helpful and supportive, everyone works together to achieve common goals."
good,Great pay management is always farming jobs out. Creats a bad work atmosphere when they have a union in place to do the job. They just dont want to hire
good,"This company provided me with strong career development opportunities, in a variety of areas.  My ideas were valued, and I had the opportunity to work with senior executives across the organization.  I'd recommend this company to work for."
good,"Your work day can go from normal everyday to urgent work day due to weather or accident.  The great thing is your coworkers are there to help regardless of the situation.  There is little of the office politics found at other companies of this side.  Most employees are focused on getting or keeping the lights on."

Coworkers are friendly and often bring food for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. The constant nature of electrical distribution leads to a casual workplace which also helps reduce stress.
