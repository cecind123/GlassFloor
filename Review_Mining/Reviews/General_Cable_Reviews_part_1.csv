rating,review
bad,This job sucks for one you can't got paid. The people here are idiots. The union is a joke and the overall place is falling apart. And things are not going to get better
bad,I fell I was never treated fairly at this company and others I have spoken to fell the same way. Turned in my resignation and was put down in their system as terminated they are not a employee friendly company and I worked there 5 years
bad,The pay is a joke.. health insurance is crazy expensive.. upper management is payed way too much for what they are doing.. this place is broken from top to bottom.  Jobs are coming back.. do not waste your time with this company!!!!
bad,"expérience dans cette société très négative, sécurité zéro "
bad,"I enjoyed the different jobs that I had.  I always had many jobs to do every day that I was at work.  I got along with my coworkers.  We had fun while we worked.  My supervisor is a good friend of mine, so we worked well together.  A hard part of my day was when I would find errors and have to help a worker correct it."
bad,"I worked for them a short time with the new human resource manager. Very negative experience due to her and the working environment she created. I was given a table in a very dirty room with no AC and no phone line. Training and expectations were non existent as well. Very strange for such a large company. I was there only a short time and was in a position that should have had a desk and phone access for sure. The HR manager was supposed to be my boss but i only seen or interacted with her maybe less than one hour the whole time i was there, she was always leaving early or taking off even though she had been their less than a month herself."
bad,"bad management, horrible culture, employees truly feel like nothing. Large corporate greed organization and don't try to give anything to stateholders all shareholders"
bad,No sick days. Poor morale. Everyone was out for themselves.
bad,In packaging l had to lift a lot of heavy boxes and move big reels. And if your a woman you get treated differently. Non-stop overtime. They have no care for the employees.
bad,General Cable treats their employees awful. They continue to take from the employees and do not care about how their shifts affect people. I wouldn't apply at all.
bad,The company needs new management to improve the culture and production. front office does not follow policies and does not enforce them on those who have been there the longest. There is not a mix ethnic group in the front office.
bad,"The revolving door of executives has run off all the quality management and talent, leaving amateurs to ruin the lives of those dedicated to the company."
bad,"I have to say my experience was terrible. Actually needed this job to help pay for school. The had a job fair, turns out they hired way to many people, ran up all the production. we basically spent 2 weeks cleaning machines, and since I didn't meet the 90 probation period, I got laid off."
bad,"Not worth working for.  While you will enjoy your direct coworkers, there are a lot of things in the shop that diminish your experience with the company.  For example I was at one point met with unprofessional actions from one of the representatives of the company.  Other things are that you will most likely have to work third shift unless otherwise stated and will not get full pay till at least a year in."
bad,"That place was a scary place to work in. The union was very weak there, and caved into anything the company said was going to happen, and some many people got seriously got hurt there, they just focused on workers comp. cases instead of workplace safety."
bad,It is a poor place to work they treat there people like a number and not a person . It used to be a good place to work it is close to home but i am at the top of my game there no more calinges for me it might be right for some one eles
bad,"I was a good place to work, until the company lied and moved us to mexico. when they lied to us and said they were not shutting the plant down, even though are plant was better then the rest of the company on orders. they moved down to mexico because of the pay difference and they could save millions"
bad,General Cable paid a fair rate. I was there for 26 years and I learned a lot of things by moving through the factory at different jobs. The jobs taught me that I can work independently or with a group.
bad,I used to work on 3rd shift. A typical day is going in . Preparing for exercise that last 20 minutes. Then have a meeting. The go to our workstation.
bad,"•	Installed communication systems in the office and production area following specification, while implementing safety procedures and protocol.	"
bad,"Every night I'd go through our work, then order parts that we needed for the entire shift, get everything written up then start, Management was great willing to listen to our concerns and correct anything that wasn't right. I worked with an awesome crew who were there for the same thing I was to make as much money as we could and we worked hard. The hardest part of my job was making sure everything was correct, some nights it was what we'd call easy work and other nights there were a lot of changes we had to make so I had to be on top of everything."
bad,it sucked dont ever work for them. my co workers were fine but the pay was to small for the job and it was an unsafe job
bad,Average place to work. The best thing about the place is working the co-workers. The pay is pretty good the factory work.
bad,"Favouritism"
bad,"This place is a horrible place to work that does not care about family life or new employees.  Also, it was very difficult adjusting to the swing schedule."
bad,"Le processus de recrutement met à l'épreuve votre patience à rude épreuve, un vrai parcours qui vous forgera un peu plus dans votre recherche d'emploi."
bad,"If you are with the cliche, you get to stay for a few years... until the next cliche forms.  If you are good, you will be pushed up quickly and soon find yourself above your skill level."
bad,"This is just another place to work. I personally would not recommend a friend to work there unless you are already family or acquainted with some of the present work crew members. "
bad,"Management SUCKS!!! They have zero leadership, no forethought or planning,total chaos with everything a knee jerk reaction.This is the only place that I have ever worked where your pay is often times short and takes weeks to resolve.There is no continuous-improvement because management cannot follow through with absolutely anything."
bad,"Beginning the day with safety, then expectations of employees and production goals in mind. Detailed investigations of quality failures with reports given back to cross functional teams. I manage multiple people with products through 4 different processes. I coach and mentor employees for their personal success with leadership and drive ownership. Getting with the production control assocaites for schedule changes and managing daily flow. The hardest part of the job is keeping assocaites focused on what needs to be done versus what didnt get done from previous shifts. Staying positive with good attitude and keeping all reports up to date with information."
bad,This is not a stable work environment. They are too secretive about things going on within the company & leaves employees no time to plan for it. Pay sucks you have to learn several jobs to get decent pay. They give 80 hrs vacation that starts over in July &  they take 24 during July shutdown without your approval. During the winter months they always shut down weeks at a time but find ways where you cant get unemployment benefits not a
bad,The pay skill is horrible. Feels like a call center. For what you are expected to do you don't get paid near enough!
bad,"Lots of clicks even with CEO.  Only sales and IT are recognized and given accolades.  Although regardless of which department your are in, upper management will be the first to criticize and never give you the resources to be successful. Instead pile on more and more and you get no flexibility in the process. Very old school narrow minded employer philosophy that doesn't believe in any progressive policies or work/life balance.  Customers and shareholders are #1 priority,and employees are expendable. Pay increases are nonexistent, you may get a cost of living adjustment every 1 1/2 - 2 years and if you work really hard you may get a bonus here and there but there is no investment in long term development, such asTuition Reimbursement."
bad,"Good environment to work in "
bad,"Management is poor, not a good place to grow. Lack of reasoning behind things and procedures. No room for promotions or advancement. Only good side is they pay you based on what you know(skill wise.)"
bad,"Promised one thing while being recruited. Rotating 4 on / 3 off, 3 on / 4 off working 12 hour shifts. Actual 7 on no off for months at a time. "
bad,Management doesn't do anything. HR department is very unsupportive and unstable. The job is a good job for the location but definitely could use better upper management.
bad,I enjoy some things about working here but overall it's been a negative experience. I don't think they value their employees.
bad,It's an ok place to work. Somewhat stressful and sometimes lack teamwork. In the process of being sold so the future is uncertain as to what direction the company will go in.
bad,"U have to be in good with management to keep ajob...hard work doesn't matter if management don't like u. They have had supervisor and employees come and go in my 6 years there. Hard work is not appreciated,  only brown nosing"
bad,"General Cable seems to be obsessed with getting large numbers of employees qualified as Green Belts, Black Belts, etc.  Then for most folks, there is no time to exercise the skills.  It might be more practical and cost effective to train a few company wide Black Belts who work on projects full time."
bad,"Although I made friends here that I will have for life, I found that the manufacturing industry was not for me."
bad,"As a company, General cable isn't a horrible place to work. Simple work, though most of the parts picked are some what heavy...50 Lbs+ but it is easy work."
bad,Not bad at first but then went down hill after plant manager died.  It is closing within the year.  It was ok.  It is very depressing and people are leaving and more work is being sent out to other workers.
good,"I went in and picked orders and prepared order for shipping, load and unload trucks and supported the production floor with materials and removed finished goods to warehouse."
good,"A US corporation with their European base in Barcelona. Constant management changes every year led to changing strategies and priorities, which led to confusion and indecisive decision making."
good,"Trabajo muchas horas "
good,Ok to work for.   Lots of hours and no family life what so ever. If you are not married and no kids then it is a great place to work.  Pays well and they will give you all kinds of overtime if needed.
good,"Job was alright. It was a job. However, it didn't pay that well for the area in which I lived. The supervisors were not very supportive. After General Motors pulled their contract, the plant closed down."
good,"All about the metrics. Lean on salary, work life balance was average, expectation was all about meeting the metrics. "
good,"great atmosphere to work climate place lack of hours job instability bad management  good and bad, people laid back lack of training   management out of place"
good,"Didn't have a lot of work to do and was often bored. Nice HR department, really liked the operators on the plant floor. Not a lot to do in the town for a young person."
good,Sair por causa que venderam as as máquinas e eu era operador.
good,didn't really enjoy not having a supervisor around because people ted to take advantage of one another rather than equal out the work force
good,"Love the people"
good,this company needs better insurance very poor coverage.. pay is good for what you do.. this company works 12 hours day which can work for some people..
good,"Generally a good work environment. The benefits were very good. Management was ok, few exeptions. we had chiropractor service at the plant. Fitness center included. I had regular job promotions as well as raises"
good,"The days are long, first shift is hard to obtain.  The pay scale isn't bad.  Going from 15 to 21 dollars an hour in 3 years.  Maintenance pays between 22 and 26.  They won't promote from within so don't plan on trying to move up and theirs know mid level supervisors.  Their rules are kind of annoying to. You might have to sit there for 10 hours at a time watching something but its technically against the rules to read a book or magazine or look at your phone.  Even though you use your phone a lot either for a calculator or to contact the materials people."
good,"Responsibilities include manage of the corporate Learning Center and training compliance.  Management of the Learning Center includes review of audio / video equipment to ensure functionality when needed."
good,They have advanced manufacturing for medium/high voltage cable.  It was 17 years ago so I doubt that the company is the same today as I remembered it.
good,The job itself was great. It was a challenge to see how many spark plug wires each team could produce in day. The daily work was set up before you started your shift.The hot orders had to be done first because of customer demand.
good,"Started as a fun and enjoyable place to work. They started going through Management changes before and after the Stock Market crash. They started taking away benefits like tool allowances, paid lunch that was given to the Maintenance staff in stead of a raise one year, and the P for P ( Paid For Performance ) bonus that we were suppose do get for keeping scrap down and making Numbers. It was suppose to be a Corporation wide decision that was ( The Lie ) what was told to us but it wasn't it was just at our Facility. Now there is no enjoyment at work from all of the lies and other things that has gone on most of the people now are there now just for the paycheck. With the Company now being bought out there is a uncertain feeling going on about the future."
good,Its a job you would learn over night. On the job training occurred but needed more one on one time. Co-workers were great to work with. Management needed a little help with more time with the new employees. Benefits were okay. Plant shutdowns is the only time you could use vacation time until about your 8 year mark.
good,ok to work stressful but good leadership long days and mandatory overtime good to make money but not a good family work life balance overall ok place to work probably great if you are single
good,"No room for advancement, degree or not. Good place if you just want to work and go home. Slow pay raises, weakened union has pretty much given into corporate."
good,"It's great pay and there's always an opportunity to advance to a higher position. It sticks more with the ""clicks"" and buddy system which makes it uneasy to work with certain employees"
good,Troubleshooting the machines that makes cable. People that i work are great. Learned so much about electronic and electrical components.
good,It was a great organization but unable to manage the Indian operations hence had to close down and redundent all the employees due to poor management .
good,Need better communication when coming through the door about your position.I came from another job thinking one thing but was put in another.And I spoke up about it telling them I didn't feel comfortable or doing the position and was still put there.
good,It was a decent place to work they were fair and management was good.  Although they closed the doors and went to Mexico. They had good pay and an ok health plan.
good,"Factory work and piece work is very hard, I worked 2nd shirt and that was hard on my family life. My American job went to Mexico, how happy would you be in this situation."
good,"work schedule varied. not staffed accordingly. fast paced. had to scan tags bring up view specs. wrap ,flip, stack and stage in appropriate area.  Ran fork trucks to move materials. also was responsible for doing steel reels on dock floor coming from production floor."
good,briefing of their shift. A reminder of safety first. making sure each shift produce a million and a half feet per shift. i enjoyed my job! the hardest part is making sure the product is correct.the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting production dead line. working as a team in each department
good,nothing to state.  Plant shut down and hundreds of people lost their jobs. Good job while it lasted.  Terrible management on qa/qc and time management.
good,Pues me gusto la presión y el orden con el que se trabaja
good,"In the 80's and early 90's it was man's factory. Harassment of all kinds toward the female workers on the floor was normal. As more woman were hired and older management changed this problem corrected itself."
good,"I go to my line receive information about the product, how the previous shift went, and if any maintenance was used."
good,I liked my job. general cable was a good company to work for. most of management were very helpful. my co-workers were very helpful also. the most enjoyable part of my job was it was all 1st. shift.
good,"The Marketing group operates in a dynamic environment where new ideas, concepts and projects are launching all the time. To excel in this environment, the team must exhibit a ""roll up your sleeves"" mentality to follow through on the execution."
good,I'm very hands on and like to get my hands dirty. I worked exclusively in the office environment and it wasn't for me.
good,Empresa em processo de mudança de Gestão com grande participação no mercado de produção de cabos elétricos em alumínio. Está passando por processo de implantação do sistema Lean e capacitação de suas lideranças.
good,"There was nothing typical about my day. Everything depended on what transpired on the production line at any given time. There may have been a grievance filed or someone might have been put on probation and I would need to report and investigate, or an employee may have been hurt running one of the machines and I would need to contact family or even take them to the doctor. My office responsibilities included processing all new hire/termination paperwork; posting open positions, maintaining employee files and training documentation. Union procedures were new to me and I definitely learned about their rules, regulations and procedues. I had an awesome connection with the Union Reps and this made my job much more satisfying. The hardest situation I faced was when the Union went on strike and management crossed the picket line but at the same time it showed the relationship I had with Union employees because they never made me wait to cross the line which made me feel very proud,"
good,•Conducted electrical testing on power lines
good,"Good, but outdated computer platforms, unreal hours for hourly associates, 12 hour shifts, short notice OT, makes it difficult to find and retain good associates"
good,"Boa integração, boa equipa, processo muito interessante de fabrico."
good,"General Cable was acquire last year by an European company, so right now it is in transition/integration mode; a lot changes in all areas. It is a big company."
good,General Cable was recently sold to a competitor.  It's unclear as to what their future will bring.  HR staff is great.  Great focus on safety. Unionized workforce.
good,It was laid back but the supervisor i had failed to communicate with me in a good manner...  I was terminated due to another employee lying to save himself from a write up or punishment...
good,"trabajo muy pesado pero personal ""respetuoso"" como en todos lados favoritismo pero en q fabrica no es asi?? xD"
good,"Pay was good for my area.  Management were pretty decent.  If you did your job and were self sufficient you rarely had pressure from or issues with supervisors (that was my experience).  Physical exertion was what I expected it to be, moderate leaning towards heavy some days.  Scheduling leaved a lot to be desired.  The sequence of orders was not conducive to minimize change overs on machine, which subsequently caused excess downtine (machine not physically running).  The only saving grace there was that unless an order was a ""rush"" order you could take your liberties and work on jobs in a sequence which made your life easier and saved the company money in the big picture.  Again, not a production personnel responsibility, scheduling/management/supervisors should have had a better grip on this.  Breaks were standard, time off was normal.  Benefits were good.  Safety was practiced above all else.  Much time spent in safety training.  Maybe a little boring at times, but kudos for GC for making safety a priority, they get a 5 for that.  I really enjoyed the work environment other than it was extremely, extremely dirty.  Metal and grease head to toe almost every day.  Had to use seat covers in vehicle to prevent destroying my interior. Come home and shower after a shift a MUST.  Co-workers were outstanding.  I've been in manufacturing for 30+ years and the shop floor employees and management made it feel like you were family.  For a big corporate company, that says a lot.  Best place I've worked concerning that topic.  Ultimately I left because as the new person with no vacation"
good,"The company has been in ""transition"" for years. It makes it difficult to feel settled and take time to appreciate what has been accomplished due to the rapid pace at which everyone is expected to implement and adapt to change."
good,"Empresa boa, porém um pouco desorganizada na parte da gestão."
good,"General Cable was a very cutthroat place to work. Employees would sell out another employee to make that extra dollar for the day and management was no better. They liked to spend company money on daily lunches for their selves, but this place is no closed permanently."
good,"Making Electrical cable. plant is now closed, have to move to east texas to work for this type of plant that was once here in malvern. Coworkers were great to work with."
good,"Over 15 years ago I worked there.  Management has changed since I left, therefore,  anything I have to say would be based on old information and personned."
good,It has been a long time since I worked here.  It is a company worth considering.  The headquarters is in a nice area and there are a lot of good operations.
good,Acceptionnal  company.  Proactive and personable.  Always speaking the best jobs for your skill set.  Pay great. Training second to none.  Work environment safe and ver clean.
good,"Cada día en el trabajo aprendí cosas diferentes desde creación de etiquetas hasta la programación y rearme de una computadora. Mis jefes, gerentes, compañeros siempre me brindaron su apoyo para comprender la realización de proyectos."
good,Productive and fun place with good attitudes. During the summer its hot and challenging. my co-workers are some of the hardest working group of people I've worked with.
good,"The Commodities industry is a hard place to make money since it has so many variables that generally do not depend on management’s ability to create markets for its products. Some of the most recognized headwinds are:"
good,For the last several years I have managed the supply of wire and cable and wire and cable related products for several industry leading OEM customers.  I am responsible for supporting profitable sales growth and targeting opportunities among new and existing customers.  The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the hard work payoff when a satisfied customer reorders or increases their spend on General Cable products.
good,Fast paced work environment with a lot of opportunities. Company has faced many challenges over the last several years with acquisitions.
good,It was overall a nice job. I got 8 hour shifts 5-6 days a week. It was an easy job but repetitive.
good,I don't have anything to say bad. I only wish there were room to grow within this company. I appreciated the opportunity.
good,Already reviewed in a previous review. I began at this company in 2011 and am currently still employed here.
good,It's a typical warehouse. You learn typical warehouse management. My coworkers are typical warehouse coworkers. The hardest part of my job is typical warehouse work. The most enjoyable part of my day  is that its a typical warehouse.
good,Was a fun place to work. Was hot but fun 12 hours. management changed monthly and seemed as if no one had an idea what was going on.
good,"Operator of machinery. Co-workers old and crabby, worst part of the job is the extreme heat during the summer. I enjoyed the postion because it allowed for  days off during the week and paid well."
good,"Company is decent.. Work decent hours with decent pay. Pay could be better "
good,"unskilled management, they don't abide by the hippa laws. They only care about there buddies. there Open door policy is a lie and they promote harrassment."
good,I enjoy the people I work with at this company as most are tenured employees who have had a steady career at General Cable.
good,"Multinacional Americana, evalúa su personal por competencias y objetivos, es una empresa orientada a resultados. Premia el cumplimiento de los objetivos"
good,"I had a good experience while I worked there because I had a great team, however overall the company needed a change in management and culture.  The systems were somewhat outdated and some managers had a micromanagement tendency."
good,"Loved working at general cable but they wasn’t paying me enough for the amount of work I was doing, the hrs they keep you in there. Jus really ain’t work it."
good,I worked there for seven years and was fired for take time off from a girlfriend of 9 years past away and because we weren't married wouldn't time off
good,It's an ok place to work plenty advancement large place to work good culture the pay is ok typical job................................................
good,"Had fun working for General Cable for 10 years."
good,A typical day was spent shadowing engineers and line supervisors. I learns many solutions and techniques for line system maintaince. The most enjoyable part of the job was experienceing each part of the factory and learning how the industial line operates.
good,"I do not work in the corporate office but in my particular office, it is laid back but professional. I very much enjoy my colleagues."
good,"Empresa boa mas pode melhorar,ter mais dialogo assim sera mais fácil para trabalhar."
good,"Shut plant down an relocated it to another facility, that is not nearly is efficient an productive as this plant was, there were a lot of great people at his plant."
good,"I learned a lot here, and the electronics team was a knowledgeable and understanding team to work with. Always willing to let me take on new tasks and further my skills. But unfortunately stockholders of the company control a lot of the day to day activity. They refuse to organize their current assets and as a large corporation lose millions in damaged product, poor cataloging, and defunct product lines taking up massive amounts of space in their warehouses everywhere across USA. These losses result in constant corporate back cuts which affects the employees."
good,loved the people.they were all nice and everyone worked as a team to go the job done. came in with the same mind sit eveyday that's why it was a wonderful place
good,"A empresa não tem serviços complicados de se trabalhar, visto que monta-se cabos de ignição de carro, e não é tão complicado. Mas por se tratar de marcar importantes atenção e profissionalismo são essenciais para um trabalho produtivo."
good,I really can't talk about my experiences because it would give away who I am. The previous company management was incompetent and the leadership in my department was also incompetent. Many of us are now unemployed as the new leadership under Prysmian Group decided to layoff lots of people.
good,"Management on the ropes. Stay away. If you have the talent LQQK elsewhere unless you want to be on the Titanic."
good,Enjoyed my co-workers at this company. Only down fall to this job was my direct supervisor didn't know how to properly do his job and looked to me to do work for him.
good,Was a friendly environment until it was bought out.  the new company is very cheap and overworks its employees.  the location is nice.  they have a cafeteria onsite
good,"A typical day was like a war zone. Apparently I was also the complaint department.  The employees were doing piece work which created much competition on the floors. I had to compute all the payrolls to reflect work done. There was a very strong union there, which I was not a member of. if I made a payroll mistake the person did not come to see me they went to the union and the union rep would come to my office and berate me."
good,General Cable was a wonderful place to work but the decision was made to move the process to Mexico. I spent 23 years there and we always had great teams and always focused on process and team improvements.
good,"It was a good job overall , pretty good pay, benefits, I needed better hours. I preferred day shift to be with family,  I needed better benefits, due to my family!"
good,"6 days a week 10 hours a day little time for much of a life after that, good pay ,paid breaks management is not very hands on and out of touch with production"
good,They have a great Lean development program for their employees and spend a great deal of time communicating.  They have moved the facility I worked at to Mexico.
good,Senior management does not know the difference between  investment and expenses. Employees fall under expense not investment.
good,"Very fast paced , safety culture oriented facility. I learned numerous management skills to benefit my future. I enjoyed working with customers on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is the demanding hours some work days consist of 12hour days. The most enjoyable part of the job was working in a facility that put safety first and foremost."
good,My job was fun and exciting . Lots of promotions and opportunities to advance. Company was sold and then downsized.
good,Ambiente agradável com colaboradores bons para se trabalhar.
good,I liked working there. I was transitioning from working overnights to working early mornings. It was hard and there I couldn't do it. I wish I could still work there.
good,General Cable is a good place to work. The company considers there employs safety top priority. The Paragould facility is a very clean and safe enviorment.
good,was a good job untill they movied to mexico thanks for telling allb of us not to worry and than in a year movied production there and then told us in warehouse we are safe then in a other year move warehouse to mexico so thanks general cable after 19 years
good,ambiente agradável de trabalhar pessoas com muitos conhecimentos e experiencia
good,Overall not a bad place to work.  The people there were great to work with but sometimes expectations from higher up were not conveyed in a timely manner.
good,I learned how to operate an extruder. Typical day was spent running an extruder. making sure compound did not run out and changing reels on takeups and payoffs
good,GCC had outstanding training programs.  Very solid company which cares about there employees.  Great people working there.  Solid HR department.  The pay was pretty good.
good,With recently being acquired by Prysmian Group this is shifting change in management styles and culture within the organization. Overall nice place to wirk
good,"Decline comment per separation agreement with company. I did like the job but was always in conflict with Plant Manager, he was somewhat course with his staff, especially accounting"
good,"Very unstable company, constant re-orgs. Work life balance is good, and while on the job the learning experience is also good. The people and the environment are the best thing of working for this company"
good,"An excellent place to work to get into the Canadian Electrical Industry, and learn industry processes, and players.  There is little turn-over, but unfortunately little room for growth.  The associates at General Cable are knowledgeable and eager to help each other."
good,"We had cook out on saftey or on good production days the pepole were inviting and frendly we work togather to savle problems."
good,"Due to the sale and acquisition that has been going on for the last year, the work environment has been very stressful.  Employees have been told that there is going to be signification layoffs since the acquisition and there has been no communications."
good,"Good company but stuck between old ways and moving forward.  Great senior leadership, okay middle management, a lot of frustrated lower level personnel."
good,"Typical work day is 12 hours, depending on the job once you get the machines up and running, it was pretty laid back for a few hours until you had to reload material or fix breakouts. you work a rotating schedule and 12 hours can be a long day and have to work ever other weekend no matter what. Hardest part of the job was the co workers. There was always some drama going on."
good,"Sorry but its a different company now. I will say that when it use to be TLC Logistics it was great. Fast paced environment, always kept me challenging myself to be faster while keeping accuracy. I was able to move up even though it was a dead end, it was good while it lasted. Management was horrible do to supervisors always playing around with other employees which resulted in employees getting fired for ""going to far"" but overall great benefits awesome pay."
good,"Receive inbound trucks, deliver materials to floor, put materials away from staging area. Co workers are great, facility management was great also. Upper management (not in house) needs to be revised, no business clue - No idea how to drive new business. Good customers of this company did not go out of business - they just took their business elsewhere."
good,"Es una empres lider a nivel mundial en la fabricación de conductores,  en México se empezó el proyecto en el 2008, creo que no ha podido despegar como se be debido a la alta rotación de personal que han tenido en el poco tiempo que tienen en México, lo mas difícil fue trabajar con pocas herramientas de trabajo y sin estrategias comerciales de parte e la Dirección, los compañeros a mi nivel y jefes inmediatos nos integramos y desarrollamos clientes de la competencia para hacerlos distribuidores nuestros."
good,Magnificent Sales Training Program. Nice salary. Competitive benefits package. Great culture.
good,"- Steady work pace"
good,The job had it's difficulties as no job is perfect.  They took good care of their people.  The health care was the worst I ever had.  Lots of great people to work under.  It had it's moments of fast paced pressure.  Good place to work.
good,Empresa basada en valores y respeto por el capital humano.
good,"Gran aprendizaje y retos para el área."
good,"Most days consisted of daily database and quotation checks, meetings to update on new quotations and update department on projects.  Assisting plant workers and department with database changes to accelerate overall workpace.  Cost savings efforts and time saving efforts are big."
good,"This place really does take care of its employees. They pay competitively, all your benefits offered, paid holidays off, vacation time at a year, shift swap opportunities, and tons of family functions free of charge. The PVS department manager is really bias and the night shift PVS supervisors are a joke.

good,"I absolutely love this job but it is NOT for everyone. No central air or heat. Physically demanding, certain managers do pressure you but I look at it as just doing their jobs. You automatically begin on graveyard( after training for a month or so on days). 12 hour shifts, mandatory overtime ( not every week)  management seems to be just like any other company.. some supervisors can relate to you and go above and beyond to work as a team while others are constantly complaining and pointing fingers.  Coworkers are nice, you end up spending ALOT of time with them. I would NOT recommend this job to a single parent that doesn’t have any help. I am recently divorced with no kids.. i have the time and the means to work 13 nights straight with one night off"

good,Applicants receive inadequate training in too short a period of time.  Learned to twin wire and other jobs as required.  General cable expects new hires to learn jobs too quickly in a very small amount of time.
good,"Se trabaja sin presión siempre que se cumpla con las tareas asignadas,o la producción del puesto determinado,buena empresa y se trabaja agusto"
good,"At the start of the shift you are given a stack of orders that needed to be assembled and produced. You need to read the orders and sit up the machine to run the wire as according to the spec. sheets. Then the orders are sent to Quality. Then to packing, on to the warehouse. The other employees was helpful and friendly. At the end of the shift we would all jump in to help what ever cell member needed help to finish the job so that the next shift will have a fresh start on the orders they will do. The hardest part of the job was learning it. There was many different components and wire. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the safety committee. It is always enjoyable to have a clean safety record. The company received the safety award eight years in a row while I was working there."

good,Always love a challenge. Love troubleshooting and solving mechanical and electrical problems for coworkers so that they can safely and efficiently.
good,"The usual work week was 6 days a week, 10-12 hours each day. Our team would work until all orders were filled. The morale was great and our team became comparable to a family. I learned to drive a forklift, cherry picker, and stand up lift, and powerful leadership skills from management. Management identified my abilities to lead and mentored me in key areas for success. During management's lunch and meetings, I would lead co-workers and help them with RF scanner issues, product discrepancies, and handle any other problems that would arise in that time frame while performing my own duties. The hardest part of the job was when my team learned that General Cable was closing their doors. This was a wonderful job. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers and the sense of completion when the orders were all filled at the end of the night."

good,"I would check my fork lift and make sure it was operational, login to my RF scanner, pick orders all day long. I moved close to 10,000 pounds a day. My co-workers would sit on there cell phones instead of working, but when it was cram time, it seemed like we did exceptionally well.
