rating,review
bad,The owner is an amazing guy but the shop manager is verbally abusive terrible person to be around has mood swings evryday and takes them out on his employees
bad,By far the worst place of employment I have ever had constantly cursed at by management the shop employee's are referred to as a  bunch or r words and morons daily  shop manager is racist and ignorant
bad,the management all cares about it money don't matter if customer don't need it or if it will strain and stress the worker .place is falling apart broken doors broken lifts machines constantly needs repair. don't waste your time find something else
bad,"There was no team work . Every body was lazy . The management at that time had favorite people , some he liked , some he did not like . Some he treated better than others . That is one reason I left , among alot of other reasons ."
bad,"Everybody are back stabbers, they don't have your best interest."
bad,I worked for Goodyear commercial tire. I do not work their anymore. Before i started i had a job title to do everything. But once they found that out they dropped my title so they would not have to pay me more. They told me we cant afford that. So they made my title as a route driver. But yet i had to do everything with no pay raise. Was told i had to deal with it. Goodyear was the worse company i ever worked for... i do not recommend working their. Unless your union or factory
bad,Goodyear does not value experience over education even though they say they do now. Many policies change to what is best for management at the time and not employees.
bad,"Mgt. plays favorites with employees.  Employees gets to a commitment letter, at this point they ( employee )  can’t do anything or they will be terminated.   Employee comes in late four days out of five and NOTHING happens to employee . Mgt. Is a JOKE !! Absolute WORST place I have EVER worked at !"
bad,"Terrible training, terrible, management, bad pay trust me you do not want to work for this company. I was warned by a friend and former employee for the company and didn't listen. take my advice say no to this company. Believe me you will regret it. Goodyear is a total joke and so are there tires by the way."
bad,Manager was very bad he did not pay you what should have been a good wage and he also had you loads you truck over the limit the truck was always past weight limit. All werehouse were sold in the Midwest.
bad,Not good environmental work they don’t pay fair They supposed to be paying 5% all the junk we done then I’m paying fair actually I think they stole money from me
bad,"Incompetent is being nice. No targets, no goals & no advancement. Ask for a Saturday off & you end up with an extra unpaid day off."
bad,Don't have a job.do t even think about working at Goodyear. They treat you like pond scum and try to make sure you are miserable on the daily.if there is no other option but to work there be unemployed
bad,"Not a good company to work for IT because IT and PMO have serious leadership crisis and some are stupid they doesn't how technology, people and process works."
bad,"Former service manager. No life allowed outside of Goodyear! 48-60hrs a week, little pay, GY offers commissions if unrealistic goals are met, fyi never made an extra dime, and I have always been a top performer. Dirty, loud annoying environment, constant power struggle w store manager who belittles entire staff. As store manager had my tech conduct second interviews and allowed tech to run dictate shop, which would was my job, I was cut out of the loop, not allowed to do my job. Constant Petty power struggle, I grew tired of having sales stolen by our own leader, what a joke, no control, no money, a absurd amount of micromanagement, including second guessing of sales recommendations in front of customers, pathetic! This store could not keep employees, constant turn over, don’t bother, you’re definitely better delivering pizza. I experienced reverse racism and sexism from a LBGT angry minority female. Favoritism, store manager hired GS at different pay level, creating resentment within staff, just one dollar difference causes anger, resentment and constant struggle within staff. RUN from this mismanaged Nightmare ."
bad,No work life balance and pay is way below market average. Managers required to work 6 days a week. Pay raises are a minimum and an insult. They give everything away for free to customers but charge employees way too much
bad,"It's not a good place to be, you are a contractor in a union plant, most of the union employees are okay with contracts, but there's those that believe the job you are doing should be a union job. Innosource is a staffing agent, little too no contact with its employees. Goodyear doesn't care about its employees, the union helps bad employees keep their jobs, employees care very little about building a quality product.  Overall it's a bad place to work."
bad,"All down hill with management .Meetings that dont help in anyway ,more like put you down day. "
bad,"bad store to work at they had a great team and it all went the drain"
bad,Goodyear cares nothing for the people that work for them. You are expected to work 8+ hours a day and run road service calls at night. You work the shop 5-6 days a week and run night service seven days a week and then they won’t to punish you when you get overtime. Overall terrible company to work for. Pay is the only decent thing about them.
bad,This place is so miserably mismanaged that its almost comical. At times they never even tried to hide their racism toward Caucasians. Mandatory overtime. Censure and punishment if you do not show for mandatory OT. The atypical 10 hour day includes one 10 min. Break followed by a 30 min. break followed by a 10 min. break. Extremely unsafe environment.. Many injuries for which you will not be compensated their lawyers are better than yours are
bad,I liked working there but I just don't like the way they just said there wasn't enough to do and the boss just said he wanted me to find something that's goin to pay more
bad,"Goodyear is good place to work if you are not salary. But if you an Engineer its a horrible place to work. Management will overuse you. You will always on call, they will contact u throughout the night and Day. They will make you work weekends and Night and Day shifts. They will make fun of you behind your back. They will disrespect your character and would be secretly derogatory towards you. Overall if you an Engineer I don't recommend you work here."
bad,"I promise that you will be bullied by management, that should be enough said, call HQ all you want, it get lost in transit, no body know anything. Promised made just to get you in the door like customers, same procedures is practice on a daily bases"
bad,ive worked at acorn tire/goodyear for 11 months now and it was a good thing at first. but then it went down hill really fast. my manager was extremely rude and disrespectful. my manager would yell and berate us around in the shop infornt of other employees and was just extreamly rude.a
bad,"Lowest paying ""service advisor"" job you can find you're thought of more of a maid then a writer they'll force ypu to do jobs that aren't in your title and offer no compensation or even a thanks it was a waste of time."
bad,"They do not care about there employees it’s all about there company and you don’t matter you are just a number to them stay away, broken equipment unsafe environment"
bad,"Goodyear promotes a culture of dishonesty.  Money is more important than human beings.  Goodyear pursues profit with the ferocity of that of a hungry lion.  The pursuit of profit supersedes reason, overrides integrity and overshadows all notion of honor.  All store managers are under immense pressure to meet store profit goals.  In order to meet those goals, the managers and service advisors are forced to sell unnecessary products and services to all customers regardless of the current condition of the individual customer's vehicle.  The pursuit of profit starts with the technician.  He is pressured to find anything and everything wrong with the vehicle he is working on and make recommendations for further service.  An honest technician will know when something is in need of service and when something is not in need of service--the trick is knowing the difference.  But Goodyear technicians and managers will stretch the truth to convince someone to waste money on unneeded repairs and services."
bad,"Not the type of place you think it is Very stressful I would not recommend working there Depending on what part of the plant you're working in Could have some effect on your health. I got sick in the banbury so I transferred jobs, you can only disqualify once not twice, so they  Terminated me for that. I only missed two days of work. Out of five years to me that's pretty good. Six people in the review board it seems like they are more focused on trying to fire you then to keep you more focused on the negative not the positives."
bad,"Don't waste your time working for Goodyear. Pay is mediocre at best and not worth the aggrivation. Most management is completely inept and terrible to work for. Sales staff are probably the worst I've ever seen in a retail environment. Training is non existant and consists of Advance Auto provided training in the back room of a parts store. Work for a real shop elsewhere, this place is a joke. If I didn't need the health insurance and vacation I've earned I'd be long gone. It sucks to realize after 15 years that I've wasted my life at a dead end job and there's not much I can do about it at this point. Advancement is pointless since service writers and management make garbage money and deal with loads of bull. Save yourself the trouble and work at McDonalds, you'll make more money for your effort."
bad,"Poor,disingenuous Management.The Manager will have you search for work for a certain Employee.As an Undisclosed warning steer very clear from this place"
bad,Aweful experience. No consistency no job security low pay. Poor upper management poor equipment. Unsafe working environment. Hostile employees. Very very bad
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work there. Managers don't care about the product or people. Rules are followed by some and ar not said directly when you start.
bad,"Not a lot of good to say about working here. The regional manager is a rather shady sort of guy and that really reflects when you talk with other managers in the region. A lot of the moves he made really didnt make sense. One good thing I can say is, I met a lot of really good employees working here. The customers I was able to take care of really became friends almost. That part of working here I did enjoy."
bad,"They told me in my interview I would have weekends off yet the day I started, they made Saturdays mandatory.  Then they made our pay based on sales but the manager kept discounting everything sooo much that we actually didn't get what we were supposed to."
bad,"i drove forklift fast and like a maniac in that place. didnt do much,messed a lot of things up. boss didnt realy like me. i ate a ham roll with turkey"
bad,It’s no place for a woman who is serious about her job and money! It’s only room for ppl who want to get paid to lie to each other and customers OH! And make no money..
bad,"not a good place to work not willing to work with emploees,only 3 sick days and it takes 1 year to get medcial coverage.cut throt place to work I woud not recomend"
bad,"Heat exhaustion, underpaid, overworked, poor management, do not pay as told when hired. Safety standards are a concern. Heat exhaustion, workers choosing what part they want to load. Picking days and hours they would like to work."
bad,Promises that was made to get me there was not delivered. Had me doing unethical work against my morals which is why I quit. I would never work for or have my vehicle serviced there. The management was not experienced in running a shop and was only focused on making money and not servicing the customer.
bad,No compassion for employees with emergency. Not to accommodating for the poor direction. Management plays favorites and it is more of a middle school gossip station. The district manager is only worried about paint in the shop (not a thing to do with daily goals or duties). Not a promising company to work for.
bad,"Management was abysmal, inept, poorly trained, unresponsive, with no idea of how to improve. It was a lot like a knife fight. At this plant, the key to success was to throw as many people as possible under the bus, not making waves, and spending zero dollars on improvement."
bad,"Goodyear has a  great  reputation in making a Good product, but an employee that works for this company earns every cent. "
bad,"Cant make ends meet here, go any where else, worst place to work , never again "
bad,I worked here. They tried to get me to send a car out the door that was not safe. I packed my tools and left. I called corporate and they wanted didn't want to hear it.
bad,I started my automotive career with Goodyear straight out of school. When I started they had 10 mechanics and 4 sales associates. Before I left they lost all 4 sales associates and 8 mechanics.
bad,"Lack of training, low pay, & an office based on bullying. It is a horrible & unprofessional environment. I would strongly suggest taking a moment to google this company & the owner. It is not worth the grief, there is no pay or benefit worth this environment. No advancement, no pay raises & you will be overwhelmed with work."
bad,"Working for this company, I watched half the staff lose their jobs 2 days before Christmas day! The environment is not too stressful, but it has had it's turnover and you could find yourself in a different department next week. There is 0 stability in working here, even the people who made the company thrive, dirty tricks were played on them as well."
bad,"They expect employees to put company above everything else. If you have a family I would not recamed working here long term.They expect you to stop and answer phone or e-mail 24 hours a day. Hourly employees get taken care of nicely, if you are a salary employee, be ready to be abused."
bad,Don't care about employee.  Very stressful company to work for.  Only care about the dollar.  Very bad turnaround rate.  Management makes environment very stressful and terrible company to work for.
bad,Here at this place you dont have a life. All you do is work with really no time off. Your always on call and when your not you are a back up so you still can't go anywhere.
bad,"Aun no tengo resultados para calificar esta empresa, me reservo a tener respuesta"
bad,Kept sending me home when we were slow and then turned around and fired me for not being available when he'd send me home. The manager needs to be replaced ASAP
bad,Company does not care about its employees.  They have downsized so much and the culture of always cutting jobs is a constant culture.  Advancement opportunities were slim to none.
bad,"Although we had an hour for lunch I wouldn't recomend working here if you need them to work with your school schedule or if you have a family. Slow paced, not enough hours, management was rude to customers and just over all a very unprofessional work place they haze you for being new and that makes the workplace an uncomfortable place to do business"
bad,"never worked for Goodyear!!!only managed VBS technicians that worked for at the Goodyear factory in Danville, Va. 24/7 Operations. "
bad,"Worst job of my entire life. Absolutely ZERO help and support from company. Everyday I went to work i laughed talk about a company needing HELP!!! it was amazing to me they needed help in every single area of the business. This company DESPERATELY needs a best practices program, the people running the company are so STUPID they do not even know what a best practices program is. another thing missing was a leadership development program for managers."
bad,This company doesn't care about its workers and they could care less about the nature of the job or your safety unless they know we're being watched by someone. They do nothing to be sure the job is safe or how much strain is put on your body when there are machines to help you.
bad,"I work at goodyear for a couple of months and the manager I had complain about the same time over an over, when they have stuff that didn't go and the work sheets they will expect employee to write them down, even if you write it down they said there's no need for it, so wich one its going to be, then if u said that something break is ither the employee foult , so the owner is going to agree with the manager , but if u said that the parts needs changing cuz it can be time, well no he will make it the employee foult , so when u have a manager that sucks it will never change? It goes down hill from there on? To said more this is the (Hartford. Ct) if u here and come here take ur car there anything u can said they broke they will fix . Cuz is the manager employee problem , not the manegment.or the chain."
bad,All I have to say store 110 Miami location they are all liars if you follow policy do no work for them you would get fired they do not care about safety for the co-workers even customer as long as they make their money you can die for all they care and if you don't believe me just give it a try when hired they would put you to work like a dog and if you call main office to talk about the company your just calling to get yourself fired so don't even try  so wish you all the best of luck and work for Goodyear store 110 at your own risk
bad,"Not the best place to work at but if you can live on minimum wage then this is the place for you.  If the store is not doing good, everyone gets blamed for it and no one gets raises.  Asking for weekends off is like pulling teeth.  Only district managers and managers get taken cared of, and the little people get no recognition, no raises, but they do get to do all the hard work."
bad,You put in long hours for low pay and little to no chance to move up the ladder.  You have to deal with unreal expectations on the numbers you should put up for the company.
bad,just all around terrible place to work they did work illegally they worked while under the influence of alcohol
bad,"Everyone who works here is miserable. Everyone in the shop is trying to get out. Management is horrible!!! Pay is horrible. Ive worked here for 1 1/2 yrs and have nothing to show for it. No benefits, no advancement, nothing. All they do is see how far they can push you. They always want more more more but never talk about paying more. I cant believe ive wasted so much time at such a horrible place. Ive seen so many people quit by just walking off the job. No one cares to put in a two week notice because of how horrible it is!!! Too much stress not enough money!!! Expect you to live off $300/ week!!! Yeah right!!! GET IT TOGETHER!!!!!"
bad,position was stressful due to management. Poor lack of communication
bad,Was not a great place to work because of management and lack of ownership for the business
bad,"Good place to work, Good benefits, Good people to work for. This was one of the best jobs I have worked in this area, sad that the plant closed."
bad,Everyone stayed to themselves. No communication. Only thing I enjoyed was the bathroom
bad,"In my shop I work for a selfish, inconsiderate store manager who treats his employees like garbage.  During my time spent here I've seen two men quit and heard numerous stories of other before me quitting.  The store is in awful shape absolutely no upkeep made to equipment and shop appearance which affects our productivity.  And the staff is awful and unprofessional except for exception of a few.  We're currently short of staff and I've been overworked during my regular shift and when I do request overtime, even when it's needed I am not given it.  It's become unbarring and I want out."
bad,Bad place to work if you are Black or a woman will go the extra mile to get u gone but when it comes to work its not there no energy at all .
bad,Management is sorry as hell! Training is very poor! Its good for the weekly pay but this job isn't worth it.
bad,"The management treated its workers like you where a slave . didn't get brakes . The first aid kit was a very small out dated kit with only tape . customers where the only thing that made me stay as long as I did .. "
bad,Moved around a lot and changed job titles...Store closed...Wasnt offered another position at another location
bad,Dirty hot work terrible pay bad management got laid off with no warning cant think of one good thing to say about WINGFOOT
bad,"Back breaking job.The pay is terrible, consist of stacking truck tires by hand,mounting/dismounting"
bad,To many unknowledgable people in upper management.
bad,"Look over your shoulder , your days are numbered. Will let you go to keep from paying for your benifits that you earned. It's all about cutting peope and putting the fear in the rest about loosing their job"
bad,Very poorly managed and employees treated badly close to home not to bad of a location
bad,Goodyear has re-structured itself to become financially stable for the years to come .
bad,"so stressful , no control from management over other employees specially techs and mechanics , lack of honesty , top managers don't know anything about what's going on inside / outside the store , no body care about new hires and no one is welling to give hand , their principle is : go learn by your self and from your own mistakes, so racist and they were helping each other in this issue ."
bad,Wasn't able to learn anything and the pay was terrible as well as management. worked you hard for nothing in return. I was given no advancement opportunities event though I expressed it to management. They only pay attention to you if you make mistakes not when you are doing well and making them money.
bad,Did not properly train the employees therefore the work environment was lacking. Customers weren't satisfied with their needs because employees didn't know what to do!
bad,"It's a great place to learn how to work on diesel trucks."
bad,"Hard-work, less money.... hot in summer and cold as you know what in winter!! I advise you not to go there in social circle, GA."
bad,If Management is trying to put this Plant under their doing a good job. Favoritism is a high problem here. Everyday you can see certain people slacking off and its always the same ones which also just happen to be the ones that always get away with it. Its the hard workers that feel the brunt of any problems. For caring your most likely to be degraded and insulted and that's not just by your coworkers but some of management as well. Allot of the workers there would sooner stab you in the back and tell a supervisor what your doing wrong then do their job and do it correctly. You do have some good management and good hard working employees that work there but they are completely over shadowed by by bad mangers and employees.
bad,"By far, the worst company I have ever worked for in 35 years of manufacturing.  Upper management is only focused on the bottom line, and fail to understand the workers are their number one asset.  Very authoritative management culture that doesn't look for solutions to problems, instead just ""continues with the beatings"", so to speak."
bad,"You spend the majority of your time putting out fires, being afraid of making the wrong choices, not being supported no matter how much you produce, and not being trusted by upper management."
bad,If I knew that the management was this bad I would have never applied here. I am sorry but I honestly have NOTHING nice to say about this job.
bad,This is a dead end job for a technician. You will never get over 30 hours! Management sits in the office all day and does nothing but collect a pay check. Morale in the shop is bad. Work/life balance is a joke! You will work every weekend. They will not send you to training schools to keep your skills fresh on the new technology. Their idea of training is trial and error or send it to the dealer! A typical day was working on some vehicles and listening to the Manager complain about business after sitting in his office for the whole day! Word to the wise. Get all of your promises in WRITING!
bad,"Hard labor, NO sick time, 3 years til you make a decent livable wage AND recieve dental insurance. Co-workers are great people."
bad,It was All buddy buddy oriented and tons of  harassment. People were taking so many pain meds that they couldn't think properly!!! If you didn't belong to the group they shunned you.The managers had contests on how many people that they could fire a day!
bad,Goodyear's management is severely under qualified.  They create a hostile work environment and refuse to acknowledge their inefficiencies. By far the worst managers Ive ever encountered in any field of work through out my career. I would not recommend working with or for Goodyear.
bad,Beyond unsafe work environment along with everyday hostile environment. Do not come to Goodyear unless you want to get injured be mentally unstable.....
bad,"The culture is terrible. Management only cares about numbers not people.  It is a very hostile environment, very hostile.  People are not treated well or equally."
bad,"Promises made, but nothing changes, females are more like secretaries than repsected co workers.  Mgrs never give you a straight answer so they always look like the good guy.  No appreciation or respect for titles, education or work progress.  Lies about budget cuts and OverTime cuts and threats of due process 3 strike rule, but really when they have an annoying bug in their ear that rules the office, policies fly out the window."
bad,Management only cares for numbers and doesn't have a real perception of how to keep the shop staffed properly. Treats people like tools. As long as your a yes man you will do fine. Pay is ok when there is work.
bad,"Inconsiderate oppresive culture. Irresponsible management with a blatant disregard of respect for women.  Core safety and equipment principles ignored to get numbers.  Liars in reporting absolutely encouraged. Make it sound good is more important  than what is done."
bad,Constant management shifts resulting extremely poor ship environments with constant “this is how I do it” changes. Company underpays you for the service work they do give you to line the service manager pockets.
bad,"All they wanted was quantity instead of quality. If you put in a work order to get equipment repaired management wants to know why the machine is down, I guess they aren't trained to check a computer. They would come by and rant and rave and want to cuss you out them write you up."
bad,i chose to leave Goodyear due to horrible management and being disrespected and talked down to on a daily basis by management and the DM all the way up to the ceo. i do not recommend working here.
bad,People in the surrounding community flock to Goodyear because of the pay and benefits. I’m sure 20/25 years ago this was the ideal place to work! But the Union has ruined the culture here and employees think that they don’t have to do their job and will be protected by the Union. What they don’t understand is the fact that the Union is only going to give them a gas card once the doors close at Danville Goodyear! Upper Management is such a kill joy and let’s not forget all the people that have positions they are not qualified for. I’m glad I left when I did.
bad,"Management throughout many departments display a high lack of knowledge and pure disregard for current proven practices. Besides solid pay, no positives. Most are excited to leave and others resent those who do. I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want to be part of a progressive company, where your experiences/skills are valued."
bad,Goodyear rubber is a cutthroat company that does not care of anyone. Upper management will do what ever it takes to get to their budget goal even cut great employees.
bad,"First off let me say this there are some good people that work there But they get taken advantage of. Now If you value your health and body don't work there. It's nasty in there. The machines are no good. They want you to put way too much stress on you body. One person shouldn't have to meet production for an entire shift for the entire plant by themselves. But that's what they do. They don't care about quality of the product just how much they can get out. They are in violation of OSHA all the time. the Building in low standard. It rains inside the building. The machines catch on fire, The building itself catches on fire. They don't care about your health or safety. Do your research before going there. There's a reason why they have a 200% turnover rate. Look up Goodyear OHSA Violation you'll see everything I say about them is true. And the pay they want you to work there 3 years before they pay you what you should already be making. Pass on this company."
bad,"Mann wird wie dreck behandelt wenn es prblme mit der anlage gieb hat immer der mitarbeiter schuld "
bad,The management was terrible. The shop was a revolving door because no one wanted to deal with the store managers games. The company pushed you to meet sales quotas for unnecessary maintenance.
bad,"It’s an interesting process to slow down and think about exactly why you love your job, zeroing in on the specific reasons you are motivated to go to work each day. Here’s what some customer service representatives who found employment through OfficeTeam said when we asked them to answer this question: ""Complete this statement: 'I love my job because ...'"":"
bad,This company only cares about numbers. The safety and good treatment of employees is basically non existent. Employees are targeted for write ups if they speak up about safety issues
bad,"Set up to fail. My District Manager even confirmed that. Not a good experience that I care to elaborate on further."
bad,No help from management or other personnel. Everyone for themselves. Bad company micro management from Regional on down. Asks for much but gives little to do it with. Poor performance on tires and management doesn’t know which way is up. The prices are to high and tires are limited and you have to chase tires from other centers and perform your job as well. Limited on what you can sell as the center I was at just sold tires in a cornfield environment . Goodyear is eliminating brands and taking brands and renaming them. Salary is a draw on commission and very hard to make in an environment where other salespersons have business in what supposed to be your area. The regional thinks there’s nothing wrong with that. Well duh.
bad,I work for a good year about 14 years at least 10 years I was stressed out .. coworkers  staying on routes longer then they’re supposed to leaving  you to do their warehouse work management would never say nothing .. you’re overworked little  pay .. and you’re constantly lie to ..HR..is no help.. management is two-faced it .. stay away ..
bad,A typical day at work is terrible. Everything about this job is focused about scamming customers and doing the least amount of work as possible.
bad,Very poor management all they care about is how many units u can sell. No price support high turnover. Better look elsewhere. Pay structure is poverty range.
bad,Local Jacksonville upper management  presses for increased sales and gross margin at any cost. Appreciation for gains over  prior year are nonexistent.  No work life balance. Expect to work six days 11 hours a day.
bad,Even though the pay was great the money wasn't worth working there.  12 hour work shifts ended being 14 plus with no compensation for working over your 12 hours. .  No coverage for vacation so you could work 14 hour days for ever.  No life work balance and my manager didn't care.
bad,"Manager of branch runs the center like a service station. Essentially, she is a glorified office manager, and Is unconcerned with outside sales. Sees them as an expense instead of an asset. Prefers to worry about national accounts and walk in business. DSM is awesome, but is 5 hours away and has little day to day interaction. "
bad,"Though they take great care of the customers, they treat the employees with favoritism and disreguard."
bad,"I've been with Goodyear for over 18 years. Used to be fun and nice place to work, but for the past 5-6 years after a new management the company went down on everything.  The company creates a hustle environment, all tbe stores are running short stuffed working long hours and the corporate keeps on demending more out of you.  No matter how much you do its never enough. Management needs to get they're act together if they want to keep good people working for them."
bad,All three places treat you well.Can be long hours as on call.Management was great at all.
bad,Company has no direction and just does what it needs to keep its head above water. Very long hours with no promotion opportunities without being in the 'good boys' group
bad,"Extremely unprofessional work environment.   Upper Management would often use profanity and threaten employees creating a hostile work environment.   Extremely political environment. Incompetent, uneducated managers are often promoted over qualified, educated managers, who are then assigned the former’s work assignments.   There are zero opportunities for advancement. Managers will promise promotions to deter you from looking for other opportunities.  HR is not respected; therefore, unable to provide strategic support. There Is no engagement strategy with the plant. HR Specialists are responsible for up to 500 associates, resulting in an excessive workload. They are also responsible for auditing bathrooms and making sure they are cleaned. Not a typical HR responsibility.  Racism is prevalent within the organization but ignored when reported.   There’s no work life balance. Weekend work is expected and you may be on call."
bad,Get wrote up for no reason. Somtime work all day and all night. Place is very dirty and rat infestation. Manegement talks to you like your 5 years old. Tooling is out of date or wore out.
bad,Working at Goodyear taught me more about myself and what I can endure and still function!! It taught me what not to be like in a high position!! Ready for a change
bad,I worked at goodyear for 12 years and while I worked there 5 people were killed one way or another. you would think after the first one they would have seen some problems needed addressing but no about 10 years go by and 4 more get killed before they finally decide to take action and fix the way things are done. I wouldn't recommend anyone work there and its a shame because its one of the highest paying manufacturing jobs around.
bad,"Area Masnager (son) had no management skills and displayed no leadership or direction. The CEO (father) made determinations with no facts involved. No discussion on issuesor how to improve."
bad,"Horrible culture. You gotta be in the click. Doesn't matter how good or smart you are. If your not in the click, you not getting any promotion's. Absolutely the most racially prejudice place in America."
bad,Archaic organization. Very political.  Undermining at every turn between different regional leaders.  The work environment literally made me sick with stress.
bad,"Worked in the dispatching center for a year before I quit, and it was always a politics game and had to be kissing butt or you would get laid off. Would not recommend to anybody unless desperate for a job"
bad,Never stop looking for somewhere else. This is not long term employment. Get experience and move on to a dealership where you can make more money and have a better work place. No type of break room . You have to sign a paper saying you took all your breaks but if you take a break the manager has something to say about it enev though he's always on break and Facebook.
bad,Very poor management in the tread shop and not enough breaks.. you will never take your your last 15 minute break..Glad I found something better then this dead end job..
bad,Goodyear does not care about employee safety and shows a great amount of favoritism when it comes to certain individuals. Management is so focused on production that they throw quality out the window along with the morale of the employees. Each day that you go to work you are blessed to make it back home because someone is always dying or getting seriously injured.
bad,quick to hire and terminate. some locations are union some are not..   Union is fairly weak and company is cheap and probably worse than most.  benefits are decent.  fellow workers are not friendly and they are cut throat. very unethical. Do not work here if you have self pride.
bad,"Poor advancement opportunity. Poor management. "
bad,"I enjoy what I do very much. I get along with all of the employees, the shop is very slow, the manager prevents advancement, mechanics are sent home early losing pay or sent outside to landscape the property."
bad,"I worked for Goodyear in Milford for 2 years and i wasted 2 years of my life. We went through so many techians I seriously loss count. I was promise a raise never got it, I was promise a promotion all of a sudden the position I was going for was  terminated. No one grows in this company unless you're kissing a whole lot of butt and that's if you're lucky. You're never home, you're always on the road 24/7 yes 24/7. The starting pay is $15 and the amount of work you do there that isn't enough specially when you're on the side of the highway risking your life, not to mention that 40 minutes away there is another Goodyear in Hartford starts off at $17 doing the same stuff. Out of all the amount of work you do they only give you a half hour break and sometimes your so busy you can't take it."
bad,good place if you have no kids or wife takes a lot of your time did not like some of the things that went on when i was there at the end of my time there
bad,Each plant has its own culture. Corporate has a very political and adversarial culture which works for some but alienates most. The company was strapped on cash when I worked there which meant investment in employees was minimal at best.
bad,"I WORKED for Goodyear Retail for 8 long  years! You are expected to work until you drop. Once they have broken you your gone. I was injured on the job. After PT and some procedures I was given a lifting restriction of 35lbs, so I was terminated. I was a service manager?? It was a blessing that it happened and I'm out of that company!! You will be expected to work extremely long hours (50-60 a week) and how ever much you give it's not enough. Your kids grow up without you and if your married it can destroy that.it's work , eat, sleep, work. There is no appreciation from Goodyear headquarters Akron Ohio! You earn vacation however taking it's another story because the store is never staffed enough to take time off. I say stay away! There are much better companies to work for!"
bad,had no help in the front counter making it hard to give great customer service. always trying to run with a skeleton crew. no room to have a personal life so to say. ended up working 7 weeks without a day off.
bad,"This is a people killer.  Walked 16 miles a day after my maintenance leads were all taken for ""special"" jobs leaving the front line work to inexperienced others."
bad,"Was offered the basics for a sales position of this type like a few already set up accounts, there would be full training on products, help with the area. None of which was given. Other sales rep was not helpful and actually gave bad advice and knowledge probably on purpose. The computer system was all out dated and no one knew for sure what service prices should be for anyone as they are different for every account you try and set up. This is not a actual sales position even though that is what they want you to do. Not for professionals. If you except a position make sure you get, In writing, what they are offering. The rules changed daily and the management was not fully in control. You were to sell recap tires and then they would run out of product and tell you not to sell it. Even though you were given a sales goal. When they tell you they will give you 6 months to get new accounts up and running your true time is only about 1.5 - 2 months."
bad,"Old boys club and don’t think because you’ve gotten the job that you’re in. Corporate has their hands in everything and you’re worked until you can’t stand the next morning. They steal from you if you don’t take your lunch, they just work you through your lunch and adjust your time to make it look like they weren’t breaking any laws. Sketchy place would not recommend. No home life they own you."
bad,Most people that worked through the store I worked at lasted at most 6 months before quitting because of management. They also tend to play favoritism.
bad,"Always promised stuff that never happens. Even if you're asked how you would resolve a problem, its never used. Absolutely no support from corporate. Want you to take tests and do modules repeatedly that pull you away from your job and more important issues."
bad,The management at the Tire Hub mobile branch is awful since the old boss had to leave. No one wants to work as a team and management just sits in the office and doesn’t help out with anything.
bad,"Pay is great but in no way worth the sacrifice of the culture and schedule. If you have a spouse or a family FORGET IT!!!! Absolute lack of sleep, rotating schedule trashes your health and your quality of life."
bad,"Includes a 10-12 hour work day, 6 days a week."
bad,"Management is not supportive or understanding of people's situations, and they show favoritism when promoting. Workplace culture is cutthroat and people do not work together."
bad,"The culture in the company is caustic. It begins at the very top and despite talk about the importance of the associate, there is never any fundamental change to the base culture which is based on numbers only, who you know, punishment for failure and disagreement, harassment, foul language, sexism, veiled racism, and a complete lack of respect for others. I would not recommend working here."
bad,The best part of the day was working with the customers. The rest of the day was busy spent trying to remain calm and not get frustrated by management. A total lack of support and dinosaur system for software made it very difficult to do a great job.
bad,"Upper management has no knowledge of how to work with people or customer service. Daily work at the store was great... until you had to deal with the DM. They did not want to train you..just throw you in and let you figure things out as a manager. In my opinion , not the way to do things."
bad,"No where to grow, its like a dead end. Management isn't adhering to a work/life balance. Your treated as a number to complete tasks rather than self improvement and growth."
bad,Be very careful of company politics. Upper management will taking credit for your hard work is the norm. Huge disconnect from corporate headquarters in Akron Ohio.
bad,It want hard work nor difficult. People was good to work with. But the supervisor mad it difficult to work with. Also the turnover was really bad as well. It could have been a better experience if there was better leadership.
bad,"Never has the saying ""all pain, no gain"" been more accurate.  You absolutely work your tail off at this place, and get nowhere.  You end up feeling like that guy that kept rolling the rock up the hill, only to have the rock roll back on you.  Goodyear is that kind of rock.  Management is absolutely atrocious, always has been.  No direction, no goals, all fun and games, but no one thinks its funny as illustrated by the incredible amount of turnover at this hopeless place.  The only positives I can think of from this place is the benefits are pretty good, they will show some flexibility with working hours, and the pto is pretty fair.  Other than that, this place is a three ring circus that is going downhill as fast as that rock rolling down the hill."
bad,"You will make good money, use it to start your own business. This place will break your body down, physically and mentally. This is not a place to get comfortable in."
bad,"VERY poor company to work for.  Total lack of direction and management!  NO training as promised when hired told to figure it out and DON'T make excuses!  NO path to run on!  They WING it!"
bad,"j'ai pendant 23 ans travaillé pour cette société, qui ne respecte aucunement les salariés, la façon de gérer l'entreprise est digne des années 1900, une véritable catastrophe, aucune reconnaissance des dirigeants, un mépris total pour les agents de fabrication, aucune formation, pas de communication, bref, une grande entreprise certes mais géré par de petites personnes,,,,"
bad,Applied to Goodyear with the thought that I will start at the bottom and work my way up. I worked through some rough business times and management changes. I worked at many locations in the district and enjoyed being an asset to the company. My end result to leave the company was being overwhelmed with not being able to provide a service for my customers by not having the proper staff. I didn't see myself excel at that current position.
bad,This was the worst job I have every had.  The environment was extremely caustic for a front line supervisor.  I would not wish an area manager position on my worst enemy.
bad,Manager is a tyrant who micromanages and gets into arguments with customers. Lots of issues with cars not getting oil put in them and with angry customers coming in to complain.
bad,"Sehr schlechtes Vorgesetztenverhalten"
bad,"The job was okay working on cars, but the manager she was unbearable to work for . The manager made a great company to work for into a negative place. Making it unbearable and a very negative place to work and keep any decent employee"
bad,Why would a company after 26 hard years lay me off. I guess. I must have made some district mgr made. I was 4 years from retiring . I do get a small pension but no other benefits. When I started in 1969 it was a.great company to work for. That was when we had great management. No more good management
bad,"Unstrukturiert und komplizierte Arbeitsabläufe."
bad,"Far from the good job it used to be,machinery is not maintained because of management,numbers is all bosses care about. They would rather build a tire that is not selling,just to stockpile it to say that they meet daily ticket, why not build something  that is in demand instead.Management has no clue how to run that plant,workers are bullied and treated horribly."
bad,"good pay, great benefits, manager thought it was appropriate to have you work 6am to 9pm and then be on call the rest of the night, if you were not scheduled for on call and no one answered their phone you would get a phone call, i personally was written up for not answering the phone. ( i was not on call and i was not back up) when i brought my concerns to him, he told me to quit b!+$#ing thats how the job is. well i have worked for another company for 3 years prior, and it was run ten times better."
bad,"Each trucking company had individual pricing, and all had to be from memory as none was stored in computer files. The computer was merely a forms generator and not really an aide in invoicing each customer. No mistakes are allowed. None."
bad,"Une entreprise à la culture américaine: aucun sentiment. Quand on ne veut plus de vous, hop, dehors.. Dommage...."
bad,Loved the job but hated the company. The management was non existent at this store and was a complete joke. The store manager would sit in an office all day and play candy crush and didnt care at all about the other employees. One employee always called in “sick” and never ran his service calls so the back up tech always had to it and nobody cared. It put extra strain on all the other employees which is ultimately why I found another job and left. It’s pretty sad when management at this store doesn’t even know how to do your job let alone theirs so if you have any questions you’re on your on.
bad,"Definitely not a company I enjoy. Working for. Your just an employee, easily replaceable. There’s no family time available, you need to practically live for this company and no social life"
bad,"This may only be true for the Colorado stores but Goodyear is a terrible place to work for. The management doesn't care about employees or customers for that matter. All they care about is numbers. They promise a descent pay and a ""guaranteed"" 30hrs a week. I worked over 50hrs a week on several occasions and only got paid for 30. their overtime pay is also a joke!"
bad,"management is the worst i ever seen in my 27yr career .every week they change how they are going to do bussness .its a hard place to work. iv been with company for almost 3 yrs and we change store management about every 4months .they have a system called triad they created and the labor time on it is very bad if your a flag hour guy .your job is good one day and the next day they have your replacement starting ,its the craziest place .they dont care about techs all they want to do is sell tires so for a flag hours forget it, 30 hrs aweek is what you can expect pay but you will work about 50hrs. if your a general service tech you get paid hourly about 12 bucks and your on the clock 40hrs so for them its a good deal and you can learn . human resources is in india so when you have concerns good luck with that.co-workers a good for the most part they have familys good working people but the management makes it hostile work place,when the managers are not hitting the number the company wants, they turn every one agenst each other and it gets very ugle ."
bad,Management (salary) does not care about the production workers at all and it is very apparent form the inside. Safety is only a priority when OSHA or when guests are present.
bad,A typical day is 12 hrs 12 minute breaks with 20 minute lunch. Fast pace work same thing all day every day. Job security is biggest problem and layoffs common.
bad,"Flat structure means no advancement, but pay is reasonably high. The extremely few upper level engineering positions are held by those who talk the loudest, not the most effective people."
bad,"It was almost a plant stopper condition when a communication card was failed in night shift. It was obsolete system part and couldnot get any where immediately since manufacturing was stopped since 10 years."
bad,six days a week with people who are higher up than you and are completely complacent in just doing the minimum while in the process making everyone below them feel like they are worth nothing
bad,The store manager has total lack of respect for employees and the fact if it interferes with vaping and dating sites he has an attitude he talks to people any kind of way and he doesnt appreciate good help
bad,"I was working with Sellars Goodyear from 2012, the work environment is so stressful, I learned how to work with GBMS. "
bad,"Capacitaciones inexistentes o incompletas se aprende a la mala(a base  de errores,suspensiones o accidentes)hay clasismo, replesalias preferencias,humillaciones,contaminacion acoso laboral,problemas administrativos, logisticos, mecanicos,de planeacion, de calidad, seguridad y ambientales,adolece de problemas sindicales( por proteccion patronal)"
bad,"Dis manager set us up to fail."
bad,Poor management overall. Manager did not have any experience on what he was doing so it affected sales and commission. Techs complained since no work was available due to lack of sales.
bad,Pues mi carateristicas son laborar mis ofisios  bien desempenados para k mi hoja debida sea recomendable y estar bien en mi entorno con mis companeros y asr demi lo mejor k puedo y dirijirme amis superiores con respeto y com mis companeos lo mismo
bad,"I invested 10+ years in this company and they only invested $2 on me.  In all my years there, I received a total of  $2 dollar raise.  This company should be ashamed.  The only ones that benefit in this company are the District Managers and any one else above them.  Also, brown-nosing managers benefit in this company.  Everyone else (assistant managers, sales reps., installers, and mechanics) gets stress, promises,  BS, and end up receiving peanuts for payment.  Goodyear's incentive plans are a joke that keeps getting funnier every year.  C'mon Goodyear get your act together.  Goodyear's  strength, fame, and respect comes from their employees' hard work so take better care of them.  It's no wonder why America's Tire Company and Michelin Tires keeps your tails between your legs.  This company is a disgrace to all American companies and deserves to be put down to sleep."
bad,"My job duties were front end replacement, brake systems, tune up and fuel pump replacements. The location was Centereach Long island.Good Year is a very good company to work for."
bad,"I have experienced and learned a lot working for Goodyear tire and Rubber company. Having the experience of working on both sides of the water, working hourly then switching to salary, was a very trying transition, which I handle very well, You have to learn and teach people that although you came from the floor that my duties changed, and we all have a job to do. The most enjoyable part is the people that I work with and work under me."
bad,A hostile working environment and would not recomend working there.
bad,THE WORST COMPANY YOU COULD EVER WORK FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Was here as a on the job trainee did not learn much other than fixing tires
bad,I would never recomend any one to work there. They won't hire you
bad,"Once closed no contact info was shared with employees, even those who qualified for retirement. More importantly, all managers were told they could not give us a work reference."
bad,I just got laid off from there.   Company was great to work for but job security was low.
bad,"Worked there 2 times corporate sales manager ended up  being store manager received top rating for a manager 1st yr. Over 1 million a year in business time cards customer service. Store rating four stars plus on social media. Manage staff of 10 toco eight techs. Plus day to day business and customer service. The corporation shut the store down with a two hour notice  Goodyear can shut down Akron with the same notice but they worry about the the blimp!!."
bad,"My immediate manager is very supportive to my growth in the company.  Has given me opportunity to assist several company events.  The Management in general has given high regard to my opinion in the office administration (e.g. office repairs, supplies requisition, etc.)."
bad,"dias bastante agitado como en toda cocina donde te puedes desempeñar con mas de 30 pesonas donde cada uno hace lo que le corresponde, no hay timpo para charla, por tanto trabajo que tenemos cuando queremos hacer que en trabajo salga exelente"
bad,"Management pushy, district manager is a typical power hungry person and will ridicule you on phone call meetings with other stores about tire sales. Expect you to sell anything to customers."
bad,"This job does not pay enough to make a living at all  I could not even afford food because it just barley covered my bills. They will “tier you up” and you will do three to four times the work with no extra pay and no recognition. The managers al sit and talk and do their own thing all day, and whenever you need help, they wait until they’re finished what they’re doing, whether your situation is important or not. You do not receive the benefits unless you are hired on, and some of the employees have been employed as a temp for over a year  some of them in higher up positions too. They don’t really want to give you the benefits or the pay you deserve and they’re selfish."
bad,They want you to follow all rules and regulations but they never do themselves. They will lie to you on job interview to get you to work for them. Pay really sucks for really hard work. Insurance really expensive. Management have no people skills. But workers around you are really nice.
bad,you are just a number may be paid well but as far as caring for the employees good luck with that
bad,"My typical day at work consist of, test driving used cars and  inspecting them for safety damage, worn or broken parts, and then creating the repair order and waiting for it to be approved. Depending approval of the repair order, i would replace the parts that were approved. Everyday i worked on different cars and trucks and learned numerous things about repairing vehicles. My Management was always supportive and equal to all the employees and would actually get down and dirty and work with us if we needed help. My co-workers were even more supportive by helping me anytime i needed. The hardest part of my job was finding my boss to get the repair orders approved because of so many other employees doing the same thing. The most enjoyable part of the job was pretty much everything i have no complaints"
bad,só  tem espaço  na empresa quem entrega o companheiro de trabalho supervisores sem qualificação
bad,"Not a good chance for growth. Not a good job. Long hours, low pay. Some difficult people to work with. Some good people though. Not a career oriented field"
bad,"Management was awful from the top to the bottom!!!!! When asked to do a job you were not given proper tools, proper documents, etc."
bad,"Not a great place to work, but not the worst. Pay is minimal, co-workers are good. Supplied equipment is mediocre at best. Management cannot seem to accomplish anything due to upper management not allowing them to think for themselves."
bad,"Not a good place to work if you happen to be honest. I personally saw things sold to customers that they not only did not need but they were expensive too, management is aware of what is going on and they turn a blind eye to it to enhance the bottom line. CEO like to refer to sales employees as ""youMFers"" Not good."
bad,"It's ok for the mean time, but it's definitely not a career. Pay is petty. Long hours. Way too much work for the little pay and barely any raises. It's cool if you just need something to get by. But don't get stuck here..."
bad,The place is a o.k place to learn if you know your stuff. If don't know anything don't even bother coming here. The management could use a little brushing up but which one doesn't. The neighbors are wonderful here. They are very friendly and outgoing. The best part of working here is working on a car other than that it's a drag being here
bad,If Management is trying to put this Plant under their doing a good job. Favoritism is a high problem here. Everyday you can see certain people slacking off and its always the same ones which also just happen to be the ones that always get away with it. Its the hard workers that feel the brunt of any problems. For caring your most likely to be degraded and insulted and that's not just by your coworkers but some of management as well. Allot of the workers there would sooner stab you in the back and tell a supervisor what your doing wrong then do their job and do it correctly.
bad,"Responsible  for day to day sales, learn to multitask under a demanding environment with customer constantly requiring you attention.The hardest aspect is when corporate calls you on a sales call at your most busiest time, failures to achieve their requirement will end up as a disciplinary  write up.The location in Coral Gables is one of the busiest office , customers will get upset from us answering the phone at time of sales."
bad,"manager is overly rude to there customers I have witness them treat  there employees like dirt and they all'ways try to upsell you things and they take way to long and when you make a complain to human resources it doesn't matter,nothing ever changes"
bad,"A typical day for me consisted of running everything with the mechanics and shop. Ordering parts and maintaining the inventory to make sure we had what was needed for the task at hand. Management was severly lacking and has an ""Old way"" of doing business. Customer care and honesty was not in high regards with this company. Lack of training was another problem. I enjoyed being able to help customers and finiding the best solution for their needs."
bad,Would not recommend this location. They play favorites and when you aren't a favorite they figure out ways to push you out of the company. In need of new management.
bad,"Management doesn't care about its employees, we held meetings where our manager and district manager told us not to bother calling HR because HR just calls the manager and tells him to take care of the problem."
bad,There are very minimum opportunities to advance. The hours of work are very long.  We receive no benefits and are not offered health insurance.  Pro:The work environment is nice.
bad,"The company was an okay work  environment..  The company shut down which was the reasoin for leaving, but they did not pay any benefits due to them being privately owned."
bad,Work here if you enjoy being treated like garbage Wages are not comparable to other plants they get away with it since it’s lawton (no competition)...
bad,Not good to work for always micromanaging also verbally abusive with racial undertones. Continuously talks bad about employees and has unrealistic goals
bad,"I worked there for over 2 years they monitor every aspect of your driving by gps tracking even how hard you make a turn but that's not the bad part the warehouse manger won't stand up for himself and diffently not drivers from fear of losing his job so at the end drivers are abused that's  why people quit the only people that stay are the ones that feel they can't do better which is sad!! You will unload trucks everyday by hand 1200 tires ranging from 25-200lbs  while other driver watch and try to leave asap on there route and not at a normal rate they have 2 labor ready guys throwing tires at you as fast as they can so they can go home and you have to catch them coming at you at 30 mph and stack them by code it's almost impossible to do when's it's 2 against one and if there's 2 of you most likely your intercepting them from going everywhere and re-throwing them to the other end of the warehouse it's ridiculous and the fun part is good year does not have any  type or Claps on the forklift to move the mass number of tires (truck tires included) which means you will be counting them and writing everything down by hand and you'll be moving the tires off the truck stacking them by numerical order  then moving  them again to the isle they're supposed to go to then when you have a chance put them all up in the rack all by hand, it's backbreaking work and you won't be  able to move in the warehouse because they will be tires literally everywhere  thousands as far as you can see which all have to go up in the racks. You being new will be worked as a slave and the whole sale manger"
bad,"Gave 2 stars because I met some great friends there... But we were all fired together- for being friends. Management at this location is not equipped to make smart decisions and you will be watched on camera like you work in a prison. Watch your back because the Director of Airship Operations takes pleasure in firing and is looking to slash people and plug new ones in for his ""yes man"" Pilot In Charge even though the place runs great. It's not uncommon for HR to fly in from Ohio and sweep a half dozen or so out on the street. No reason is given. Very ugly treatment when you take pride in your job and put up with so much. Safety is not the number one priority and there are some long days with little or no overtime for your efforts. Pay scale is very low in exchange for being a ""Goodyear Blimp Mechanic"".  I wouldn't expect that things will improve much since Goodyear has bought 3 new Zeppelins and they are 10's of millions over budget."
bad,Worst Place I have ever worked for is Goodyear at 1303 N Academy! Management swears at you. Gives good workers a hard time. While doing NOTHING to workers that on purpose are slow and do as LITTLE as possible.
bad,"Goodyear has been a good company for me to work for while in school. The managers worked well with my schedule and paid me much better than what many of my friends were being paid at their jobs. A little monotonous as a General Maintenance Technician though, change oil, rotate tires, change oil . . . not a hard job, just sometimes monotonous. But the co-workers helped liven the mood a lot. Overall a good place to work for a job, but I would not want a career there."
bad,Employees are valued for as long as they can be worked. Compensation is low end retail and benefits are expensive for what you get. Very little room for advancement.
bad,"A typical example of an American corporation. They dial up production expectations to a heart attack then drop it down one iota. With a continental shift, it has little life/family balance. I would not recommend this company!"
bad,"good place for people retiring , no stress , you can take 3 hours to do one oil change , no training for the beginner, you can do whatever you think is right .if you just need a place to hang around ,   great place !!"
bad,"little room for advancement,poor pay,don't receive promised raises or incentives,poor moral on the job,no company activities or holiday bonuses,very little company sponsored training on products/services."
bad,Very strong lack of management. Good pay and mediocre benefits. Half Vacation time used for plant shutdown times. Middle management catches brunt of trouble. High turnover in middle management.
bad,I’ve worked for the company for two years and it has gradually gotten worse every day. Management is poor and they pick and chose who they will write up and who they won’t. They all have favorites and will harass you until you either quit or be fired if they don’t like you. You never know the security of your job even with being there 3 years.
bad,"Competing goals and projects between plants and corporate leads to much turnover. Horrible and unqualified managers in key positions. Unless something changes, there will always be high turnover"
bad,"Worked in a ""lab"" for second shift and realized it was not what I was looking for. No one would take responsibility for their mistakes and would get offended if you saw them doing something wrong and try to fix it. There was a lack of management and they were only in that position since they were there for many years. The culture there is very cut throat. There is a lot of drama there and as long as you don't talk to people, you will be fine and people will like you. You're taught something in 15 minutes and expected to use huge machines for the next 7 hours of work. There are favorites here and management will be on their side when something goes wrong. One of the worst companies I have worked for."
bad,"Great Experience, Fun Environment. Flexible hours. Opportunities for advancement and mentoring fellow coworkers. Travel opportunities available. Sales oriented."
bad,Management leaves you to fend for yourself in most situations requiring experience.  The company cares more about its paper trail and antiquated business model than its employees.
bad,Schedules additional work at closing time. Not flexible. Managers call you in on your day off. No room for advancement. Does not care about job work life balance
bad,"Work various shifts with no consistency, expected to be available at any time. District manager is a micro manager to help warrant his position, he brings nothing to the table. Culture is okay, they have the ability to get candidates for work which is a good thing. How long they stay is another. Most enjoyable part of the day is clocking out."
bad,"Poor old style tough management, do not appear to know law.of how to be treated at workplace. Discrimination, poor treatment by other employees and management. Stay away.  Very expensive employee benefits. Company paid portion is too low. Cost of benefits for employees high."
bad,This would not be an applicable statement to post currently.  Not a fair statement for me to give.  It was a family owned franchise.  The business has since gone defunct.
bad,They don't give bonus like promised techs do GS work little to no check out time not enough work to make any money not even a fan when it's hot hope you like to sweat
bad,Don't expect to stay in any one store to long !  The Division manager in Jacksonville has no care for his employees only his bonuses.  Expect to hate the job shortly after getting it due to very bad management in Jacksonville and high turnover rates.
bad,"Goodyear is over 100 years old. The company is stuck in the heavily political, slow to change mindset of the 1970's. There is an extreme lack of diversity and strong sense of favoritism that permeates through out the company. "
bad,"Good pay, great people at lower levels and in the plant, Management demands require zero work life balance and you are looked down upon for even wanting the weekend off. do not recommend for anyone wanting a life, but if you want good money, chance for advancement and global opportunities, go for it.  Just expect no life going forward...."
bad,"My review summary sums up this business, I however stand behind the product, not this particular distributor."
bad,"Needs better management and better benefits, covered for store manager when he called in and took extra shifts to keep paperwork in order due to lack of leadership in store."
bad,My day starts at 7 p.m. and ends at 7 a.m. A lot of heavy lifting standing on my feet most of the night. My Co-workers are hard working individuals as you have to be to work there. The most enjoyable part about my day is when I can go home and rest. I really need a change in career.
bad,"The people who were your coworkers were very nice; but the management of this company is very aloof. This is a manufacturing company managed by accountants, who look for profits and stock value. The one positive thing is that they do make a good product. Compensation & benefits are good; but the culture is more of a production than an actuality. Once you have served your purpose, you can be discarded without warning. I did enjoy my tenure at this company, but was not sad to end my employment there. I would recommend taking a very good hard look before deciding to work at Goodyear. Some years are good; but not all of them!"
bad,"For management people its better company but not for freshers, very less salary & no job satisfaction,,............................"
bad,"Learn all info on tires and deal 1 on 1 with customers. The hours and shifts are unfair to employees, students are forced to quit their job or school. Disabled employees are strongly encouraged to quit."
bad,Mgmt believes in passing the buck. Do not expect any major career advancement unless you are someone's child with multiple generations of relatives that have work in the organization. Work/Life Balance is poor IMO.
bad,"no organization "
bad,Management team stirred drama almost every day. Some of us began questioning the validity of our turned hours. Never promoted in 7 months though promised in a few weeks at the interview. High turnover rate with very low shop productivity. Manager degrades certain employees only causing frustration and further lack of productivity.
bad,"The Gadsden plant has recently announced they are eliminating one shift of production which will result in an estimated 250 employees being laid off.  It is generally believed that this is the first step toward closing the plant."
bad,Mechanical hours and jobs constantly given away. That's some people's incentive pay. Had to hustle customers in to side work to compensate for lack of pay. Rules constantly changing and would never be followed or enforced except when convenient for management.
bad,"Poor Management. Manager does not pay attention on request, racist, one sided. People in the shop are good. management has a lot of gossips. If you are closing you have to finish what you started."
bad,"The owner of this company is a great guy, family-owned for many decades. I would still be employed there if it wasn't for the terrible managers they hired during my time working for them. Great location in a great little city! Nice shop, nice people, nice employees except for the aforementioned managers at that time. I miss working there."
bad,"Too many changes to company leadership, no constant approach to business, loosing trust with customers.  Morale was once high, now due to  constant cuts it's as low as ever, wages out of kilter with other local employers yet more and more is expected from an ever shrinking local team.  Progression with in the company now extremely limited locally.  Has set values, doesn't live up to them, wants to grow but no investment."
bad,I enjoyed the guys I worked with but the only downside of working there was the management was not there as in the manger was all about himself and not about the guys working for him.
bad,no room for growth unless you are golfing buddies. I've been there eight years without a raise and I'm not being promoted any time soon. I have learned over four jobs and they still haven't compensated me. I train people and still don't get any consideration for promotion.
bad,decent company but the people running it do not know what the left hand is doing.  only basic sales skills needed as they believe in discounting services instead of actually providing a sales technique
bad,"Goodyear is a decent place to work.  It isn't ""fun"" or exciting.  It is a job.  They pay a decent wage, but the promotions are more set up by who you know, not what you know or what you have done."
bad,"The manager had pstd and work lock himself into his office and not come out.  Would take up all slack for the manager, make sure the service techs did their paperwork right and then fill it for them."
bad,Bad manager. Was not able to advance. Manager told me what percentage i needed to hit monthly to advance but once i hit the number he still turned the advancement down. Manager over charges customers. Manager also likes to play favorites. Hours are cut and you only make 9 to 10 dollars as lube tech with no raise as state inspector.
bad,was a good shop for 6 months. learned how to do tires there but sadly before i could move up the manager left to go to another store. the result of that is no management so no one knows what theyre doing which turned into a bad mix up of information that i just didnt want to be a a part of anymore.
bad,upper management is all about money. they use the cheap advance auto parts a lot of warranty work do to cheap parts. Store is slow not much work coming in lately.
bad,"Management changes to often to make any headway in company."
bad,"On a typical day, you can plan learning that if something is in correct, you can be awarded with the you did it in correctly award. Told that you're are the reason for problems, and it is driven into the ground. The hardest part is working with don nelson and seeing just how he can award you into the ground. Enjoyable part, closing time."
bad,Customer Advisor is was my job to let the guest know what was wrong with vehicle and what it would take to repair them. Also make sure that we had the parts to work on the vehicles.
bad,Cual es la receta para quedar trabajando con contrato indefinido?
bad,If you are not a member of the good ole boy club and do no intend to brown nose your way to the top this is not the place for you or anyone.
bad,Management was very inexperienced. Always blamed any problems on the mechanics and took no blame for any problems that occurred in shop.
bad,"Faire des réparations sur des vielles machines tres sales (noir de carbone ,huile et graisse) ."
bad,I learned not to get stuck at one place. always know what your worth. you don't have to let people belittle you for a job position.
bad,"No vacation time for my full time position"
bad,Manager berates employees.  He has no problem reprimanding employees in front of customers.  If not in his clique you will not get ahead and you will get calls that should be given to others then questioned as to why you can't do your job.  This happens when you have not been trained in this area.  Don't go there.
bad,Goodyear obviously wasnt great... it is closed in Union City.
bad,low pay had to work sundays good co workers long hours hard to sell because their tires are expensive compared to many other sources
bad,"This is the worst of both worlds. It is an old-style corporate culture that make petty tyrants out of middle managers, but without corporate-style benefits. New employees get no pension, and 40 years of service (if you get there) earn no more than 4 weeks of vacation (if you're allowed to take it.)"
bad,not very good. I had a hard time a Goodyear having an eight year old son and pregnant wife it was very trying to mix my life with their schedule. my days off always changed and i worked on weekends. Missed out on alot of quality family time as well.
bad,Goodyear has changed directions in the last 5 years.
bad,Never you have launch break. Never now when you clock out. Is for people no have family or social live.
bad,"Management is under tremendous pressure to meet production goals.  The unrealistic demands from upper managers cause great stress on lower level employees.  Co-workers are unfriendly at best, and at worst will backstab and blame everyone but themselves when there is any kind of problem.  The ONLY thing that matters to this company is profits, and lots of it.  The attitude is ""Do what I told you... We didn't hire you to think!""  The above average pay is the only reason anyone ever stays with this outfit.  (By the way, even with their ""slave driver"" mentality, they couldn't get enough from the employees and decided to close down the local plant in 2011.)"
bad,Would be a great place to work if they had better bcm's and managers. They don't care about safety only about numbers. Goodyear was the best paying job I had but it wasn't worth injuring my back driving a forklift that had bad tires and a broken seat. All three forklifts in final finish was in the same shape.
bad,Horrible management and a lot of harassment. Feels like going into a prison when it’s time for work. I’m currently lookin for another job to work. The best part is gettin off and away from all the negativity in the building
bad,"Plant layoffs jobs sent to mexico. Good pay poor management"
bad,"Many e-mails not customer-related - spent most of your time in the office."
bad,"Customer service is expected to exceed any expectations however, staff at GY allow themselves to be manipulated y select individuals deemed customers. These practices permit those clients to assume privileged status among themselves and demand complete attention upon arrival while as a worker you are expected to drop whatever task you are handling to address these pampered customers every whim."
bad,"Even though the management was extremely kind, I learned from previous employees that the culture had degraded since they first joined. Corporate underpays all of its hands-on workers all while cutting benefits such as vacation and retirement (working on July4th seems like a joke for such an ""American"" company). It seems like they are treated like replacements for robots which haven't come yet."
bad,"Goodyear, has some structural problems, starting from the top down. Many of the senior managers are only in positions that were given by the good ole boy system. Which is fine if the person put in charge is capable. Third shift Area Managers are pretty much punching bags coming from all business centers. For example; it doesn't matter how hard a 3rd shift manager works to try to correct the mistakes from the prior day, they are still held accountable for everyone else's mistake, often time being berated screamed at yelled at and threatened to be fired or wrote up. "
bad,"This company was great to work for until the original owner passed away.  The people who took over were not concerned about the company, customers, or employees."
bad,"Not a horrible place to work but the pay is very low. Very physical work. A lot of customer introduction, good and bad. They dont treat the employees very well."
bad,"Everything is so disorganized and inefficient. From SOPs to getting access to actually do your assigned tasks. Meetings are almost always a waste of time but there's plenty of them."
bad,I worked for Goodyear over 30 years.  I started out in the warehouse and over the years worked my up the ladder.  Goodyear was a safe and comfortable place to work as I raised my family.  I was laid off with alot of other associates in a reorganization.
bad,"I learned how to take a tire on and off at good year for a good 4 weeks till i finally got it. I learned different techniques on how to measure tire threads, and how to find oil filters easily."
bad,"Unsafe work areas, and too many risks taken.  Pay is high if you work 20+ hours a week overtime. When you leave for the day, you are an unsafe driver on the road.(And the company shirts say ""HOME SAFE EVERY DAY"" ) During the off season, you are lucky to get 10-20 hours per week."
bad,"Reviews are only provided once per year.  Pay for performance is a joke.  The workforce associates are easy to work with in most cases, however, mid to upper management, not so much.  Little encouragement to move up and little to no support to do so.  What I did enjoy about this job is helping people resolve issues with their vehicles and building relationships with them."
bad,Company has big issues with losing employees because of the challenges with the company to keep a safe and secure working environment.  Company should invest more in training management.
bad,"The job started out to be a good place to work and retire.  But midstream, the parent company took over and it went downhill immediately.  Our parent company was more worried about moving units instead of customer service."
bad,I did not agree with this owner cause of his cruelity to employees and his dishonesty to customers. this job was a horrible place only due to owner and his morals
bad,"Kollegen super gelernt sehr viel, aber zu eintönig."
bad,It was a job which allowed me to provide a living for my family. You must be able to work with a union and management. The associates are god people to work with.
bad,"there is no clear turn-over of task in my workplace, and the warehouse is not good enough in daily working hours because it is hot and there is no fans."
bad,Very long hours and somewhat unattainable expectations.  Culture is punitive with no positive re-enforcement.  Silo mentality with departments pitted against each other.  Good compensation is the only saving grace.  HUGE disconnect with what Akron (global headquarters) preaches and how the plant treats you.
bad,"The pay was relatively decent, the job was not very hard and the company offered decent benefits. "
bad,"A typical day at work in a retail location for Goodyear Tire is exhausting.  What could be classified as fun and innovative instead becomes mired down with micromanagement and broken promises.  If you have a family, don't even think about working here. The job/life balance is severely off of where it needs to be.  Stores, and yes I mean all of them are extremely streamlined and understaffed.  The hourly rate for doing the job is actually pretty high in my opinion, but bonus/spiff programs are lacking.  Essentially, it's a tire store and the one thing that is compensated the least is selling the tires."
bad,Been here for a year. There are no such things as annual raises and you just get more work dumped on you without the pay.You are micromanaged- you cant even get up to talk to coworkers without getting yelled at
bad,The work was labor intense and hazardous.  A typical day at work involved something breaking down on a machine.  I learned that having a job that you enjoy is extremely important.  My co-workers seemed unhappy and complained a lot.  The hardest part of the job was making the required quota of tires.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the tire hold area.
bad,Management that only knows how to point fingers or take credit for good things. No team work. No accountability.
bad,"Typical job not much room to move up the latter, anytime you're dealing with cars you're bound to learn something new, management could be a lot better, co-workers are real cool and stick together, hardest part of the job is dealing with the weather, most enjoyable part of the job is we're closed on Sundays."
bad,Their processes are outdated and not standardized. Each group operates in it's own silo and politics make the culture challenging. They pay well but the work/life balance is determinant on the department you work in. The company lacks diversity and does not value inclusivity. Great resume builder but not a long term career for most.
bad,I learned new things about different makes and models of cars
bad,"a typical day at work is opening and closing the store, interacting with customer, checking emails, holding a 10 minute talk meeting with employees to review numbers and go over the daily goals."
bad,"This company WAS, years ago a good place to work with high hopes for upward mobility and bettering one's self while helping the company at the same time. Now, the benefits are terrible (as in the health benefits are very expensive and prescription coverage is a joke!), you won't want to advance in this company, you will be promised hours to work and have them stripped away and probably the worst of it being that they take a simple job/career and make it so complicated that you'll nearly hate doing it by the time you're done!"
bad,Over all I liked the work that I did. A lot of the problems stem from union members to non union members and management.
bad,I worked here 5yrs and was stuck in the same position for that time....while I was their people coming into the company was making more than me and had no experience even when I tried to go to a different department I was denied I was told that I going to work on 2nd shift for 2wks I was their much longer and when I finally had enough I asked for more money cause I know I deserve it....then I found another company and after 6mts I made lead
bad,"Disappointed with how management works, and how little they care to help. I was the so call manager, supervisor, and associate. Co workers are good people."
bad,"Goodyear has a very high pay rate for the area I live in and if money is the only thing you are after then I guess it's the place for you! But it is a very harsh working environment,dangerous,extremely hot,you are constantly breathing dangerous chemicals! And the management is terrible! Ifyouryoulhealtand li"
bad,"My experience wasn't to my liking, first complaint was road side assistance, partly for the area, the company it self had plenty of opportunities. Otherwise not a bad place for a paycheck"
bad,Not enough pay with a high workload and poor management. Learned a lot my 2 years there but other companies are willing to pay more depending on your work experience. Avoid this place
bad,"It was ok, but could've been classified as slave labor.The management had some questionable management issues. I worked on the action logistics side meaning the company was technically partnered under good year."
bad,"I do not recommend working at Goodyear.It's hard work, hot and your just a number to them. The only thing Goodyear cares about is making the daily ticket and will put your safety before it. And if you get hurt on the job it's all your fault. The only good thing about working at Goodyear is the pay and benefits."
bad,"hot and dirty, lot of long hours. always threatening to fire you for this or that. union plant. Every opportunity is driven by seniority not by your skills"
bad,"It had bad pay. Management was very poor, customers were over charged for service and ripped off. Services paid for weren't completed all the time. Just a bad experience over all."
bad,This is an ok place to start to learn how to work on cars if given the opportunity. But after awhile the schedule can become very erratic and unbalanced. The wages fluctuate all the time and it's very hard to get paid what you deserve for the amount of work you put in. There's always some loop hole that limits the money you can make for the work you do or the sick time/ vacation you can accumulate. Not somewhere I'd advise staying for a long time if you're really into the automotive field. This job is more of a temporary stepping stone to take you to the next level of your Auto Technician or Service Advising Career.
bad,Born and raised in the south therefore not pro union BUT after working 6 years with goodyear TOTALLY support unions because they deserved one. Management was totally heartless and unfeeling to workers needs and concerns.
bad,"I left the company because my manager smoked cigarettes all day long three feet from my desk.  I complained to the Branch manager, but nothing was done about her smoking."
bad,"Lack of management, and not a lot of room to grow. Not a good work environment. Store has a lack of business. You will have the opportunity to work on many different vehicles."
bad,"Technicien de maintenance dans tous les domaines d'applications, spécialisé sur le dépannage et le réglages des machines de cuisson des pneus. "
bad,Poor communication between raw and finished materials leads to lack of execution by employees. Production tends to come to a halt adding to the loss of man hours and in some cases building materials. Managers are often forced to push out numbers instead of focusing on the direct needs of company to customer dynamic.
bad,Stay away from this organization unless you like to be disposable even if you perform above expectations. My employment lasted 6 years with a perfect safety and sales record. Myself and several others(40+) were let go and the only excuse they gave was restructuring and position elimination.
bad,The Men at Goodyear are extremely insensitive and rude but they are productive. I would never go back to work for them but they seem to have a pretty decent work system going for them.
bad,"To be honest, the management wasn't great. This manager tried to be friends with my coworkers and I by getting drinks with us after work or inviting us over his house but during work he would always be putting us in holes, not listening and for a long time (until there was a new DM) he would only show up for so many hours yet he would get paid a full 40 hours a week. There was a point where management wrote me up because I was being polite to him-literally. "
bad,Goodyear pays their employees every week and gives them 40 hours.Management is trying to put this Plant under their doing a good job. Favoritism is a high problem here. Everyday you can see certain people slacking off and its always the same ones which also just happen to be the ones that always get away with it. Its the hard workers that feel the brunt of any problems. For caring your most likely to be degraded and insulted and that's not just by your coworkers but some of management as well. Allot of the workers there would sooner stab you in the back and tell a supervisor what your doing wrong then do their job and do it correctly. transfer to another state.
bad,"I would go to work and we would open the doors, and get everything ready while we wait for customer cars to work on, i would learn from my co-workers that had more time there at the shop, management was ok, didnt treat me that great, they where immature people, my co workers, were nice and would help me in whatever i need help on, i learned alot from them, hardest part of working there would be having alot of customer cars and trying to finishing them all at the end of the day, i would just have to be very focus n get everything done correctly, my favorite part of my job there was working on cars loved learning lil details how to make things work, or fix problems ."
bad,Produktionsstandort wird nach dem maximalem Gewinnerwirtschaftunsprinzip geführt. Es wird kaum Rücksicht auf die Mitarbeiter genommen. Gewinne stehen über Allem.
bad,"This company has many wonderful people working there which is definitely the best part of the job.  They are friendly, intelligent, generous and committed to excellence.  However, management is stiff and very slow to change their ways even though the management teams change at the drop of a hat.  There are very few opportunities for advancement (the same people just rotate positions) and the culture is a stereotypical old school network.  In the corporate environment, it is expected that all associates are available 24/7."
bad,"as a production worker for goodyear tire my duties were operate production machinery in a safe and efficient manner perform safety and maintenance checks regularly clean equipment and tools appropriately meet production quotas by managing work load effectively operate manufacturing equipment and/or perform general laborer work that supplies raw materials, products or service associated with the manufacture and processing of tires and tires products."
bad,"I advised the manager that I was attending summer classes, he agreed as if everything was fine. I went to work the following day and was fired. I had never been written up nor ever received any reprimands. I'm still unaware as to why exactly I was let go if everything was agreed upon.  Goodyear as a whole was a fair company to work for its just the management that's horrible. "
bad,Treat employess horribly
bad,Typical traditional American company. No true innovation with limited opportunities. Job security is one benefit if you just do the bare minimum. Management seems to not care about engagement.
bad,"Schedule changed weekly, and was often not posted until the day before it took effect.  Seriously."
bad,"The Company takes away most of the comforts of being there. the breaks are terribly short, and it was either really hot or no heat and extremely cold."
bad,"A typical day at work starts with pass down meetings among all management within the department.  After that, we have safety huddles with the associates on the floor.  As the day goes on I spend most of my time doing machine checks and helping my associates through any and all issues to meet daily production."
bad,"Goodyear used to be an exciting company to work for. At one time they believed in customers come first, and employees next. Not sure when all of that changed, but it got pretty bad, pretty fast. I was able to promote very fast to Store Manager, but then lost all work/life balance. I would not work in management for this company again"
bad,Being a hard worker and doing you job well means nothing here. No opportunity for advancement and workers health and well being is not a priority. It does pay well and has decent benefits.
bad,"For a fortune 500 company there was not much organization. Unclear career paths, and unclear organizational chart, takes pride in layovers and have them yearly"
bad,"short staffed, site manager treated employees poorly. For the wide range of duties the pay was not adequate or compensatory of skills used. Overall culture was negative"
bad,"-A typical day was writing up customer work orders, scheduling "
bad,good benefits good pay. credit union in plant is convenient. the RN on night shift is outstanding.  Emergency Response Brigade is very proud of flag on top of tower.
bad,"Typical day, 12 hr shifts, on feet for entire shift, learned a lot, (good and bad) work ethics, habits, management skills. "
bad,"I spent a lot of my young adult life at Goodyear working very difficult shift patterns in a hot and dirty environment."
bad,Not willing to upgrade or repair equipment to ensure quality products.
bad,tire builder of radial truck tires on a machine that was built and used in the plant since open management was college grads hardest part was meeting quota on a bad machine enjoyable was meeting quota
bad,ability to learn lean processes in several departments.  Work hours are not conventional so it allows you to make appointments during typical work hours.  Benefits and pay are great.
bad,"I thought Good Year would be a great place to work. They are so unorganized in our dept. They move us constantly from one machine to another because of lack of stock or the machines,constantly break down. Now there downsizing our dept because the company accumulated so many tires in their warehouse, their moving a lot of us from the RTS dept to other depts."
bad,"Brutal hours, low pay, and loss of hours during the off seasons make this a tough job to sell. Some good things to learn here, but long term its a difficult place to work"
bad,"Dream job turned into nightmare. To be honest the job was ok, the hands on training was not very good! Hurt my back and ended up quitting instead of becoming a liability."
bad,The pay is great was making 28 plus a hour when left but was passed up on strait day jobs by people whose wives or dads were management or HR  and switching back and forth from days to nights every couple days leaves you feeling run over by a truck 19 years and had enough
bad,"Leider wurde unserer Standort trotz schwarzer Zahlen geschlossen."
bad,Empresa com processos bem estruturados. Cultura tradicional.
bad,"unsafe lack of tranning, poor wiring diagrams old out dated equiptment. After two weeks of tranning I was left to work by my self in a dark nasty dangerous place"
bad,My time at goodyear was brief but some things i seen there were very unsafe their lifts were not properly taken care of the would get stuck up in the air with vehicles on them or the locks wouldnt engage properly just scary stuff
bad,"Currently the retail division of Goodyear is disfunctional. There does not seem to be any clear direction on where the executives what to take the company nor do the goals advance a commitment to the consumer. Work-life balance is very hard for salaried management. The job is a 7 days per week and since your home if your office, there is no separation between work and family. Bonus programs are very difficult to achieve. Due to the fact that currently the retail division currently lacks direction, it would be very difficult for me to recommend anyone to come work for the company. I am only speaking for the company-owned retail stores and not for the rest of the divisions with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company."
bad,"when I first came on board to Goodyear, the plan was to learn and grow with the company. I wanted to someday be a store manager. Over the five years, i have been transferred five times. I have been a dedicated employee. However, with veteran store managers leaving the company, the district is in a world of hurt and no one to take charge. I feel that my career with Goodyear is coming to a close. I came into with high hopes. Now, I am seeking other alternative career options."
bad,"Going from a shop where the pace was fast. this shop was too slow, not enough business unless you like oil changes and tire changes. management was very inconsistent and favoritism was shown."
bad,"A typical day at work for a general service tech include a maintenance inspection, oil changes, tire repair, and mounting and balancing of tires."
bad,Got to have thick skin to take on a salesmen position. Work in changing weather and different terrain. You get a crash course on different commercial tires. Management team under pressure due to demands from their superiors. Workplace culture can be negative at times among employees.
bad,"Hired for assistant manager company lost a big customer which was Penkse truck rental, shortly after received a lay off notice. Left me chasing them for over 3 weeks for my 3 days pay, and 1 month to receive cobra insurance which is good."
bad,good place to work if you are a full time employee 25 dollars is not bad espescually in this little town. down fall 12 hour shifts from 7 to 7 rotate shift and you basically get 4 brakes no more than 20 minutes plus your standing all day doing the same thing every single day
bad,Provided good work structure and training. The job was a consultant so I can not provide details. My co-workers were well educated and I enjoyed the experience.
bad,"Being in automotive sales and service is very demanding to begin with.  Throw in a computer program that makes no sense and fights you the whole day with infinite useless keystrokes and company policies that make it next to impossible to help people and you then have an idea of what it is like to work at a Goodyear store."
bad,"Started work on either 8 or 12 hr shift and went about my day, all that mattered was safety, quality and production. I learned how to manage my time effectively. The hardest part of the job was staying motivated when production happened to get low and management would decide to throw the other important factors (Safety, Quality) out the window. The most enjotable part was working in my own space at my own pace, and being able to help and recieve help from co-workers when needed. I also enjoyed  attempting to help devise safter ways to do certain aspects or the job. I don't feel that all management on the floor was bad, but feel they were pressured ito poor decisions from higher ups."
bad,"A typical day at work starts with a safety meeting, followed by a visit, an area manager who complains about everything but does nothing to correct it, spends more time riding around on this bike then doing his job."
bad,"Great job for individuals with short term big goals, however management is inconsistent and industry is very unstable making a long term plans impossible"
bad,Owner of the shop did not want any joking around in the shop while on the clock making for the days to be boring and dragged out longer. cameras in place were also being watched every waking moment making it seem like none of the employees were trusted.
bad,"Get to work around 7am. Complete daily reports, and order inventory.  Help the team service trucks. Once the day is done finish reports and make bank run."
bad,Good place to work. Good people. Learned a lot about powder coating and tire business. Company could have been more responsive to machine maintenance requests
bad,"This is a place where you can’t wait to get in then once you’re in, you want out. The corporate website is very appealing & they make it seem as it’s a great place to work. There’s a huge wall between corporate & ICM. ICM Management is a 2 on a scale of 1-10 & the majority at corporate are stuck up. Managers (most) gossip ALOT and they make it stressful for those who don’t want a part in it. It’s not a respectful work environment. It’s clean when visitors are expected onsite but the place has (huge) roaches. Overall, the place is a mess, unorganized and poor scheduling. They produce more scrap than production. In fact, there’s an employee assigned to that job, each shift. No accountability. Besides that, the pay & benefits are great and if you want to work the OT hours, they’re usually available. I wouldn’t consider this job in the work/life balance category, whatsoever."
bad,"This was a hard company to work for. They expect a lot, and often did not give credit when someone was successful. Instead of celebrating successes, the question was ""Why didn't you do more?"""
bad,It has been way too long a time since working for Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co so there are probably a lot of changes by now. However when working there I did not like the quotas assigned
bad,Purchasing was a great department to start in to learn what it takes before and after the tires are made and sold to the general public.  It was interesting to see what the sales reps went through.
bad,anstrengendes arbeit.mann wird nicht genug gut bezahlt.
bad,Respectful owner. Not enough business to keep running during the time of employment. Fun environment. Not enough business to pay for cost of living even if commission
bad,A typical work day was having to work 12 hour shifts from 7pm to 7am.  The workplace culture wasn’t too bad but management was definitely lacking.  The hardest part of the job was having to throw heavy tires into truck trailers all night into the morning hours while mostly being short handed every night.
bad,Goodyear was a good company to work for over the years that I was there.  Good benefits and training to move up in most locations.  That is all for now
bad,Se aprende mucho pero es un ambiente muy pesado para trabajar y de mucho cuidado por las maquinarias .
bad,Working for Goodyear was a very bad experience for me starting from the slow customer flow to the rude and explosive attitude of the store manager. I intended to work there to expand my knowledge on mechanics and different ideas on how to work on cars but instead sat and waited for the shop to get dirty so i could clean it
bad,"Innosource handled the paperwork for me to work at Goodyear after I retired from Goodyear.  They were not as efficient or as courteous as other contract firms, but by staying on them I managed to keep things straight"
bad,Learn how to turn raw material into rubber. Was able to keep up And maintain production. Excellent forklift operator. Was able to work well with others....
bad,"Empresa em expansão, muito boa bem vista, bem localizada."
bad,"minimum pay, poor work conditions and no concern for employee safety."
bad,Large Corporation.
bad,testing rubber samples from line to see if the batches meet spec.
bad,"It was a good start in the workplace, but not a career that i wanted to pursue."
bad,Due to management a relatively inconsistent place to work.  Scheduling of appointments is very inconsistent from day to day; some days may be back to back appointments whereas others there is a lot of down time.  This creates the general attitude and atmosphere that they are not out for the best interests of their staff and employees.
bad,"dissapointed! , Goodyear turned their back on me after a jobsite accident, even after being a 6 year employee with the organization"
good,I don't have anything good to say about this company other than the fact that one of the co-workers that I worked for was really nice and a good person to work with.
good,"when I first was hired I was told that time off would never be a problem. It was always a problem, even though we had enough people to cover other people positions that had the day off.. Management would always send people home early."
good,the technicians are lazy the manager got investigated and prosecuted for embezzlement and while i was there the most loyal employees got unfair treatment and working conditions
good,"Goodyear plant in Topeka was a very tough and political place.  It was a very tough place to advance, it wasn't what you know but who you knew.  They seem to find the worst people to take over upper management position."
good,"Its a job, Cant say much more than that. "
good,"Working for Goodyear has been a great experience.  However, new management discourages General Technicians and the pay is minimal. Management blames general technicians for everything that goes wrong at the store. There is no team building; no respect shown to General Technicians."
good,"Typical day is clocking in 15 minutes early, walking to job's work station and going to work. You are not special, you are a very replaceable worker. This is especially true if you are a temp worker, Goodyear will most likely fire you for any reason possible, before they have to pay you any benefits. Coworkers are unreliable and useless. Hardest part about the job is standing for 12 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid $9.50/hr and overtime pay weekly."
good,"Empresa agradável de se trabalhar."
good,"Salary does not compensate for duties performed.  Currently, work full time hours at a part time rate."
good,"This job was by far the most stressful. A typical work day had the workers struggling to reach their quota and still being told that they were not doing enough. The machines did not work properly and were constantly needing to be worked on, which hindered reaching the quota."
good,Good people to work with but the owner of the establishment I was working at did not care very much about his employees or therefore the shop. For a young person starting in this field this is a good Foot step .
good,"Long days, no chance of advancement, very much an old boys club.  Late night phone calls, on call on weekends. Scheduled to work weekends for no pay. No balance."
good,Been here too long to walk away but the writing is on the wall so to speak and job security isn’t good right now so I’m looking to see what else is out here
good,Broke my foot on the job an was off because it was broken an was told i could come back but they hired another person to take my place a month after i was off
good,"Cuenta con un buen nombre."
good,"This place is a decent job, if don't mind warehouse work. However, management could be A LOT better!!! Very dishonest and contradictory."
good,"Good place to work, not much time for family or personal things. Team members are great but it is very difficult to take care of anything other than goodyear's business. Mandatory 6-day work weeks make it difficult to have a life or tend to the needs of children. Holidays are mandatory and weekends are mandatory, unless leave is scheduled."
good,"Difficult work place for lean,because senior managers don't change."
good,It is an ok place to work very fast paced. Room for advancement but came to a point where their schedules and my schedule would not work out.. Management is very flexible to a certain degree.
good,Very uninvolved in workforce safety and meeting the needs of employees. Laid off on last minuet notice without the courtesy of a call.
good,the people i worked with made the job fun and exicting and still on a profesinal level
good,I hardly got any raises and no bonus in years. I learned a lot on the job dealing with the public and received a lot of training. The company needs to value retail employees more and pay above minimum wage
good,This company is a good step in the long road in ones career. a good place to get your feet wet and learn new things and be able to perfect ones skills.
good,Rotating shifts are not balanced effectively which can cause health issues later down to road.  Pay is not competitive enough and it takes to long to start making a good wage.
good,Muito boa porem deixar a desejar em alguns aspectos.
good,"Wile working at Goodyear I have learned a lot about how the automotive industry works and runs. I have also learned how to do alignments and breaks. I was hired at Goodyear with almost no prior knowledge of a vehicles steering and suspension components. After working there for almost a year I can say I am very confident in diagnosing steering, suspension, cooling, break, and ac systems."
good,"I wouldn't say that Goodyear is a bad place to work, they pay is reasonable and you are paid a commission on top of a base pay. It just didnt work for me."
good,If you like to work hard and don't mined the heat and the off shift the pay is good. You come to work everyday except Sundays you will do fine. You work together with others to get the job done. Do it right the first time then you don't have to re do it. You care about you product you make and it makes you feel proud and happy to be a part of your product.
good,Management lacks a backbone. Either people get away with anything or they push you until you quit or do something to get fired. I would not recommend this place.
good,"told I was sent home pending review over a tire sale that was made price matching , I'm always been targeted for some odd reason , always being over looked for job advancement , I'm a hard worker I stay late to get the job done , do what ever it takes to make the sae and no I'm being penalized for it"
good,I've been with Goodyear for a while but it was my time to leave. I'm not the quiting type but my manger and I did not see eye to eye with eachother and I thank him for the opportunity he gave me there.
good,Spend a lot of time in meetings and then try to get something done. Any one leaves and it takes months to get another warm body. Nasty dirty place to work very hot in the summer.
good,Management is what made me quit. The manager at the location didn't help within the shop or left her office. The job is a risky career and with having children I wanted to make sure I came home to them every night. You are on the side of the road or interstate at all hours of the day and night. One person not paying attention could end your life.
good,SCL was the licensee of the Goodyear Brand for Footwear.  They were a terribly poor representative of the brand. They provided an inconsistent message to consumers in the end they proved to be a poor picture of the brand.
good,"This was a temp position to be filed while regular employees where on strike, I did not get familiar w/ management nor was I offered any additional employment opportunities"
good,Love my job and everyone that works here. Benefits are not that great nor is the pay. Working with customers to sell service needs and tires is fun and competitive work environment.
good,"In the commercial tire sales position you will be doing B2B sales daily, finding your own tires, going to pick them up and delivering them. Management (in my situation) was micro management. Drive cams in all of the vehicles (hated them) and you will be written up for just about anything as the companies safety officer, your regional manager and store manager all are sent any drive cam recordings. Hit a curb in a drive thru barely at 2 miles an hour while ordering and on the phone and was wriiten up. Overly zealous about safety. They will fire anyone over very little, even if your a devoted and profitable long time employee. Netted (not gross profit) them a million dollars in one year and was written up for lack of production. Co workers for the most part were great folks. Insurance was very good but expensive. You are also restricted to only selling Goodyear products except for OTR and products they don't manufacture. But getting PO'S for outside purchases is a time consuming process. Very corporate."
good,A typical day for me its just like any other day at work which is normal. Unsatisfied with the operation of this particular shop. Nothing against my co workers. There was no controversy between me and my co workers.
good,"A typical work day is replacing and repairing commercial tires. Hardest part of the job is lifting 100+ lbs tires. Management truly has no motivation to make the company stronger, or make the employees happy"
good,"very little training,,no help in doing jobs long hours no breaks . Management did not offer time to do training"
good,Was able to learn a lot from older employees and the head technicians
good,"Managers only get one day off per week"
good,"a typical work day was just diagnosing vehicles that were complaints were placed. Installing new tires, alignments, etc. i learned how to replace engines and transmissions, improved my diagnostic skills and learned how to do alignments while i was there. My management there was decent. It was always a bit hectic due to customers wanting to wait for their vehicles and the manager didn't want them to wait long. The hardest part of my job was probably doing something i felt was something the less experienced employee should have been doing sometimes, but if it needed to be completed it was completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new skills and gaining knowledge that i was weak on. It was a good experience because of the senior guys i got to work with."
good,poor management
good,When I worked at Goodyear I was often misled about positions that were open to me other than a general maintenance technician I had the skill set of a tech and the productivity to
good,"The culture is Hierarchy-based and still behind the times around remote workers"
good,"While it is good pay and benefits, the work culture her is almost impossible. Shift work is difficult with a family, and the company is far from family friendly."
good,Hate working for a place with uncertainty always laying people off  one day you working next they talking about lay-off and leaves you and your family struggling
good,"All they care about is numbers, not employees.  Also they will wait until Thursday afternoon or Friday and tell you that you are working Saturday.  If you have plans, to bad, you will be written up if you dont come in. Also day shift works their 8 hours and go home no matter how far behind they are.  2nd shift comes in and works until the numbers are met.  Even if it takes 10 hours."
good,would not recommend as it was taken over in 2015 by Summitomo Rubber USA and the new owners have a very unorganized with poor communication on key objectives.
good,"Lot of great people working very hard.  Many legacy challenges, taking on too much debt, cripple company's options.  If you can get the right job, you'll have opportunities.  If you get into wrong department you'll be limited."
good,"Pros- great retirement and health benefits. Pay is good also."
good,It was overly competitive. All the good jobs went to the lead automotive technician. I also had to do all the cleaning for the people that were actually making commission. I spent more time on small jobs and had no chance of making commission. I made manny recommendations for repair and almost never got sales.
good,"There was no opportunity for advancement. Training was practically non-existent.  The only training offered was for secretaries, such as Word, Excel, office tools.  Legal training was laughable."
good,"accept for the manager that is was there when i worked there."
good,Overall this was a decent typical sales job. Work like balance was non-existent as the shop was opened on the weekends. Management was unrealistic with the expectations they wanted.
good,"Overall I think my review would be different if my current plant was ran properly.  However right now the mind set at the plant seems to be that no body in management cares about our products, and that makes it hard for anyone else to care."
good,this job was very difficult. had to work 11 hours a day 6 days a week. very good pay because of 25 plus overtime hours. but only having sundays off was exhausting. no social or private life
good,Relentless with job demands to be audit compliant and employee retention. When a good team is developed one of two things happen. Good talent is pulled to a different position at a different location (so called promotion) or they demand lay offs due to the nature of the business.
good,good pay if you fight for it. room for advancement again if you fight for it. run down equipment. i would not recommend working here.
good,overall a good group to work for. Small retail chain owned and operated by a father and son. Learned a lot under the management team.
good,"Micromanaged to he point that it is exhausting.   There is alwaysa report, or meeting or required fleet check or required something that keeps you fro doing your actual job of getting out in the market place and selling something"
good,management needs help very fast and hot industrial environment
good,"Never knew what I would be doing or where I would "
good,"En Goodyear se puede aprender a manejar grupos de personas, se tiene que aprender a se acertivo, dirigir grupos de trabajo, manejar grandes cantidades de dinero."
good,"The manager, just promoted for the last two weeks is not a people person.  He cannot train anyone and makes morral low because of his people skills."
good,Help and assist customers with vehicle repairs and maintenance. Schedule appointments and research parts and labor for repairs. Advice customers why these parts are need and how these parts work on the vehicle
good,"Work with AS400 to review and analyze computer data to ensure productivity of tires. Elected Lead Hand via Union to be responsible for distributing manning accordingly across the department, scheduling vacations, order supplies, payroll of 60 people."
good,"I have learned how to maintain control in an environment that talks change, but continues to perform daily as a nineteenth century business. I have had to develop tough skin working in an union environment with little support from upper management. I believe it has developed into a well rounded leader who can remove his feelings and emotions from managing"
good,"the work/life balance was pretty bad, many were expected to be on call 24/7 even if there was someone else that knew the position and was supposed to be on call. Sick days were discouraged from being taken even if you were sick, and salary employees are not treated very well. Union plants have strange rules when it comes to being paid for overtime, and often if you were salary you were expected to be exempt from overtime. if issues cropped up it was expected to be all hands on deck, even if you had no way of assisting righting whatever was going wrong, and if you weren't chances are coworkers would blame you for the issue or delay in fixing it."
good,Goodyear as a whole was fair company and not bad to work for. The compensation was adequate for the work load. They did provide paid training classes and encourage all employees to attend.
good,It is very unfortunate they put women in charge you don't know much about tires and makes the job really frustrating managers never stay around to answer any questions you need they always off doing something other than staying on task.
good,The company is not able to keep up with the demand due to the poor evaluation on the issues in the plant. Constantly harassing the department that gets their job done but ignores the department where the issue is. Lays off employees to save money but makes it hard to keep up demand.
good,"Was overworked, coworkers were lazy and always complaining of pay. Manager never took action to fix issues, but would throw things around to show dominance. Favoritism was a major play in the shop. While said favorite worker was off using company vehicle and property for personal use and drug deals. Disciplinary action was never taken and said person was available for rehire."
good,Poor management  skills with people. Good pay.bad work environment. Does not provide proper training to complete jobs. All they wont is a body in place and they say be careful and dont get hurt.
good,"Managers pressure you to upsell customers on services that aren't always needed, pay is low compared to similar jobs at other companies. Treated like property and not a person."
good,"A gerência da empresa é muito distante de seus colaborardes, quase impossível contatar o gerente."
good,"In the beginning when was operated as “mom-and-pop”, company was stable. Long term employees in which created long term customers. After was bought out and incorporated a corporate philosophy there was extreme turn over, which created less personable service to customers and slowly clientele started to  diminish. Come Ratterree amongst associates were low, extreme pressure for sales started to set in and created a stressful environment and affected business."
good,"all day any day you would be working on cars but my job was to do the basics oil changes, tire repairs, break and engine and transmission inspections. the management is horrible and very rude. hardest part of the job was making sure that you did everything right with no mistakes"
good,Very hard on your body and long hours on your feet. I do like the feeling of doing a good job on time. I like to know I did the best I could do on my job.
good,"Automotive Diagnostic; Oil & Filter Changing; Tire Mount, Dismount, & Balancing; General Automotive Preventative Maintenance"
good,"poor balance of work and home, poor pay, managers are ok but the day to day operations are not worth the trouble you go through daily basis. stay away"
good,good place to work in other states district manager mismanaged how to promote and reward good numbers only would yell at employees would hire managers from outside company with no qualifications for the position
good,Clock in and communicate with fellow first shift supervisor.relay what jobs are lined up If any... basically clean put away stock tires. Until a truck driver need repair done to their tractor and or trailer
good,"The typical work day at the plant consist of performing a job that no one gets credit for the work that is done, but to get the blame for the downtime that you don't have control over."
good,"Well... It's a cleaning gig. Not much to say. There were basically two divisions: factory cleaning and office cleaning. The regular office cleaners were paid about a dollar above minimum wage. The factory cleaners were ""General Laborers"" and made closer to $9 while I was there. "
good,low pay stressful heap more responsibility on you with no compensation  workers suffer while huge benefits to mgrs no way to get ahead .................
good,I think for the hours and working conditions this job could pay more and all employees should be treated the same. Eight and twelve hour employees should have the same benefits.
good,"the amount of hours worked was not worth the pay.  You do get a lot of overtime. requesting days off was pretty easy.  But for the work load, I think the pay should be a lot higher"
good,"Diverse, challenging work place. Working with well known and respected brands. Good people dedicated to the business. Some potential for promotion. Does not have a work/life balance culture."
good,"Just like any job, if you work hard and stand out amongst your peers, you have opportunities to grow and make more money. Its a rough job but paid better than many other local ones."
good,El liderazgo de la gerencia es impositivo y no colaborador. Solo se exigen resultados sin desarrollo ni capacitacion. No hay entrenamiento. El trato a la gente es hostil.
good,"small shop, needs help selling work and gettting organized. needs tools and equipment fixed and updated. stressful shop, promises more work than possible to get done"
good,"Goodyear Philippines is generally a good company to work for. "
good,"They tell you that you will make a certain amount, only to find out that you're making considerably less.  I was told that I would get a certain % of the amount of work that I put out, but I was never compensated for the work.  Each paycheck was less and less."
good,ok job to work at. Customers keep you on your toes. Phones ring all day long. fun job to work at. Customer problems are not handled in the correct manner.
good,"Compensation package was pretty good, and so was job security. However this job is all consuming.  As a service manager you have no outside life due to working 6 days a week and people calling you constantly on your day off."
good,"Company is beginning to be more stable financially, but cost cutting is still a large part of the corporate strategy.  "
good,I liked this job I just could not physically do it any more. It was very low pay and no benifets for my family.
good,I enjoyed learning the commercial part of the automotive service.
good,Pays well but very poor work environment.  This is a decent starter job.
good,Durant 23 ans j'ai pu m'épanouir dans l'entreprise mais les 5 dernières années furent difficile a vivre avant la fermeture.
good,"Most enjoyable part is my colleagues"
good,"Start @ 7:30 or 8 am depending on time of year."
good,Muy mala empresa no tiene fondo de ahorro  ni comedor  ni seguriad e higiene
good,If you have any issues dont plan on being there long or dont have family issues cause they dont work with you at all horrible company to work for no structure you never know what you will be written up for it changes constantly and you leadership that you do know wont protect you. So
good,People were always cranky an unpleasant to work with. long hours and hard labor. easy to learn any department.
good,"heavy labour dirty work,long hours,and underly payed for the work"
good,"Union City plant closed,but it was a good place to work while I was there"
good,It was always what can you do for me to day.Not how can I help you preform a better job are work safe while doing the job.
good,"Do not expect this company to be on your side! They practice the good ole' boy system and if you aren't in it, you are an outsider! I will never work for a corporate company as an salary employee ever!"
good,"Hours were tough.  The favorites got the early shift and never had to work weekends hardly.  Others had to work until 10pm, 5 days a week and had to be back on Saturday at 4am."
good,Orario di 8/9 ore di lavoro al giorni. Ambiente collaborativo. Difficoltà di aumento salario.
good,When I came to work here it was pretty exciting. But the longer I stayed I saw the real company. Stuff breaks it’s months upon months to get fixed. OSHA would have a field day here. Oil and fuel everywhere all down different drains and now not managed well. They like working their workers to their breaking points and no thanks for hard work.
good,"This job wasn't a good fit for me, nor did the management make ANY effort at trying to make it work. For that reason alone I wouldn't recommend the particular region I worked in. There were some great people working there at a lower level, but the mid to upper management at Goodyear Commercial leave everything to be desired and treated these employees terribly."
good,Like working 11 days plus on call 24/7 this is the place for you. Management does not by in to TPM programs and would rather limp along with a machine working at 10 % than loose a day and get a machine fixed. That is why the entire plant is about to shut down
good,"i liked my job ,but recently bias towards work distribution and little to none management support,physically demanding getting older,hours and benefits good."
good,Great for starting in the industry but not a long term career. Not much in the way of career advancement or opportunity to advance at the particular store. Environment was very cut throat.
good,"Empesa de grande porte com bastante benefícios para o funcionário, porém com desgaste da vida pessoal por fazer turno e folgar de final de semana a cada 42 dias."
good,Good group of co workers. they help one another fairly often. Management is pressured by customers which trickles down on workers. Very high demand for speed.
good,"Too much stress on the ole mighty dollar  weather it was with the management stressing over there job  Ie,,,   managers.  or repairing the shop in a safe manner so the workers are working with safe equipment"
good,"Time management issues of employees, results in poor store performance."
good,"Entreprise d'accueil de mon alternance, j'ai pu découvrir le fonctionnement d'une grosse structure et d'enrichir mes connaissances HSE."
good,"Dirty, hot work environment and long hours.  No room for advancement in the maintenance department.  The parts department is always an issue as we lack parts needed."
good,A dead end job for those working retail.  A lack of seriousness and true career minds.  $20/hr is the highest they pay...heard it right from the manager.  Not a good place for anyone who wants to earn more each year.
good,"The job pays well but the company is only focused on their production not the happiness of workers. Its very hot, hard, and dirty work that can be hard on the body. Shifts are 12 hours and makes living a normal life very difficult as most people are usually placed on a night shift."
good,"Good year was a good place to work,but doesn't have health coverage or 401k and for a shop that works on farm and commercial vehicles the benefits would help"
good,Management needs to work with employees to maintain set schedules. Employees are transferred too often and not given the chance to learn the culture of the environment.
good,overall they pay well however you always feel like your job is on the line. They expect top notch performance and will do everything to ensure it happens. They expect their managers to work open to close everyday and not take days off or take any type of vacations or paid time off. The benefits are good. Standard 401k and insurance costs. They offer all the same things any big box company would. Overall higher managers are a joke. You never see them and don't expect any type of conversation except how to make their jobs easier and how to make sure you are improving performance. They don't like to invest into their own stores and therefore you are stuck working with sub par equipment and trying to command top notch prices.
good,Its a pretty decent company just that the management is more concerned how to save money than make money. Cut hours and don't get help or supplies needed.
good,"Claims Processing"
good,In tremendous transition - not strong change management capabilities at any leadership level. There is little strategic planning capabilities in the HR groups with extends to the rest of the organization.
good,"Things I like about Goodyear:"
good,Es una empresa buena en cuanto a beneficios y salarios como planta pero la empresa externa que presta servicios es mala
good,"No work life balance, overwork salary associates. Expected to give atleast 10hrs per week and then forced overtime and offshift."
good,While working for Goodyear tire company I always felt like a number. It did not seem like a company that you could be more than the job position that you were working at that time.
good,thanks to bill clinton and nafta. goodyear dunlop is now shutdown and making its tires in china and shipping them back to the u.s.  be careful driving on goodyear tires
good,"Typical automotive retail environment, very fast pace and days go by very quick. Love the people I had the opportunity of working with made friendships that will last a lifetime. Also love the relationships that were made with very loyal customers. Hardest part of the job was high turn over of associates, high pressure to make sales and not a good work/life balance.  If you want to make good money and do not want a life, then this is the place for you!"
good,The company provided me with many opportunities to learn new skills and new areas of the business.  I was exposed to a lot of different business units and business functions.
good,L'entreprise a fermé ses portes et s'est délocalisée en Russie.
good,"As a general labourer, it has good benefits package, the drawback is the changing 12-hour shift works. The plus side is that you only have to work 14 days/nights a calendar month (+/- 2). There is no union to protect worker, and HR is very weak in term of protecting the labour force. They act more like a ticket master (for special events or deals) than to address real human resource issues. Mostly, they lean on the employer and management side than the employee side."
good,Company not doing so well so staff cuts always looking to cut cost and people loosing their jobs. This is not any easy business to work with. People push to breaking point.
good,"Total account management for some of the company’s largest tyre retail and wholesale accounts"
good,"I mainly do a lot of preventive mantiance work like brakes, wheelseals and tires and road calls"
good,"A typical day at work was 12 hours of making what you had on hand worked towards the best achieveable goal for that shift.  Main thing I learned was how to improve my people skills, stay controlled, and job plan from hour to hour and day to to day. Management was decent up until a plant manager change in 2013, which is eventually while I left this postion. The co-workers were easily the best part of this job, even though they were union if everyone shared a mutual respect it felt almost like a family from day to day."
good,"Fun place work / beside you get to learn more about diffent makes / modes of cars / trucks / how to change oil them and things to maint. your own car or truck, too"
good,just fixied and change oil and tranmission and change tires and more there where some good people not bad
good,Goodyear does not pay enough to keep good management team members in their unionized manufacturing plants.
good,Tire sales at counter. Customers would only want a vehicle inspection and management would tell them the items failing on the vehicle when it was not true. Could not stand and watch customers getting ripped off for things they do not need. Sad
good,"Goodyear was a very hard working business every day brought new challenges to the table. I learned how to properly perform oil changes,tire repairs and I received my General Service certification also. The management was unfair and disrespectful to the employees throughout the day. The hardest part of the job was upselling products to customers who weren't satisfied with what was found wrong with their vehicle inpection. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the moment I started the day. I have a passion for cars so my job was always a perfect environment for me."
good,10 hr days
good,Lay offs inside the plant with no warning. Forced overtime. Work in not difficult.
good,Must be prepared to work long and hard hours. You can learn a lot. Management not to good. Co-workers got no pride in there work. Hardest part of the work is to work safely because we work with heavy machinery.
good,"12hr days and 12hr nights, As a Goodyear contractor, we worked alongside Goodyear employes, doing the same job. for less than 1/2 the hourly wage."
good,"In der Produktion werden Leute verheizt und halten den Druck nur wenige Jahre, wenn überhaupt aus."
good,Cannot advance within the company. Have to apply separately and search to see if an opening exist. Each position is filled by applications and not given to it employees to advance within the company
good,"Repetitive long nights of strenuous work in hot climates all day long. Very productive, straight business, with 300 degree temperatures with very little help"
good,"Maybe 30 minutes total breaktime in a 12 hour shift, nowhere to sit outside. Discouraged to leave fenced secured area during shift. Great pay and benefits but you earn every dollar."
good,Worked at Goodyear for 5 years and I enjoyed it for the most part. A lot of on the job training and advancement opportunities available. Work/life balance is horrible. I was on call 24/7 and worked every other weekend. Great company to start at fresh out of college. Difficult when you have a family. The pay and benefits are decent.
good,"Safety is talked about but when it comes down to it, production will always win out. They will use PPE or standardwork as a reason for someone being injured. It’s never the resulted of poor maintenance or judgement my management."
good,"It is not the Goodyear from stories we have heard in the past.  It is a place to come for a job, that pays well and has benefits, but not a career unless you have a degree.  Raises are ONLY a ""cost of living"" in the roll that i am in. It would be nice to have stock options or something along the way of performance raises to give the incentive of a career...not just a job."
good,"As with many companies over a long period of time changes occur.  Including the views of the leaders within the company.                        "
good,"The conditions were tough to work in, with extreme the heat and/or cold  and the press to produce more. Management could have been better with people skills, which often caused for frequent turn over."
good,Typical day at work is a 12 hour mandatory shift standing walking pushing carrying tires and material or components to build the tires in a fast pace environment
good,Management is a joke no communication prices are absolutely incredible so no one gets the work done here. Plus having to hustle everything keeps the work from getting done right
good,Empresa com cultura bastante conservadora e associados com muito tempo de casa.
good,"Goodyear is a fast paced environment in automotive but its seems to have the same problem as every other automotive industry ..no one applies, but if someone were to apply they either fail the background check or drugscreen. in general people are hard to replace"
good,"Hard work if you are a hard worker. Like every other business it has a buddy system to get promoted. Higher level management was not really employee interactive, floor managers were mostly ok. It could be ugly when people get frustrated. Clocking in was the hardest part of the job and clocking out was the best part of the day."
good,Vehicles move quickly in and out of this shop. Be prepared to work longer than your shift. You must be able to lift heavy tires and have high endurance.
good,"Expose to dirt and dust but challenging work."
good,"My experience at company headquarters in Akron was great.  It was a lot of hard work, but we all pulled together as a team to get things done.   I worked there for over 20 years."
good,Has a decent work culture.  Pay is ok.  They do have a learning center and offer classes for anyone who wants to take them.  There is some opportunity for advancement.
good,Great place to work in high school. Started out as a lube tech and moved to alignment tech. Management wasn't too bad. Great learning experience for a young mechanic.
good,"I worked 60+ hours per week. Always  met or exceeded AOP, the next year the target was always 10 to 15 percent more than the previous year. Management did not care about work/ life balance."
good,my crews at the stores I worked at were outstanding. even though we had excellent customer csi scores they make decisions based on money not service.closing stores in areas that needed to be there. opening stores in completely saturated markets which failed miserably.
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho"
good,"It is fun working with car and dealing with customer. awesome coworker and nice people to deal with. the shop is nice and clean. "
good,"I worked for 41 years at the tire plant . it was hard work but I made a good living. I then retired when I turned 62. I got along good with "
good,Se gana dinero. Pero esclavisante y bajo mucha presion
good,Working for GPI is stressful because working environment is not conducive to work because top management at that time does not consider fair treatment.
good,a regular work day basically consist of a checking cars in to be serviced. Leaning how to explain different things that needed to be fixed on a customers car. My manger was very helpful and would always give that helping hand when needed. The hardest part about the job getting a customers to have something fixed on they car when they needed it done but didnt have the money for it. The most fun thing about the job was a new craft and able to learn about different types that came into be repaired.
good,lidar com muita pressão. criar alianças profissionais. lidar com diferentes culturas.
good,"Salaire et avantages correctes par rapport à d'autre usines. "
good,Do your job and do it fast. Customers come first and they don't like to wait. Keep your head down and just keep plugging away. Big company means big management.
good,The GM is a great boss but a terrible leader and a weak manager. The work home balance is like this work 5 day work week. on call for the service truck 3 days a week in the shop for 2 days 72 hours on call 16 hours in shop. That is 88 hours of life disrupting time I get scheduled 2 days off but then because we run a skeleton crew I get called in.
good,Great products but poor work environment.  Poor work/life balance based on expectations of leadership.  Exceedingly political environment.  Poor performers protected.
good,My typical day at work would have been by myself. The management fought like little kids. I enjoyed my job just not the management. The people that worked in the back of the shop are the best they worked hard and did what was asked. The management is what is the issue with Goodyear in pooler.
good,Always plenty of overtime. But you will have to be willing to get dirty. Really dirty. I did not mind the dirt so much as I did the rotating shifts. 12 hour shift that alternated between day and night every few days that made you feel like a zombie most of the time.
good,Certified tire is an automotive tire  company with stores all over southern caifornia. It is a business that is constantly growing and trying to take care of their customers as best as possible.
good,"I started here busting tires and doing oil changes. They paid pretty well, though they froze raises for 2 years. The regional managers, auditors, and corporate team absolutely do not care about their store level employees."
good,"open to close almost everyday  six days a week"
good,I really enjoyed the challenge they provided.  The work life balance was horrible.  When I decided it was time to leave I had officially hit 100 hours on a Thursday.   My boss also committed suicide from the stress.
good,This is an ok job if you need a place to work and dont mind sweating all day doing manual labor. Pretty intense work. But they will hire anyone.......
good,I start work and start to organize and help customers with the invoices and what they need done on their trucks and trailers if its mechanical or tires. I also start to see what inventory needs to be stocked and sort invoice and delivery receipts to be filled away. It is a task to get all this done with short staff in the shop but i still work my way around every task to get it completed before the end of the day.
good,upper mgmt. is very unruly. They have no respect for other employees unless you are a brown noser. you have to work weekends and long evening hours.
good,"Management team is not experienced and the union is only out for itself.  Between the constant fighting, work is not done in a proficient way and the place creates lazy and poor work ethics"
good,"Great co-workers but poor management. Very unorganized, no training programs or room for advancement. Plus side get a service truck with fuel card and tools provided."
good,"Overall decent pay for the area, however pay for maintenance has fallen behind other companies for similar skilled craftsmen in a 100 mile radius.  it was initially a well organized factory now it seems less so. My co-workers are great to work with."
good,"Learned how to successfully run a business, manage other people, hiring and training of a successful team, worked hard to bring this location profitable. I traveled to many other locations within this company to help establish new stores opening."
good,"Per quanto riguarda l'ambiente, molto nocivo alla salute, degli operai, ma lo stipendio mensile, abbastanza buono."
good,"I enjoyed working there I just didn't enjoy some of the people I worked with."
good,"I liked the environment, the HR dept was good and very caring, management could have been better. They were understanding of my disability by giving me a stool to sit on when sore, and called every now and then to check on me. The benefits were explained very well and they offered dental and Aflac. The pay was terrible causing me to go elsewhere."
good,Seems like a ok place to work. As with any big company there is alot of red tape and politics. Seems to be more worried about the numbers rather than the future of the company.
good,Managed the front of the store and upsold on all the products. Also provided customers with a detailed report on their car.
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is heavy lifting. I learned a lot about what a tire is made out of and how many different processes you have for one tire.
good,"Het leuke aan de job is dat je zelf je dag kan plannen"
good,"Goodyear retail in the beginning was a good company to work for until i started to see good employees leave because of poor management and lack of promotions. The employees that I worked with over the years are in my opinion  are some of the finest in the business and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job for me is really the management not communicating with the service department because if you have a large job that pays good money, you should not have to be pulled off of the job for a oil change. Really Goodyear is a good place to work if you are new to the automotive industry but is not a place that I would recommend as a career."
good,The company focuses a lot of safety compared to other shops.  Equipment such as lifts are well maintained.  Technician compensation is based on flag therefore it is not easy to make money!  Stay in school!
good,"A Goodyear era uma empresa que renunerava bem e tinha bons beneficios . Mas nao tinha carreira , se vc foi treinado naquilo ia ficar naquilo. E tbem os horarios eram dificeis 6x2 virando turma."
good,"repair equipment,berings,no comunication they closed the door and locked us out, enjoyed the chalange"
good,"I would create and bill medical claims, patient collection, insurance collections, claim denials, patient statements. The hardest part of my job was that I was in charge of 4 different providers accounts and I did not have the help I needed to complete all the task every day,"
good,Busy with minimal wage but very good if first job. You get the opportunity to work with cars and learn if interested.
good,"good place to work"
good,I love doing production work. Management not very supportive.
good,"- Rotinas de análise de projetos de Engenharia Civil, compras em geral, gerenciamento de obras e controles em geral;"
good,I've work for Goodyear for 15yrs it has it's up and downs but over all a good plae to work I want to advance my career and fill I can't do that here.
good,i enjoyed job it is privatley owned owner would make amd change job reqirements to employees without notice
good,"A typical day at work , you can expect it to be very busy. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the heat, it can sometimes reach tempertures of 100+ depending on the department you work in.Co-workers can be very helpful, if your having problems with a machine, or the product. They will try to help you solve a problem that you may be having."
good,"Change tires, oil, check brakes and inspect cars daily and also help maintain the grass on the property."
good,pay is adequate for work performed. Management requires mor oversight. no advancement oppertunities.
good,Over all not a bad place to work - 12hour alternating shifts.....Advancement is slow.....
good,"Managed Aounts Payable & AcountsReceivable, along with accountibilty of inventory, process Payroll, OSHA trainer"
good,ok place to work with good pay. expect the most out of their employees.
good,"i would look further to find a job.the jobs here are not very stable at this time,other plants are striving while this plant is being left behind.Was good for a long period of time then started going down hill and never stopped."
good,"Great place if you're coming from a quick lube or tech school. Learn tires, steering and suspension and lots of alignments. You see all kinds of makes and models"
good,"not enough pay for the type of work, work is dangerous and the pay does not equal the potential hazards of working around semis.  At least 20-25 per hour needed."
good,I had the chance to advance the work load is stressful at times but my teams pulls it out every shift. Room for advancement is based on who you know. The hours are steady and the leadership is changing in the right direction
good,"Shortly said...company has grey goals and morals just doesn’t get carried out and assured it’s handled professionally and properly. Management is lacking innovation and forward thinking in some areas and some are extremely closed minded to their lower employees..customers are willing to pay for quality, as long as quality is actually consistent."
good,It's been a while since I've worked there but it was a good place to work and I would recommend it.  The facilities are nice and new.  Management is interesting.
good,"people were over worked and not treated right, compensation was minimum. coworkers were good and easy to get along with...………………………………………………………………………………………..."
good,Play the game well. I started young and should have received a free education. I waited too long and they no longer paid for school. I finally went to school and try to advance but they hired outside help.
good,"Always understaffed but required to take every customer. Very stressful  environment. Usually a high turnover ratio, constantly training new employees."
good,"Work environment was always hot, fast paced and working alone. Managers form of communication was radios. I learned to keep up with a fast paced environment."
good,"It's just an ok place to work at, some days it works in your favor but most of the time just cleaning up after others. It's the work culture that seems to be the real problem."
good,Good training programs. Travel to manufacturing sites. High level in-house training programs. Mentoring with company gurus. Open office concept is noisy at times but small meeting rooms are usually available for private discussions.
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, sempre auxiliando um ao outro, para assim nos termos um ambiente de trabalho confortável e produtivo."
good,I would like to work with a growing company and a place for moving upmthe ladder. A regular day is making a list of vehicals to change tires work your vehicles for the night finish paperwork that comes with changes. Being in Management was very stressful i was pulled everywhere but i took care of business. The techs out in the field where great i trained them the best way and safely. Hardest part of the job was some people at the locations we worked they where not happy so they took there problems out on our techs.The best part of my job was traveling alot and meeting a hand full of good people.
good,Ovet all I enjoyed my experience st Goidyear.. Corporate  dies not look out  for thrir employees..at all.  Manager's  can not run the shop the way it should.. Give the dm a  week in each shop half the time behind  the counter the other half as a tech...live the  life.
good,"good place to work, I really liked it. I changed oil and tires for a few months and got promoted to sales rep, the big negative is the corporate staff. I was ""let go"" by the company, along with nearly the whole staff, because I had worked with the old store manager who cost the company thousands of dollars. needless to say, I worked with him for only a single month, yet lost my job because of it."
good,"i didnt like the hours, to many low pay. really stressfull and demanding. always giving us more than we could handle. management always onn your back."
good,"If you are willing to work hard without breaks and beat your body up with extremely hard work, you will be paid well have a good benefit package: decent healthcare (BC/BS) good vacation time, holiday pay and sick pay. Management is mediocre company wide, with and huge emphasis on safety and no care at all towards working conditions. Whenever the corporate office makes changes either to commissions  or pay in general it never benefits the employees."
good,"Goodyear is a good company to work for don't get me wrong.  The management where I have worked was constantly changing and I had to wonder what some of top management in the plant brought to the table (with exception of two plant managers (I have had 6 in in 12 years.) and my boss who I have had for 9 of the 12 years there. He will be leaving within 2 years.  Seemed to be a lot of politics at that level with little understanding of the actual process of how to make a tire and the machines that make them.  Nice people but... I am in a strange place in the corporation where there isn't a lot of room for movement.  I am not sure they are an ""if you earn what you make then you will make what you earn company""  They pay pretty well but the hoops you have to go through to get a raise so that your salary matches your performance is daunting and exhausting in my case."
good,"good place to work"
good,Each day was different. Had to work on some real garbage that was brought in. Having to fix other peoples screw ups was no fun. Would hire people without ASE certifications.
good,"Working for Goodyear allowed me to travel, see new places, work in different environments, and above all provide for my family. The work is very physical demanding, and is a great way to stay in shape. The atmosphere was fast paced, and paid well, with monthly bonuses according to how much work you performed the previous month. Must be willing to work days, nights, weekends, and holidays as performing on call work is mandatory."
good,Would recommend this as a place to start out and get your feet wet. Do not intend to make a career here unless you are planning on going into management. Work flow can be scares at times.
good,The pay is good but at what cost! The plant is your home you don’t get to enjoy it much....you’ll miss out on a lot of things due to work and there very strict with giving time off ( even if you have vacation) don’t be a woman and fall pregnant (current situation) they look at you as if you’re useless and treat you like an outcast as if you’re carrying a deadly disease because to them you’re no longer any help to them if you can no longer do the job assigned rather than giving you something else to accommodate your restrictions by your doctor because “ pregnancy isn’t work related we don’t have to accommodate anything”
good,Goodyear provided many opportunities for career training and advancement.   Goodyear was always willing to give the youngest and brightest associates the opportunity and responsibility to grow their career.
good,Empresa com costumes tradicionais e de muita distância entre as hierarquias. Difícil acesso à cargos efetivos por conta de uma estrutura de áreas que faz uso do estagiário como mão de obra barata e sem chance de perspectivas.
good,There is definitely work year round. The only real issues are that theres not very much work advancement and when there is theres not much pay increase.
good,"A typical day was fast paced, I learned how to professionally interact with high end customers."
good,Ask plenty of work/life balance questions in your interview.  It is common to force Area Managers to work up to 80-90 hour per week.  They cap your overtime pay at much less than time and a half.
good,"manage day to day operation of a retail location selling tires and automotive services. including scheduling, guest care, business to business and sales"
good,Not the best of working conditions but pays well. Good co workers but most of the upper management were unapproachable. Long hours with plenty of overtime available.
good,"Intensidad y siempre mucho trabajo. Una empresa tradicional en un mercado dificil que supo reinventarse para seguir compitiendo y liderando el mercado. Exige sacrificios personales; posee una cultura en la cual se valora la productividad, organización y transparencia. Este último gran pilar de la organización que junto a la ética, su robusto gobierno corporativo y su estrategia financiera soportan parte del éxito de la Compañía. Aprendí a ser un lider, resolver problemas, tomar decisiones, cumplir objetivos siempre a partir de hacer lo correcto y todo el adiestramiento técnico necesario para ser un muy buen profesional. Una gran escuela y familia."
good,Bonne entreprise...horaires salaire travail équipe
good,typcial day isnt to consistant. always something different. the pay is piece work pay and work gets slow a lot. sometimes gets difficult since its not a consistant pay each week. always varies
good,"Hot work."
good,"The pay and benefits are probably the best thing about goodyear other than that it's not very rewarding, hard to move up unless you have a degree and they treat you like your just a number out there."
good,"This isn't a job you take and think ""I'm going to move up in the company and make something of my life!"". This is the job you take and think, ""This is my life now. 12 hours a day, forever."" it's hot, it's dirty and even if you get promoted it's just to another hot dirty job. if you stick it out long enough, you get to work in the office, which is just hot."
good,"I love cars, i learned a lot working here. not only do u learn about cars and its problems and how to deal with them but u learn a lot about people. what pushes people to their limits what makes people tick. most mechanics i've met are quite miserable, no different than this place but being human we must learn to keep ourselves entertained which is exactly what this place is good at doing."
good,This is a fast pace job. The work is intense and very matriculate. The jobs were very dedicated and l like the jobs that I did perform. The work hours were very long and hard. The eight hour shifts were okay. Sometimes we had to work 12 to 16 hour shifts.
good,Daily inspecting and handling of numerous tires that require close inspection and attention to detail. The management is one of profession thats to be emulated.
good,"Learning an abundance of new information was a definite pro.  Some of the attitudes of co-workers was hide bound, and backward."
good,"Good work environment, "
good,"Employees and management changes very frequently; whether they get fired, transferred, or acquire a new job they don't seem to stay here very long."
good,This is a good company for managers to start at to get a broad education on how things are done.  It is not a place for those who are faint at heart.
good,Wasn't a bad place to work for the pay but the management really needs an overhaul as they focus on numbers more then quality of there tires. I hope it changes but wont hold my breath
good,The hardest part of this job was trying to work as a team in the common goal to achieve the numbers. What I loved the most about this job was the different walks of life I was able to come across. Great job with great benefits but definitely long hours
good,"You work 5.5 to 6 days per week.  Highly sales driven.  Long days for the pay.  Good compensation package, but you definitely work for it.  Room for advancement is not there.  Their bonus structure is horrible."
good,"mise à jour sur odinateur avec un logiciel propre à l'usine des fiches de sécurités de tout les produits nouveaux ou ayant plus de 2 ans ensuite imprimer et garder une copie dans nos fichiers et une copie à l'infirmerie pour savoir quoi faire en cas d'accidents diverses."
good,"Fabrika ortamı stres yapar, bunu yönetebilirseniz, kendinize ve çevrenize iyi davranır, güzel görünürsünüz..."
good,Culture at Goodyear is to work many hours doing non-value adding tasks.  These consume a lot of the work week.  Lots of time putting out fires instead of preventing them. Stuck in old ways and very slow to change old habits that don't apply in the current business environment.
good,The pay here was decent however the tirefloors were not very female friendly
good,"this job has given me a lot a knowledge on working with varies types of vehicles. a typical day at work is starting a 8am opening the shop getting everything ready for our customers, when there is a ticket on the hook make sure it is broth in check what is in for then proceed to take the wheels off , check the break specs and the hole car.recommend whatever it needs to the sales men and wait to see if the job got sold."
good,Semi-comfortable conditions / Not much room for advancement / Pay sustainable for cost of living / Unionized / Great employee atmosphere.
good,"You will be bored to death here, however, there was no real pressure to be busy. Prices are crazy so its impossible to sell a job unless its a fleet vehicle. 30 hour weekly salary."
good,I would cut steel breaker for consumer tiers and build moto tiers for motor cycles and drive fork lift when needed to move stock to unload and load machine as needed for the job and would use hand jack as well
good,Great opportunity to learn different skills in numerous areas.
good,"I learned alot about customer service, and liaising with other managers and departments. "
good,"Went to work at 7am to 10am during votech class two times a week. Worked on recycle flyers for the plant. Went to meetings, walked on the floor where they build the tires and the production.  "
good,"good place to work and mostly great people to work with"
good,"Extremely dirty air, hard to breath black carbon dust and all of the chemicals in the air."
good,"Enjoyed the experience, whiched it would've lasted longer and been more stable"
good,"nice, easy work days with great breaks and good pay, it healped me learn a well ballanced procedure for preventive maintenance on vehicles."
good,Goodyear is a fairly company to work for even to the point of considering retirement.
good,"It is a job that I enjoy doing as I enjoy working on vehicles, however I feel that the compensation could be a lot better and there is no real job security and advancement/rewards aren't really thought much of."
good,"Building green tires, according to specs and tolerances, so I can build the best tires for cars and trucks. I learned how tires first start at the mixing compound area to the finished product as they are loaded on trucks. Quality of each tire must be inspected during each process. Do it right the first time. Do whatever it takes to get the job done."
good,Good benefits. Shift work wears on a person after a while. I had good managers while I was there. Most employees were easy to work with.
good,Very physical and demanding. Great salary but benefits could stand to be better. Job security is okay but its very demanding on your outside life.
good,"Cheerful place to work, always had a smile, typical day included answering emails and the telephone, dealing with HR issues, updating database systems. As this was my first job in an office, I learned a lot about professionalism, honesty, integrity, HR Procedures, HR issues and computers. I enjoyed working in the HR department as it was a very relaxed environment, i got on with everybody very well including managers, I found it very easy to fit in. The hardest part of the job with dealing wit disciplinaries.The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles on everybody faces knowing that I had made a difference."
good,"A typical day consist of arriving at work at 530AM and leaving the plant, on most days around 5PM. I have learned how very important it is to listen to and involve associates at floor level in resolving problems and improving. Management is moving the company in profitable directions as of late. Many of coworkers are engaged and work well together. The hardest part of the job is balancing floor time with meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team of people for common goals and objectives."
good,"It was hot and noisy with alot of good people to work with. A typical day at work meant working hard with little else to focus on. Learned how to build tires and had the opprotunity to see other parts of the production process. Management were descent people to work for. My co-workers were great people, really enjoyed them. Hardest part of the job was making production numbers. Most enjoyable part of the job knowing that quality products were produced locally."
good,"Hired as a secretary through a staffing agency. Goodyear as a company with their benefits and pay being great. The staffing agency, not so much. They harass their employees about minor items and give no leeway as far as illness, appointments or anything that might come up in normal day to day life."
good,"Management needs to be and have improvement's, safety concern needs improvement, safety issues and management issues needs improvement. Good people coworkers"
good,"Ingresas cómo aprendiz, después de un año continuas cómo man power, es muy complicado pasar a la plantilla de la empresa."
good,"Typical big company feel with a lot of established processes and red tape. If you're looking for a steady 40 hour job, this is a great option for you. If you like to be challenged and work with other highly motivated individuals, you might be frustrated with the culture and have difficulty finding a role that gives you access to like-minded employees."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo generado por los colaboradores
good,Es buena empresa pero las posibilidades de quedar fijo  son muy pocas
good,"This is a good place of work if you are comfortable with 12 hour shifts."
good,Goodyear is beneficial financially and benefits. The shift and work environment is not the best for a single parent.  Benefits are A1 and compensation is about the best in the area. I would recommend Goodyear for a male or a female that has adult kids and doesn’t have a lot of other responsibilities to deal with.
good,Feel pressure to sell unnecessary work. I was given work hours that put me at a disadvantage for flat rate pay system. Lack of communication and feedback with management.
good,It provides a lot of hours and it is a decent job. They provide good training and reasonable break and lunch times. They do lack growth within the company.
good,Union and company could never find common ground. Goodyear leadership is very lacking from the very top down. Did very little to maintain equipment which caused high levels of scrap.
good,"your day to day actions can and will change, you learn more every day whether you try to or not just because how often you are doing and learning new things"
good,Worked for the company for three years.  Had to work through chymo therapy when I was dealing with cancer.  spent more time at work working alone then at home with the family.  Pay was ok.  but not enough to live on unless you worked a lot of over time.
good,i worked here for 2 months and didnt like the job because they were short of work and always ask us for vto. we couldnt get our hours and the location was on the other side of town.
good,Goodyear is a good place to work because the pay and insurance are good but the long twelve hours three day weekend I did not like.  It is a dirty and loud place to work
good,Goodyear is a great entry level position for individuals just getting into the mechanical field. Goodyear West Memphis has a manager that knows his stuff.
good,This place is fast paced and a lot of paperwork. Everything needs to be in order and the details needed to be handled correctly and in compliance with company charters well as state regulations.
good,Not sure why I would have to rate this compny for you. When I worked there it was fine. Fine.Fine.Fine.Fine.Fine. It was challenging at times but very rewarding.
good,"Twelve hours per day is your shift.  The days off are well appreciated. If you are a contractor, some permanent workers treat you differently as though you are beneath them."
good,The job can be demanding and put some wear and tear on your body. I enjoyed the celebrations that we had. Good people to meet but some management acted like they could care less about you. They just wanted to reach their quota.
good,"Goodyear is a 100 year old company and acts like it. Very slow, full of processes that haven't been updated and people that have been around for 30+ years. Needs to take a hard look at its culture in order to stay relevant. Leadership lacks strategy for the future."
good,"It was a great place to work on your abs.  Lots of swinging of hammers and flipping tires.  Dusty, cold environment.  Low pay.  Great place if you enjoy the smell of burning rubber."
good,"Nice place to work with plenty of opportunities to learn and for self development,but need some changes in work culture and work life balance,Good place to work for freshers"
good,"tire replace, cooling flush. 4wheel alignment , brake system inspection, replace water pump. timing belt replace, all drive belt replace ,oil change , mileage management"
good,"⦁	Examine vehicles, compile estimates of repair costs, and secure customers’ approval to perform repairs"
good,"I'm perfectly fine with the people I work with and the job that I do, but I'm certain that we would be paid more if we worked in Akron, OH. I work in a call center at Inktel, which is a call center that offers customer service representative positions for companies like Goodyear, Wal-Mart, etc."
good,"Good people, decent benefits, but man, you had better really have some strong connections when you get a job in the commercial tire industry. It's an old boy's club, and the kids aren't all welcome."
good,Didn't work long enough to offer any input here.  But I have to type something so I am going to rattle on about nothing to meet the character quota that I have to have
good,"It's ok for what it is, as long as you do what you need to do you will be fine. You stay focused and continue on, you will receive incentives that will make your experience enjoyable."
good,"Overall good company. Good supportive people. Lack of systematic working, hence more fire fighting for Engineering, Production people. But it si improving day by day."
good,"This company had a long hours, no flexible hours, this company was sold to a new owner, it went under with the new owner and is no longer in business."
good,"Completely falsely advertised the position worked.  Delayed the start dates for contractors twice.  Excellent building to work in, and the gym and cafeteria are second to none."
good,working at just tires taught me alot to where i can take my knowledge any where i work. The different types of cars gave me an example of what to look for when diagnosing a vehicle.
good,"good start for college grad for learning about automotive, depending on which location to work, business can be good or bad, management is fair and understandable"
good,open close  6 days for years  have done it all ..head mech/ sales// manager. problem solver...  did what ever needed done   ran 11  people..  ran tight shop..  etc...
good,"Management really needs to focus on mentoring and developing Associates from within."
good,"I started at the bottom then was trained and promoted.  The pay was about average, but the benefits were great. The company is good to work for.  I would recommend them as a place to start."
good,La experiencia alli fue buena para mi y para mi CV
good,I would show up for work to a over booked schedule and a boss complainant that we are be hind just to rush as fast as the shop could then not have a shop manager that was not smart enough to deal with simple problems when they occurred.
good,"Empresa que fez parte da minha historia, minha experiencia."
good,As a manager here it was tough.  A union environment is not for everyone but it was one of the reasons my salary was so good.  Lack of trust would be the biggest issue I could see between management and hourly employees
good,"I was 19 or so and excited to start a job that had great benefits, but I didnt enjoy the walking 20 miles a day or the hour drive i had to get to work. It just didnt work out. Would give it a chance again now that I am older."
good,"I really enjoyed the time I had there, but at the age of 25, it gave me hypertension. Stress level to perform was extremely high. Left for less stressful career, and one with advancement opportunities."
good,"It's a job; good days & bad days.  Warehouse manager a good guy.  The office employees can be ""trying"" at times.  Have to use your own cell phone, GPS."
good,Company needs better leadership and a proper training program.Communication is lacking very much and no one takes accountability for the obvious problems .
good,"i open the store 30 minutes before ,make coffee ,clean the costumer area , bathroom ,cheek all invoices for the last day ,emails, pay roll .cheek the hours, "
good,For A While It Was A Wonderful Exciting Place To Work But Eventually It Got Tiring Working 12 Hour Shifts Back To Back It Became Completely Exhausting Not To Mention The Pay Was Eye Popping And It Put The Icing On The Cake For Me And Made It Easier For Me To Leave
good,"Rather than strategy it relies on day-to-day sales tactics. hence, it is a good place who loves sales. However, for those who like to think strategically may not be the place. Also, marketing and sales organization extremely male dominant environment."
good,"Facility is very hot. There seems to be challenges working in this labor environment, and perhaps challenges between the workers and the management.  Weird day nigh shifts"
good,I worked the front counter selling tires and service to the general public.  I worked in service department helping change tires on occasion when it was busy.  This was my first job out of college.
good,Base pay did not justify time put in. Goodyear tire and rubber co seemed to care about tires then about the retail stores. Marketing for the stores was next to nothing.
good,It’s an okay place to work. During the winter it’s brutal having to go outside so much. Management is easily stressed out. But otherwise it isn’t all that bad.
good,I didn't mind working there to get payed well to do tires and oil but the shop manager just had it out for me and really everyone she made it unpleasant to work there.
good,Sometimes the work could be a bit stressful seeing that the manager expected you to learn an entirely new computer system in a matter of days. Could have been a bit easier on that aspect.
good,Enjoy working with fellow employees.  A challenge at times to get parts delivered on a timely fashion.  Changing hours hard to get used to.  Customers are always an adventure.
good,Great starting point for someone interested in a career in sales but slow moving and the position goes almost un-monitored. If you want to be successful you have to be really good at self promotion. Management is always shuffling and politics seem to ruin a lot of opportunity for field associates. Numbers don't play much of a role in promotion. Advancement almost entirely based on whether or not upper management likes you.
good,horaire de 12 heures difficiles et ambiance de travail correct.
good,"Open 7 days a week. Which I hated, but good sales every month on specific items. Manager was awesome. District Manager was awful. Specific store was in horrible location. Machines outdated"
good,typical day included starting the day with a morning meeting very fast paced loved the fact that it was in town wasn't able to advance due to goodyear closing down without any notice 2 weeks before christmas.
good,"its ok to start off with, they do not want people to advance there because then they would have to pay them more, coworkers were great, manager was a shut-in but he was ok"
good,A great place to work with great benefits but the travel has become too burdensome on my family life.  This is a  good opportunity for a single person.
good,Ok place to work. Fast paced production facility. You can advance if you have college degrees. Pay is good and benefits are good. Family is an important aspect of the company.
good,"Started there as a tire and oil change person. After about a year, was transferred to to a service position with pay increase. Stayed there several years and only left cause I moved away from the area."
good,The company has a lot of long term  benefits  the hours don't match the business flow. Holiday hours are really unnecessary. The good far outweighs the bad however and the pay is great
good,"I had some issues to come up medically, and the doctor that I was going to decided to lie concerning my case. He was a goodyear doctor, I did not go to him as a goodyear employee and he was the main cause of me losing of my job. Then he would not see me as a patience anymore. The union did not looking out for me as they should have a fought more. It was easier to let me go."
good,"New store with no market share and immense competion. I hope all that still work there have a proporous future. I drove way too many miles and my hands got seriously dirty, not my style."
good,overall good company to work for it was a learning experience about the automotive industry. management was always on top of taking care of there workers and customers always going above standards.
good,Good place to work managers are very flexible got a lot of good benefits. Depend were is the store the pay is going to variable for a lot. But shop are small shops but are very competitive.
good,"- travail sur ses projets avec entre-coupage de réunions multi-services (projets en cours ou futurs, revu de direction, sécurité, qualité, environnement, budget, progammation des arrêts généraux annuels maintenance usines;"
good,"great place to learn what you will use the rest of your mechanic life. changing tires, balancing tires, paper work. alignments,"
good,"Goodyear isn't to bad to work for. My only complaint about Goodyear, really isn't about Goodyear. Its management. Their management staff are more worried about making the company money than they are worried about keeping staff. When I left Goodyear, I called the management staff out on several issues in a store meeting. When I submitted my 2 weeks notice of resignation, 4/5 others did so as well."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and what I did for the most part. It is very hard to be successful at times because their products, and especially service costs, are so much higher than their competitors."
good,"Out of everybody at my shop, the store manager cares the least. He openly complains when phones ring or customers come in. His goal is to spend every day quietly in his office with the lights off. Service managers are great, guys in the shop are knowledgeable. Store manager is sinking the whole place."
good,I like that my co-workers are willing to help with whatever is necessary. My typical day is watching the PLC programs and adjusting as necessary. Occasionally I have to go work on the machines.
good,Goodyear has made it possible for me to raise my children and to provide them with the things they wanted and needed in life. I enjoyed working there.
good,Ich habe Täglich neue Erfahrungen gemacht und wurde zu einer guten Arbeitskraft der Beruf machte mir sehr spaß.
good,Great place for a paycheck but very unsafe work environment. There is no chance for advancement at all because of upper management.
good,"Good Job For Beginers, or working in college but wouldn't recommend full time but its really depends on your skill set and knowledge."
good,Listen to complaints about other employees and management. sat in meeting with supervisors about said problems or disputes. ran weekly meeting with chief steward from the main plant.
good,"it was very hot and also long hours, no chance in improving or promiton. over all its hard labor. not paid enough.i wouldnt work thers again"
good,Responsible for pms and maintenance on many different makes and models of cars and trucks. Also assisted in inventory control and service management.  also completed maintenance services on fleet vehicles.
good,got to see and work on all kinds of cars exotic and classics diesel cars and trucks good work enviorment friendly coworkers
good,managers looked to creat issues with one another instead of team building profits dropped for the store and people left seeking better options
good,"How much can I say about factory that is good..honestly not much, working 12 hour night shifts not gonna lie really sucks, but it is my first and only job so I am not gonna complain much. The people I met working there were great and some I call close friends. Its a good environment just lots of hard nights.They go out of there way to push safety that way everyone comes home with all there limbs attached."
good,"It was a great place to work with a good clientele, not really enough room for growth, long hours, not great compensation."
good,I can get along with pretty much anyone and this company just wasn't the job I wanted but still a god experience I learned a lot.
good,Buena empresa con buenos beneficios pero diferencia y malos ambientes por la cantidad de gente que trabaja
good,"Great team effort in all aspects of the day to day from initial ticket write up to the time the customer leaves. nothing difficult here, just keep up with your P&L statements,account payables and receivables."
good,this company would see benifits from a better organization echelon. the hands on experience is adequate. there is a lot of question in most policies though.
good,"•	Provided customer service requests for maintenance of the Corporate Headquarters."
good,"llegaba directamente a trabajar, a la hora de comida descanzaba poco y despues seguir trabajando"
good,"This is a good job for a starting Technician, but depending on which Goodyear you go to it may be harder at some places to advance then others. Also be prepared to frequently work hours that you'd rather not work (11 hour Saturday's, at least where I worked) and holiday's (Christmas Eve, Thanksgiving, 4th of July, ext.)."
good,the management was the problem was always over my shoulder was not use to it i had no good days i was the only one in the shop but it was mechanic work my passion so i went with pay was great thats what i enjoyed
good,Great people to work with.  Plant was under very poor operations manager.  I had all the duties of a plant controller but the company would not give me that title for the lack of a 4 year degree.
good,This company was all about work no fun no playing around. You could say there all about the dollar bill maybe too much. They didn't treat there customers fairly only wanted to make money any how.
good,"Great environment.  Wealth of information available via the sales network and continuous training opportunity.  A typical work day includes meeting with clients to assess their needs.  There is no micro-managing bosses hounding employees, salesman have autonomy to create their work day."
good,I learned a lot of maintenance skills from this position.  This job is where I learned most of what I know and I was able to take that to build upon.
good,"The shop i worked at was pretty good the other employees were pretty cool to work with good people."
good,"Good Job and Good schedule, Warehouse closed due to competitors."
good,This was a place I truly enjoyed going to everyday. We were like family and worked very well together. We were bought out by our competitor which is why i'm unemployed.
good,"-Good management "
good,company is ok.  job is terrible.  the hours deeply affect your family life
good,Very Labor intensive heavy manufacturing environment. Technology used is a mix of low tech and high tech processes.
good,Dealing with employee issues over the telephone. Good cafe. Co-workers fun and hard working.
good,they take in jobs even when we don't have proper tools for the job and we get in trouble when the job takes longer because of not having the proper tools
good,"Empresa para desarrollarse profesionalmente."
good,"building tires, 12 hours rotation shifts, helpful coworkers, handle heavy equipment, good pay and benefits"
good,I learned to inspect to trim tires.  I helped train new inspectors.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"the day start of by opening the shop then waiting for the service writers to hang the tickes on the hooks so we can pull the cars in . uppon pulling the cars in the inspection begings , start by checking the tires for any nails ,then the breaks for wear , then the engine comparment along with the service writer so we can get a solid pma sheat."
good,"•	Handled incoming calls to receive quotes on tires and repairs"
good,"Oil changes, transmission fluid changes, checking all fluids, tire installations, stocking tires, filling out repair "
good,"fast paced environment"
good,This job was very interesting and i worked with alot of good people and i learnt a few good skills..
good,12 hours shift very dirty job not good management small break room for such a large plant
good,I enjoyed the learning experience but these types of places limit your potential.
good,"Afwisselend werk"
good,good place to start and get your feet wet in a career. Much room for advancement
good,I had a very good and professional manager he was very young but very mature always ready to teach and understand.
good,"Global operations, legacy product line, sizable matrix organization."
good,Working at a corporate location it was a well-maintained shop with a great crew.
good,Very hard work to loading big tyres and unloading from container very hard to work for this company but say is just work
good,"A Goodyear é uma boa empresa para carreira profissional, tem oportunidades em diversas áreas, e possui um padrão americano em processos e procedimentos, que em alguns pontos facilita em outro burocratiza."
good,"Great expiernce for as auto. Learning the system and making sure payroll was on time, which is very important."
good,good company to work for - can move within the business to different departments and feel like it's a new job.
good,I used to check on the timing and issues with daily shipments. At the end of the day I had to produce reports on transport preformances and assist the area menager with every possible issue. The team mates are not very close but I learned a lot from every one of them. The part of the job I preferred was the visits to the warehouses when we had to discuss new transport services or check the inventory.
good,"When I worked there, things were dirty in the 850 unit, and there was a lot of conditions that could have used a lot of improvement. I have heard from others it is way better to work for now that when I was there, and I believe it. Wouldn't mind going back, as long as I don't have to get around the 'hot boxes' again."
good,"Detailed auto inspections, tire mounting and dismounting and oil changes, with the occasional brake jobs, coolant flush, and misc parts installs."
good,Fast pace working environment where upper management should be improved (Good Old Boy System). No respect shown to Area Managers (Supervisors). Compensation is pretty good for the location.
good,"Some days were good,but some days were slow. The coworkers were all good people,helpful, and knowlegable."
good,"Open ,close, bank deposits, greet customes, phone skills,Keep a clean and safe place to work. scheduling, computer skills,inventory,"
good,Es un buen ambiente de trabajo pero es una empresa en la que no tendré crecimiento a futuro.
good,The days are long and there are no dull moments. Fast paced work environment and areas of opportunity with providing employees with work/life balance.
good,"I really enjoy going to work here every day, although it's non-stop. The co-workers and customer interactions really get you through that; those people help make it fun. My manager is fair & generous. I learn more and more daily about sense of urgency and pass this along to my employees. I really enjoy it when current customers tell new ones to stop in and see us because we do nice work & then we help them."
good,this was a great learning experience being a mechanic helper i learned everyday making repairs on automoiles
good,Detail cars. Learned how to bill out customer work orders. Tire changes. Manager was friendly and generous. Co workers were nice people.
good,"Small office, with high demands on accuracy and accountability. Demands that workers are always on their toes and produce and put all their effort into everything they do."
good,They could use some hindsight in the fact that while there I saw more waste of product and more pushing to meet a quota then to make a perfect product. They care more about if you are standing around when the machine breaks down than the fact that the machine broke down for the third time that night. With a little more thought into the mechanics of how to operate things more smoothly and more effort for perfect tires then they would have less waste.
good,Would have liked the plant to have stayed in Union City. Enjoyed having good benifits. They have a great insurance program. Enjoyed working in the Creel room. I liked havig every other weekend off to spend with the family.
good,Really great people to work with
good,I work for goodyear for 2 years . Good place to work very Family oriented.
good,The typical workday begins with a meeting every morning to communicate any issues that may have arisen during the previous shift.
good,help the purchasing manager on a daily bases with various assignments - from calling vendors to setting up spreadsheets and faxing out PO's
good,lost job to overseas production maybe they can see that we need jobs here to buy tires
good,"work opportunities are good for advancement and pay raises. Must not be too bad of a place to work, I was there off and on for 18 years! Once in a while, you get some trying managers, but not often. That's something you take a chance on anywhere!"
good,Too many hands in the cookie jar. Used to make good money. Now anyone can take service work and there’s no way to make hours. Current management is awesome. Just overloaded with “techs.”
good,A very good employer looked after me well was very leniant with me gave me the chance to further my career helped me to learn more about cars and changing tyres
good,Insane work goals are given without the proper tools to be successful. Management doesn't set clear objectives and their is high salary turnover. People are promoted within the company without the required educational degree.
good,"	Implementation of NFPA 70e, develop and implement Lockout Program, including extensive LOTO training"
good,"They like to have meetings and believe that they are accomplishing something. "
good,"Not much room for advancement, management not cooperative nor responsive to suggestions . The people are great,good benefits,stressful at times ,but tolerable."
good,"Empresa muito boa para se aprender a trabalhar, foco nos resultados."
good,", My average day was from 8 to 12 hours a day and 16  on weekends. Management was not very helpful and I learned that the pay was more than average,, GREAT benefits and pay,, I did not enjoy how NASTY the work place was, everyday was different,, I worked in extreme conditions and made everyday what it was,, MY families lifestyles."
good,"Like many positions that interface with high level customers, there is not a typical day.  The management and job culture strives to perform ethical and ""do the right thing"".  These values are paramount to me and ethics are a driving force in my professional and personal life.  The hardest part of my job is also one of the most enjoyable parts of my job.  The fast paced and quick changing environment is very fulfilling and infuses variety into every workday."
good,Goodyear was a good learning experience.  Talk about being thrown to the wolves.  I knew nothing about selling tactics or even how to start.  Goodyear had several ways to learn.  They had flip charts showing you what to talk about.  How to learn about the products and just what to recommend  to the customer for his needs.  One day I walked in and felt like a true professional.  My first tire sale was to a gentleman and I sold him 5 new tires.  All the people ask me why I sold him 5 tires.  First of all I didn't know any different and second of all why not!  They all said usually they save the best of the old tires for the spare.  My customer was happy buying a new one.  Anyway Goodyear was a good company from the standpoint of learning some good and some bad.
good,This is a great place to start you career off and get your foot in the door. It was laid back until right before winter and right after winter for tires.
good,Everyday we had work from oil changes to changing brakes car alignments change tires as well and the bosses all down to earth. They understand the job field
good,"Overall experience was good.   All positions were very challenging and each job was proved with hard and dedicated work.   Benefits were good and appealing and honored to received.  Awards earned . Over time, there were a lot of lay offs.  Happy to have been able to retire and pursue other interests in recent years."
good,"All corporate avenues we open and easy to navigate. Policies were clear, concise and consistent. The hierarchy was clearly laid out, as well as paths to professional growth. Scheduling is consistent and flexible within reason. Unfortunately, management consistently presented themselves and requests with the authority of a ""boss"", as opposed to the encouragement of a leader. This approach often caused tension and a low moral."
good,"12 hour shift on a continuous schedule. "
good,"The cure area for curing hose is very hot and extrudes a lot of steam, chemical vapors and smog. It takes a lot of stamina, strength and know-how to do this job. Fellow workers made the best of this dirty job and together we got it done."
good,This is a very good company but it is very corporate and there is a huge disconnect between the corporate office and the field. I've learned a lot about the tire industry and the commercial truck/construction industries. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with a variety of different people and companies.
good,Good place to work to provide financially for your family. Great benefits. Didn't like some of the shift requirements. Didn't agree with the closure of this location.
good,"You will work at least 40 hours a week. Pay is not too bad, not really enough to survive on but good. Environment in the shop depends on the employees, could be good or bad."
good,Tons of basic training.  Tons of corporate training regardless of age or experience.  People are  friendly but not very open or inviting.  Great parking and amenities.  Good food.
good,Local Steel Workers Union too influential in mid-management day to day business. Restricted supervisor involvement in scheduling and personnel management.
good,Working directly with an owner of multiple locations is an excellent way to advance in this business and has been a pleasure. Being surrounded by skilled high level technicians has also been a blessing. Working 65 to 70 hours a week has been a burden on my quality of life and family life.
good,"Goodyear's main issue is the pace in which its culture operates. Unfortunately, Goodyear's legally conservative culture doesn't allow it to do anything creative. Additionally, this legally conservative culture slows down business to a grinding halt. It took 4 months to get the Goodyear legal department to approve a simple license order for a $25k MR project. Not only did it not meet the business' needs in time, but it soured a relationship with a great supplier."
good,very little organization treatment can be improved far too often are reliable technicians ridiculed and looked down apon for no reason at all or fired for no reason. management in some stores need to be overseen more often and input for improvement should be taken into account from all employees
good,"Goodyear has a very strong brand name, however the tire industry is not one to attract a lot of excitement.  The facilities are large, dirty and built in isolated locations.  Most are 24-7 operations that negatively impact any work/life balance."
good,"learned mostly automotive skills and customer service, never had any problems with management or other co-workers, great place to get started in the automotive industry. A typical work day was busy, always lots to do and never really slow."
good,very busy and was tiring learned some of what i wanted to learn but didn't learn the rest.
good,"Its a good company and good facilities, but the pay scales and the benefits need work"
good,"The money is extremely good. However, there is a lot of work place drama. Not much teamwork in some departments. The hours are very long depending on shift and department. This is a rubber plant so do not expect to leave clean if you don't shower first. The benefits are amazing and it is a union job. The work is very hard but the pay makes up for that."
good,Trabalhar com diversos tipos de pessoas; Aquisição de flexibilidade.
good,It' is a very enjoyable place to work. Friendly people. I have learned alot about working on car and you will alway learn something new everyday.
good,Good company to work for.  Job Security and lots of mandatory overtime to work.
good,I love the people I work with. Couldn't ask for a better second family. The work is fast paced if everything runs right. Lots of stock and machinery issues and management doesn't seem to know how to control any of it.
good,I get pretty dirty every day bc of the chemicals used to make rubber.
good,just like the title says they pay really well but don't know how to train managers.
good,"Provided application administration including security monitoring, configuration, implementation of architectural designs and documentation for various application environments"
good,"I initially took this job as a way of supporting my family, because my job at the time wasnt paying near enough. The pay was great for not requiring a degree, but the work is hard. As great as the money and benefits are, I had no even less time with my family due to working 3rd shift. Some jobs are less phisically demanding than others, but for the new people that are low on the totem pole that's about all they get. I'm not a weak or unmotivated individual, but moving roughly 20 tons (no exaggeration) by hand in a 12 hr shift 4 nights a week will break you down quick."
good,Great coworkers a good place to learn how to keep numbers in your head and to learn how management thinks about your time and work ethic there are no bad just do your time and job wright with few mistakes and make it home.
good,"It is a fast past work area a lot of down time and you learn to measure rubber to nright leagth and coworkers are very helpful in looking at skap rubber and the hardest part of job is laying down scrap ,must enjoying part of job is stay ing busy."
good,"fast pace, great customers, keeps you on your toes, flexible work hours, work weekends."
good,"They have poor mangement and Faver tisum and the supervisor that is there hard his friend and so called say he is somebody boss but he is not and me and him had woods and the manager came over and had woods with me and called ma"
good,"very self work company. very good benefits, and my consumer relations team is wonderful. i wish the pay was more than what they offer. vacation time and time off is not an issue. it's the pay rate."
good,The atmosphere was good and bad. The good thing was the hours and the bad was some of the people there were negative but I looked past them and tried to get along with everyone
good,Always willing to help out people and very fast and efficient and if something isn’t right they make it right manager is understanding and easy to talk to
good,"While I was at Goodyear, every one was nice and was willing to answer questions or let you borrow a tool."
good,Over all experience is good. Company can make getting hired challenging. General manager is very knowledgeable but can sometimes be difficult to work for. Rate is 3 out of 5
good,"Stressful environments, good pay, overtime when needed, hot working conditions, dirty working conditions, unionized plant, smelly work environment, old machines"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers. They trust that I will take care and service their vehicles like it was mines. The hardest part of my job is to get my oil and tire technicians to have the same mindset that I have concerning the importance of caring for the customers like I do.
good,Trabajo de oficina bastante comun sin nada que destacar.
good,"Goodyear was an enjoyable place to work at times, but the culture can be very difficult. At its heart it is still a good ol' boys club. There are very few executive/senior women, lots of mid level women are leaving. We have a strategy that is followed, but leadership is sometimes delusional about our ability to reach it. For all 6 years I will Goodyear we assumed we would grow, while pretty much every year we lost share. The benefits are great though and the people are fantastic."
good,"The pay and benefits are descent."
good,A typical day at work was good. At times it was very busy other times it was very slow we always remained busy no matter what we always had something to do or we found something to do. It was a fun and fair work place  and we all worked together as a team
good,A day at work was full and busy.
good,"Open shop; Talk with and take note on customer complaint on their vehicle; Diagnose vehicles; Order parts; Repair customers original complaint on time; Make a list of other problems on customer vehicle; Clean shop, Put away tools, Read and respond to E-mails of customer questions and complaints; Speak with customers on phone and answer any questions they may have about our service and how we can make there experience at GOODYEAR better."
good,"You need to be prepared for long hours, extremely hot work environment, and a lot of physical work.  It is very dirty and hot.  There are no gender positions. No restrictions on height either.  If you are too short for the job you have to make it work. You don't pick your job.  You are giving a position based on seniority."
good,"The only reason I stayed working here so long was that my supervisors were so chill. Like all big companies, there are yards of red tape for anything to get done, Goodyear will NOT spend a cent on even decent equipment. The lifts break constantly and are not safe for operation. They actually spend more money repairing damaged equipment than simply replacing it. Stupid. Other safety concerns abound in the workplace, including the terrible toxic air. The lunchroom is the size of my closet, and 20+ employees share it. And, if you are a warehouse worker, be prepared for every single employee to make a mess for YOU to clean up. Not much clarity in job responsibilities. Also, for a warehouse job, it is EXTREMELY physical. You will be lifting 200+ semi truck tires above your waist daily. Overall, not great. Pay was good. Benefits good."
good,"A Goodyear é uma empresa extremamente dinâmica para se trabalhar, o que pode conflitar no planejamento antecipado das atividades."
good,Long hours but rewarding pay. Plenty of opportunities to learn and mentor others. The employees there are very good to work with. Balancing work with family becomes troublesome at times.
good,"It all depends on what plant you're working at.  Easy to get hired on with the floor jobs.  However, its extremely difficult getting hired on for a management position unless you know someone like most jobs."
good,Goodyear was also a good company that I work for very physical work but I did enjoy it had to work 10 hour days but everyone that I worked with was great.
good,"Hard and fast work good pay but a back biteing workers time off was good had to work rotating shifts , one week off each  month was good the heat at times was hard to work in it was agood place to work"
good,"J’aurais aimer travailler d'avantage, mais je n’était que sur un contrat."
good,"Skills are enhance by means of training and online coaching."
good,My job as a department expeditor was fast paced and highly stressful. All calls from the tire assembly for my departments product was supervised and directed by me. I ensured supply delivery and quality production of materials in a timely manner.
good,"Competitive pay and benefits but dealing with the customers to always make them happy can be exhausting. Much different than just a regular retail job, Work long hours, but there's overtime. Most days is an hour lunch time (unpaid)."
good,There is always something to learn and do. You will rarely do the same thing two days in a row. Great environment. Very demanding but the people make the job better.
good,Its an awesome place to work... I enjoy every moment of it.. Good training simple easy work to pick up and learn from... Lots of experienced co-workers willing to help you
good,"Muy buen ambiente laboral, el grupo de trabajo muy bueno, se puede aprender mucho en la empresa"
good,A typical day at work is knowing you have a job to go to. What you learned  how to improve productivity and quality. Work hard and be competitive.Management good and knowledgeable to work with.Co-workers easily to get along with. We help each other. The hardest part of the job is the heat that comes off the molds. The most enjoyable part is be able to take part in activities.
good,"Co-worker is lazy and constantly complaining about the heat. Typical day can include anywhere from 3 - 10 cars, not including accessory fitting. This co-worker is not reliable at doing his job and would rather stay in the air-conditioned office and leave the work to me. That and not being appreciated for the work I do is probably the hardest part of the job. However, there are good days as well when no one is stressed. These are the days we all get along and everything runs smoothly. I have learned a lot regarding the tyre business while working here and that I can have confidence in myself and my work."
good,Was the hardest job I ever had but the pay was great. Co-workers were great and was the most enjoyable part of job. The job was very hard and hot..
good,"A manufacturing company that is not marketing focused.  They have the talk, but not the walk or budget to support.  The employees work hard and are dedicated to the company."
good,Inspected tires before loading the truck.  Enjoyed working a team of people that was invested in getting the job done.
good,"we worked a 12 hour rotating shift sorting tires on shelves, the tires never stopped coming"
good,"It was a good place to work and I got along well with my co-workers. If business was slow, I had to deal with flexible hours which were not always full time. I learned more about tires and other things I did."
good,"automotive on vehicles, customer service at a fast pase.. comfortable co workers and management"
good,Bad working conditions especially summertime. Rotating 12 hour shifts not good for anybody. Management leave a lot to be desired.
good,under utilized facility. Goodyear micromanaged which really doesn't help the locations to compete.
good,"Working at Goodyear was an overall enjoyable experience. There was a lack of organization and communication at times. Additionally, meetings felt somewhat overdone, and not always productive. But a good work culture, and a great mentorship program."
good,It is a great company to work. But the amount of work you have to put in you are not getting the right pay. But at this company that is not the case. If they would pay right it would be very nice
good,"Very hot and dangerous place to work at. You need to stay alert an focused. The pay is good, benefits good. As with any job you need to wear proper protective equipment ."
good,Empresa com excelente ambiente de trabalho. Beneficios muito bons.
good,"learn basic skills needed to perform the job, helpful employees that work well together, will interact with customers when needed, typical routine maintenance"
good,Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar porém com pontos a serem melhorados/revistos.
good,con -money that should be the only thing well it was for me and ive been here 3 years and im leaving now because theirs just no money here they want you to advertise for them
good,"Por um longo período a empresa esteve focada no desenvolvimento constante das pessoas elevando-as a um nível bastante alto de capacitação e formação profissional."
good,Es una muy buena empresa ya que sus stand standares son muy apegados en cuanto a la seguridad del trabajador siendo así una empresa que compite a nivel mundial con productos de alta calidad ya que son exportados o enviados casi el 100%de la producción a EEUU
good,Fast paced manufacturing facility. Safety awareness paramount. Long hours for Managers. People engaged. Constant overtime for floor managers 7 days a week.
good,"Good work schedule, worked days, Good health coverage, Management was great co worker easy to get along with,pay could have been better. Had no trouble working there."
good,"Very good place to work for a manufacturing plant. Excellent pay but insurance benefits not so good. Pretty good work schedule. Not very stable job security. I was offered a position as a tire builder in this company but was employed with another company at the time, and was not sure of job security with the Goodyear plant. When talking with the interviewer he assured me the job was secure and I had nothing to worry about. I resigned from the company I had been working in management with for thirteen years and took the position offered at Goodyear. Six months later I was laid off and seeking employment."
good,"Best paying employer with amazing benefits including job relocation, 401k, affordable medical and dental. This is a great career opportunity with multiple locations."
good,A good place to work if you want to have job security and make a lot of money. Long hours of work. Made a lot of good friends. Still have long lasting friendships with a lot of the employees there.
good,"Fun atmosphere, and the customers were outstanding and pleasant. There was a great deal of teamwork from those that wanted to assist where needed, and some others that fell short of requirements. I enjoyed the staff, and I made a great addition to the facility."
good,"Start at scheduled time."
good,"A typical day at work is like every other day routine, Open up the shop clean up floor to begin our day. Second check which vehicles  wasn't finished the day before to get right on it so we aren't behind for the day. Then we continue the day with customer vehicles with Complete maintenance check and oil changes depending what service they purchased. "
good,"As an automotive technician, I diagnosed and repaired cars and trucks, and maintained a clean work environment. The daytime hours were great for family life, but the flat rate pay compensation was not enough to support my family."
good,It was the best job I have ever had and will miss it very much. Training periods were not as long as needed for certain jobs. Coworkers was always looking to lend a hand if you had any issues.
good,"I have not been with Goodyear very long, but so far it has been a big adjustment. I cannot give a perfect summary of the job yet, but I essentially have become a full time AP assistant and help with research of invoices that do not get paid for a variety of reasons."
good,"Great benefits, great pay, great environment. This is a place that you can work with a plan to retire down the line. Twelve hour shifts are a big adjustment for people that aren't use to working that much during a normal workday. But after a few weeks of it, your body will adjust to it pretty easily."
good,"En el mundo de las ventas para lograr las metas , hay que estar muy bien informados del producto y la empresa que Labore capacitarse era fundamental por ello en planta nos daban capacitación en tema de ventas y producto .cierre de venta ."
good,"empresa excelente em criar processos porem ineficaz na hora de cumprir tornando tudo mais burocrático e sem eficiência , trabalhamos e estamos inserido num mercado onde devemos ser mais práticos e seguir arrisca tudo aquilo que pregamos ou iremos padecer nesse mercado cada dia mais evoluído"
good,"*A typical day at work was using CAD, talking with clients, and reviewing test samples"
good,This company is very hard to work for. Over all good pay and good health insurance. 12 hour shifts day and night shift. It is Union based company. Again the company has a lot great people that work for the company.
good,"Goodyear did a company wide restructure and felt it was in the best interest of the company to move the accounting department to Akron, OH. That meant that my job was eliminated as of March, 31 2017"
good,Not a job for a woman the work was hard and I stayed sick because of the environment..but the benefits was good and we get a 7 day week off with pay
good,"-Reifen Kontrollieren"
good,"* Um dia típico de trabalho, pode-se resumir em um dia agitado no qual deve-se cumprir ordens e metas estabelecidas;"
good,Good company with little work life balance. Long term employees were treated with special privaledges. New employees not respected same. Union allowed un disciplined activities to happen. Not easy to terminate hourly b/c of union. No support for salary employees
good,"Overall really great place to work great company to work for everyone that works there is very friendly and is willing to help everyone treats customers like family and that’s how we were all trained. The only reason for leaving was that I slipped two discs in my lower back, I went on disability which was a struggle to get so they pretty much just let me go"
good,Very Stressful environment. Youll have to work in the heat for 12 hrs and the fans dont work. Maintainance main priority is the buffer line because thats the final step before shipment. Overall this job is not made for everyone.
good,"I learned many things about being a mechanic, i've been familiarized with the parts of a particular car. the other employees are very approachable, me most enjoyable part of the job is when the costumers are giving you tip."
good,"Very good compensation, but that did not compensate for the long hours, stress and negative work environment that surrounds the automotive industry.  You would have to be a real car enthusiast to enjoy the work."
good,Very good wages for the type of work that was involved.  I believe I would still be employed if it were not for the union protecting the workers that did not want to work.
good,Goodyears managers were horrible very rude and very unprofessional. The training was not raining at all it was more like gossiping about the different departments within the plant.
good,"Am anfang wahr es interessant aber mit der zeit spürt man die schicht arbeit, körperlich als auch gesundheitlich am sonsten sehr zufrieden. Umgang mit diversen maschinen wie man sie bedient."
good,I've learned how tires are actually made from scratch. The co workers are pretty good workers. Got along with them well and never really had any kinds of incidents.
good,laughter is medicine for the soul you can work better stress free i enjoy 20 min before we get off we wine down
good,Foi bom enquanto durou mas não dava mai pois fui pra longe. e devido a longivitude ficou muito inviavel a minha locomoção.
good,"la situación país hace que los profesionales inmigremos a otro pais, mi cargo es Gerente de calidad de una div en goodyear , tengo 19 años en la industria del caucho y por motivos de inflación ya mi sueldo no me alcanza para las necesidades básicas"

good,Gute Firma - leider werden Abteilungen ausgelagert
good,Great company to work for.  Met a lot of great contacts in the community.  The training was great and will always take those skills with me in the future.
good,Blacks Tire is a good place to work. There is very little room to move up because It is family owned and only so big. Covering NC and Northern SC. The Area manager is not bad to work for if you are a manager. The man is wide open all of the time and always on the go. If you are interested in a mid level career it is not a bad place.
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers. We were focused on doing a good job to keep our jobs and be able to support our families. My supervisor was supportive. He shared his knowledge. I became a skilled laborer while working at Goodyear..
good,"excellent pay and benefits, you work 12 hours a shift, only work 14 days a month. receive seven day straight break once a month. A good place to make a career out of."
good,Was very organized and clean warehouse. Plenty of room to grow. Great benefits with cost of living raises. Comany match 100% on 401k. Operated plenty of equipment with the exception of lock out tag out
good,The company is a good one to work for. It is unfortunate that the upper level management treats the lower level management negatively.
good,drove a rotator fork lift truck. was responsible for moving and storing and labeling of large containers full of materials
good,"Good family run business,  company trains all employees frequently to keep updated with changing times and vehicles. Observes holidays . Has company functions"
good,Not a very organized place to work for. They are going through many structural changes that adversely affect workers. They are short-staffed on management although they have people within who have applied for the empty positions and are well qualified but they haven't been placed into those positions.
good,Very political career path and favors those who are career dealer channel individuals in spite of the fact this is the biggest money losing channel for the company.
good,"A typical day at the work place, would be enjoyable, every day was like a new expirience.learning how 2 deal w/ diffrent personalities was very exciting n intresting.could never ask 4 an easier crew 2 work w/ and manage.my workers were easy going,and a hard working crew.can't think of anything being hard.The most enjoyable part of the the job was helping the co-workers.we were indeed a great team.would doit all over again if the chance was given"
good,Min work week 50hrs. Regularly 65+
good,"Goodyear is ok when your at a high position but if your at the bottom, from my experience your more like a place holder and theyll let you go with no hesitation. You don't get commision till your promoted twice from the labor side. Service right ups"
good,"- learnt about tire manufacturing and its process. Also, the warehousing, storing, distribution."
good,A 8 hour shifts. I learned that I could learn to do any job at a fast pace. Management was al right. The people were great to work with .
good,Performed oil changes and tire repair / replacements on customers vehicles. Volumed varied from day to day.
good,"O dia de trabalho era bem corrido, aprendi a desenvolver e trabalhar sob pressão. A parte mais difícil do trabalho era acertar composição da borracha, e quando acertava era o que mais gostava. Não tinha muito contato com a direção."
good,Goodyear never wants to advance me (im thinking they just dont want to pay me more ) but they want me to work more everyday for less.
good,"My managers kinda let our lead techs run amok and they had the maturity of a 12 year old. Also, kiss your weekends goodbye. And your evenings. And any semblance of a sleep schedule. You'll be doing after hours road calls instead of having a life off the clock. Why I left. Wanted my weekends back."
good,"As long as you understand there are long hours required, and little time to see your family, this is a great place to work. They are open on the weekends including Sundays, as well as most holiday's but there is no holiday pay involved."
good,it was a good place to work I wish they didn't close I learned a lot of  skills  there I built tires I cured them I built batches in bandburry I checked tires for conformance.
good,"Coworkers are nice it could be better run, but overall not a bad job to start out at in the automotive career, This location can be a mess however being understaffed and short handed."
good,This company has potential to be a great employer.  They are just too engrained in an us versus them mentality between middle management and hourly people on the production floor.  It can be a very physical job.
good,"When I started at Goodyear in 2009 everything was great."
good,Goodyear was a great place to work.  Job security was okay and it was a union based company. I enjoyed my job and working at this company. I wish they would not have move the job to another location.
good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar no dia-a-dia, cultura muito forte por novos resultados."
good,"High volume shop with quick turnaround. Fair pay. "

good,"Empresa de grande porte, na qual dependendo da área que se trabalha, obtêm- se grande desenvolvimento e crescimento profissional."
good,"People are great, very big place. This is a Union Shop, you are nothing but a number. Not much room for advancement. Can be dangerous for maintenance personal."
good,If you are a manager be expected to be heavily micromanaged by corporate office and regional staff. medical compensation is OK but could use improvement. Fun working with Goodyear as long as you stay out of management. pay not as competitive as other Commercial dealers such as Michelin or Bridgestone.
good,"Historical company with brand new HQ."
good,"Tire Technician"
good,"atmosphere is very friendly. staff are personal with all customers, plenty of room for growth. no health care. no time off"
good,"it is my own business. I got  a contract with a property management company  , worked there for 3 1/2 years . lost alot of regular customers. now   unsure if i want to rebuild my clinet base that took 7 years to build"
good,"Noisy, too many chiefs, not enough Indians.  Pay is good, insurance fair. Management could use some help.  Six days a week is horrible for family life"
good,"Enjoyed my time there, with the exceptions of some of the personel. Overall very good company.  Learned a lot and enjoyed the flexability."
good,Compensation is good.  Work somewhat stable.  Management style and union operations very old school with no room for any new managerial approaches.
good,Service customers that have car needs in the community.  Deal with customers via the phone and in person that are sometimes irrate and/or friendly.
good,Training is key to success all aspects of automotives is coverd
good,come in help who i can with what they are doing until its my turn to bring in a car and take lead. i learned how to balance tires better and more car parts. the co-workers are very funny. hardest part is trying to understand what the customer wants . most enjoyabale part is the people u meet .
good,your co workers are great but managment and corporate are not fun at all. the worst part of the job is they dont care about there emplyees and dont pay you what your worth.
good,production comes first-- covers up everything with smoke and mirrors
good,"Goodyear-Dunlop versucht sich neu zu erfinden."
good,"Goodyear is a good place to work, with really good benefits. It is a fairly stress free environment with plenty of opportunities to excel. The work schedule is pretty good once you get used to it."
good,"went through Goodyear's training for stroe management, 2 - 4 week classes "
good,excellent company to work for offers decent salary with great benefits.can be fast paced and need ability to work with minimal supervision doesnt offer advancement opportunities
good,"Company believes in getting the job done at all cost. Safety is a issue, but much more can be done to improve this situation. Management could tidy up a little."
good,Good work environment but very low pay. Top performing people were not recognized and given a chance for advancement and better use of their skills. also not very transparent as a company from the top down.
good,Empresa com bons benefícios e respeito ao funcionário
good,Steady work environment faced paced phone operations handling multiple tasks at one time always a task to test your ability to make you more knowledgeable in your position
good,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, porém o trabalho é corrido, é pesado, a grande maioria dos colaboradores adquirem problema nos ombros, coluna ou joelho devido a repetição de movimento. "
good,"I was a full time employee here. I really enjoyed working for this store in particular, even they were not giving me the pay we agreed on ""they were working "
good,"The Service Advisor position in the automotive industry is a fun, demanding and daily changing position because of technology changes in automobiles. I learn daily from my co-worker whether its the mechanics or other sales associates."
good,Typical day was to load semi trailers and unload them by hand. Stack semi tires ten high by hand every day. It   was a good work out but for 8.25 per hr and no raise like promised I tend to not want to work as hard for the pay.
good,"Si algo llama la atención es la escucha activa del personal y el trabajo constante por tener a los trabajadores contentos, mejorando sus herramientas de trabajo"
good,While being employed at Goodyear Tire & Rubber.  I've learned a lot and was able to meet a lot of people from different cultures. I wish they would have kept their departments in the country.  I would have definitely had stayed.
good,Great place to work.  The people that they hire are great.  The work week can be a little long but the people are great. I enjoy the atmosphere and the fair treatment of customers and employees.
good,"This job is very different than my previous contracts with Goodyear."
good,"Typical day coming in answering the phone, finding parts, pulling parts, cashing customers out.  Learned how to install tires.  Hardest part of the job is not being organized. Most enjoyable part is the customers"
good,"employees were great my manager wasn't, he didnt understand the needs of the employees under his management, plus he was from another country"
good,"A typical day starts with Night Cage Inventory"
good,"I was brought in as a contract worker, so job was short lived. I would have loved to continue to work there till I retired but that wasn't going to happen."
good,"This is a good company to work for except for one important thing: pay.  It doesn't matter how fun the workplace is or how well the job balances with your personal life.  If you can't pay the bills, why work?"
good,i learned how to operate a press at a moderate to fast paste in a hot environment that was enjoyable to work in with surrounding employees. The hardest part of the job was keeping up the pace at mid to late hours of the shift.
good,"Hurry hurry, do, do, now go to lunch, hurry back, go, go, now go home."
good,this was a great place to work at it was fast paced and something new happen everyday pay could have been higher and a better district level support staff also your competiors can sell your product at lower price than you didnt make your job easy

good,"good location, lots of customers, good prices loved the working atmosphere great technicians respectful managers"
good,"I came into the company as a GMT with the hopes of advancement but it never happened.I even relocated with another promise of advancement but a year after relocating, I decided to move on. So, all in all, a good work place but not much potential for advancement."
good,"Typical days/nights at Goodyear were basically the same. I knew what I had to do every day. From this job I have learned how to hone my ability to multitask. The management left a lot to be desired, they seemed to be more concerned with themselves than their employees. I learned more each day from my co-workers although some were less patient than others. The hardest part about the job was the physical demand but it was an honest days work."
good,Typical mechanic work enviroment. Was a demanding enviroment with but over all pleasant. The particular branch i worked at was poorly managed but overall company was good.
good,When I first started at Goodyear in Gadsden in 2009 it was an awesome place to work. Things have changed since then. Still good pay and benefits but plants being built in other countries has hurt the business.
good,"It offers opportunities and benefits but could be better."
good,A great place to apply everything you learned in school and read about in business books.  This is the real world and your hard work makes a difference that you can see.
good,"pay is great  however, you become a robot coming and going."
good,"Good pay management works with you on hours and family life."
good,"Your general day is clocking in, and performing tasks based on position on vehicles in the bay. Oil changes, tire replacement, mounting and balancing are the main services that an employee will do, with occasional higher level work depending on skill and experience."
good,Franchisees so sometime the owner will change so it's not like a permanent job always worries about stable job other then that there is no room for advancement even if you go to school cause mechanic are picky about who gets jobs because they are on a commission base pay

good,"I really enjoyed my time at Dunlop. I was there for 3 years and I met some really great people. The job had some stressful times and a unreasonable quota to meet but the pay and benefits were very good for not needing a college degree. I left Dunlop because I moved to South Dakota but if I ever move back to Buffalo, NY than I would consider going back."
good,If your fresh out of high school I would recommend this job it pays well for what it is and you will learn a lot from working there. The people who work there are willing to teach you as long as your willing to learn.
good,"Somos humanos no maquinas"
good,"Goodyear can be a good place to work most of the time, it has its ups and downs like every company. Can be hard and labor intensive especially if you are replacing big truck tires"
good,"I greeted incoming customer's. Assisted them with their vehicle needs. I took their information and keys, offered courtesy rides. I was the person who called the customer with any recommendations that the technician would see fit to improve the life of the customer's car. I also assisted customers with tire purchases. I paid the bills, assisted with parts and tires inventory."

good,"Culture is fair, great place to work while in school, meets the hours to allow one to fulfill their goals. Great benefits through the company for employees and families."
good,A good place to start if you're looking for a job in the automotive industry. They're willing to teach you and send you out for further learning. Also they give reimbursement for certain certifications.
good,Great management with great product. Bonuses were not the best. Benefits are nice. Great holidays that were paid without hesitation. wish I could go back.
good,The job is well suited for a single person and pay could be better not super fast paced but a consistent work flow on most days. Management could be more helpful too .
good,long hours paid at the lower end of the scale flat rate also technician favoritism .no training for new automotive technology also no hotline technician support
good,"Good compensation. Fair wages. "
good,A typical day at work is a pretty full and busy day. I learned that working hard does pay off for myself even though it's not always remembered or really appreciated as you would think from some. The hardest part of the job is when people make false accusations even though you have proof and witnesses. It's just the point of how things like that can even come about and nothing is really done about it. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the job done and also seeing the customer happy and smiling knowing that things were being accomplished for yourself and also for others.
good,"The pay was weekly, they always helped you out with scheduling and offered programs for you to advance in your automotive career. Good place to learn customer service"

good,During my time here I have encoutered lots of great people. The hardest part of work is getting along with your managers or there is not promotions. What I learned is that 12 shifts are long and will wear and tear on a family.
good,L'ambiance de travail au sein du service et dans l'entreprise est très bonne. Les missions sont très enrichissantes et permettent de rapidement monter en compétences.
good,"Era estabelecida uma meta de produção pra se cumprir e tinha que ser feito, aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, tinha muitas reuniões e realmente a comunicação foi o que mais gostei de ter para aprender de como uma poder bem estabelecida uma boa relação entre funcionário e empresa e vice e versa."

good,Was a good place to work for if you like working on commission. Not much time off and you have to work weekends. The owner was great person and helped out as much as possible.
good,Decent job where you get to work outside and travel around north east Kansas. Company truck provided for roadside and afterhours calls.
good,"hard graft ,make you work your socks of for your money,showers and changing facilities ,do get hands dirty, able to progress through multiple jobs"
good,"typical day is disassemble tire presses, doing preventive maintenance. doing this process I've leaned how the press works. Management helps us by having the parts we need to do our job safely. My coworkers are knowledgeable and hardworking.  Hardest part is the heat caused by the steam giving off by the press. the most enjoyable  part of the job is knowing we completed the task safely"
good,"A lot of opportunities to create a career out of anything that interests you. Great people, great location, great opportunities."

good,"didnt work there very long...i would change tires and oil...."
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, dinâmica, alto nível de aprendizado profissional e boa remuneração."
good,"This was overall a great place to work, though my one major complaint stemmed from working at a franchised location. as is the issue with many non corporate, franchised stores, the management thinks they can treat you however they please, with no consequence. I loved the customers and coworkers I worked with, but ended up leaving the company due to the store owner steadily insulting me, and everyone else who worked there, even over non work related topics. All I can say personally is that I now definitely have my sights on corporate run positions for the future, and I would recommend the same to anyone else who values their peace of mind at work."
good,"fun work place with supportive management not all about numbers but how you personally grow and develop.decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of big MNC. the most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them. the office saturated to get crowded as the company grew."
good,nice place to work minus being laid off.pay is really good.12 hours a day.bad part is smelling like rubber all day and stuff
good,"I have worked at Goody Year Tire Company for twenty years, as a Tire Inspector. I was a salary employee with a great salary and benefits. Recently laid off because my job was outsourced to a third party agency, therefore, my salary was reduced to $15.00 per hour."
good,"# good hike in salary"
good,"A typical day at Goodyear tire and rubber as a Store manager is high pace. I  have to manage both employees of the shop and customers, to provide the perfect atmosphere. I also have to maintain and keep track of inventory and parts and meet sales goals on a daily basis. I have learned at my time at Goodyear how to manage in the greatest pressure situations, to problem solve and market and grow a business. When I took over as store manager the store was a $50,000 dollar a month store, now it's an $80,000 a month store. The hardest part of the job especially  over the past two years has been keeping a service manager to work under me. I trained my last great service manager and he got promoted to his own store and after that I have worked several months in a row fro 7am to 7pm six days a week. It has taken it's toll on me. What I enjoy the most are the customers I am a people person so I love my customers and my employees."

good,"like some of the co-workers "
good,"A great place to work, I learned how to multitask and stay on schedule, co-workers are nice, hardest part of the job is standing for 12 hrs. a day, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who are there to do a job and carry their own weight."

good,. Typical day consisted of :
good,This facility is hard to review because the working conditions were less then favorable. There was no conditioned air and you were constantly inhaling very dangerous chemicals in the production of rubber products. It was very stressful because you had to maintain above average production to insure the next process had material to work with. The co0workers were excellent because they understood the tasks at hand. I learned to navigate my way around an industrial setting in the work place
good,Was a good company to work for but Corporate greed has gotten the best of them I don't recommend this company to anyone
good,"good work expierence, very friendly and helpful co-workers"
good,"built tires on a daily basis, learned to run machine independantly, management was good to work for, co-workers were good to work for, hardest part of job was nothing I can think of and enjoyed being able to work indepedantly."
good,"Great place to work with great people, could be a little more organized with customers and appointments though."
good,"Creating daily, weekly and monthly waste reports"
good,not to bad a place does not pay very good. but the people are great to work with
good,"I spent a lot time here seen a lot of changes,but I started here they gave me my start in automotive feild.This company can be everything you want it to be just apply yourself."
good,Salários compatíveis convênio médico e odontológico plr e vidalink .
good,"it needs some work in the human relations side,they do not follow the corporate culture with putting employees first. I wish they would follow accepted standards."
good,Nothing much to say about it. Everything was answered in the indeed survey. Goodyear is a nice place to work at if as long as life balance isn't a problem for you.
good,"There is so much employee seniority ahead of me that now since we went to 8 hour shifts I'm never going to reach 1st shift. I left a day shift job knowing I would go to nights here but on the 12 hour schedule I had a better chance to make days and was about to make it, but they changed the work schedule. It paid more here so the nights for a while was going to be worth it."
good,"they only do a good job mentoring employees who are favorites with management, When a manager gets a promotion they usually pull their favorites with them"
good,"Had to work open to close everyday but your two off days (7-6), always had to be doing something or you got in trouble, have to have your own tools (which did help me get my collection I have today), pretty friendly people/management, always busy, work was done professionally and proper, working open to close everyday you’re always tired and never do anything with your life once you get off (which is why I left), and if you need a certain day off I had to skip my off day then trade it with someone and work a whole 6 days instead of 5 open to close (that was the sh1tty part!)"
good,"Really enjoy working here. Probably the best job I've had so far. I would really like make this a career. The work is fast paced, but the time goes by quicker. I would recommend anyone to put in an application."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Goodyear while I worked there but was part of ""Black Friday"" at Goodyear in 2004 and was let go in a group conference room with many other employees.  HR gave us our severance packages and said that due to the economy that they could no longer employ us.  Still have friends that work there and enjoy the company."
good,"The management is horrible, but the guys in the shop make working pretty fun. If I could take them with me to a new job I would. They helped me a lot when I got hurt."
good,My position as Service Manager was constantly changing by the constant movement of the Shop Technicians. With so many shops in the Colonie Area the Techs were constantly jumping from place to place. Kinda like herding cats. But we always managed to get the job done.
good,"Goodyear is a solid Worldwide company. They have excellent benefits but they are medium to low in compensation. The have high sales revenue goals and excellent products and pricing, but they have difficulty maintaining qualified capable help. I had 4 store managers in 3 years. Poor work/life balance few paid holidays, attracts lower quality applicants who have no qualifications or experience and it is difficult to meet sales targets when there is difficulty fielding a crew to complete the services that you sell. "
good,I really enjoyed working with Goodyear and wish I would not of took the early buy out and would of stayed on but if I would of stayed on I would not of had the opportunity to learn how to operate the off road equipment that I was able to learn !
good,"good place to work. sometimes its very busy and you cant hardly keep up, then sometimes its pretty slow. easy to get along with everyone that works there."
good,I learned alot made me a better person when it comes to paperwork and being on time. Learn how to drive forklift which helped me in other fields of work.
good,Depending on location...may be a fast pace and need to be a quick thinker. All experience will come in time but tools are needed as you grow in this field.
good,You walk about 10-15 miles a shift around a tire assembly machine to put all the components of the tires together or back up 2 tire macines to load all the components and relieve the 2 builders for breaks and lunch.This was almost 30 years ago and may have changed.
good,I enjoyed working with the guys at goodyear. there was never a dull moment. I also enjoyed making deliveries and meeting new customers as well as seeing the repeat customers.
good,"GoodYear isn't a bad place it's great for a first job, but really don't like the pay thatI'm receiving. I just feel underpaid even I am currently working two hours it's just not good enough for me."
good,Plenty of room for advancement at times. They shutdown our plant and gave everyone the opportunity to move to other plants across the United States. I chose not to move
good,"As a delivery driver-non cdl, my job is primarily loading and delivering retread semi tires from the retread plant to the commercial tire centers in the area. The driving schedule is light, and scheduling is relaxed, but loading by hand, up to 100 tires from 90 to 130 lb each, is tough. After two loads in a day, then unloading the casings sent back, by hand, by myself, in an outside lot, in whatever weather (rain, snow, heat, mud, dust, you name it) I'm doing a lot more manual labor than I expected. Personnel and local management are all great people, and I enjoy working with almost everybody. Pay is decent for this job, and the benefits are above average but not fantastic. Goodyear is a giant, sloppy, disorganized mess of a corporation, very frustrating when you have to deal with hr or upper management. Leadership is completely disconnected, upper level support is nonexistent, and expectations are unrealistic, but most of us in the trenches understand this and muddle through together."
good,Fast paced hard working hours differ from job to job and positions are always different from work in every day basis not as much of a set schedule sometimes
good,My time at Goodyear clearly put was adventurous as well as challenging and invigorating. The pay is not GREAT but it is competitive. The manager of my branch is fair and trustworthy. Lower level management needs work and nepotism is a fairly small problem but a problem non-the-less.
good,Good place to wrk I would recommend .it's a hard day sometime because it be hot.i learned how tired are made.my job is enjoyable when rubber is not sticking too bad
good,i built tires for 40 years then bead building for 4 years. very physical job. Learned how to deal with many differ people as workers and management. retired from there. It was hot and somewhat stressful asa rate was required every day.
good,company offers in house training and outsourced training events. pay is not the best but has potential with long term employment. employees were very friendly and helful
good,Alot of heavy work but not hard work. We work with all commercial based vehicles. Big rigs waste haul etc. Work with some fleet bucket trucks pge for example. OTR work is available and the only other advancement but isn't available at this location.
good,I would describe this job as very hard and competitive. They pay you very well bit you really have to work for that pay. I think some of the work isn't worth what you get paid. It's also dangerous.
good,Always gaining new experiences. The spectrum of technology is very wide and sometimes challenging.....................................................
good,In meiner momentanen Position arbeite ich in einem größerem Team. Hier herrscht ein angenehmes und freundschaftliches Arbeitsklima. Während meiner Ausbildung / meinem Dualen Studiums habe ich verschiedene Abteilungen durchlaufen und auch hier wurde man immer positiv aufgenommen und Aufgaben versorgt.
good,A typical day consist of meeting customers and dealing with day to day problems with their vehicles. Management is good and bad at times depending on how heavy the schedule is. The best part about the job is you learn to prioritize and act on problems quickly.
good,"-buen trabajo"
good,A typical day at work consists of morning stretches since we lift heavy tires to promote safety. Some days it's more difficult working than others when you are short staffed and hours are cut back to 32 hours a week.
good,"Empresa muito boa para se trabalhar, dinâmica, alto nível de aprendizado profissional e boa remuneração."
good,"I truly enjoyed Deckard Tire Company, because I had the opportunity to really dig in and become a part of something,  A small, mom-and-pop shop, we all worked hard, and at the end of the day we felt like we had accomplished something.  Our customers were our friends, not just targets we were shooting at, and our goal was always to provide a valuable service and make them happy, not just separate them from their money."
good,I have worked with this company since 2008.  I was able to transfer from one facility to another facility in another state.  No further insight at this time.
good,"Empresa em processo de otimização dos processos organizacionais. A liderança é, na maioria dos casos, promovida de outras áreas da empresa e não contratada de fora."
good,I worked under a contractor for GoodYear cleaning the building days and nights 4 days a week 12 hour rotating shifts. it wore me out but i got used to it. I would start by getting my cart shocked with cleaning supplies then start my rounds. it was not a hard job just tiring at times.
good,Based on the almost 5 years I was employed with Certified Tire I wouldn't have anything negative to say in anyway great company if someone is serious about the opportunity and ready to work hard to be and or stay a teams member.
good,Typical day at Goodyear is daily stretching in the morning. Discussing safety topics that pertain to the work environment. Gathering information from customers that come in to get invoice and Delivery Receipts billed out. Most enjoyable part of the day is interacting with some of the customers that use our shop on a regular basis.
good,working for good year was very fun and easily experience work place a lot of hard work and excessive workout is involved.
good,boa empresa para se trabalhar ambiente acolhedor mas tem que se ter espirito de equipe e muito braço para se realizar trabalhos operacionais que ainda são na sua grande maioria artesanal
good,"-Un bon esprit d’équipe dans le service Formation Produits et Service ."
good,"Overall Goodyear is a great company to work to, however there are major differences between organisations - at one you may find a super place to work, at another can be a very difficult challenge."
good,"Uma Empresa que tem um segmento interessante, a qual nos prende e ao mesmo tempo encanta pela beleza do produto."
good,"Day consisted of fulfilling customer orders, predicting up to 60 day needs, ordering, DOT compliance, hiring, firing, talent development, inventory control and customer service. I enjoyed the customer/employee interactions. There were no aspects of my job that I did not enjoy."
good,"Although pay was not desirable, it was good work and pleasant co-workers. I was responsible for replacing, and repairing, tires and changing oil. Management was competent and understanding of situations. My co-workers are great and amazing to work with. They are knowledgeable and helpful whenever it is needed."
good,"atypical workday was pull your order and get it to the door with accuracy and no mistakes. good team and company really took care of employees with certificates to restuarants and employee appreciation at Six Flags, holiday dinners, and alot of one the job cook outs and get together after a good month of production."
good,"Ce travail consisté à réceptionner et à contrôler les pièces qui arrivé dans l'entreprise puis de le mettre en stocks dans des emplacements spécifiques à l'objet, vérifier la bonne quantité indiqué en stocks et enfin servir le client qui désire une pièce du magasin tout en gérant via l'ordinateur mis à notre disposition."
good,"As a contract administrator a typical day at work was attention to detail, accomplishing to do's and prepare accordingly for the next day of work."
good,"The work environment could be enhanced if the associates and management would reach common ground on goals, and an accountability system was implemented."
good,day starts with your safety huddle and job assignments. manager is engaged throughout the shift. not too much socializing. its tough when its a slow day. being behind starting the shift and have to catch up.
good,Good place to work great benefits and pay Safety is a priority here. Working as a team is important .Hardest part would be some heavy lifting and working in the heat. Most enjoyable would be some of the people you work with. What I learned is to stick in there when the going gets rough. You can do thee job with right training.
good,"typical day at work i would put on summer tires, would also do oil changes and tire rotations, i learned how to balance tires properly and affectively, only had 2 managers and it took verry long to hear back, co-workers were friendly, always willing to help out."
good,"Basically, its most about focus and attention. Know of what kind of steps to take first before doing. Imagination pays off you must have a visual sense of directions. I will say the hardest part of it is the diagnosis part, you must be most precise front the source of area of malfunctioning to the end of the controlling parts. If not really sure of what or how to go about it we often ask one another that maybe someone knows more about it for help. Its a good thing everyday because u learn more as u go alone its not really a routine everything is different daily."
good,Typical day at work includes doing oil changes and mounting and demounting tires. Filling out inspections on all vehicles. Cleaning shop.
good,Worked with warehouse distibutors selling OEM products to end users and retail shops. Daily cold calling and also seeting up of product on site. Managed a mulit million dollar territory as well.
good,This job was hard but you made good money and there was always room too grow.
good,"Typical week was a day in the office and four days on the road. Primary responsibilities were to accounts and the portfolio of products manufactured by Goodyear. the most enjoyable part of this job was meeting with customers, developing relationships and driving product to the end user."
good,"The culture is meant to be a collaborative workplace, but there are still many individual silos of knowledge.  Work life balance is not great, but you can control that if you choose."
good,Lots of work available and improved efforts with continuous improvements. Team work. Good product and employees take pride in their efforts to produce an excellent product.
good,Be on time never lay out of work do your job the best you can good pay good benefits it's hard work you can get overtime all jobs pay good they do lay off and always rumors of shutting down but other than that it's payed the bills
good,"Good pay and benefits. Maternity/paternity leave with some weeks of pay. Good benefit options; however, higher of premiums. Good company matching on retirement."
good,"Muito boa empresa, muito dinâmica, com boas oportunidades de crescimento profissional, bons benefícios mas com muita pressão por resultados, o que considero normal em toda empresa de grande porte."
good,Well it was a good place to work met some good friends an had good attitude an good manager an worked as a team but the pay wasnt the best so I had to find a better job
good,I learned so much about the tire industry and my managers were awesome but unfortunately I decided to leave to pursue a career in real estate. The time I spent working at Goodyear was a great experience. I would recommend this job to anyone with some AP/ AR and collects experience.
good,"Customers come first at Goodyear. Employees that work hard and follow their ways, advance quickly in many cases.  I came from a dealership setting to the Goodyear independent setting and learned a lot. I was able to take that and use it at the dealership to get to that next level as a service advisor."
good,Overall a gerat work place with a good work life balance and ability to move throughout the company. Completed value-added work for both the company and personal growth as an engineer.
good,"This job is best for young people the environment is poor and hour can be long, but breaks are provided and pay is far above average. Union members have little chance for advancement"
good,"Its ok, I have 15 years in and ASE certified, they treat you like a glorified GS. That is until they need you to do something for them. The store manager is same type everywhere, bring everything in and then panic that people have been waiting too long. Or it's getting close to closing time. They make no sense but same everywhere"
good,Everything good until they didn't renew the lease. I thought it was a great company to work for but they shut down the Tucson area. Schedule and training were a plus.
good,"My main problem with Goodyear was that they don't pay commission on sales only after you've achieved a goal. The goal was at first so big that it seemed impossible to achieve, but I did get the goal twice in 12 months. It would be a great job if it was a truly sales plus commission. The competition was extremely difficult to beat because they had more flexibility in their pricing were Goodyear doesn't give the sales person much wiggle room to compete."
good,"Most days were mostly laid back, every once in a while we would have days where we would get really busy and didn't have the crew to keep up. I learned how to mount and dismount tires and how to balance tires. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the manager who really didn't know what he was doing and was close to making everyone that was working there leave. All the employees were nice to be around except for the manager and the other commercial tech. They paid way less then what the other stores in different locations did."
good,i enjoyed working as a lab.tech. it was interesting and i felt i was productive contributing to the development of our products. i learned a great deal about using lab equipment to better solve problems.
good,Good year is a great company but lacks positional raises in the company limiting your career advancement. The company has set raises and lacks inside promotions within the company.
good,"Goodyear focuses on engineering design, development, and testing but doesn’t not give enough emphasis on manufacturing or product quality. Goodyear does not invest enough back into the company or employees. Goodyear is very good at cutting costs to make profits seem higher rather than focusing on leading the industry to make more sales."
good,"I've been in Goodyear Philippines for just 3 months as Logistic Assistant. During my stay in the company, i just enjoy the good ambiance of the office."
good,"Working for Goodyear was one of my most Challenging Jobs. I really love the fast past environment, the sounds and rhythms of the machines as I worked to meet my production quotas. The pay was exceptional, but you worked for every cent. The supervisors aloud you to work with out hovering, they were more helpful then a distraction."
good,Being a retail location open seven days a week the work life balance isn’t really there. The opportunity for overtime an bonus is there if your willing to put in the time.
good,"Large Global company with many nation wide locations. Retreading commercial truck tires or giant off road tires offers a wide range of diverse training opportunities. Manual and automated machinery, cranes, forklifts for handling tires and supplies."
good,"Had a good overall experience at goodyear within my stores. "
good,It was very stressfull we were understaffed and the days we were busy it was hectic. The days we were slow it was very hard to stay busy with cleaning
good,Goodyear offers excellent job benefits to its hourly employees. But is very unpredictable when it comes to lay offs and job security.. Also a little to much favoritism among upper management and family.
good,"I started working at good year at the age of 14 as a tire changer, worked at several Good Years, I highly enjoyed the work environment, but I got slowly disenchanted with the corporate world, for the lack of advancement and the lack of extra, work opportunities."
good,"Goodyear is a great place to work for. I worked in the Danville, Va. Plant for roughly 20 years. I can say that I have seen a lot since I was there. I stated that I felt it was political, some would call it the ""Good Ol Boy"" system. I think if they would just let the employees do their jobs, it will change the entire culture at that plant. Stop the dog and pony shows, and get back to the basics of what made Goodyear Tire & Rubber #1 in the tire industry, for more than 50 years."
good,The heat was the hardest part of the job. The work area was also dirty. The people were great and we had good supervisors. I supplied supplies to machines and it had to be done in a timely manner. I learned that I am a strong person who can do a great job and be very proud of my job.
good,"Highly pressured and very fast paced work with many metrics to ensure are maintained, Long hours with mandatory overtime. Good benefits, good people to work with"
good,a good place to work at. the manager run a tight ship and was fair and honest with the employees. he lead by working right along with us and made us better employees.
good,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. was a good company to work for; however, they severely lacked with benefits as compared to more modern day companies.  Goodyear is an old company and that culture is still very much present in the day to day operations, which made it hard to get much accomplished."
good,Fast paced environment on most days. I enjoyed the team of people that I worked with. I wish I could have stayed. They loved my work but the corporate office did not hire me because I am a felon. I did my time. I wish they would have taken that into consideration.
good,typical day was showing up doing a lot of front end work and even more alignments I was the unofficial alignment guy so the techs could deal with other work besides the techs didn't like doing alignments but I loved it. I am very good at alignments
good,Good job just no where to advance in the center I am at in Columbus and at this moment in my life I am not willing to relocate. Good compensation and benefits.
good,No chance to learn or build experience do to greedy older techs taking all of the work and refusing to mentor the younger mechanics.  Management only cared about how money they could make by 5PM  Later crew was just hot bodies to keep store open to satisfy corporate   office.  Should have great training programs but they were never offered.
good,good place to work if you want a career in the automotive industry.I got to learn new things about cars and how to work on them. Great people to work with as well.
good,"when you work at Goodyear you could work anywhere else, Goodyear is a harsh environment, dangerous,you learn to deal with that you can handle anything. I personally love the never knowing what is going to break next causing the next crisis. It is a challenge to figure ways to improve the process and the work environment"
good,"bons salários, não cortava benefícios, transporte próprio, local bom para trabalhar e boa estabilidade."
good,"wurde nach 21 Jahren gekündigt,wegen angeblich zu viele Fehltage,wobei ich 2010 schwer Lungen und Herzkrank war"
good,In a whole its a great company to work for but if a crisis arises then your kinda SOL cause its hard for them to work with you on certain things unless you have FMLA or ANS
good,"Hard job very physical lots of energy needed, pay is ok could be better but seen worse management has its flaws like most corporations, lack of training for new employees"
good,"Frequent management turnover creates some confusion as far as day to day expectations.  The company as a whole seems grounded, but incentives and raises are hard to come by."
good,"Primero antes de empezar a trabajar damos un mensaje de seguridad. Luego cada quien va a su puesto de trabajo verificando informaciones del día anterior , para dar información en las reuniones. Se realiza seguimientos a los indicadores de producción. La gerencia nos da información del día de situación de planta. Como cultura laboral realizamos reuniones con los trabajadores en sus maquinas buscando mejoras continuas en el proceso. La parte mas difícil es la comunicación entre los turnos .  Y lo que mas me gusta del trabajo es el compañerismo que tenemos todos los días entre todos los asociados que hacemos vida en goodyear de venezuela"
good,"Excellent job. Although there are a few good managers, many lack people skills. Some can make an awesome job unrewarding & daunting. Many folks are related. True cut throat company. If you're lazy & too sensitive, I wouldn't recommend it. Do your job, mind own your business! It's plant life. Overall good job to make a good living. Finally, work safe, by all means. Although accidents can happen, some jobs can be dangerous or (life-threatening) and a lot of people have been injured or caused injuries, by not being aware. Focus on your surroundings and make that money! :)"
good,It was good place to work I made good money.I enjoyed going to work every day.I enjoyed being a team player. I love to work over time.The 12 hrs went by fast because i enjoyed the work
good,"assembly line style of work."
good,"Lugar muito bom para trabalhar, porém enquanto estamos na empresa conseguimos enxergar alguns defeitos que outros não enxergam."
good,"La empresa es una buena entidad  tanto laboral como económicamente.No obstante su politica actual de comercialización"
good,"L'environnement de travail du bureau d'étude est agréable, bonne ambiance auprès des collègues."
good,maintained 15 to 16 curing presses.  maintained cleanliness and a safe work environment.  trouble shoot presses if necessary. i had to manually load and unload presses.
good,This company relies on their brand name and sells a lot of tires. They are concerned with auto and shop safety. They have many branches nation wide and I can only speak to the SC stores.
good,It was a fun place to work got along with everyone i had to work with it was a very life changing exper but its time to start a new champter in my life the hardest part of my job would be work with defictive stock that got brought to us from a differ department but it still wasnt that bad the best thing out of that experince was the friends i made there
good,"-planification et suivi des interventions de maintenance préventive"
good,"Great place to start a career in automotive. Its a great place to learn the trade,The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.The hardest part of the job is getting a pay raise."
good,This company is a family oriented company and treats employees like family. There is a sense of urgency to welcome new employees into the fold and it's a fun work environment to work in.
good,depending on what shop you go to will depend on how you like it at Goodyear. my shop was a multi care store so we did more than just tires and oil changes.
good,"A typical day at work starts off by getting a pass down for the off going analyst.  After the pass down is complete I will start day shift by completing any task that he (she) was unable to complete.  Once back in the office I would inspect of the paper work for the off going shift. At this point I am making sure that there was no mistakes made on the previous shift. For the most part my job required me to make sure that we was following our own process and making the necessary check though the shift."
good,This work place is a very fast pace place to work. Managers have to be able to drive production along with driving safety first. Communicating with the associates on the floor and balancing what management is requesting is stressful but fulfilling.
good,Goodyear was a great job but the economy of 2007 caused the plant to close its doors in December of that year. thats when I relocated to Ft Worth Texas
good,in general a great place depends on management. similar to other big company's upper management is to far removed but dictate how to run your store.
good,"I come to work daily and line up the shift and make sure we have the components to build the tires that are required. In this job you have to make a lot of decision that effect the company, some are positive but at times they are not so positive. The thing you have to do is make sure you have all your facts in order when making these decisions. It's a challenge everyday and I've always been in a position that my decision can effect a lot of employees. As the Drum booth manager I make sure the tire room has all the equipment they need to produce quality tires."
good,"Goodyear is a great job.  The benefits are excellent and the people are very friendly.  Management could do a little bit better than what they are doing, but for the most part, I would recommend Goodyear to anyone."
good,I learned a lot of sales experience within this company. I learned all aspects of running a successful business. This was a team environment based company.
good,"The hours are long and the work is tough but can be rewarding as far as the money is concerned.  "
good,"se trabaja en grandes grupos ya que la intervencion a la maquinaria, se realizaba generalmente mecanica y electrica, se debia mantener gran concentracion ya que los riesgos en este tipo de trabajos era bastaste amplios"
good,"Hard work but knew you was getting good pay check at end of week,but worked six days a week so not a lot of family time that was the hardest part of job.management was ok most of time."
good,"When I started working for Acorn Tire, I didn't know if I was looking for a career in mechanics. I was just looking for an honest, steady job where I can work with my hands again. Acorn Tire gave me that opportunity, starting out as a mechanic. I had washed everything I knew about vehicles only to be trained the proper way to fix and identify problems with vehicles that folks use every day."
good,"My typical day started at 7am or 10am. Clean front of store, greet any customers, and make sure their expectations were met."
good,"One of the best experiences that I have learned from The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, has been the daily contact and work not only with local peers."
good,"The company has been going through an incredible transformation, and has been beating all-time earnings records. Strategy is being executed well. Cost cutting resulted in job insecurity."
good,Young workforce has been put in place. Nice new building although the collaborative environment isn't conducive to positions where quiet thinking and concentration are required.
good,"Good Year is a good job, steady work. The work schedule is off key.  I learned that all tire companies are not just rubber. I learned how to read prints. My coworkers were ok. They kind of just stayed to themselves. the drilling was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable thing about my job is, the plant is it was climate controlled."
good,Safe work place with supportive management. Ability to learn new tasks and grow as a tire tech and associate with customers.
good,"New investment in Akron HQ, strong worldwide presence, aggressive new product development, focused on growth in emerging markets."
good,"I enjoyed working there, selling, answering phones, going to the bank, the co-workers were a very nice people , I learned a lot about cars and tires and how to manage accounts. My boss was like a father for us, and the place was my second home :)"
good,Opportunity for movement within company.  Training for career development.  Slightly old-fashioned.  Stodgy but consistent.
good,the goodyear india ltd is a good company. but due to heavy load of wrk and my professional .net program course...i quite the job. working schema of goodyear is very strong and gud.
good,"Managing and watching over union workers to make sure you get the full benefit."
good,Extensive learning work place with valuable focus on creating capabilities
good,"A day at Goodyear consisted of doing preventative maintenance on customer vehicles such as but not limited to: oil changes, tire replacement and repair and fluid exchanges. Shop cleanliness, opening and closing procedures and educating customers on vehicles repairs and scheduled maintenance."
good,Very good pay Great working conditions Management needs improvment
good,"As Regional Customer Service and Product Supply Manager for Goodyear Dunlop Middle East I developed and implemented the supply chain system for the Middle East, Africa and French overseas network, sourcing from the global Goodyear Dunlop manufacturing network."
good,es una buena empresa pero loe faltan definir reglas y procedimientos
good,excellente entreprise sur le plan humain professionnel et humain
good,I learned quite alot from this company.  Also started out as a billing clerk and advanced to payroll and accounts receivable collections.  Management was great and so were the co-workers.
good,"A empresa oferece bons benefícios e salários compatíveis com o mercado, é muito dinâmica e possibilita aprendizagem em diversas áreas."
good,"A moderate amount of hostility between the hourly workers and the management.  Mainly because the location where I worked was unionized."
good,"Okay job, always had plenty to do. Had reasonable time off. Fun environment to work in."
good,Definitely a lot of opportunity to move up in the company. Must be able to provide top notch customer service and maintain optimal sales growth. Management can be demanding once you start answering to upper levels but in store management is laid back and friendly as long as you are doing well at your job. Schedules can be very hectic and balancing outside life with a position of higher responsibility with this company can be difficult as scheduling can be very demanding. Overall great company to work for with plenty of opportunity to grow within company.
good,"very busy work days"
good,"Excelente, es un buen grupo de trabajo."
good,Great crew to work with and great learnig oppurtunities. Small but very close company. Easy to work for easy to get along with everyone.
good,They are corporate owned. I learned many skills and was even sent to tech training and management classes. The job was fairly easy. I liked the work pass at the shop.
good,OK place to work. The pay and benefits are great. leadership not very consistent.
good,"The workplace environment was constant turmoil. Lacked management and communication on what was going on from shift to shift. Review schedule and what runs and been upgraded that needed to be ran ahead of the others. Setup the machine, pull dye, set equipment, (pressure gages). Load dyes and set machine settings, have rubber at hand to set run, performed periodic checks for quality assurance. Keep up with downtime (out of compound, trucker, maintenance on machine). Check pull tags to make sure size is accurate. At the end up of the shift have line set up for the next two shifts. The hardest part was the heat and the weight of the rubber, and being able to reach the equipment. I was the first woman tuber operator at Goodyear at Union City, TN, knowing that I could run the equipment that well to be the first woman to do it made me feel good."
good,"great company,everyday was challenge.i really like working for this company.  "
good,Servicing customers automobiles. I learned slot about automotive repairs and customer satisfaction. I had a knowledgeable manager who taught me about car's.
good,it was a good job other that the fact that the shop was in organized.
good,A lot of issues with this company need to be resolve. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers because we help each other. Management could do alot more concerning what they are required to do as far as information and imput. The harderst part of my job is working in extreme heat temperatures in the summertime.
good,Good company to work for. Plenty of overtime. Learn multiple jobs. The hardest part of the job is working in 120 degree weather. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay.
good,"Mucha carga laboral, exageran con las competencias pero es un buen pilar para iniciarse en la pea, muy buenos profesionales con don de gente, siempre dispuestos a enseñar y mucha exigencia con objetivos. Tecnología de punta y constantes capacitaciones."
good,"Aprendi muito como profissional, a Goodyear é uma empresa muito focada em meio ambiente e segurança o que nos dias de hoje faz muita diferença."
good,"High stress environment but good pay and benefits. Management is fairly easy to get along with and loved my co-workers!!! Downside is being around rubber smell caused headaches. Another downside is multiple duties spanning from two departments fell on one person (me) which caused stress. I overal learned how to multi-task in high stress, demanding environments."
good,"Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar. Nem sempre o mais competente era promovido. Havia muito apadrinhamento, o que por vezes desmotivava a equipe. Não tive sorte com meu último chefe. Sim, chefe, pois um líder conversa, ensina, compartilha e dá feed-back."
good,Spent several hours a shift doing quality checks on components made to be used in the tires. Did safety checks of machines and made sure machines were running to code per spec. Spent time on the new machines to see what could be done to improve how they were running and how operators where handling things. Management was good to work for and very professional. Getting involved with the new equipment coming in to the plant.
good,"Provide outstanding customer service to customers by selling tires, road hazard and recommended services, benefits and product features."
good,Great starting job excellent training but too slow and cumbersome as a big corporation. Identifying new applications took years to get the funding to get into the markets which by that time many other competitors who were more nimble and less restricted had also identified the markets and were in ahead of Goodyear so you were always playing catch up.
good,"A typical day was fixing cars, and helping customers. I learned that although I like working on cars, I didn't want to do it for a living. Management was good, my coworkers were great. The hardest part of the job was working on scalding hot cars. The most enjoyable part was joking and laughing during any down time."
good,"Great salary and benefits, but vary unstable. Plant closures were rumored my entire time there, and eventually came true. Very fair company, and very easy to learn job. Good training and opportunity to learn new skills."
good,"This company's main draw is the pay, they usually pay more than most manufacturing operations in my area. But, where I work, capital investment had been very little, and the longevity of my plant is in serious question. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement."
good,"Between learning about the automotive industry, and hands on sales experience, this job met any expectations you could have. I would currently still be with them if I didn't get a better offer somewhere else."
good,The salary is low to start. After a year it goes up a little but after 2 year probation period it raises quite a bit. The area I work in which is mixing the guys are great to work with.
good,Be ready for absolute life change and to be dedicated to the plant first! You will work 12 hour days and overtime is in abundance! Your workmates become your friends because you will see them more than your family
good,"Great plave to work.   Never after 20 years of service did l think i would be looking for another job, but due to declining tire sales. Im having to start a new career."
good,"I love working for Goodyear,but I want to search a career job. My daily duty at Goodyear tires co is servicing (GSE) ground service equipment at the Federal Express Corporation operation. I have learned how to put the customer first and perform my task and an skilled technician level.Outdoors is the hardest part of the job."
good,Working here at GOODYEAR has been great opportunity and good experience. The chances on advancement is a very slow process. So I’m looking for another Company with better chance on Advancement.
good,Always busy working and always safe .. make sure its always clean and ready for the next person.. I always like being there when somebody needs me. me
good,"im not exactly sure what to say since they are no longer the same company they are now called just tires. so im going to name 3 fruits banana, apple, pear."
good,"Sehr gutes Arbeitsklima und super Arbeitskollegen, Arbeit hat Spaß gemacht"
good,It is a good company to work for. I have not nor will never speak in any way negatively about a company. I enjoy the people I work with customers and employees every day.
good,"Worked for Dunlop Tires for 6 years until Goodyear bought the facility and shut it down. We had an amazing reputation and set records for producing high quality tires. Goodyear bought the company to eliminate competition and closed the facility which had constantly produced a profit, even in years where other facilities failed to do so."
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar pensando em questoes salariais, questões pessoais sao complicados."
good,A typical work day as a power house operator was eight hours on a rotating schedule seven days on two or three off. That was then I think it has changed now.the most enjoyable part of the job for me was you are in charge and by your self and held responsible.
good,When you complete challenges that the company puts out for stores to compete with its cool because you can win days where you get your lunch paid for.
good,Great place to work at I was 1 of 3 employees at the time. Fast paced with servicing commercial tractors and trailers. Everyone was hands on with help.
good,Very interesting area of France. Open minded and friendly people. Working for international company gives a lot of opportunities and challenged. It is great experience to work in France.
good,"I enjoyed working at Goodyear. I did not intend to leave, I was offered another job with a little more pay. Also the other job offer pays for my health insurance."
good,"muy buena empresa, pero por la administracion no pude seguir trabajando"
good,Extensive Travel to various states meeting with Current and Potential new Customers. The hardest part of the Job was time management as many customers were located in various states across the U.S.
good,"Goodyear was a good first full-time job. Not having any experience in the automotive industry, the whole staff was very helpful in showing me what needed to be done and how you are supposed to get it done as well. Very fast-paced work environment because you are dealing with peoples vehicles as well as their time. Stocking all the tires that would come in off the truck was a mandatory situation."
good,"Good people work there, they like joking around and having fun. They will also work with Military personnel if they need it. They have good team that will help out when you need it."
good,"working at good year was ok, good pay, helpful teammates, and good benefits but you'll really wont get time to do anything you need to do on your own time. if the work place is understaffed and your reliable your most likely are going to get a 24 hour call because the primary person on call is already on a call."
good,An organization where continues learning is promoted. Work and family life balance is promoted. Sometimes long hours and overtime is mandatory. Teamwork is high on the agenda
good,"The company was a good company to work for, with enough avenues to move up or laterally throughout the company. The corporate stores used an outdated MS-DOS based system that made it difficult to efficiently help the customer at all times. The independent franchise locations had the more user friendly windows based system."
good,A empresa na sua grandeza deveria fiscalizar com mais rigor suas unidades ( filiais ) para identificar falhas no gerenciamento ( Condutas antiéticas ).
good,Great teams with multiple project and variety of work. Great facilities at HQ and good benefits. High quality mentors with a large amount of experience.
good,I like working at good year i just think that it is not my forever job. I like the people that i work for and most of the people that i work with. I enjoy what i do at good year i just wish they paid a little more.
good,Very busy and crazy. Never know what the next day will bring. Very dirty and loud. Seems that the plant is falling apart. Union work environment that makes it very hard for management.
good,Goodyear is a great company with excellent benefits for their workers.  I work in the one union free plant in the U.S.  The managers are out to just make a name for themselves and care less about the people they have under them.  It's more about production than the individual.
good,If i were to recommend anyone to a service center i would with out any hesitation it would be Goodyear. Their professionalism and courtesy are top notch.
good,Overall Goodyear is a good place to work.  However the collaboration and comradery has dropped down compared to what I was used to.  Chemical was more like a family and one felt comfortable in expressing ones professional views and personnel views on a project. 
good,The hardest part of the job is the work life balance.  Your schedule isn't consistent which makes it difficult to manage ones home life. What I'm learning is patience.  I enjoy working with people and I have improved my listening skills.  I've become more understanding and empathetic of the customers concerns.  The hardest part of the job is working with disgruntled customers.  The workplace culture was the best.  I've gained many friends.
good,"Great job. Enjoyed the actual work. Loved the fact of creating good, quality products for the consumer. Took a lot of pride in the test tires to help the company further it's production."
good,easy going work place place... fast paced...good workplace place culture... mangement is good and fair... learned a lot about the company including the history on tires.. overall its good
good,"Good job, great pay, great benefits, hard working. A lot of time spent their. Work/life balance isn't that good. Supervisors aren't that great. May cause health problems"
good,Fast paced as mechanics are on commission based salary. It does get competitive with fellow mechanics. You need to have quality tools. Goodyear provides quality up to date trainings to mechanics and good working hours. Great store manager and service manager.
good,"Overall, a good place to work. Excellent safety program. Work schedule is busy, but efficiently managed, 2 days off per pay period, often not consecutive."
good,"I enjoyed my time at goodyear, initially I had a great boss who let me run the lab freely and make improvements as I saw fit. The lab was very outdated and needed to be upgraded badly. By working with the head chemist at there headquarters in Akron Ohio, we did just that. After a corporate reorganization, I had a new boss that thought the lab had been fine for the last 20 years , and didn't need any changes.I disagreed, and that became a problem, but i did enjoy my time there, and found it rewarding."
good,Major company but every day is very insecure about the future with competition high. There are many tire plants being built nearby and the plant is doing its best to survive but not focusing on the main items to keep it going.
good,"The place is very flexible for the employees consider it timings or work. Very good environment and colleagues to work with. Sports and cultural activities are also encouraged giving chance to every individual to output their hidden talents. Overall this is a very good place to begin your career."
good,"Staff members are all easy to get along with and friendly, they all help promote a healthy working environment. The surrounding area is not the best around but it does not directly affect the workplace."
good,"typical day was slow really couldn't learn anything."
good,"During my tenure in Goodyear Phils., I can say that my advancement were productive and efficient. Started in the production line, then to Maintenance Tech. up to Purchasing buyer - with these advancement, I can say that my work experience in this company molds me to be a good worker and as a person that can work on different area of responsibility."
good,"My direct supervisors were great, but the Officers and Directors didn't really care about employees. The office environment was relaxed and fun, thought."
good,Great place to learn about the building of tires and the amount of engineering that goes into such a common product. I learned a great deal about analysis and data management from working with projects. Hardest part of my job was the long work hours. Best part was getting to experience the start to finish process of building tires.
good,Muito boa empresa apesar de ter que revezar turno isso geralmente não e muito agradavel
good,"The customer base was established and willing to work with a new person. They acted as if you were an adopted part of the family which made the job enjoyable. The staff at the location was interested in helping the customer base and working together to meet that end. The most challenging part of the job was long retail hours when short staffed, but the enviroment that you worked in was enjoyable enough to make those short time frames worth the additional effort. It could and was often a fast paced enviroment requiring you to multitask and react quickly to internal and external forces."
good,"I enjoyed my time at good year as an employer. I was a teenager back then, but it was a good experience while I was there. I wouldn't mind working as a mechanic to increase the level of customers and to gain more experience with new and old cars."
good,Il ne faut pas regarder ses horaires. Beaucoup d'outils mis a disposition pour le travail et le team prevaut a la personne.
good,"Goodyear allows associates to advance their career through continuous improvement planning. As management, if you don't have a four-year degree, you max your potential as a store manager. But, that shouldn't be a surprise in today's world."
good,"I worked at goodyear for a few years i started out as a rental counter salesmen and worked my way up to service manager for the store it is a fun place to work very high paced and you need to know what you are talking about there when it comes to sales otherwise you will not be successful."
good,"Hard work, 12 hour rotating shifts, great compensation & benefits, upper management doesn't communicate enough with floor personal.  Co-workers are great."
good,"busy but i was happy,different skills and people friendly,helpfull and instructive,helpfull and worked as a good team, stripping the tyres of by hand,learning new skills."
good,"Great place to work and learn if you work extremely hard. Bosses can be real biased, and unless you are the favorite you can be talked down too. Don't plan on having a decent break time."
good,"The Lawton plant is a nice place to work. The company pays well for the area, and tries to stay on path with innovation. The health benefits are among the top for the area."
good,"Machine Operator. 12 hour rotating shifts. Continental shifts. Excellent salary and benefits. Work independent as part of a team. "
good,a typical day at this location was open to close 6 days a week of steady work with some fun in between. The job was easy to handle and something ive done for over a decade.
good,Salary at the time was how many hours in the day do you want to work.  Some salaries reached triple digits.  Awesome benefits at the time. Great company to work for.
good,"La polyvalence, l'intégrité et la mutli-culturalité de l'entreprise"
good,"Our culture is very committed to helping the community. Everyone here is very friendly, and it has been a great place to work for."
good,"I enjoyed working for Goodyear, and would work for the company anywhere. Being the only woman in the store was difficult at times but understandable given the size of this store. The guys were friendly and polite for the most part..The pay was comparable and the work was constant. Because I had my own office, it was easy to manage my time and accomplish what was needed for the day .  I really enjoy being busy and the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day."
good,Bin mit der Arbeit zu frieden Habe grosse verantwortung da ich vorarbeiter bin .Mir gefällt es nich da ich immer Sonntags arbeieten muss
good,worked for operations for 2 and half years and moved to tchnical services in 2004 and continued in this role till 2006 and to continue the career path Joined Apollo Tyres as Sales Officer.
good,"-en fonction du poste"
good,"A typical day is working on assignments to improve production, safety, and cost."
good,"Le giornate intense, ma personalmente la soddisfazione di fare un lavoro di qualità è sempre appagante."
good,You work very hard and jobs can be very physical. The hours are very long and conditions can be extreme. The employees are great people. The benefits are great.
good,"Dunlop tire was bought out by Goodyear-Jobs were eliminated as they moved all sales and operations to Akron Ohio."
good,"Lo que más me gusta de este trabajo es que siempre hay algo que hacer, y todos los dias se aprende algo nuevo."
good,I worked here for 11 years and am glad I had this position.  I enjoyed working with a maintenance department that took pride in their work. I left only because there was talks of closing the plant which it did sell the plant.
good,Uma empresa que valoriza a segurança do funcionário. Funcionário trabalhando sempre em equipa para maior agilidade e desenvolvimentos das atividades diárias.
good,I opened the store early each day in order to maintain the Manager's reports. With the reports turned in first thing in the morning I can give the customers my complete attention. I am a hands on Manager. I have no problems helping with all the daily duties from making the big sales to cleaning the bathrooms.  My store is a team we all work together.
good,"this location was in a area I had family and I had grown up in, so everyday I got to help someone out I knew, great feeling helping customers"
good,"Llegar a esta empresa por la mañana era un agrado, el ambiente muy cordial, cada persona sabia que hacer cada dia con su volumen de trabajo bien establecido y con procedimientos que te conducían con claridad a los objetivos con la cuota de esfuerzo que cada persona debía aportar. personalmente yo me forme profesionalmente en esta empresa, adquiriendo mis primeras herramientas en negociación, compras, abastecimiento y planificación, el conocimiento adquirido fue enorme, la dirección de esta empresa es de estilo muy americano comiendo en los mismos comedores que los operarios y era habitual que el director de producción, de finanzas o de recursos humanos se sentaran contigo o en cualquier mesa a comer compartiendo desde gente del servicio de limpieza o con gerentes de alguna área en particular, con mis colegas y en general como mencione al inicio el ambiente siempre fue muy grato y cordial, lo mas difícil fue acostumbrarme a cumplir con la gran cantidad de procedimientos que este tipo de empresas exige pero una vez que te acostumbras se torna habitual, te acostumbras y entiendes el sentido de todo lo que se pide, lo mejor de esta empresa es que si deseas aprender como funciona una planta industrial de estándar mundial incluyendo sus áreas de marketing, ventas, distribución importación, etc, es un muy buen sitio para aprender de normas ISO, Oshas y procesos de producción en general."
good,"Goodyear was a good job, very busy, 3 IT people for the entire plant. The plant had over 2600 people working there, large network covering a 46 acre plant, all under one roof."
good,"I have Managed a crew of  ten  people "
good,"You never stop learning. I would come in, in the morning and there would be work on the service desk, clock in for work and change into my work uniform. I would then analyze the task at hand, bring in the job and get working. The management are great there and the co-workers are too. I've been with the company for almost 6 years now so i know everyone pretty well. The hardest part of my job is when work comes in and its something you haven't done before, but that is is also the most enjoyable with so many different personalities you begin too know everyone's strong point and weaknesses. The more experienced ones would come and help me but if they don't know either than its a more enjoyable learning experience with everyone involved. I just love learning, teaching and working with my hands."
good,Simple and straight forward work day. Come in. Sell stuff. Meet great people. Have fun. Make money. Go home. Store management was great when i was there. Not sure about now. I enjoy selling and meeting people and developing a relationship which is why i enjoyed the job.
good,I am ready for new challenges. I am  not able to advance due to it being  am manufacturing plant. I want a new career that will give me more opportunities
good,"loved my customers,always fun to see who was coming in for service or just good conversation."
good,"llegaba surtia y verificaba precios , tenia el punto de venta apto para comenzar a asesorar a los clientes y asi poder hacer un cierre de venta , atencion de garantia de lunes a viernes, tuve muy buena capacitacion en producto, mercadeo y ventas , lo mas dificil el peso de la llantas , habia estabilidad laboral y excelentes capacitaciones"
good,"Uma ótima empresa, referente a desenvolvimento, forte cultura e desafios e metas definidos."
good,"It was extremely helpful for me to be working in an environment again with at least a little dangerous element. Working conditions, as such, become more about safety instead of comfort. I feel I work infinitely better under a lil duress. You get to yell, at work, at your boss! Can't beat it."
good,"Comptable depuis 13 ans, mon parcours professionnel m’a permis d’acquérir et de développer les compétences et le savoir-faire inhérent à l’exercice de ce métier. En effet mes expériences, en entreprises, m’ont amené à intervenir dans différentes  étapes. Ces expériences, m’ont permis de développer une réelle polyvalence, tant sur le plan du savoir-faire que sur les secteurs professionnels rencontrés."
good,"Grâce au respect de chacun et une confiance partagée par l'ensemble des intervenants, les tâches à effectuer sont généralement toutes finalisées dans les temps. Dès lors qu'un incident survient, il est maîtrisé efficacement et calmement."
good,I worked at this location 3 times and always got along with everyone and enjoyed the feeling of the shop.
good,Una Empresa en la que se aprende mucho y que siempre hay mucho trabajo.
good,"Goodyear like most shops, is a great place for those who enjoy fixing things and working with automotive vehicles. There's usually no shortage of work."
good,"Fast growing business with strong commitment to gaining market share and enhancing customer service. Typical day consisted of reviewing previous days Invoices and documents. Following up on banking and AP and AR accounts. Review with sales team as to where they are at in order to exceed Goals for week and month.  Reviewing inventory and re-ordering product as needed. "
good,"In this location I have two certified techs and 2 general services techs. I will initiate the repair order by greeting the customer and listening to tier concerns. After they have described their situation I will ask a series of open ended questions to gain further intelligence on what the problem really is and what kind of conditions will be more prevalent. I will then relay that information to the technician. Once the tech has finished with the evaluation of the vehicle, I will then formulate the estimate and locate the necessary parts for the proper repair. Once the estimate is completed I will review the findings with the customer and obtain approval to repair the vehicle. We will average approve 25 vehicles a day so that my day is pretty hectic to begin with. Part of my job deals with the unpredictability of vehicles and that all of them will not fail the same way. The same can be said of customers. On a scale of retail associates that customers feel comfortable with my profession is one of the lowest, because I am dealing with the second largest investment that people have and unfortunately car repair is not inexpensive."
good,"Goodyear was a very good place to work. The pay was great, work loads were consistent .Everyone had a job that they knew and could perform without much supervison. Which allowed for a more effiecient and quality work atmosphere. Bad days usually occured when inferior material was brought from outside companies."
good,"A equipe de compras é bastante enxuta e versátil para realizar as tarefas do dia-a-dia. Meu cotidiano era repleto de reuniões produtivas com a equipe e demais área envolvidas nos processos de compras. Me envolvia em primeira pessoa na rotina de compras ( hands on ). A comunicação com a gerencia direta era aberta e clara, com feed back francos de ambos os lados."
good,"Responsibilities included health, safety, and workers compensation, as a member of Human Resources for team members at the Asheboro Wire Plant."
good,"Some days were very labor intensive throughout the entire day, with a few breaks in between jobs. I've learned more mechanical based work, being able to work with and learn from Senior Techs, do flushes, axle replacements, brakes, etc. Management was fair, they allowed personally emergencies to be taken care of, and work load was distributed evenly. Co-Workers were helpful for the most part and easy to learn off of through hands on work and just looking at what they were doing. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with stock and keeping jobs flowing into the shop. I really enjoyed the learning experience from working along side mechanics but also able to keep a Auto Body perceptive just being in a shop near cars all day."
good,Goodyear is a good place for younger techs to learn the ropes with a safety net. Over all solid ethics but lots of instruction from above.Good pay for a retail automotive repair shop.
good,My time withThe Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. was a part of my life that i will always remember. My different jobs with Goodyear was very rewarding during this part of my career. Goodyear was focused on training and job advancement. It was very important to Goodyear to employ and train the best employees the area had to offer!
good,"I enjoyed my work in this environment with actual hands on applications."
good,"He trabajado por 8 años y me ha ido bien ,en las relaciones laborales como en todo ,siempre hay quien mortifica y quiere hacer la vida de los demás pesima pero se sobrelleva"
good,Jobs were very challenging pay and benefits are very good the only thing that really concerned me was my health because of the chemical that we breathe so that was major to me
good,Just started working there! Been a month now! Very hot inside and fast paced! Not built for everyone but if you not afraid to work and able to stay healthy this job is great! Built for men and not Lil boys!!
good,"If it was always fun,it wouldn't be work. Unfortunately the plant, where I work, is the oldest plant in the company and the future is a little uncertain. But if it comes to it, I would rather transfer to another Goodyear plant than work somewhere else. Goodyear is a fine company,  just read up on your particular plant to make sure it's not on the chopping block."
good,"overall it was a good place to work. would recommended anyone to work there. You learn a lot, the other employees help out. Are flexible on your days of you want/ would like"
good,They always have something for you to do in the workplace. There is minimum down time and they usually have overtime shifts that can be worked during the week.
good,"empresa boa de se trabalhar, aprendi muitas coisas em 3 anos de goodyear, mas do ano passado pra esse ano vem reduzindo custos e fazendo cortes na producao, e reduzindo salarios e tercerizando algumas areas como o restaurante que era muito bom, ja foi uma das empresas top de americana, hoje nao e mais."
good,"Buen sueldo y beneficios laborales, cuenta con ruta y casino. No da la opción de ascender o cambiar de cargo en un futuro cercano. Se maneja mucho el trabajar bajo presión por la mala planeación."
good,"Management concern's, Maintenance department going through a rash of retirements with no reliable replacements. Maintenance is expected to be multi trade yet wage is in lower 50 percentile of trades workers."
good,"Goodyear is great place to work. Learned a lot of new things, meet a lot of great people. The hours are good and allow for a good work, life balance. k"
good,"Es una buena empresa para laborar, beneficios como casino y transporte lo que la hace tener ventaja sobre otras empresas, sin embargo no hay muchas opprtunidades para ascender laboralmente y el incremento anual es dependiendo de tu deaempeño que muchas veces está ligado a objetivos no propios sino de la empresa como resultados financieros."
good,"Company is easy to move up within, there is a high turnover rate due to over working issues but overall the company is not bad to work for, they do pay well"
good,Management had a tendency to lean on the individuals with specialized skills to accomplish specified tasks. Instead of allowing those with the skills to teach or train individuals who didn't know how but wanted to learn.
good,"good company overall, have plenty of work to do, most systems are new and easy to learn. "
good,Great if your a mechanic just starting out or if you want a fast paced learning environment where you get to have some fun as you work. Hours were good and overtime was usually an option.
good,"Established company set in its ways but is working toward change. Leaders recognize the need to accommodate remote work and flexible schedules.  Company has come a long way in the past 10 years with summer hours, paid FMLA days for major health/life events, and allowing time off to volunteer in the community."
good,The day starts with greeting the customer within the first 3 seconds of entering the store. Smiling and introducing yourself to develop a good repro with the customer. I've learned throughout my years in customer service is to treat all people the way you would want others to treat you. It is the best one on one experience that you can give to a customer. Earning trust and the ability to communicate intelligently about the service sold. Workplace culture for very at easy. There are no difficulties created which makes the job flow well. The most enjoyable part about Goodyear are the customers that you meet on a daily basis. Getting to know their needs and you share your ability to build on a conversation to create a trust bond with that person or persons.
good,"12 hour rotating shifts both days and nights. Heavy lifting in a hot environment. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. What I learned from working there was that if I could succeed there, I could succeed anywhere."
good,Entreprise américaine = les décisions se prennent vite & rentrent rapidement en application.
good,"Probably the best place to work (money and benefits) if you don't have a college degree and plan to live in or around Lawton for a long time. Nowhere else around here that I am aware of can compete with the salary or benefits Goodyear offers. The hours are long and the shift work can get exhausting but it allows you to live pretty comfortably as long as you stay within your means. Good benefits. It's not as physically demanding as they make it out to be as machines do most of the work but depending on which department you work in it can be rather labor intensive. You start off at half of your total salary and get continual raises each 6 months until you reach your full salary at 2 years when you are also granted ""bid rights"" and allowed to bid for other positions in the plant."
good,I learned a lot while employed there.  I advanced from an Accounting Clerk to Property Accountant.  I enjoyed working with the Engineering Department.
good,"No room for our area to advance. Some rotating of shifts. I learned to work with people from all different countries, to advance the product and company"
good,Maintenance is only performed when production allows causing a lot of machinery to run until it fails instead of fixing a problem before it gets worse.
good,Great pay and benefits if you live in Topeka!. typical factory  work environment  you have hot and cold climates depending on your department. the hours for newbies aren’t all that great unless you enjoy working 2nd shift..overall great place to work if you stay in Topeka.
good,I've learned to be patient when work on cars that are hard to do. The hardest part of the job is waiting on parts and not getting paid while waiting. The best part of the job is finishing the task at hand and no problems.
good,"Overall, great company to work for. Compensation and benefits are outstanding. "
good,"A l'époque, de bon salaire et avantage. Ma journée consistait a faire l'inventaire de rouleaux et les monter pour les machines selon les besoins."
good,"It's a great company to start your career with, they offer very strong training. The pace is very slow so may find it hard to move up fast if you are impatient. Overall I recommend this company."
good,"Empresa ramos pneumático , muito bem conceituada no mercado , oferece todas oportunidades possíveis desde que os colaboradores estejam preparados , ótimo ambiente de trabalho , preza muito por seguimento de sistemas de trabalho .Neste período pude desempenhar varias funções dentro da empresa o que me possibilitou muita experiência em vários setores , compras , planejamento coordenação de trabalhos de manutenção , contratação de serviços terceiros ."
good,"I really enjoyed working at this Goodyear store, while I was there. I enjoyed communicating with a very fruendly customer base. The technicians were great also. A very straight forweard, honest place to work.I did not want to leave and would love to go back."
good,"Fast Pace , competitive, The opportunity to advance is Low on a scale 1 to 10 maybe 3. Good Clean Place to work. Glad I made the Choice to work here. The Hours ive Choosen to work helps me get alot of othere things done in my personal life"
good,A good place to work at. Very fast work environment with good management. The workweek was always 40 hours with potential overtime depending the time of the year.
good,Good place to start your career and learn the trade. Learned how to use equipment and tools. Good people to work with always had fun and learned a lot. Some management issues but for the most part good experience.
good,Great with learning about tires discounts becoming a team member was a great deal learning from the people that’s been there for awhile experience with forklifts
good,"Empresa com excelência,e dinâmica.que respeita o ser humano na integridade, com segurança no trabalho e fora dele e também o meio ambiente."
good,"Bono de produccion "
good,We were require to work 6 days a week. Most jobs were production so you had a required amount  to produce each day.  Your pay was based on your production. Good pay and benefits.
good,"Dealing with customers, vendors, inventory, accounts receivable and payable, employees and upper management. I learned how to be a more effective manager.  The workplace culture was family oriented and diverse. The hardest part of the job was the inventory.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, vendors,. and employees."
good,"Good environment with great customers."
good,Good place to work but fast pace and stressful. Culture is conservative but working hard to become more collaborative. Pay is very good for the local market.
good,"Goodyear pays well and benefits are on par with other large corporations. The culture is pretty ""old school"" and slow moving due to many levels of red tape."
good,Awesome compensation for your time. Extremely Safety oriented. Long hours management needs work there are too many managers within the company work 6 months out of the year
good,"Not a bad place to work - if you're quick at what you do.  If you get a lucky break like I did the managers will put you in an easy shop location.  Let's break it down - you're expected to work 8 to 10 buses a night, take your break, check the yard for flats, and clean up shop all within an eight hour shift.  Now depending on what yard you're in and when you check the yard, you could be dealing with many buses or only a bunch.  How someone would get all those buses done in that short of a time is beyond me but for my managers it was possible - unless they lied,  "
good,Godyear es una buena empresa para desarrollarse y cuenta con buenos beneficios
good,"It's always good to have connections for your tires if you are a car person, and this is could be a good place to start your way up getting into this industry either as parts sales person or mechanic. The working vibe is also young and energetic, sometimes it's challenging to make the sale but usually the tech team is very supportive and plenty of parts available in stock for you to sell."
good,as a store manager they expect to work 60 hrs a week the pay is average but there is a monthly commission and yearly bonus that helps. Goodyear use to ave the best insurance till just in the late 80 and the cost was way higher. as a store manager i had to over see store profit and loss also control inventory and training to your employees
good,"On the whole it was a good place to work.  Past management was a ""micro-management"" style that did not promote individual thought or action.  Current management is much better.  Hardest part of the position that I held was putting up with the political BS - following directives out of Akron that did not benefit the plant and actually cost the facility more money.  Really enjoyed working with most of the associates at the facility, but as is normal in any large corporation, there are those who are only interested in the paycheck taking no pride in their job."
good,It has eminent system for training freshers and workplace as spec standard with numbers of vulcanization process followed by safer working environment
good,"Work 12 hour days and nights, rotate frequently, Had opportunities to continue education,take on positions with more responsibility. Management is supportive to a point, culture is great strong pride in doing what others can't do. There is a lot of micro management in some areas"
good,A US milti-national tyre company. Has good culture. provides opportunities to grow (even internationally) if you are capable enough. Provides good benefits to employees.
good,"Gran oportunidad de aprenizaje laboral, capacitaciones constantes"
good,Managed and controlled IT strategies that align with North American goals and expectations. Each IT department is aligned and committed to meeting leadership goals. I became a system administrator and advanced to leadership with Goodyear. They believe in training individuals to be able to perform their jobs to the best of their abilities.
good,"Very fast pace, productive, fun working with many gentlemen. I learned to work strictly with men, that was the hardest part about my position, and the most enjoyable part was I was able to run an office at times it was challenging but I accomplished things I wasn't aware I was capable of doing. Such as learning about tires."
good,"A typical day at the Goodyear i worked in would be basic work such as oil changes tire change/rotations, every now and then we would take turns going out and buy pizza for our lunches from the best pizza place in town. I truly do miss working for Goodyear if i had the opportunity i would like to work with Goodyear but i think it is best i find more jobs so i can find a better field i can work in."
good,I loved working for them. There was a pleasant atmosphere and the departments worked together to fulfill the job at hand.  The hardest part of the job was that it was hot and dirty in certain areas.  I remained busy and it was a fast paced invironment.
good,"Loved the local management. Gave supervisors freedom to learn how to plan and manage within their individual strengths. Tech's work on compensation plan, the more you work and learn, the more you make."
good,Great place to work if you are looking for advancement opportunities and good compensation. Work life balance is not very good. Expect to work 60+ hours a week
good,A minha opinião é que tem ótimos  profissionais  na goodyear.. eu aprendi muito como profissional . a goodyear  tinha uma ótima gestão  trocou alguns gestores que no meu ponto de vista  não conhecia muito do processo.. então deu uma queda de rendimento  por parte da nova gestão  ... eu continuei trabalhando sempre com o foco na segurança qualidade e produtividade ..e buscando fazer o melhor.....
good,After economic crisis took place in the region we went thru a flush of different management officers and relationships became impersonal. I was committed and dedicated to my career that ended prematurely!!!
good,This job would be great for a younger man starting out. Very friendly environment and owner/ manager very understanding and patient. Paid weekly is huge plus.
good,"Ordinary work day is 7 AM- 6 PM and by 10AM we are usually full throttle, but we also have our slow times too. I was fresh on the tire breakdown machines and had to relearn the tire balance machines. Management and my co-workers are one of a kind always cutting up and having fun. Nothing is really a challenge other than a big work load and the best part of my job is the guys I work with are like family."
good,"Multinationale, mais prends en compte tous les employés, les avis, les idées. Possibilité d’évolution permanante"
good,"Mi evaluación es satisfactoria,puesto que hay buena calidad humana dispuesta a ayudar al crecimiento conjunto (trabajador-empresa)."

good,Pas de pb particulier horaires difficilles..bonne ambiance..
good,This was a very fast paced job which I loved. I learned a lot about how to socialize with people of all kinds.
good,"Love working for the company, and with my fellow team members. The hours of operation can be a bit challenging if you have a family and need to have a set schedule. it can get hectic but overall a wonderful company to work for, if your availability allow you to work 10-12 hour shifts, and possibly 7 days a week when needed."
good,"In a typical day I would be looking after a team of three people. This would be my Mill man, Lay Down man, & Service man. It would be my role to ensure that the raw materials were on hand, that the ticket set for the day was achievable, the stock was available and to meet the company's expectation of a two minute compound changeover."
good,A typical day at work and can be long hours.  A lot expected and beyond from management but they were good to me while i worked there.

good,Family owned business.Great friendly environment.Management and staff are friendly and helpful.“I was given some great opportunities by my past  employer and I regret having to leave. However I am also very hopeful for the future.”
good,I enjoyed every day I spent working here. Meeting new people and seeing and working on new vehicles every day was exciting. There was always something different about every day that passed.
good,"Ma fonction de responsable qualité et de process m’a permis d’acquérir une solide expérience dans l'industrialisation et le management de la qualité."
good,"Typical day production of rubber, Management very helpful, Co workers great. The hardest part of the job was the heat, Most enjoyable the people"
good,Solid when company is running well. When in the company is in doubt i think they should ask there employers for advice more and rely on the people that have been there for the company 20 or more years. Just a suggestion
good,The pay for the area is outstanding along with the benefit package but the current employees do have a major attitude and chip on their shoulders when it comes to new people or the amount of money they get paid for the job that is performed.
good,Goodyear was a great company to work for. At the end of my time there it became a bit to competitive with the economy going up and down.
good,"A typical day consists of repairing various automobile components."
good,Enjoyed my time there. Team atmosphere with opportunities to better yourself. Management was helter skelter at best. Enjoyed my co-workers and miss them most. There was really no hard part about working for this company. My time as Expediter was my favorite job as it allowed me to free lance problem areas.
good,"empresa altamente organizada"
good,"environnement de travail stable, formation et suivi de chaque personne."
good,The owner decided to close some of their stores and the one I worked in was one of them.  Otherwise this place was the most enjoyable place to work as far as the other employees and management are concerned.  The pay was ok.
good,"A very unorthodox environment, lots of team work, very open to new ideas and ways to make the workday more enjoyable while working towards mutual sales goals"
good,A typical day at work was 7am to 4pm working on cars for customers. I learned how to work on my own car and how to talk to a customer.  The co-workers were great and we all worked together to get the job done. There wasn't a hard part of the job and going to work everyday was enjoyable.
good,The management was poor. I worked 60-80 hours a week. I was paid well. I had excellent benefits. The work was physically demanding and dangerous. The employees there worked with an amazing team effort and everyone was helpful to each other. The company was shut down in July 2011.
good,"The typical day at Goodyear starts with numbers and what to achieve. It's a game of sales and customer service, so meeting those standards are a priority - but only after safety is met. Follow these guideliness, and keep to policy - you will enjoy the job."
good,"good place to work not only for the pay and benefits, but for the experice, learning something new and the all  around enviroment. Management didn't really bother you  too much as long as the job was getting done and correctly. is  a hazardous place to work but they take a very great amount of care in safety with procedures and very up to date safety  equipment. over all very great place to and  would  love to go back"
good,A typical day is spent ensuring that all the machines are up and running properly and that they are all loaded. I learned how to maximize my time spent so as to keep the tires moving. The Managers are never really out on the floor unless there's a problem they are helping with. The hardest part of my job was the heat as the press-room is the hottest place in the plant it can be a little unbearable. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that the salary is more than worth the hard-work that you do.
good,This was my first 'Management' position after I received my Business Degree. It was a temporary assisgnment. I thoroughly enjoyed getting all the business experience during the short time I worked there. I was not afraid to get dirty so I even assisted the mechanics in the shop.
good,cleaning tanks cutting grass performing basic maintainence within the chemical plant
good,"A typical day consisted reviewing invoices, parts receipts and making sure that the customer was charged correctly, bank deposit, miscellaneous projects and filing.  I learned more than I could ever write down.  I learned about cars, parts, people; it was a fascinating job.  The management was understanding about your schedule and worked with you when they could.  My co-workers were awesome!  I loved working with almost every single employee.  The hardest part of my job was being a woman in a man's world, especially the automotive world.  There was not one particular part of my job that was the most enjoyable, I really enjoyed the ""detective"" part of it, reviewing invoices; actually all of it was great.  Flexible schedule, self regulating, casual, enjoyable job."
good,very Productive. The plant is in needof remodeling. Equipment are old and with daily breakdowns. I enjoyed being on the floor trouble shooting and identifing equipment fatigue. A family atmosphere was a daily dose of harmony.This is where I learn the most on how to manage the most diveried minds of individuals.
good,"assurrer la sécurite des employées,s'assurer de la Qualité et de la Productivité,tourné sécurité, réunoin sécurité,développer et fabriquer des produitsen comlant les attentes de nos clients, tout en rencontrant nos objectifs qualité,et ceen innovant et en S'améliorant ,procédés,produits et services."

good,Repaired tires that were identifed by the inspectors as having defects. Scrapped the ones that could not be repaired.
good,"You start your day off looking forward t another day of challenges. As a technician you diagnose what the vehicles faults are and repair them. As a service manager you order parts, communicate with the customer and technicians. To take careof your customers should be your number one goal. The hardest part of the job was waiting on parts to arrive."

good,"store management is great, but corporate doesn't care about its employees. and the customer is never wrong according to Goodyear corporate. overall great experience"
good,The management team always supported you and helped you to understand the best way to do the job. Good benefits and good life-work balance. I enjoyed working there.
good,I enjoyed walking into the company on Sundays and managed the facility by opening and closing with having more responsibility to inspire to my greates potential.
good,I was a fast pace worker..when I first started  lumping tires  it was tough ..then my body and my mental got use to it in a couple week ..I start training my mind that it was just a work out at exercise where I do my truck in 3 hoursno matter how much work and how big it was I'll get the job done and never quit easy work..
good,"I enjoyed working here for 11 years.  The rotating shift is something i dont believe anyone can truely get use to.  It is hard on your body working the 12 hour rotating shift.  Pay is great, people are great."

good,Very good but not perfect but still very good 👍🏽 They have great technician that are easy to get along with. We all help each other out when we need help.
good,a fairly conservative and siloed company.  Competitive pay.  As with all large corporations it is easy to go unnoticed.  Your opportunity for advancement is often predetermined and you are placed within a tier as either expert (stay where you are) or promotable (where you are groomed).
good,You may have to work more than 40 hrs per week but it is fun to work at this place. Workplace culture is good and Management are helpful to attain personal and careers goals.

good,"Although the work can be sometimes fast paced, the building is however air conditioned.A big part of the culture there is to take pride in your work and keep a good attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work on the development of a new tire then to see how well it performs soon after out in the real world."
good,"I would come in on my shift, see who I'm working with cause we always worked with a partner.  Then we would get our assignment for the day.  The assignments would be to change out 2 sets of molds.  We would go to the presses turn off the heat/gas line.  disassemble the mold from the press by removing the screws.

good,"As the IT Leader, our team was very productive and engaged because of previous years of neglect in respect to technology. The leadership team was very supportive of technology advances to improve the manufacturing process and reliability. The hardest part of the job began with the dissolution from Goodyear and sole ownership moving to Sumitomo Rubber. Drastic culture changes, increased stress, and dramatically changing expectations have become part of the normal day."

I quickly learned how to operate, troubleshoot and maintain a production line with minimum guidance. My coworkers were very helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job was ensuring the full completion of all production orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team effort in completing the orders.

The hardest part of the job was loading and unloading truck loads of tires. Selling the products to people was the most enjoyable and working with some of the many employees over the years."
good,"Goodyear invested in me as I was a young adult, and they sent me to training to different locations, and once I graduated, I performed very well in the field.

A typical day was supporting the General Manager and his sales team that are responsible for 3,000+ Tire Dealers/customers, working on reports, helping the team with training on systems and processes and customer service to the sales force or customer.   A capricious atmosphere that was never dull or boring. Management is focused on their customers and reaching objectives and goals.  Co workers are a hard working, dedicated, fun bunch of people and everyone worked well together as a team. The hardest part of the job - working after hours and weekends to keep up with the work.

It's a very relaxed atmosphere, if you can keep up with the workload, which can be high at times.  Safety gear is free, and benefits go through in 3 months instead of six, which is possible at other companies."

We enjoyed working with one another that we remained in this group with essentially the same personnel for many years. The gang were assigned the large technical jobs of major machine repair, removal, and instillation. Management were not technically trained and gave general instructions.  We had to make the best decisions we could with those instructions. Hardest part of job... Proper equipment to complete the jobs.  Example: large enough fork truck to lift load safely.  I learned to depend on my co-workers for their incite as to how to complete the job efficiently and safely"
good,The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company offers a variety of products and services to consumers  The company also review goals and timelines in meeting companys objectives.

good,"This company have lot of servers that will help you develop your skills. From AS400, HP-UX, MPEIX, Windows, SAP, Lotus Notes and Linux and lot of other technologies. It's really challenging because you have no specialization and once you receive a call for support you need to fix it ASAP because all of the machines/systems are part of manufacturing process. Well it's really a question to me but as a support team we are doing our best to provide resolution to their issues. We are providing support from workstation to server and application."

good,My days varied with the amount of vehicles scheduled and the type of work required which I really like.
good,acomodo de personal
good,"40 plus hour work week, Work scheduled would change based on the training schedule and learners that we had. I learned how to work better with people, build different types of spread sheets using formulas, grafts and making data bases. Creating a training standard template that was easy for anyone to use that pertained to their job. Managed and paid associates, keep up with the manning for the Business Center Manager. Getting used to the hour change was the hardest because you would come in sometimes at 3 am one day and then 7 am the next or get called to come back in at 11:00 pm that same day to train someone. Knowing that the job was getting done and that they knew that they could call me anytime to come in to work with someone."

Trucks were already lined up outside the bay doors.Dump trucks, tankers,flatbeds,van freights,septic trucks, roll off dumpster trucks,box trucks,garbage,motorhomes,buses, you name it I did it.Mostly all they would need that early was flat repairs or a few tires.I was pretty much a one man service department.I took a whole lot of pride in my workmanship.I knew the key to good service is getting the job done right the first time they are there.As the day progressed I would go to the 3rd bay and help the mechanic work on the front ends or whatever he would need me for or what he wanted to make sure I learned.I miss this job alot because I had the trust of all the costomers that walked threw our doors.I made tire changing look easy and look fun.I have no complaints with any of my coworkers.They were all great men.Good workers.Friends for life."
good,"this is this best company to work for , aside from the plant floor coworker drama that goes on the work and the pay , and benefits can only be beat , if you where a doctor or professional."
good,Very hard work but overall a good place to work. GoodYear needs to change there management on the floor to more experinced supervisors. For example maybe get supervisors off of the the floor that know the jobs instead of bringing people in that have degrees in business management but no experience.
good,"Has good experience in Manual Testing, SQL, some experience with Load Runner and exposure to SAP"
good,Great opportunities.If you are willing to move and take advantage of .
good,"el transporte pasa a la hr acordada el transcurso hogar-trabajo era agradable convivir con los compañeros de trabajajo incluso con el chofer, llegar directamente a ponerse equipo de proteccion, para posteriormente iniciar con tus labores, el transcurso del turno de trabajo se llebava de forma agradable hr de snack, hr de comida, tiempo para practicar futbol, a la hr de salida acudir a tu locker para dejar tu equipo de proteccion y pasar a abordar el transporte de regreso a casa. en mi estadia en esta empresa forme parte de la brigada durante este tiempo pude llevar cursos en diferentes areas areas; primeros auxilios, combate de conatos e incendios, busqueda y rescate, que hacer en caso de incendios o desastres naturales. por otra parte se realizaban pequeños convivios en los cuales se llevaban a cabo torneos de futbol de turnos vs turnos donde tmb se hacia carne asada entre otras cosas. todo esto era realizado por parte de la administracion en estos eventos participaba personal de gerencia y todo el personal de produccion y mantenimiento, en cuanto a los compañeros de trabajo el ambiente siempre era bueno incluso se convivia fuera del horario de trabajo o de cualquier otro evento de la compañia, la parte un poco dificil no del todo fue cuando empece a laborar por el hecho de ser nvo en ese ramo pero gracias a la colaboracion de todos mis compañeros fue una etapa que no se me iso tam complicada, durante todo el tiempo que labore mi relacion con todas las personas que laboraban en esta compañia fue buena, el termino de este trabajo se debio a que la compañia a la que se entregaba"
good,"A typical day for me included sales, reports and admin work, the occasional oil change or tire mount, and other tasks as needed. I really enjoyed working here and was quite upset that the branch I worked at was closed down. The management was fair in dealings and never over-complicated. The people I worked with were fun and knowledgeable. They were always ready to teach me something new about vehicles or the services I sold. The hardest part was the transition from a non-automotive industry into one focused on cars, but the staff made sure that it went as smoothly as possible. I'll miss working here and enjoyed my time there."
good,"Great place to work, friendly work staff, great learning experience"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, posibilidades de promocionar internamente, cursos de formación, buenas retribuciones económicas."
good,I like this job good first time job for young people just starting out.
good,Great place to work & learn about cars not too much too gain from a $7.25 a hour pay rate but definitely a great place for someone is is trying to get hands on experience with automotive service.
good,the pay is good for a family man. Goodyear is a great job. The benefits are excellent and the people are very friendly. Management could do a little bit better than what they are doing
good,Communication between upper and lower management was terrible which led to even worse communication from lower management to the employees. This resulted in most employees having the feeling that management did not care about them and that they only cared about production numbers. Safety wasn’t a priority until someone got hurt and even then it was only a priority for a short time.
good,"You are compensated well for your time working at Goodyear in both hourly and salary. Sometimes the work can be stressful, but good hourly and salary workers make great things happen with support of maintenance and upper management."
good,"I have been working with GoodYear for over 6 months, and have had a positive outlook towards the company.  Good working environment with friendly supportive staff and management."

good,"Provided high level of customer satisfaction while exceeding sales and profitability goals"
good,"Great place to work and I enjoyed myself and all of my customers "
good,"Sales reps have it pretty good. Usually 8-5:30 and very seldom If ever work a Saturday. Pay is better than most and potential to earn more is there if you hit and exceed your sales goals.  Lots of benefits come with job. Like any sales job there is pressure put upon you to hit your numbers, but not as bad as I’ve experienced at other sales jobs. All things considered it’s a pretty good gig."
good,"Great benefits. Work environment can  be stressful. Compeitive, long hours, hard work. USAA great union to be part of. They really lookout for the employees ."
good,"The people and managers are great.  The pay and benefits are great (for that part of Ohio).  The culture to remain an employee is aggressive.  The company cannot seem to ever make a decent profit and as a result, is always cost cutting and exploring options off-shore.  The IT department is mainly support of licensed software such as SAP."
good,"Good place to work, associates are treated with respect and also are given the freedom to make decision that is beneficial to the company. I would recommend Goodyear to anyone."
good,"They greet you when you walk in and explain everything about your vehicle that you need to know. Explain your problems if you have any and in an orderly fashion. Working area clean and Good place to work, but need more employees."
good,Excelentes beneficios-oportunidades de crecimiento
good,Goodyear has an extremely high focus on safety. A lot of other companies should take a page out from their playbook. Safety is priority. Good employee pricing on tires.
good,"Check test sheets for next test requirements!"

good,"Working at Goodyear HQ comes with all the modern amenities such as a beautiful fitness center, tons of windows, and great Cafe."
good,"Even though Goodyear had only 4 employees, we work together as a great team. A family environment.  I was able to meet  face to face with customers whose cars I performed work on. This gave the customer a face to the mechanic and me more information to correctly diagnose the problem."
good,Work days depend on time of year. Shop manager has been there for  15 plue years so she has a good customer relation ship. It was like any other job we all have had stressful and hated it and other days loved the job. Had fun with coworkers and management.

good,"I liked working for Goodyear, as a service tech, real fun place to work at, Manager was, and is awsome! Worked great with others, and the Customers, etc..."
good,Goodyear has a commission that far exceeds most companys. I have made good money without a lot of hassles. The upfront staff are nice and the sundays hours arent that bad.
good,As a union member we were paid alot of money to build tires or push a broom if on light duty.. But we had our jobs no matter what. Never worried about anything.
good,"In the 25+ years I was employed by Goodyear's various divisions, I can honestly say I met some of the best people in the business. I suggest that there were some managers who would inspire you to do anything; it made my job enjoyable. Using this with the experience of being moved about the US to learn of both new customers and new life styles cannot be calculated. It was a true shame that in the late 90's / early 2000's that Goodyear Trie experienced economic woes that caused whole departments such as mine to have redundancies. I can only say good things."
good,Good place to work. Like everything there are always areas to improve in. I believe they are making an honest effort in improving their safety record and production.
good,Typical office functions ranging from Accounting to clerical work. Advanced my skills on account reconciling and budget analysis. Management was respectable and willing to work if unexpected agendas came up.
good,I was brought onto the team with only retail experience. I was quickly trained and adopted to the manufacturing industry and have learn a good amount about their machinery and have gain experience through the process.
good,"Empresa internacional con mucha preocupación por su gente , alta exigencia , buenos salarios y beneficios . "
good,An excellent company to work for. Benefits were good and management was very fair and knowledgeable when I last worked there.

good,"Understood all job responsibilities. Worked well with others."
good,Steady work and productive atmosphere. Great co-workers in a fast paced environment. Warehouse routines are fast paced an work changes daily...
good,"Goodyear has changed a lot in the last few years and the change is visible in culture and leadership. The business results and stock prices over the last 3 years are a testament to a good strategy and its execution by some of the most competent people in the industry."
good,"I learned lot while working here, great relationship with everyone, management knew exactly how to manage the guys, the work wasnt hard, great break area"

good,"Great Team Concept each Dept, Management proactive, team achievement goals, hard working co-workers, hardest part of the job is working against machine failures, meaning downtime, machine need to maintain ""up time"" in order to refill request, the most enjoyable part of the job, working side by side with co-worker to achieve goals, working safely, walking out the door after quitting time together, solving problems together, family oriented company.

good,"Tuve la oportunidad de tener un buen jefe y compañeros, ha sido una de la mejores empresa que he trabajado, se preocuparon por darme el chance de prepararme, ahí aprendí lo que es la responsabilidad y el manejo de un montacargas."
good,A typical day at work I do general maintenance work and when requested I help the technicians diagnose a problem by offering my 14 years of experience and knowledge of automotives. The hardest part of my job is not being able to work to my ability and being limited to general maintenance work. The most enjoyable part of my job is simply conversing with fellow co-workers.
good,"The reason why I call this a Love/ Hate Job is because if you're a hard worker, you'll love the job but you tend to drift sometimes. You get 3 Breaks, and the pay (especially if you're single) are excellent and you get paid every week. You get OSHA trained and the training is paid for as well. BUT, the factory is so big; so you should never come less than 30 minutes early. The management is very understanding and serious about their jobs because their jobs are your safety. Building tires are not easy, and standing for 2-3 hours at a time while doing it may mess with you a bit. But other than that, I absolutly loved working here and would not mind going back at all."
good,"Being able to have experience in machine function,trobleshoot.Being able to report to management when machines were not up to standards.Example shutting machine down to maint.Enjoyed working with management.The hardest part learning to troubleshoot machine.Being around people that enjoyed their job and the safety of the public"

good,"Dia a dia aprendes algo nuevo en tu desempeño cotidiano, algo que realmente se siente muy interesante."
good,A day of customer service for automobiles & light trucks
good,"Some areas are really dirty to work in, supervisors come and go, most of the people are easy to work with. Overall good benefits and good pay. Shift hours"
good,Be honest and be on time and do your job well.Work with others to achieve your goal to produce a quality product.Great benefits for yourself and your family.
good,"Working for Goodyear was a great experience. It was a good learning experience, and taught me what I know about the field today. My boss was a good leader, especially starting at the age of 15."
good,"climate controlled. good hours. overtime available if you wanted it, work wasn't hard. manager told me it was very, very, very, very, very hard to get written up(his words)."
good,Great company. They treat the employees fair and with respect. You get bonuses. I would recommend them to almost anyone. Can be labor intensive at some points in your day.

good,the most enjoyable part of working there was being around cars every day. The co-worker were always helpful and the managers wee even better.
good,The company encourages associates to move to different role every 2 or 3 years to learn more about the company.
good,"i've had a great time working for Goodyear. Alot of the guys I work with and other companies involved have taken me out, bought me lunch, that sort of thing. No one's hassled me or given me a hard time; I've been hooked up alot. The schedules are good for commute, especially since I live in Los Angeles, I experience virtually no traffic to and from work. The benefits and primary pay raises went through quickly, and the other people there have been very acomodating to me (slight injury's, sick days, etc.)"

good,"I started off at the bottom and worked my to the top with goodyear commercial tire centers and am now a master medium/heavy truck tech. The shop will progress and take on as much work as they're confident that you can handle. Some shops have a commission pay scale with an hourly minimum wage guarantee.

You interact with several community guests who are excited to see the blimp and you are there to make the experience memorable. I was in charge or arts and craft, signing in and gather groups to help things run a lot smoother."
good,"Great job, you know what you have to do and you can do it at your own pace. The work hours are usually pretty flexible and you get plenty of paid time off. You don’t have a manager or supervisor watching over you, so basically you are your own boss. Great benefits and management is great! You just have to make sure you do your job to the highest standards and you will never have a problem."

good,"Dentre minhas atribuições diárias, dava suporte aos assessores comerciais que solicitavam brindes e materiais promocionais para PDV, coordenava a compra, alocação e distribuição desses materiais, monitoramento das mídias sociais (facebook, twitter). A relação entre gerencia e diretoria com os demais funcionários é ótima, a hierarquia existe e o respeito também, entretanto a relação é dada na base da amizade e companheirismo. É declarado o conceito de equipe. Algo que me desagradou na Goodyear é o fato de ser uma empresa muito tradicional, ideias inivadoras não são bem vindas e isso acaba de certa forma podando o seu funcionário a dar novas ideias para a empresa. Outra coisa que me desagradou é a ques. tão da efetivação. Ela não é definida somente por méritos próprios e sim pelo bom relacionamento e pela afinidade com o gestor que está recrutando."
good,"Corporate empowered their store manager's, which I enjoyed running the store as if it were my own and yet still have the back up of upper management.

good,"Expedited PO's "
good,You are busy all day long it’s good work hard work but good work  everything falls on one manager  which was pretty stressful  as a tire technician you do half of the mechanics job as well  and my favorite part was service calls but being a low person at that place expect a lot of shop time more than anything
good,"Culture of engagement and politeness is slowly eroding away. Although Corporate Offices state that culture, diversity, engagement, and safety are foundational values; truth be told the rest of the organizational structures suffer from experiencing just that... Many of the manufacturing and other business segments leaders lack vision, trust building, associates development to enhance business continuity and growth."
good,This was a job that I definitely learned a lot from.  I experienced the whole process from start to finish. My first experience in management and one I will never forget!!

good,my typical day at work is a disaster. I have 5 other co workers besides me. and out the other5 two of those are sorry and lazy and don't like to do work. The hardest part of my job is doing extra work that some other workers don't like doing. I have one of the nicest manager that anyone could asked. It's take something really horrible to make him mad.
good,I have worked at Good Year for over 20 years. Over the years I developed great knowledge of many positions in the company along with aquiring many friends that became more like family.
good,"Due to new management changes all the time, there is little change in better. Co-workers are great people. Hardest part of the job is convincing associates/managers of Federal Regulations and fact of needing to follow safety rules. Mostly reactive instead of being pro-active."

good,I left after several months.  I went to a job that allowed me to do more repair work.  Good group of guys at this store but the benefits are a joke and the company keeps certain people from ever earning any time off or better pay.  Would return if an upper position was open.

I learned how to drive service trucks and document information in computer to find my parts in the storage locations. Management was good. I had fabulous supervisors who were very friendly and nice. I worked with some good and some bad people but got along very with everyone. There was really no hard part to my job because all I had to do was enter the part number in the computer and it showed me the storage location to pick it up and then take it to the designated area and drop off.

I learned many skills that I found beneficial to me such as brushing up on my forklift driving, and transporting tire tread.

good,"Its a fast pace, competitive environment.  Very stressful.  We work long hours.  The only thing I don't like is the contract negotiations every four years.  It changes anything from pay to health care to time work to closing a plant down.  Over all we work hard for the past we do get."
good,"This was a good working environment. I had a lot of hands on learning there, the management was very professional.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to help others."

good,My first professional business experience. I was focused on learning as a young employee. My manager and colleagues contributed greatly to my development. A successful company in general.
good,It's very lax working in the HR office here. The manager is not a nit picky petty person. I really enjoy my position and the freedom of it. I work at my own pace. The factory part seems like it would be stressful. A lot of heavy lifting. Don't work on the shop floor if you have lots of health problems.

good,"Goodyear India Limited is very good company. The staff member,s of this company is very supportive, They will always help,s And co-ordinates to each other,s. They are very hard working. Management is also very good of this company."
good,Great group of guys to work with and a great customer base who look forward to your assistance on a regular basis. Most days are very busy with work always coming in and out. The customers looking for your help always make the job worth while.
good,They did you have good supportive management.  So I had to complete the job in my own.  I liked working alone.  Did you know when you would get off of work at night.  I was to get off at 7:00 p.m. but always worked at least to 7:30 or 8:00 p.m.

The job in itself was amazing. all of the coworkers were a blast to hang around including management,. There were usually never any arguments and the task that were asked to get completed were achieved in a timely fashion. The most difficult part of the job was on busy days when there were only a few techs at the shop and things needed to be completed in a manner that was next to impossible. On the other hand of that being at the shop with close friends and laughing and joking around while things were getting done may have been the greatest thing about that job."

What tire machines are being ran, who going to what machine. And what they expect of you, to do get rate. I learned how tires are produced, because I didn't know. I also learned that building a tire requires a lot of components and it goes through a lot before it gets to me, you and the customer. I don't think there is a hard part of the job.
