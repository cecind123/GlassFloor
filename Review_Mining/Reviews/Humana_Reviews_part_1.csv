rating,review
bad,This was the worst company to work for. There was no schedule flexibility at all. They were not considerate of others. The environment was unprofessional. The managers always stayed on their phones. I'll never go back.
bad,Rather not say this started out to be a great company and then they started moving leaders around and switching things up and it wasn’t the same anymore I would not recommend anyone to work for this company
bad,We were required to be there from 6am-9pm during AEP or we were threatened with not making goals or loosing the job. Extremely clicky and the managers were rude and incompetent. I would not recommend this position to anyone who is pursing school.
bad,They say they are diverse but they are not. There is no advancement. Managers are not trained and are incompetent. Pay is not well neither.They say they do not micromanage but they do.
bad,Needs reconstruction. The company needs to do better evaluation on the employees and Management. Also offer better incetives and training and employment opportunities.
bad,"Nenhum profissional tem valor para essa empresa, ao contrário do nome, é um trabalho desumano. Plantões valores baixos, desorganização de escalas, coordenação despreparada em gestão de pessoas, enfermeiros sobrecarregados, descaso com familiares e pacientes. Prestadores de serviços insatisfeitos."
bad,Started off great but now the management only cares about work getting done. Disrespectful to employee’s  and there is no one to speak to about issues due to friendships between leadership
bad,"Management admitted to putting me in training with one who had no training or patience with teaching.I was told by management that I was doing a great job, while performing my duties while my so-called teacher was away. When she returned, I was let go for not doing well. I left knowing I was being told a lie. It was not worth the trouble. Management at this facility does not know how to behave professionally in all circumstances. I am not an employee scorned. Just one who didn't have one-half the chance. Sincerely..."
bad,"just awful, bad management, bad culture, no time off, no benefits, terrible all around. everyone is paid different rates. They'll fire you if you get sick."
bad,"Health insurance customer service"
bad,"It was nice and fun while it lasted, then they changed management, destroyed our pay and benefits and broke us off of the company to a straw company so they can be better at fraud. Now it is called Conviva Health Care!!!!"
bad,They are slave drivers that under pays you. The cops y as a whole do not appreciate you. They do not care nothing about your personal life or family. Horrible place to work.
bad,"Management is unreliable, favoritism and laxed with particular CNAs... The staffing coordinators are incompetent and inefficacious when to patient schedules and needs... Some employees give 100% and management on the other hand, gives less than 25%..."
bad,Everyone is ghetto they talk to you any way they want. There are rules but only enforced to certain people because of my issues with everything there is a discrimination investigation going on.
bad,"Poor communication dismiss internal employees and recruit from outside what they call ""reef"". Hasn't commitment to employees. Managers don't say ""good morning"" Nothing polite.  Do not follow their values.  You will win a little bit well but you will suffer."
bad,no review i didnt enjoy it managers were not nice they were mean they were fake and treated employes not very good i felt very small at this company they didnt help me when i neened help it was a very stress related job and i wasnt given a chance to excell
bad,"Attitude reflects leadership "
bad,Call center was stressful and fast paced. Humana monitored phone call and gave feedback on what went wrong in the call. Hard to get any days off for vacation or personal time.
bad,Would Not work for this company ever again. Tie off being beaten up by management.  I also went to my supervisor with a problem with compliance was told im not a team player because compliance was being broken. I should have called it in ti hide but went to mt Supervisor who went to manager who botched me out...if only state of insurance in Wisconsin knew what they did.
bad,I trained 9 weeks. I ended up teaching my self once we hit the phones. I was a inbound contacts rep 2. They just dont care. I seen 4 people from my training class miss for no reason. I was let go because of attendance. I was just one min late from break and was never late. They pick who they want. Micromanaging as heck.You have to park 5 blocks away from building and arrive 15 min before each shift
bad,"This place is horrible, very ghetto fabulous, mandatory OT, no chance at advancement upper management is horrible.  This place is very unprofessional and you have to be friends with management to advance"
bad,The training was a joke. Was even told the class was computer based and they didn’t expect u to know anything til u reached the floor. Computer never worked and no one cared. Unrealistic goals and no one helped. If they did answer a question they had an attitude. Stressful and worst job I have ever had
bad,"When you first interview everything seems great, but everything isn’t what it seems. Promotions are based on favoritism. Employees are overworked and under trained. The management are completely unprofessional."
bad,"I’m not the one to complain about any job, I work and I go home. But this isn’t a good job. Leadership is horrible. And are always making constant changes and expect service levels to match these DAILY changes. They don’t have the capacity to service everybody’s needs. They make the job seem so easy when your signing on but in reality it’s a circus. They block out PTO at random times because their service levels are so high. They nag you about stats constantly when your just trying to keep up with the daily changes. Your can forget about any constructive trainings outside of new hire training- they will put it off or give you a 20 minute run down and throw you to the sharks. This company will make the job seem so relaxing and easy but forget to tell you the company is unprofessional, understaffed and unrealistic.Oh and benefits are horrible."
bad,To much favoritism. Not a healthy working environment. Leadership discursion should not be considered and everything should go through human resources
bad,"This is not the best place to work. They expected me to travel over 100 miles per day to see their patients. Patients were great, no issues there. Management was ok."
bad,"Worst job I ever had in my longstanding career as a pharmacist. Out of many pharmacists hired, majority quit within a few months. Terrible hours, very poor management with unrealistic expectations. In order to meet hourly quota of cases per hour there is no time to take bathroom breaks. Mentally draining and not worth the salary. No regrets on quitting!"
bad,"This Work environment was Poor and lacked good communication by management.  Lack of communication from all management levels.  There were some positives, but the uncertainty of job stability was always present due to numerous previous layoffs."
bad,Below industry pay and overly demanding unreasonable management.  They talk a big game about inclusiveness and work life balance but the reality is they dont care about people and view them as simply replaceable
bad,Too much work! It doesn't even match the pay. You worry about job security. You notice people around you are being laid off and you wonder who's next. Then its you...
bad,"Difficult position, unreasonable production standards, unsympathetic management; little opportunity for advancement; difficult schedules from 6am till Midnight."
bad,The HUMANA in IRVING is the worst. Unprofessional.  Supervisors have no clue of what a front line rep. does day in and day out and they don't care. they are all about talking about their personal lives and texting or even handling their real estate business.  A complete disgrace.
bad,A typical day at work would be challening and exciting to meet the quota for processing prior authorizations. I learned to process prior authorizations in a speedy and accurate manner. The management was very friendly and helpful when I had questions. The culture of the workplace was pretty much laid back and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was pacing to work the queue to get the great numbers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you did your job correctly and met the criteria for the day.
bad,"it sucks. if you get sick, they don't care as long as you are on the phone. you basically cant have a life or a family to work here. they don't care about anyone but them. if you're in school that doesn't matter either. i wish i never would have worked there. it was too stressful and if you didn't speak Spanish, you were treated different. i would tell anyone to run far away from this company!!!It's a SCAM!!!!!!! They tell you one thing to get you in the door and then they lie to you once you are in there.DO NOT WORK HERE!!!!WORST PLACE EVER!!!"
bad,would not recommend this job it was nice to learn something new just not a good fit for my future goals. management was not organized pay roll always had issues mandatory overtime was a constant basis
bad,"Poor management. Management doesn't care about your life outside of work. They treat you like you're a robot, just there to take calls and never show appreciation. You are micromanaged. Very hard to get time off. Attendance policy is ridiculous. Supervisors do as they please, come and go when they want. When calls are graded, they deduct points for every little thing. A lot of favoritism. Schedule bids every quarter, very hard to ever keep the same schedule. 30 minute lunches, ridiculous. DO NOT WORK HERE!!!"
bad,"You get hired on for one job and before you know it they are training you for 5 other jobs with no pay increase."
bad,soul sucking corporate monkey's. They promote idiots and get rid of the best and brightest. No appreciation for a good agent . the mentality is to is hire a new agent and to replace the seasoned veteran. the promoted idiots cannot develop or foster a good working environment. They only now how run off the people that would serve the company best. This is done by the idiot management to prevent anyone else coming in and shining brighter than them.
bad,They did not allow me sick days and would not take any doctors notes . My son had emergency surgery and they told me if I didn’t come to work I would be terminated .
bad,This company only calls when they are ready to call you. I’ve been working for them a month and haven’t gotten a client yet. Everytime they call me they think i suppose to jump the same day to a client. They are not professional at all. Also they ask me over and over when am i available. I answered those same question all the tome. It never change and i still haven’t gotten a client.
bad,I worked with this company for 11 years. Front Line Leaders and Team Leads alike all give different answers for the same question. All play favorites and God forbid you need time off for religious purposes or you get sick because they hit you with compliance for every single time you get sick or have a sick kid. They don't care about there Members they just care about the Average talk time. They ride you  about talk time instead of caring about empathy or concern for members. They talk a big game about empathy and Personal touch but God forbid you actually take your time with member and go above and beyond. You aren't appreciated for doing that.
bad,I hated working here. There was a lot of favoritism and they hired friends and family. There was a lot of drama and I was glad when I left. I had a lot of issues while working with Humana and they were willing to work with me.
bad,"Humana is a Fortune 500 company. They have great benefits and I loved their wellness program. Negotiate better pay than $15 entry level. Department I was promoted to had 15 hours of mandatory OT for months so there was no work/life balance, super stressful and overwhelming. You have to be super fake in order to move up with the company and kiss booty. Last supervisor was so gruesome looking, I had nightmares about her face yo, she was double dog ugly, but that's neither here nor there."
bad,"typical working day is stressful there is a lot of good nurses and coordinators that has left"
bad,"this company does not care about the employees who work for them , management doesn't honor the open door policy, and there is no corrective action for management who do not know how to do their jobs appropriately."
bad,When your manager ask you to tell her what you think and she does not like it she lets you go the next day not sure what else you want to know the manger staff does not care about you or what you saying knowing what is said is true if you don't drink what they are giving out they done want you
bad,If you are not friends with a manager or know someone there you are stuck in The worst position. I got downscored for the same thing another rep did not get down scored for a d was advised that it depends on who listens to the calls and how they want to score you. This is ridiculous. It should be the same across the board for everyone. And if you are not a minority or again have a friend in management position you will. It be recognized and you will be picked on. I tried to get help (like another employee for the same Hardship reason and I was denied. But yet becuase she was in the minority group she got her rent paid and diapers and food for her kids. When I applied for the same help I was denied. They discriminate.  They also fired me during recovery after my back surgery. The day after back surgery I had a seizure and fell so I’m pretty sure that added to the failed back surgery that I had. Regardless they never tried to work with me on anything. If I applied for time off I was denied. They denied me for everything but someone else of not my race could ask for the same thing and they would be approved. If you are Caucasian and have no degree only experience don’t work here. Or take a chance they may like you just my experience.
bad,"Management was completely ineffective and absent and did not recognize the achievements of good employees, instead promoting bad employees. No real footprint in Michigan."
bad,The company in Raleigh is not a decent one . Many friends getting promotions but not the ones who actually do a professional job. High school part two.
bad,"Thank you for the opportunity. I was able to help people which is my biggest focus in life.                                                                                                             "
bad,"I feel humana is nice entering but everyone became very mean very fast. I enjoyed the job, the pay and the company but the people were manipulative and belittling."
bad,"I would NOT recommend this job or company to ANYONE. Employees are not valued at all and the company has a very low morale. Also, the pay does not match the workload in which they're constantly changing rules, policies, and other issues that add to the already stressful work environment. LOTS of micro-managing going on as well! It's no surprise that they're always hiring because people don't stay employed there for long!"
bad,"Company misclassified ee as exempt salaried dumps the job of 2 full time employees on people refuses to pay overtime (even if you are forced to file lawsuit) works ees to the point of chronic illness and near death, refuses to pay disability, etc. Humana management believes they are above the law and violates every federal employment law. When information is brought to their attention HR will turn blind eye and ignore complaint and blame complaining ee for everything management did. Management is beyond abusive, creates a severe hostile environment that is intolerable to work in. If you try to hold onto your job, their abuse will increase to another level. And due to all the overtime and abusive work environment it becomes a dangerous situation, so dangerous you are afraid and 2 sick to return. So abusive, even your doctor will  say no you can not return. If you complain to HR you will be ignored. Still, 5 years later, nightmares continue on. Corporate America management has become so abusive and out of control and on a power trip that people are near dead trying to survive. Then they will refuse to terminate employment or work with you to move you to a different location and trap you to the abusive role. When you have to go on disability, their torture will continue and they will deny paying disability and even deny paying your meds you need to function trying to recuperate from their damage they caused. It's just the worst experience I've ever had but this is corporate America.And they can do whatever they want and get away with it. This is a criminal employer that should"
bad,is a bad company bad mannagement they do not do good to their promises and other things like manager using ee for things not allowed and as well take breaks when there are issue on the floor
bad,"this was a horrible job, would never go back again. Manaement was horrible, there was no advancement, the managers didnt really help at all and it was just horrible."
bad,Work environment is not employee friendly is not a good place to work.  Strictly sales and what have you done for me lately.  Management team lacks diversity.
bad,"none terrible"
bad,"It was not what I expected it to be from such a nationwide Company,  the managers and also other coworkers were rude I didn't receive much respect and wasn't appreciate of my work ethic"
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to this company. The management is absolutely horrible. Schedules and pay are horrible. Please do not apply. The job is very stressful and unorganized. If you report your supervisor they retaliate, even though that is not tolerated."
bad,This is so poorly run that it's a joke!!  Pretty much anything goes as long as Humana doesn't find out about it.  You wouldn't believe what all goes on there.
bad,they have their clicks ...if they didn't like you not in the special club even if your a just minding your business. the set the goal to high most of them are not reachable.
bad,Meetings went nowhere. The Culture had me on my own and no one to bounce ideas off of because the workload was too high and no time availability. I would not recommend.
bad,Humana is not a company any sane person should work for.  The culture at Humana is horrible.  The turn-over rate is out of the roof.  I dreaded everyday going to that place...
bad,Bad Treatment to employees the company do not care about employees needs what the deal with or how they are treated management is a joke they hiring and put people who know both about the position in management position they are not willing to help or anything
bad,"I chose not to submit a company review at this time."
bad,"Employees do not matter to this company.  It is all about the money.  They don't care about their employees or their consumers.  It's all about cutting corners to save money and denying coverage. The management is cold, unreachable and uncaring."
bad,It was a very bad  job  to  work at!! No room for  growth.No  type of training  and people in  charge the were not trained.Worked there for four years and only one raise
bad,no advancement; moving into another department will always be blocked; I would not recommend working in CIT; Don't do it; find something else; and management was horrible
bad,"When I initially started with Humana it was a wonderful place to work."
bad,Unfortunately i had an unfortunate experience with Humana. I was one of their top performers i exceeded expectations each time. I was rewarded employee of the month three times in my first year and i was still mistreated by my manager every single day.
bad,The job itself is easy but working with management is horrible. They don't care about you as a person or anything outside of Humana. All they worry about is the numbers. There is a lot of favoritism that takes place.
bad,"Easily the most heartless, cutthroat, ruthless management I have ever worked for.   They are always looking to cut positions, regardless of the ripple effect on the organization.   Absolutely no concern for work-life balance.  Managers will crawl over dead bodies to get ahead."
bad,hated working at the humana call center. never going back. the call center was awful with management. the environment was dirty. there were bed bugs in the carpet and the ac went out in the middle of the summer.
bad,"Lots of backstabbing, only got an advancement if you were on your superiors good side. Did not look at employees self worth, very stress full, lack of communication. No respect for employees"
bad,I was so unhappy when I worked for Humana. The management was awful and if you tried to talk to anyone about anything they didn't listen. I was treated so awful by a coach that I complained to Human Resources and later she got a promotion. That makes no sense.
bad,"perfect, I exceled over top in customer service over 300 employees. I really enjoyed learning Medicare and Medicaid for the first time. It opened up many doors to the key to success for my future and over well learning to move forward with any health insurance company based off of comprehensive health management. I am a dedicated individual and my work ethnic shows right throw. My compassion for health and helping people with their health insurance means a lot to me because I am the same person member, patient that is on the phone with me...."
bad,"This company is the devil. It's not worth your life."
bad,If you are looking for growth this is not the company for you. The pay is average but they can do much better.They lack good leadership and does not give out bonus.
bad,"Constantly threatening from Management for production to get numbers up and when you did get your numbers up they accuse you of rigging the system and no open door to HR they will side with Management and stab you in the back and terminate you for doing what the Management wanted you to do.  A certain Manager was buying young girls gifts and there is a lot of favoritisum in the office amoung Management.  They let people go based on age, if they don't like you or jealously.  HR will not protect you so do not go to them they will side with Management and they most drfinately will retailiate against you and fire you if you do go to report any thing to HR they for o good reason fired me for reporting bad behavior to HR.  True Story!"
bad,Humana is a stressful environment to work. Where you are given little to no acknowledgement of your successes and are treated unfairly when you error. Management is unskilled and that is reflected in their inability to comprehend the lackluster environment they foster.
bad,Wasted a year here and was never praised for my accomplishments but was surely put down when minor mistakes happened. And no room for growth even though people get fired around the clock. Never again!
bad,"Terrible company, awful managers. None of the managers know what they are doing. They promote a bunch of kids to manager positions, and if you don't fit in there little click, they treat you like SH**. All they do is gossip. The turnover right is high."
bad,Very stress company to work for and if management has it in for you it will be a bad outcome. The culture is not a positive one to be in.  Hardest part of the job is always being on pins and needles with work.
bad,This company is all about making money. There is no true care or concern for the customer. Just push the promotions Silver Sneakers magazines ect. When patients have real issues there is no resolve
bad,"Horrible hours, horrible management. Very stressful. Lots of mandatory overtime which some people may like but for me, I'd rather spend it with family. Not flexible"
bad,"It honestly was the worst place to work for.  Management was horrible, people talking down to you. employees doing drugs on site. Did not want you to get up from your desk to go to the bathroom"
bad,don't ever work here. micromagement. Hostile environment
bad,At the Plymouth location no body talks to each other or helps each other. If you want a team environment this is not the place to work. Humana does not know how to treat their employees with respect. There is not a break room and you eat at your desk. They lead through bullying and fear.
bad,"Poor management. if you have children stay away! They do not care if you miss work, have to leave, etc to take care of your child/children. The only thing they care about is if you are at your desk working and working the mandatory overtime most departments have. You are over worked and under paid constantly being asked to do more also in most departments as I have now worked in 3 different departments. This is a stressful job contantly wondering if your going to have a job or not. Most of the time poeple can not hit the numbers they are asking you to meet which will eventually cause you to lose you job."
bad,"I worked for Humana for 4 years (surprisingly). Humana has unrealistic expectations and quotas. In the 4 years, I seen the entire floor turn over 3 times. There is no job security! They make TL's and FLL's from other departments that know nothing about the floor, department or the people. The department becomes very political (favs). If you're not one the favs you don't get promoted. It don't matter if you work hard."
bad,not what I signed up for and this is not the job for me. I have to wait a year before I can transfer to another department if I make it that long because every day is something different
bad,a lot of issues during training. When tried to get more orientation due so many issues it was not allowed. Mentor was rude and not helpful at all.  The job was more like telemarketing than actually something helpful for people.
bad,This is THE most petty company ever to work for.  It is full of unqualified personnel and the company is always bordering on violating labor laws.  This company is the pits.
bad,"Humana has had multiple lay offs in the last year. Humana has new management and there is no job security for people anymore. Job requirements change and this position was no exception, except requirements were changing almost daily."
bad,"not a fun work place  you work for home only face to face interaction with co-workers is during monthly meeting. Most interaction co-worker and supervisors is via skype, link or cell phone."
bad,Unproductive work environment due to the fact that a bunch of number crunchers are trying to run a clinical department. Micromanaged and too many changes at once. Systems often down with no word about mitigation. A bunch of old-timers were forced into early retirement. Pay is terrible for what you do.
bad,"the company promotes the balance of work and quality of life, but expects it's temps and perm employees to work 7 or 6 days a week for months straight."
bad,it can be a stressful job depends on the area you work in and your manger. Grievance & Appeals is a stressful area to work in they do not have a training curriculum you train by side by sides.
bad,Unfavorable workplace. Just not a good place to work. Picketers outside constantly complaining about the company. Managers always scheduling very unnecessary meetings.
bad,"Humana has several divisions and programs.  In Tucson, they collaborated with Health Essentials and we did Palliative to Hospice Care for patients."
bad,"I cannot speak on every department, but the department that I was in was not organized. The managers didn't know rules and regulations. No wonder our department was eliminated due to the managers we were given."
bad,Very cut throat environment. Managers do not have your best interest at heart. They do not treat employees with respect. They show favoritism and they only care about their paycheck.
bad,"Horrible work atmosphere, management was horrible if you weren't in her gossip click you were blackballed. Too much favoritism It did not matter if you were professional and arrived to work everyday and on time. Very unprofessional management  Waterside building is the ghetto Humana run by ghetto front line leaders and managers. Stay clear from the 4th floor!"
bad,"cut throat, rude, ignorant in knowing how to communicate, unfair pay, discriminated by favorites, unprofessional, hostile environment, and  self aborted individuals who does not care of others feelings nor space."
bad,The supervisor was unprofessional and nonchalant and he just did not communicate was taught one thing and than that changed everyone was on different pages
bad,"Management is poor, company does not care for workers, a coworker of mine mother passed away and the did not want her to take off work because they felt they needed her at work more."
bad,"Humana is an extremely conservative company with no diversity. People who did not deserve to be promoted were promoted constantly, new ideas are not embraced, and the company as a whole is old and not innovative. You can see this by the products inferiority in the market place."
bad,"a typical day at work would be to take call deal with upset members getting yelled at. when you need help theres no management around, if your not on there team you wont get help. you could by taking a call with someone so rude that is always cussing at you, the job is stressful or makes you stress when you have an older person yelling at you saying if they dint get there meducation they will die or that its our fault. working for humana is stressful and they pay is not worth it"
bad,a joke a is the issue here if you want to be screwed her is the place for you it is a place for kiss tale people here you go this the job for you its crazy
bad,Humana was a stressful job. I was trained only to take verification on benefits and in 1 day they trained me to handled a numerous amount of calls. I was to handle about 5 different lines and didn't feel I had the experience. Communication with the supervisors was also very challenging.
bad,They don't give raises and they beat you up every day on how you do your job.  Who needs to be beat down each day and have your systems going down EVERY DAY.  It is super super stressful and they simply don't care about their employees.  and they don't care that their systems are absolutely terrible and that their quality checks and balances are brutal.
bad,"this project was shut down, I hated it anyways. The pay sucked and the managers didnt care about anything that was going on. poor management and the worst pay ever. the had high risk situations were they would neglect."
bad,"the job was stressful with no motivations. The teachers were ok, but not enough training to have yo go live and deal with some many different scenarios."
bad,Company will work you to death and Humana does not support nurses.  At the drop of a hat they will fire you or lay you off literally over night. They are truly the worst insurance company i have ever worked for.
bad,never again will i work with that company.  You have to fill out a form and tell them why you think you deserve a raise??? Not off our performance but what I say matters most
bad,"I don't have anything good to say about humana. they don't treat their employees right and lie to their members about coverage, often times bullying them into it for the money."
bad,hated this place horrible management disgusting co-workers. low pay very little benefits. no respect for people personal life or color i hated this job i would never do call centers again
bad,"I worked for Humana Government business which is TRICARE and management was horrible. Getting PTO was impossible, they denied every time. The leads they had to assist you were rude and treated you like it was a burden asking them for help. They were so strick in taking your breaks on the exact time they had you scheduled it was very micromanaged and unforgiving"
bad,Humana is by far the WORST job I've ever had.  I wouldn't recommend them to someone looking for a job or someone looking for insurance.  Their medicare sales is a very stressful work environment filled with lots of pressure and anxiety.  Management only adds to this stress.
bad,they treat their staff bad. They pile you with all these trainings and make it hard to focus on the task. the pressure is overloading. you dont have enough time on your breaks to degress. i hated this job
bad,"in the beginning it seems very good atmosphere.  then as the weeks went by, people began not showing up for work.  then you learn they did show up, they were escorted from the building and not able to report to their offices for duty.  there was never a proper release, just immediate disposal of your position."
bad,I just don't want to talk about it just not a good company in the end as far as the learning was ok but not management. they need to straight forward with there people.
bad,"ledningen var ej bra, de andra arbetarna var inte trevliga, det svåraste med jobbet var att se hur otrevliga de var mot kunden varje dag."
bad,Worked as a pharmacy tech for Humana and they are Completely HORRIBLE. They are constantly demanding more work of their employees with no extra pay. Management couldn't care less about you as a human but more of a typing robot only concerned with how much money you are making the company. Stay away from this place. It's run by a bunch of greedy CEOs. They lure you in with the higher pay rate but you're basically a slave behind a desk being watched at all times. Their heath insurance is Garbage and has huge co pays and deductibles. Awful company stay away.
bad,"I worked for this call center for awhile, at one point I told an elderly lady, who was being covered by us before, that we no longer would cover her 12000$ life saving medication. I left the job shortly after that."
bad,"I have nothing good to say about this company I. Thought it was going to be a permanent job as I was told, but that turned out to be a lie. Supervisors are only there for themselves."
bad,"Another job that when you initially apply, your expecting to work in the field you applied in, but then get told you're doing duel jobs with low pay. They lied about the actual job. Terrible attitudes to from management and co-workers."
bad,Required 60 hours per week to achieve quotas.  The rules and policies change frequently. Training for position is inadequate and inconsistent. Computers crash frequently and interfere with important call back tasks and must be rescheduled with members. The training sessions on the computer are difficult to hear and lack direction. Micro management /criticism along with high work loads and inadequate training = FAILURE!  When will they learn.....NEVER!
bad,"This is the absolute worst job ever!!!!! Management is prejudiced and if you don't brown nose and kiss butt there is no chance for advance, such a popularity contest. Stress is high metrics are impossible and the whole atmosphere is cutthroat! I say run the other way!"
bad,Horrible job. Underpaid. Poor management. The company doesn't tell you about shift bids and the limitation of a two year contract until the end of your long 13 week training.
bad,"The training is awful and the directives change daily. For training, they give you powerpoints to read and a caseload to attend to right away. At times, they have to shadow other workers but they just do not have time. The Front Line Leaders do not do the training. There is no work life balance. They are undergoing a law suit which is public knowledge for lack of overtime pay and it is a continuous issue. Front Line Leaders are not well trained (except for maybe one) or prepared to lead their teams and are not supportive. Half of the workers are not working as hard and the other half are. There is a discrepancy in work assignments. There are retaliative practices. This has been ongoing for years. Even when things have been reported to HR  - nothing is done about it. There is no voice for the workers. It is all about numbers. The clients are the best part, but unfortunately are affected by the system. There is a lack of organization. Companies change all the time, but this company continuously changes at ridiculous rates and nothing works. There is also a lack of communication and upper management appears not to be aware of what's going on or perhaps does not care. The LTC program Humana is by far the least competent out of all the LTC programs in Dade county. That is why they are hiring contract workers to make up for all the work that everyone is behind in because they cannot seem to catch up, but they refuse to accept constructive criticism or ideas from the worker on process improvement."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company . Long hours plus poor supervisors. The conditions Were not great. They provide no benefits. The long hours talking was not easy
bad,"I was laid off.  my position was out sourced to another country.  in fact, my entire department was laid off and our positions were sent to India for cheaper labor."
bad,"The office was clean.  Software and phone system was outdated.  Unsupportive management, and no team effort.  Unnecessary production sabotage and overtime retaliation."
bad,"it was the worst job I ever had, the employees the people that actually did work were good, management was as horrible as could be, I do not recommend them."
bad,most terrible for profit I have ever been employed and cuts to allow shareholders to cash in extra money while increasing costs to patients and decrease in quality
bad,"busy work day"
bad,"This place is micromanaged, don't give scheduled breaks and could careless about their employees.  Turnover is very high and advancement opportunities are non existent."
bad,not a good place to work if you are looking for professionalism.  I was not comfortable with a lot of the day to day things that took place with this company when it came to dealing with the elderly
bad,The company is laying off thousands of employees and then places these open vacancies to  make it seem as if it is not hurting financially. The company is not stable. I have a lay off date effective 4/2017.
bad,"The Manager was the most unprofessional, intimidating person I have ever encountered. Even though the turnover of employees continues and complaints are made it is apparent Humana does not care. The cycle continues."
bad,"No room to move up although they will tell you there is room. Compensation for workload is absolutely horrendous. Even though it's a health insurance company they sure don't make sure their employees are taken care of with their coverage."
bad,"I was one of the many schedulers that was hired for this company. And like the ones before and after me I saw the unstable work environment. I did not have hardly any training nor the equipment that I needed to properly do my job. I was put on other assignments and then thrown into my actual role six months after I had been there. When I was not able to be 100% accurate at my work, they tried to blame it on me. To spite the fact that I had not seen or done any scheduling since my first week of being hired. I had to use my personal email and telephone to transfer resident info because I NEVER got my fax machine that I needed. Which by the way is against hippa law. The attitudes and back stabbing was the least of my worries. I had to worry more about the lies I was being told by the management and what they were telling the other employees about me. The other schdulers were upset with me because they thought I was trying to get over but the reality was I was just doing the jobs that I was told to so by management. When I realized that things were not stable in this company, I looked and found another job. I would not wish my experience on anyone."
bad,"Unfortunately, this office managed poorly. Managers only spoke to employees to point out mistakes. Very stressful environment. Gave our department 2 day notice before they laid us off 5 days before Christmas. They notified us via telephonic conference."
bad,"DMS, the sales area, is the worst place to work for. There is  no job security at all. Management harasses you and make your life miserable when they are ready to get rid of you."
bad,"At first things were great then things went south quick.  HR wouldn't protect employees being treated unfairly, bosses were bullies and help personal grudges and bosses showed carelessness by violating an employees protected health information and sending the info out becoming viral.  My career was officially over after that it was just a matter of time.  I only miss helping the patients."
bad,"Very easy job but just like all easy jobs with power-hungry people, can quickly become the worst job on the planet. Management tolerates major favoritism. A heavy population of latinos who work hard at keeping the place 90% latinos and take away any access at management positions, lead positions or any position of power."
bad,"They do not care about their employees. It's all about the bottom line. They don't protect their employees. Medical insurance has 1,500 deductible for their employees who are bringing them the customers and the money. Insurance rates are also extremely high. Employees cannot get injured on the job or report anything that happens to them on the job without the fear of losing their their job if they report it to HR."
bad,"This was a contact assignment, the management was bad, not a friendly work environment. Unsure of your last days, sneaky underhand management."
bad,"I don't know where to begin...or end. Endless bad experience is the best I can come up with. Here it goes: impossible work; no support; expect results without information to do job; ancient, broken AS400 system. "
bad,"I have nothing good to say. If you have a life, you will not if you take a job here. They feel like they own you because you earn a paycheck"
bad,the job itself was ok at times and I say this because most of the customers were very rude! they cared nothing about the company policies they only wanted what they desired at the current times.
bad,"Working for Humana is a joke.  Their ""protocols"" are ridiculous and the pay is the worse. For a visit they pay you only $45.00 and all the work that needs to be done is insane. They do not reimburse you for mileage you have to keep track of it. "
bad,"Management failed to promote from within the company. The Company works the employees long hours. Hardly ever can request time off. Management tells you whatever you would like to hear, and fails to met what was said."
bad,"They would tell us not to let the members know we could do a mail order override on purpose so they didn't know there was still a way to provide their medication early, or if there was an error. We pretty much lied to our customers. Their plans said that things were covered, but then would find out later it wasn't covered."
bad,I have been with the company for about 8 years. I have worked in Ohio and Georgia. The Company is ok health insurance could be better
bad,"Company is just that, it is a very stressful position, metrics and overworking employees. Pay is good, that is how they suck you in, benefits eh!, raises are far and few, ""they"" say they care about employees but NOPE"
bad,"I do not like surveys, and I would rather remain neutral. I hate surveys and I will not answer any of the survey questions."
bad,"I would never work for this company again. Although I learned a lot working there, the mental anguish & stress due to inconsistent directions from Management who ""micromanaged"" to the hilt!."
bad,"I believe Humana is a great place to work unless you're in the Security Administration department. High turnover rate with a slim chance of being hired on full-time. They'll promise you the goods in your interview but a month down the road you'll realize you're a gate keeper for 100,000 employees and bottom man on the totem pole."
bad,this  company underpays the employees. I do not recommend this job to anyone. management is unprofessional and I would rather not go in to any further detail.
bad,"One of the few companies that claims to ""care"", yet their actions are polar opposite.   The only thing they care about is money.  Hire the right people for the right jobs.  The promotion process is a joke.  No reflection or review of previous assessments before deciding to hire promote or fire. Now they use a ""score card"" to ""rate"" your performance against other employees.  This company truly expects the moon and stars and there is no end to the increase in work in sight. I pity those who plan on staying. It's not getting better anytime soon, and with the lawsuits trying to block the Aetna deal, best of luck.   If you are lucky enough to have a ""decent"" coach, you are one of very few.  It is a comedy show.  Salary at 40 hours, work 40-60/week, with no compensation for same. Raises doled out at the 'discretion of the coach"", max 3% IF you get one.  Get rewarded for excellence, get fired months later seems to be the norm, and have witnessed it with many associates.  Even Schwab (401k) company confirmed the number of associates who have had to cash out due to being fired within a month of Christmas has been exponential.    Members are lied to, disgruntled, short-changed and best of luck getting ""customer service"" or any help from them,.  It is nearly non-existent and frowned upon.   Be a robot, you'll do fine here. Just don't get caught being compassionate, that'll get you written up.  If you file any complaints with HR or Ethics and Compilance PLAN on being retaliated against."
bad,"This was an experience! I truly thought that this was a customer service job and found out that this job was eventually going to require that you sale insurance to incoming callers.  "
bad,This was a temporary position and they did not treat the temporary help very nice.  We were dispensable and it was know to all.
bad,"I enjoy my job for a while but it got to the point that it became stressfull wanted to much out of me and no award for it. Enjoy my co worker they helped out alot, but mangers and suprevisor was not supporting."
bad,"- Taking calls for Medicare members"
bad,A typical work days was always the same. Everything went smoothe. I enjoyed the work environment. When first got out of training my peers was always willing to help if needed any.
bad,Manage day to day facility operations of the health risk assessment team. Perform health risk assessment to qualifying members. Explanation of benefits.
bad,"While humana is a great company to work for...its subsidiary senior bridge is a disaster and a horrible place to work.  The staff is incompetent at best.  There are no processes in place for employee who are not performing their duties.  Being a manager at this toxic place is basically being a warden at s prison. The regional director is a bleeding heart social worker who wants to ""change everyone'.  You are expected to work 24/7 with a BlackBerry that needs to be on all the time.  A dysfunctional group of people."
bad,Worked as a contract pharmacist for about 3 months. The only individuals hired full time were minority females. Creating one injustice in order to get back at another just amounts to 2 injustices.
bad,"great pay"
bad,"This company does not care about you, the individual.  They only care about $$ !  I was on telephone with IT dept. for one week from 6 AM to 6:30 AM trying to figure out what was wrong with my home computer equipment.  IT DEPT. SHOULD GO BACK TO SCHOOL!"
bad,"This people are a joke, they don't care about patients, they just care about money.  Lots of turnovers with Employees. Poor salary. They are racist with the africanerican comunity and if you are not Latino they don't need you. The doctors at the centers are absent at all times. Transportation for patients always late. If you are not part of Careplus health care you are not business for them. They even push and lie to patients to enroll them on Careplus health insurance."
bad,"Management has no idea what they are doing, but expect you to. Very terrible training! Spent more time running her personal errands then learning the system & the job."
bad,"not a great company.  "
bad,"Humana is not people friendly.  If anything comes up or happens in your life outside of work, there is no sympathy.  The environment was very much so like high school.  If you werent in with the ""cool kids"" your head was on a chopping block DAILY.  The attendence policy was horrific.  AWFUL PLACE TO WORK"
bad,"Some days was better then others. I learned a lot of medical, benefit and pharmacy terms. I under the medicare benefits and what it covers. The hardest part of the job was back to back calls and dealing with irate members."
bad,"1. I dont like the environment. "
bad,I don't want to even think about this job. Worst job ever. Nightmare on Twin Creek.
bad,"referrals, doctor calls, approval of doc. and ref., "
bad,very demanding job.Great company yet starting off its difficult to adjust to people who require so much without any type of appreciation.
bad,"Humana is fine its the Management that's the issue.  The Manager over Order Entry at Springdale needs to be let go OR demoted, she used to work for Medco and they got smart years ago by letting her go, I was told she caused too much Drama and I know that's what is the problem is in the Order Entry Dept. at Humana in Springdale.  She thinks she's all that, has people do her work so she can sit on her high horse.  If you don't ""click' with the Management forget getting ahead even if you're a GREAT worker that gets you No Where.  This one FLL that received BAD reviews from her team members (about 10 to 13 people are in a team) more than one-year in a row and is not liked by a lot of the regular employees even outside of her team members in this case because that 'FLL' was too important in letting that Manager sit on her high horse because she did a lot of her work for her so for that she's needed and stays a poor FLL to the workers.  That FLL is no longer at Springdale but is now got married (por guy) and has moved and is working at a new Humana Facility in Texas now (poor employees working for her)  When hired and during training which was to be only a meesely week and ended up throwing us on the floor a half of a week sooner our trainer told us 'Humana doesn't care what you know they only want warm bodies or head count out on the floor."". That same trainer is now an FLL (FLL is Front Line Leader).  Once again if your in the click you move up and talking bad about the company you work for like this person did, didn't matter.  So if you work there and want to move up just get in"
bad,"This was not a fun place to work, you did not get to do anything Monday-Friday."
bad,"Never believe anything they say! They lie to everyone!  They set you up to fail and are always changing things so you can't master them.  Never report anything because although they say they have an open door policy, they will get rid of you without even blinking!  YOu can never know what to expect when you go in each day.  Your co-workers will be just as mad about their job as you are so don't expect anyone to care.  The management is terrible.  They will not promote you if your ethnic race is white and never cross another race because if you are white you don't have a chance.  Also, the people that do actually move up anywhere are idiots.  So expect that you won't have support from your management.  TURN BACK NOW!  THIS IS A TERRIBLE PLACE TO WORK!"
bad,The management at Humana try hard to fire you instead of helping. Its like tip toeing on thin ice. The medical benefits are outragous. Employer does not give pay raises. Company Micro Manages and they do not consentrate on whats important. 
bad,they don't pay for the work you put in and the travel . I wouldn't refer this place to no one.
bad,Awful and management is bad. I would not recommend this place to anyone. They will not work there long
bad,no consistency. you literally have to be friends with the right person in order to move up. Too much favortism
bad,"Upon joining the DSI team at Humana (as a contractor, of course) I was essentially thrown into the mix with little training or guidance outside of a few more knowledgeable co-workers and an online document database which was often long out dated. I was assigned to work in the basement of a musty building where we got no cellular reception nor internet connectivity outside of Humana's extremely locked down network - meaning I couldn't access the majority of things I needed for my contracting company. Webmail? Not a chance."
bad,Management is out of the office 4 of the 5 days of the week.
bad,"Never will work for this company again. Everything about it is saying make this organization Rich while making our employees Poor. Even though its health insurance company, it doesn't provide Any medical insurance for their employees. Pay is sickening for all that is required and their policies are awful."
bad,"The only that I learned about that company, that if you don't know or have a connection inside of the company, you don't have the change to be inside of the company."
bad,I hated working there MANAGEMENT HAD THEIR FAVORITES BLAH BLAH BLAH
bad,the job was very unorganized there was no room for advancement
bad,"Low pay, Bad hours, outbound cold calling, Call Center enviroment. Lots of promises made to get you hired, but after that your just a number. Upper Mgmt. is evil and will fire you for any reason at all. The Mgr's there even hate it as well but are stuck. Worst job I have ever had. Do not go to work at the Call center at Net Park in Tampa. This place is very bad. Trust me, i quit after 2 yrs of lies. I was a Top Agent in Sales."
bad,"A typical day at work involved hundreds of calls from frustrated customers who had been contacted to pay back money from as far back as 2001, or they would loose access to their spending accounts that their employer contributes to."
bad,This company is not a good company to work for. They have you work 40 hours a week and then cut you back to 20 hours to no hours. How do a person suppose to live off of that
bad,Morning huddles with the daily information of numbers to be pushed out by the end of the day. I learned that you have to be competitive about your everyday work performance. Management says they are there for you but really they care more about their own job then you as a person. Co-workers get along fine as long as they don’t feel there job is on the line. The hardest part about the job understanding a new work load that you might have been trained on for only a few short hours. The most enjoyable part about the job is when you have done time
bad,"I do not recommend employment with Humana MarketPOINT in Pensacola. It may seem like a great place to work but just the opposite. Every company experiences inner-office politics but Humana MarketPOINT is well above average. Humana employees are subjected to a hostile environment of fear, intimidation, discrimination, lack of respect and hypocrisy. I wish I had done more research on the company's culture before accepting the position."
bad,"Very militant. Low wages - paid salaried to avoid the long hours/overtime pay. If you're good at your job you will be stuck with no advancement opportunities. It's all about who you know. High turnover, poorly trained management."
bad,"One ethnic group permitted one hour lunch breaks while another - 30 minutes, same with late excuses (ex. live wire across road causing tardy, one race forgiven). Blatant retaliation by management. Rapid turnover with management, negatively impacting training. Health insurance coverage is more expensive even than small companies. Research the web for other feedback."
bad,"I would not recommend this location to anyone. Very high turnover, treat their employees like children. It sounds crazy, but their pitiful training sets you up for failure and seems they like to  make people feel dumb or that they are asking stupid questions. If your not a friend of the mgmnt crew or a brown-noser you will not be successful there."
bad,"There is not good managers in NJ, they are not respectful and don’t know the area."
bad,Compensation commission lacks equality from person to person and position to position. Office dynamic and inclusiveness is not available in most office spaces limited mentorship and job development opportunities. All around boys club not of effective place for women and women's growth.
bad,"I will continue to work for call centers but never for Humana, they over worked us and treated us like trash. I had a new born and needed to be off before 5:30 but the job was not trying to hear it. That’s when the job was getting to fruasted and i couldnt even pick up my new born from daycare so i had to leave and find something new"
bad,"Stressful. Not loyal to their employees. Over work you and under pay you. The only advantage of working there is the possibility of working at home. Bad management. High turnover. They hire a load of people, and then"
bad,"Terrible department and management was a joke. If you were not a brown noser, then you will not succeed at Humana. Management had favorites and when you escalated your concerns, you are black balled. I would never return if Humana was the last position on this earth."
bad,"Do not work I’m the PA department! They hire Lpn but the leadership and managers are all RN / BSN and the power trip is the biggest I have seen in over 9 years . They treat you like pre k .   Very disrespectful and condemn . You come into a different setting burned out from the floor think is going to be a breath of fresh air .... your frustration after 6 will have u think you rather go back to the floor so you feel you  or emails with holiday are coming  you can’t finish work until you are done .... sorry if is your kids birthday ..... hat aa bad taste on my mouth ... thahave a voice nemail with can you explain to me ,"
bad,"I was promised several opportunities and never received them. The company takes extra money from you if you don't join go365...The company has a way of convincing you that you'll excell within the company, but you just have to commit to 18 months in the same position (but you don't find that out until after you're actually well into your probationary period)"
bad,The managers will create lies on u if u are not their favorite they will drag u thru the mud!  I have been there for a yr and it was the worst decision of my life
bad,"Humana seems to pay a decent wage, however after you see all the work they throw at you.... any position other than management is underpaid. There are no bathroom breaks outside of your scheduled 15 min break. The work life balance is absolutely HORRIFIC! During peak season (the end of august til december) there is no time off, nor can you go home for any reason, WITHOUT YOU JOB BEING THREATENED."
bad,All about the money and keeping people from utilizing their benefits and making ridiculous restrictions to include making medicine so unaffordable for senior citizens that most go without.... all about profit!!!
bad,"Humana, as a company, is becoming more difficult to work for.  The culture of the company has changed negatively within the past 4 years.  There are unrealistic expectations coupled with poor management from the director position down.  Outside sales is in constant conflict with inside sales.  Humana is difficult to work with regarding salaries and bonuses.  Long-tenured agents (14+ years) are being forced to do twice the work to maintain their books because of the persistent issues with technology and leadership."
bad,"Humana says they want you to have a good work-home balance but there is so much mandatory OT that you can never plan anything outside of work. There is also shift bids at least 2x a year because they can’t seem to manage the volume of calls and so many people leave because of the toxic environment so your schedule can change constantly. They claim it’s based on your performance for you to receive “your” choice of schedule, but my metrics have always been in the top 5 of my department and I was given my 13th choice of schedule in the last shift bid. New programs are rolled out, you are given about a 20 minute web based training and then told to run with it. There is no follow up and the calls are back to back for 10 hours a day so you sink or swim on your own. Management just does not care! I loved it for the first 4 years but the new regime is making it hard for all the tenured people to not hunt for another job!"
bad,The management at the call center needs work. They are very rude and and incompetent. They will not be able to help you solve any problems because they really don’t know anything about Humana
bad,Avoid at all costs. The people working here are not that polite. My supervisor was a mess. Barely spoke any English. My team lead loved to throw parties and potlucks. She's useless. I didn't like my time here at all
bad,"It was good at the beginning. After training you were put out there with no help, if veteran employees help the manager and leads tell you to stop asking them and let the leader line help but half the time they arent available. When it's time for to go home, requests come in by fax they tell you that you have to stay and make it mandatory, and don't care if you have to get your kids or other plans. Coworkers arent on one accord they are only out for themselves."
bad,"This place is supposed to be built on integrity, no one in the Killeen Humana campaign represents any of the positive and motivational characteristics. Pay is horrible for all the work and stats they want you to reach. I stayed under the radar here and always followed my scheduled breaks and lunches on time, always came to work and did overtime aside from mandatory overtime, always exceeded my stats or making most of them and still go treated like nothing. No matter what they say about growth opportunities it’s not happening unless your besties with the higher ups."
bad,"The pay is too low for the workload and expectations. The mandatory overtime is ridiculous. You can forget work/life balance if you choose to work here. "
bad,"They were dishonest regarding the amount of vacation and how I could use it. Also chose to change shifts to help business needs, then was denied the opportunity to switch permanently. The training was inadequate and was denied the opportunity to take notes! The favoritism and nepotism kept the atmosphere very stressful. I would have stayed as the pay was somewhat adequate, but eventually saw the toxic atmosphere was mentally unhealthy. They need to listen to employees suggestions and let up on the micro management to produce a happier, more productive climate."
bad,"Humana was the worst job I ever had!  We had mandatory overtime during the ""busy"" season, which never seemed to end.  We were forced to work 2-3 hours of overtime 5 days a week.  Absolutely horrible.  Management was pathetic from the top to the bottom. Do not work for this company! You will be sorry. I meet people all the time that used to work for Humana, and they all get this look in their eyes when you mention Humana. I think it is PTSD!  They do not care about their employees.  You're just like cattle to them. I worked in customer service and that is probably where the issue is. I'm sure the executives are very happy there. They always looked happy heading up to their offices. It's typical...they make all the money when the people that do all the work make peanuts."
bad,"Would not recommend"
bad,"truly horrible people! The call center in Phoenix is run by completely incompetent bullies and cowards, there is no leader ship, there is absolutely no human resources at that office and so many human resources issues."
bad,"This is a kiddie environment, we’re you are suppose to be fake or something your not ..and let there members abuse you ."
bad,"I worked for Humana processing Prior Authorizations in Tempe AZ for almost 2 years. A typical day at work was answering phones then after a while, you can work back end production queues. "
bad,"Not a good company. Terrible insurance, management was the worst.  They watched u like a hawk. Didn't appreciate their employees at all. Not a good company to work for"
bad,It’s a temp job and they advise you of that. Horrible management & atmosphere to work. Very hostile due to everchanging rules & regulations. They will say they have an open door policy however if you express any concerns your pretty much doomed so I’d not too. It’s a lot of college kids with degrees and really no job experience.
bad,"I was a captive agent for Humana from 2006 thru 2009. I was never in the Director's click which was problematic from the start. I was a middle of the pack producer, given leads in dangerous neighborhoods but went anyway. Once in a ""crack house"" I notified Police and they wanted to know why I was there. Advised them Humana agents had to go where they were assigned. Sargent suggested next time I call for an escort. Once Obamacare was in place agents were picked off one by one due to office politics.Two agents made false statements against me and I was terminated. I hired atty but FL is a right to work state and I was given no chance to defend myself. I worked a lot of weekends, Sat and Sunday just to make quota. On computer sometime until 9pm to get daily reports submitted. The most enjoyable part was helping seniors understand Medicare and their options."
bad,"Health benefits for an insurance company were incompetent."
bad,".I did not like the job. I was in College and needed the early morning shift. They did not work with me at all.  I did not get the shift that I needed or wanted.  The manager mistreated me, and was very inconsiderate."
bad,"They use their employees.  Treated like children.  Management is awful.  I got my license and found better opportunities. "
bad,Poor management.. Ridiculous expectations and demands. . Lack of proper training. Disrespect for their staff. Condescending attitude. More interested in saving money than helping members.
bad,"Humana advertises itself as a fun, stable place to work, but the culture is stressful, pushes for numbers and money and puts pressure continually on the individuals that work there.  You walk in daily not knowing when the next round of layoffs are coming, and you rarely get a raise even though the cost of living increases.  Advancement is also said to be an option, but that is not truly a possibility unless the supervisor is that department already is familiar with you.  This is not just to be negative about the company, but to be truthful.  I had always wanted to work at Humana until I did.  Now I would recommend you look elsewhere if you want any peace of mind."
bad,"Humana has adopted an open workspace ""collaborative"" environment. I personally found it incredibly distracting and unprofessional. You could not have discreet conversations or phone calls without finding or scheduling a conference room. One collaborative conference room had stools a little over a a foot and a half above the floor with a matching table: it looked and felt like something from preschool. "
bad,The job was rewarding but the management was very rude and never wanted to listen to you. If you had a problem there was no one to assist you. Management was very unprofessional.
bad,Horrible work environment. Constant change and layoffs. Forced to work overtime everyday in order meet expectations. Expectations are not appropriate.
bad,"The workplace culture was not reflective of its values.  The metrics were attained. However, it seemed the company was never satisfied and continued to raise rate and quality.  The attendance policy was so strict that a minute late from break, lunch or arrival resulted in disciplinary actions."
bad,"There have been about 5 layoffs (maybe more) lost count, since 2017. It used to be a good job working as a field care manager. Not anymore. They micromanage  and hand out so much work you could never complete without excessive hours. They recently changed the salary employees to working hourly. They sold it as a good thing but you'll get in trouble if you work overtime too often. Which means you'll turn in 40 hours while actually working at least 50 because this greedy company doesn't want to pay overtime. They take advantage of their employees. Constant changes and give employees no chance to recover or adjust to the changes. Check out layoff sight humana. It truely is a soul sucking job and they are an evil insurance company. No place to work for a caring nurse or social worker. The work from home options seems good, but trust me they will invade your home and make you miserable. I don't know anyone who as actually happy with their job there. We are all trying to find new jobs. Maybe the managers are happy? But the worker bees are definitly not."
bad,"flexible hours, hiring process overturn is high, very unprofessional, not organized, your job status change, alot of work need to be processed. If MANAGEMENT AND STRUTURE WAS A LIITLE BIT BETTER, WORK FLOW WOULD BE MORE PRODUCTIVE"
bad,Not recommended for a career path. The promises of advancement were never met. The job continued to become more sales related and the culture became negative with poor management. Lay off rumors were wide spread prior to waves of lay offs
bad,"Did not have the training that I should have had before doing live work. when I mess up it can affect weather or not someone has their doctor's visit or prescriptions covered. Getting your foot in the door and having opportunity at a large company like Humana is not easy, nor is it promised. As an LTE Limited Term Employee you are expendable and will be treated as such. Expect 10 hour days and 7 days a week, with no encouragement, but rather negativity about your production times and kickbacks. GOOD LUCK!"
bad,"I don't know how much longer I can work here & be treated like a number. It has been a very stressful job with poor management. You are set up to fail from the start in ""training"" & their expectations of you when you get on the phones is unrealistic. How can they expect US to know things the supervisors don't even know?? They are supposed to be a wealth of info...not here. Poor training = Misinformed beneficiaries = Complaints. You get an occurrence for EVERYTHING including having death in the family & getting admitted to the hospital when you are scheduled to work. They seriously could not care less about us. With this kind of treatment, I can imagine what will happen in Jan. 2018 when we gain 3 million more beneficiaries. It will be even more of a NIGHTMARE = Higher turn over rate. Buckle up BSRs. We have to support each other because HGB certainly won't."
bad,Even though this is a work at home position you will find yourself working all the time. Humana is not a straightforward company and as a Case Manager you will change teams every other month. I want to say I went through 5 different managers in over a year. They are very disorganized and really do a lot of lying. Really find a better company to work for.
bad,Very political  nota at lot of opportunity for advancement unless you were to already know someone in a certain area. The educational reimbursement was nice.
bad,The money may seem nice but what you have to deal with is insane. Management is straight up evil. The dont care about you at all and will harass you all day and even while not at work. I had such a terrible experience at Humana.
bad,"Humana management style is to supervise with intimidation they treat employees like prisoners, the insurance is very bad. The supervisors will not take customer complaints they tell employees to tell customers they will get a call back within 24 hours but they customers never never get a call. Humana is a correctional institute without the fence and guards with high powered weapons I would not recommend any human to work for this company at least not in the department that I worked in.... warning stay away from Humana Pharmacy Dept, they cheat customers out of tons of money with their health and pharmacy plans and the training is a joke within its self....you have been warned."
bad,"Horrible company to work for, no room for advancement (unless you know someone), no raises, constant change that makes jobs harder and takes away from helping people, unreasonable expectations, supervisors/management have their favorites and make it very clear, no support, treat employees and memebers poorly, they are all about numbers and profits over people.  The stress is overwhelming and alot of employees suffer from mental health issues once they start working here and if you use FMLA they target you and eventually you will be let go once your FMLA is up. Worst place I've ever worked."
bad,"The company spouts a lot of great things about work/life balance, being healthy, room for growth, ect. It sounds good, but once your there do you feel those things? No. I started my first day in my department with my manager and team lead bashing my future coworkers to me. Set a good tone. I quickly realised that your worth was judged on how much overtime you worked  (even if you weren't really working) and your willingness to give up your weekends. If they realize your a good worker, they squeeze you for as much as they can. The way to move up, is by kissing up to managers and giving them info on your coworkers.  The director, managers and team leads stand around, on the floor talking about people in loud voices. No professionalism, a bully mentality. The few who go above them to complain,  are quickly filtered out.  The culture is terrible. No one is happy,  everyone is always looking for another job. They keep people because the pay isn't bad and the pto is decent. Good luck getting time off though. They won't tell you the holidays they list for you, they'll really expect you to work. Don't worry, management won't be there though. Insurance is terrible, expect to pay for everything yourself and also pay more if you dont give humana axcess to your health information. It was my worst work experience."
bad,"Humana Pharmacy knows nothing of personal life/work life balance. If you have a family or a personal life, Humana Pharmacy is not the company to work for. The only thing they care about is you being on the phones making them money."
bad,"This company does not take into consideration, unexpected health issues that may arise. People do not expect to have a health condition that causes them to be totally incapacitated for a time. Especially when they are just starting with the company."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. ACS is a horrible employer their employees are not valued and they treat you like just a body to fill a seat. Everyone knows that they are replaceable.
bad,"Had the worst experience with their training and on going coaching, the hardest part of the job was not the members but the coach who belittle everyone and spoke to nurses like children."
bad,"This company does not advance pre-existing employees and then hires management with less knowledge and no experience . The pay is horrible for the amount of jobs you must do , and the company is so understaff it causes their good workers to become burnt out ."
bad,Very stressful high paced. Very rewarding working for our military. No respect for senority. No back up from management. No chance to interact with coworkers because of the cubical setting.
bad,Humana overall is not an idealistic company they advertise fairness but don't practice. Advancement is promised if you are a friend or relative of management.
bad,While most of the time being a home care nursing assistant is beneficial for the patient in general some patients are more difficult to take care of than others
bad,This is a mom and pop shop.  Boss was horrible and abusive.  Rest of the staff non-inclusive - didn't like my lifestyle.  Wouldn't recommend ever working here.  Too small.
bad,"Humana's management style appears to be to breathe down the necks of their employees and watch over every little thing employees do. This type of management style is not conducive to productivity or enjoyment in your work.  A Manager reprimanded a coworker of mine for being in the bathroom ""too long."""
bad,"The protocol for HR issues are swept under the rug and the corporation is acquiring small mom and pops home care agencies to stay on top of the industry game...their is no grievance time at this company, 15 day of Personal time that you must arrange for Dr appt's, emergencies etc....the salary offered was great and the best part was you get paid weekly...the culture and environment of the organization was strange and poorly managed...."
bad,"I personally hate working for Humana.  The management was terrible, constantly breathing down your back and not allowing you to prove yourself by working alone. Breaks were very short. Benefits were included but the deductible was insanely high."
bad,"Do not work for this company especially at the Fort Campbell TRICARE Service Center location management is incompetent and there is no room for growth. If you love kissing behind, constantly being back stabbed by management and working in chaos then this is the place for you. Since Humana took over the contract in March there has been 4 resignations that tells you a lot about this company and location."
bad,"Worked in the Medicare Coding department. Horrible management, never knew what the current procedures were,treated employees unfairly. Everything based on who you know not what you know. All they care about is production, you are expected to go above and beyond for the company using your personal vehicle to drive to different physician offices, work mandatory overtime ect. and never getting anything back not even simple appreciation. Management is rude and unprofessional and HR does absolutely nothing about it. Good luck getting a fair shake."
bad,All i can say is everything about working for this company was all micro managed!  We got harassed every single day from supervisor constantly texting us. Human resources did nothing to stop this.
bad,"Humana is having highly political environment in Software Development.  Your first manager can either make your career or break your career.  Humana needs better people in management who do their job unbiased.  Though Humana is trying it best to improve culture but it is hardly impossible task as so many incompetent managers are promoted and now they are promoting people they like rather than people who deserves.  I don't see long term future as company doesn't have good talent sitting at top.  It is becoming more and more ""who you know culture"".  My only advise to upper management to focus on hiring talented people who deserves.  Incompetent people brings more incompetent people and now it has slack culture.  It is hard to do anything right at Humana.  My personal experience says - if you want to work with talented people and grow than Humana is not right company.  In Humana promotions are based on who you know and not based on who deserves.  Toxic environment."
bad,company was great management was terrible. Good workers do not leave good companies they leave bad managers. I worked for humana for several months before I was terminated for an undisclosed reason.
bad,"OTC management and supervisors are horrible. They chose people for roles that they don’t deserve, or even qualify for. They never listen to what’s going on or be fair to anyone if your not there kiss up. Let employees that are get away with anything that states in the policy that’s prohibited. Great Company but bad , bad , bad... management and supervisors"
bad,Poor management. Unrealistic production goals and Manager and assistant will set you up for failure. I would not recommend working for this Department or manager.
bad,"Had 8 supervisors in 3 years. The good ones lasted less than 5 months."
bad,"It is not an adult atmosphere. I don’t want to work where people are decorating the place with construction paper and glitter. I hate it. I don’t understand the culture at Humana. It seems to be a place you either  love, or you hate it with a passion."
bad,"It’s a big company. At the end of the day, they only care about their profits. They are sending lots of jobs overseas, laying off people yearly, and increasing automation. They do not truly care about you as a person. Salary is good, but that is about it. You are replaceable at Humana."
bad,"Humana has such unprofessional & poor management. There is no time to have a family there, the hours are too long & they treat you like slaves. Poor poor management I'll say again. Be prepared to stocked by the Team lead in the OTC department consistently while your working."
bad,"Any new training on the job but there was no incentive for advancement."
bad,If you work in the dental dept for customer care. It is stressful. Lil to no help after training. You work from home minimum supervision. No work life balance. No sick time. After 3 call outs you are sent back to the office to work. After the 4th call out you are fired. If you have small kids or are sickly yourself. They DO NOT CARE. Benefits are just ok. They do not offer HMO. Ins is HIGH
bad,Too much micromanaging and lack of support from leadership. No way to advance to a leadership position or another position within the company. leadership played favorites.
bad,I worked there for 6 years the first 5 were great as I worked for a sup that understood  what was customer service always there for his reps I was trf to group this sup I only worked under 2 months and all she cared about was making numbers they wanted us toget do e with a call in 537 secs I dont know how you could speak to 70 and 80 yr old and explain to them all about either their benefits or claims I also had providers calli g in and they frequently  had more than 1 member to get info on my view of the company is if these folks really cared about the people they serve they would not put a time co strai t on their representat6
bad,"I started off in the Data Entry department in 1998. Two Supervisors were very racist. It was a tone of immature women working there at the time. I moved to a Claims position where the pay was horrible. Had to always work OT to make it financially. I was laid off in 2003. Horrible atmosphere, fights among employees, unprofessional managers who were racist. If you didn't know your rights, they got away with it. Great health benefits was all I liked. I preferred having male Supervisors because too many females that we're very petty."
bad,"The Clinical Services department needs a COMPLETE overhaul!!! From the PIC to the supervisors right down to the leads. If you’re not a favorite, beware, and management does not help. No HR department onsite is a problem as well."
bad,"At one point we were all on salary and management pushed us to the limit.  Many days I would work more than 8 hrs/day working through breaks and lunch to try to keep up with their unrealistic expectations.  Now they have changed us to hourly employees and from the time we log on to the computer, every minute of our day can be scrutinized by our managers using a computer application called Verint.  This program shows when we log on to the computer, how long we spent using skype chat, how long we were on a call, how long we took to chart, breaks, lunch, and how much time we spent on the internet.  This same program records ALL of our calls.  Coaches can an pull screen shots from our computers for review by management. Now we are expected to take 2 breaks, lunch daily and an hour of ""wellness"" time per week. We're on 8 hr days and any OT has to be approved in advanced.  Guess what?  There is no such thing as paid OT because if you start asking for it to keep up with your roster, you will find yourself with a performance improvement plan and then fired. We also have have multiple ridiculous meetings per week that takes time out of our days and give us much less time to manage our members.  Management talks about how much they care about our members and us but it's really all about the money.   I've been with Humana over 7 yrs and this is the worst I have ever seen. Management throws ideas against the wall to see what sticks and stress level is higher than ever.  Good nurses quit because of the bs and now they're hiring new, unsuspecting nurses that think working at home sounds wonderful."
bad,"Job training left employees gravely undertrained for the type of work and production expectations enforced with the constant threat of termination.  Mandatory overtime at 50 hours a week through the entire holiday season.  Upper management did not clearly address respectful, employee concerns during meetings with tact or empathy.  Upper management refused to make eye contact or greet employees regularly.  Morale was consistently low.  Communication between management and employees was not consistent."
bad,"Unfortunately, I did not listen to colleagues from other companies that left Humana.  I understand why and would not recommend to anyone. Too many managers. Managers unqualified to lead people. Too much waste in current processes- Six Sigma definitely needed. Onboarding process not favorable-disjointed and unorganized. Unfortunately nothing positive to say"
bad,"No loyalty to employees and you have to be part of a “clique” to move up or get a better position.  No work/life balance, food is overpriced, raises are few fat and in between"
bad,Just do not work for HUMANA Military. Trust me. Apply if you love working 50+ hours a week while the leaders do nothing but monitor everything you do while not knowing the process themselves.
bad,Very high pressure and long days. I worked in Specialty and we were under alot of stress to get EVERY order out every day. Very hard physically too with packing and shipping the orders too.
bad,"Humana allows supervisors to personally set unrealistic goals of 100% no error rate.  If you have the supervisor that requires 100% all the time, and you get a 97%, you  can be written up for it and ultimately reprimanded or worse, even if the company itself does not require 100% and 90% is considered very good work performance."
bad,"I went home daily feeling like I had not accomplished anything. I was constantly having to deny medications to seniors who were in the ""coverage gap"" and it was disheartening."
bad,Humana used to be a good company to work for they have let go of so many opportunities and benefits. The company is very strict on what we have left of benefits
bad,I was a Provider Relations Consultant covering provider education for the entire state of OK required to use my own transportation for provider visits.  It was an impossible expectation to for one person to cover an entire state as large as OK.  I was also required to attend meetings in another state 4 hrs. away driving my own car.  Also marketing was selling medical insurance plans to senior citizens without fully explaining the plan benefits and verifying of member's physicians was in-network.   This caused alot of member dissatification and confusion.
bad,"The company lacks diversity and lacks awareness of cultural differences.  Structured to promote internally, but done so without proper notification to all employees of postings."
bad,"once in the position, was a call center. mandatory 30 min lunches and if late, was written up. Mandatory breaks, if not met when directed, written up with job in jeopardy. no time off without written warning no authorized leave if illness is not requested in two weeks."
bad,"This company hires nurses knowing they plan to lay them off in a few months time. The management is toxic and no one cares. Management is very top heavy and you are micromanaged heavily, but even your production doesn't seem to matter in the end because they just lay off hundreds of people every few months. Advancement in the company is nearly impossible. Insurance is terrible, which is ironic since it's an insurance company. Pto is generous. Pay is middle of the road. There is zero job stability and you are constantly under the threat/stress of a reduction in workforce. They make a show of how they care about your health as an employee but don't actually support that."
bad,"Work load more than can be done in 8 hours, high answer rate of calls expected and punished if people not answer phone. Management higher then your coach could care less about you other then do more so they get higher bonus"
bad,There are multiple layoffs occurring consistently. It was hard to work under the management due to hard to achieve expectations. Difficult to enjoy speaking with members.
bad,Humana used to be a good place to work; Tempe call center is corrupt with management hiring and managing relatives; mixed work life with people's home life
bad,Stressful working with Humana long term care. Seniority means nothing to these people I went on maturity leave when I return my caseload of 4 years was taken and given to a new case manager not fair since I'm familiar with those members after 4 years of being that case load.
bad,"I Worked with good people. Corporate management was terrible, inconsistent and set baseline too high for job to be accomplished. Overtime was expected and there was no compensation."
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worked. At first, things were pretty good. However, after the first year or so new management began making lots of changes. You were constantly pushed to make metrics, metrics were always being increased and or added to. They started micromanaging every part of your day. No one ever seemed to be on the same page about anything. My coach was a joke. The health insurance was the worst I have ever been offered. Employees were not appreciated at all. After several years of mass hiring, they started cutting jobs right and left. No one is safe there."
bad,"This is a fast paced and stressful environment. "
bad,Cutthroat and competitive among teammates. Poor management. No achievable goals and a culture of bullying and threats. This is not a place I recommend.
bad,"You could rely on your co-workers for help, but management only cared about themselves, or their favorite people. I enjoyed the work, but would not want to work there again."
bad,Humana pays well but management remains unprofessional and the business is ran like a dictatorship. Staff below the line are friendly and cooperative.
bad,"I was excited to get a call from this company and be hired because this was my dream job but boy did it end up being a nightmare. The first week was already rough because I found out that I would be away from my family two more weeks pass the time that I was initially told. I was not the only one that has happened to. For someone that doesn't have a family that might have been okay but it wasn't for me. Oh and please don't try to negotiate salary because that will only make the director upset and not like you from the beginning. Im pretty sure negotiating salary is a normal part of the hiring process. To be clear I am referring to the Gulf States region of Humana. I asked how performance was measured in my interview and they gave me and generalized answer. Well performance is measured only by metrics. The management is horrible and care nothing about the employees. You better have good metrics though! If you want to be stressed to the max, have no life, are good at kissing up, and want to be spoken to like you are the dirt under the directors shoes this is the perfect job for you.  I'm so blessed to not be an employee with Humana anymore!"
bad,very hard work environment. stressful fast pace.  long nights poor supervisors under staff poor training environment  not enough training for the work .
bad,"Humana preaches work/life balance and even allow one hour of ""wellness time"" a week yet your coaches and direct management don't actually allow that. So focused on metrics and meeting numbers and there is no actual caring or helping provided to the members. The coach watches every minute of your day and will notify you accordingly with borderline harassing messages. The focus is all wrong."
bad,"Humana has a high demand, fast past and high productivity environment that has great opportunity to grow with poor leadership that makes the care center hostel."
bad,"This location does so much unprofessional things.  They micromanage like no other company I've ever seen in life.  The front line leaders walk the floor and talk about other employees personal business in front of other employees. They do this on a daily basis because there leader hugh cunningham does it with them, so they think its ok. Two weeks ago a front line leader was taking pictures of an employee and posted it on social media as a joke about the lady hair, now keep in mind due to hipaa law phones are not allowed on the floor but they have theres out taking pictures and whatever else they choose to do.  I pray that aetna takes control of this location and fire all the management here including hugh cunningham because he allows all of this to happen"
bad,"As an RN, I worked for Humana for brief period of time when the home health company I worked for sold out or shall I say cashed out! As soon as Humana took over, they installed cameras in our office (a sign of distrust). In addition, they had everyone sign work agreements which stated in a lengthy legal letter an overall reduction in pay. No mention of benefits other than direct deposit. Management that took over was grossly incompetent, rude, and only looking at the bottom line. If you believe in quality care, an understanding team concept, and believe people are more than just a number or dollar figure than run and don't look back. I would never consider working for Humana, any of its subsidiaries, or Humana type companies because they have taken human out of the equation despite that catchy name!"
bad,Humana bought the company that hired me and started the layoffs. they assured us there would be no lay offs before they  bought out CompBenefits which was a great Company to work for.
bad,"This was the worst place I've ever worked. My manager has a history of problems with his assistants. His first assistant was reassigned, his second assistant resigned after 3 months, and I quit. Additionally there is no HR presence onsite and if you do choose to notify them of your concerns you should expect retaliation. We had several employees concerned with the office environment and the high turnover rate spoke volumes. In most companies this would be a red flag."
bad,They lied big time in the hiring process which turns out to be the case with many many people. If I had known I would not have accepted the position.
bad,"I enjoyed my job and was very good at it. but management is not good, in which they ended up laying everyone off around me. I loved my job and did whatever it took to get my work done. I did a lot of overtime."
bad,"Humana's management style is the one of micromanagement watching over every little thing employees do. Micromangement isn't conducive to productivity or it doesn't result in a good work environment.. Also they advertise that they are ""hiring 350 new employees"" in the local press but don't tell that they have fired (usually for little petty things) 350 others. Their training sucks, they don't know what they are doing. Employees with more responsibility have nowhere to go when they have a question (specially the nurses), because the managers work from home. People sometimes quit because they don't trust the way humana works and provide  training. They hired me because they were desperate for more qualified employees for their new team opening up,  reviewed me after the 90 days with raving comments (the supervisor said "" 23 out of 25 points, because nobody gets more than 23""), and fired me 3 weeks later, for no apparent  reason. I found out later they had hired many Bachelor degrees paying them between $8.000 to $12.000 less than they paid me.  It is a farm like call center where you seat all day long making phone calls to older customers trying to trick them on how caring Humana is, so they continue to give them their business. It is so much brown nose stuff that teams of personal coaches and humana cares managers call the same customer with the same questions over and over again. But humana doesn't pay for the medical services as promised in their insurance policies most of the time, not doing it's job. I had so many custumers complaining about humana not honoring its word and"
bad,"Humana pays well but you have to go through hell. Management have  no clue how to treat employees, unless you participate in afterwork bar hopping and secret affairs. Jobs are not posted when available- lead and supervisors' minions receive. Demoted managers are placed in other areas to wreck havoc in other departments. Process and procedures are not effectively communicated. Employee metrics change at drop off a hat without much consideration of the due diligence process. I work in the West Chester facility. Much social, sexual orientation and racial bias. Off color jokes- an EEOC charge ready to happen. Seriously, I don't have the energy to file because, we are worked like slaves but someone will because of the severity. After a day's work, I have little to no energy to do anything else in life. Sad because I am fit and in good health."
bad,"A typical day consisted of inbound calls from member of the Humana Health Coverage needed information, or updating existing information.  I learned a great deal about our Health Care Plans.  Many of the co workers were informative, and helpful.  The management changes the policies from day to day to fit their needs."
bad,"Humana has managed to half-implement agile principles, it's quite a mess. The IT organization is generally disorganized and running along at light speed.... while trying to keep the wheels from falling off of the wagon. "
bad,"They tell you there will be possible overtime then hit you with a mandatory 17 hours overtime. Sometimes more depending on their needs. The management is never available but when they are they give you unrealistic expectations. There is no talking, just silence. So boring."
bad,"Was hired in as Medicare Enrollment. was told if did not miss any days and did work as told or above would go full time. Did not happen was layed off 3 months after peak time even though no days missed and several awards for production. No benefits, management has favorites when you see them. Was given notice from company of last day of work then penalized for leaving 1 day early for full time job even tho they where letting me go."
bad,I am severely unhappy with this job. I have been working there over a year I have yet to have any type of review or raise. I work almost 60 hours every week. I only get one day off. I am never approved any time off.
bad,"Humana is constantly laying people off. Humana is constantly re-organizing and can’t seem to get it right. Employees live in an atmosphere of fear, never knowing if they’re going to have a job the next day"
bad,Don’t have a person with experience or even years with the company and still deny cause then it looks personal not professional and that’s not securing at all. And job security for a billion dollar company with a lot of pay off really is horrible and scary
bad,"The average intuitive person would recognize the following areas of deficiency immediately upon hire:  Lack of leadership from the top down; Unnecessarily complex systems in place that are counter-productive; Right hand doesn't know what the left is doing (company-wide); Gravely incompetent managers in some markets who duck and dodge to avoid answering questions; Except for a few geographical areas, flat $24k base salary (no raises); Health plans not competitive in some markets (no sales...no commissions); Employees hounded by top leadership to complete company surveys that are supposed to be anonymous, then immediately retaliated against."
bad,"I had worked really hard to move into a full time position, received STAR awards and everything. Always hit my production numbers and then some. They opened up jobs in the job I was currently doing, they gave the job to two people who slacked off, took multiple breaks to chat or just left their desk instead of people who actually worked for it. They said I denied the role when I wasn't even offered it so a higher ups niece could get the job."
bad,Tom Cruise had an easier time with The Firm than you'll have working for this insurance giant. Everything is recorded on property and anyone will snitch on you for even the slightest complaint.
bad,"Humana used to be a great place to work, but greed took over & there is no job security. They layoff the workers who have the most tenure, keep the newer workers. All about the almighty dollar. It’s sad."
bad,The management is VERY unqualified. You only get promoted if you are in one of the “clicks” I trained every single team member that got promoted elsewhere but never got recognized for it. Instead I got the “boot” a few months after I started WAH.
bad,"Nothing to review. Nothing more to share.  You have to pick and chose your own battles when it comes to working a full time position. Every job is going to have something good or bad, but as an adult, we have to put a grin on our face and take the good with the bad, make the bad better."
bad,Management not flexible and does not want to help you advance. Will not give helpful information or assist when a customer is upset. Not available when you have questions .
bad,"The section of the company I worked in was unable to survive in the marketplace, so it is hard to provide an overall review. The staff was struggling to help this unit survive but it was clear to most of us that they would not succeed. This led to a very tense working environment with long stretches of nothing to do."
bad,"Never now when your whole dept will be let go due to out sources positions. Stressful telephonic case management position trying to reach member to do discharge survey, multiple calls out with unsuccessful contacts to mbrs."
bad,"Manager was unprofessional with staff, communicationg with satff at their homes, placing LVN above RN on projects. Culture was loosely defined and followed, if your boss liked you were set, should your boss resent you because she was an LVN and you were a RN, BA you got nowhere quickly. Best day on the job was my last day"
bad,"I had a masters and a license. My supervisor was not skilled enough to be in that role and our team suffered as a result of it. I saw her one time in the 18 months that I worked for Humana. When a series of my clients died, as they do, my supervisor was not able to offer any of the debriefing necessary for individuals in this line of work witnessing death and dying and all of the trauma that goes along with that."
bad,"Would not work there again even though I was there for 15 yrs."
bad,"Toxic work environment under toxic Director.  worked for the TRICARE arm of Humana.  my particular dept was very toxic.  Did not know anyone at HGB prior to being offered the job.  Little did i know that position had been open for many months.  As it turns out, no one internally wanted to work for this particular Director.  I was vindicated very soon after leaving the company as Director was re-assigned, etc.  Extremely high turnover rate for such a small dept. "
bad,"i honestly can't even describe how insane the experience was. I had to leave, run away as my health got compromised."
bad,"Humana starts out great. Then, they give poor leads... unsaleable, used leads.  Before you know it you receive all used outbound leads which makes it impossible to sell.  They set you up to fail.  They offer early retirement to anyone over 55 and lay off anyone who doesn't retire. There is an age discrimination suit against them."
bad,Upper management is terrible. Employees are great but treated poorly. Very cut throat and political. Very stressful environment because of the way Management handles things.
bad,"Very stressful and mentally draining."
bad,"I was a quality analyst and the management did not care about workers, went over 7 years without getting a raise. There was no advancement, the attitude was poor."
bad,"Humana has a horrible culture .  They are now firing employees 55 and over except for the good ole boys at the top.  They want to be acquired by a larger entity, but recently failed a merger with Aetna who already got rid of their 55+ employees.  Managers often have no clue, work is often meaningless and management style can be demeaning."
bad,"I am not sure why they put people in management with little or no  no experience.  I was shocked at the level of professionalism within this company.  Poor management, not much strategy and operationally challenged.  Too many chiefs and not enough people to do the work."
bad,No job security especially at end of year when the dollar amount is the bottom line and all that is cared about. Unprofessional management with lack of discernment for quality employees.
bad,"Humana is a very stressful and challenging job with little training provided. The department that I was in does not allow you to make mistakes as if you are not human but perfect. My supervisor only cared about money, constantly nagging us about reach or just complaining about anything she could possibly think of when she herself does not even know how to work our cases. When ask to shadow another department she would let you but would not let you transfer to the department of your choice,  she enjoys coaching and writing you up no matter how hard you work.There is no advancements unless you know someone that knows someone. If her job is to tell me how to do my job, then shouldn't she know how to do my job! Management is terrible , I would not suggest this place to anyone!"
bad,"I was hired a few years ago. They are doing a mass layoff without much of an explanation and no promises that there won't be more. It's a typical insurance company. If you don't express your feelings ever, if you like being micromanaged-they literally watch your screen and record every call, if you like being numbers driven, and if you are basically a robot that never leaves their desk for 8 hours, this is the perfect company for you. They offer you ""wellness"" time 1 hour a week, but if you use it, you fall behind, then get in trouble. I'm in the worst health of my life because of this job. I stay for the benefits for my family and that's about it. Growth opportunities are few and far between and management on all levels keep employees in the dark. Job security is basically non-existent. If you express concerns about the layoffs they 1. Fire you 2. Tell you to read educational material about job stress, anxiety, work/life balance 3. Ask you if this is the right place for you to work. The clients you work with are generally nice, but the company and management is greedy and it shows. To sum it up, I don't really recommend Humana to anyone with a soul."
bad,I've never worked for a company with such little initial training yet expectations of a veteran once on the line. Micromanagement is too nice of a word to use for them. They SPY on your every move. They threaten you with this unreasonable metric every day...so demoralizing. They don't care about quality only quantity. I'm trying to get out of this toxic atmosphere ASAP!
bad,There were several things wrong with the department including management and the work load that was placed upon us which has employees working nights and weekends. The quality expectations were 99% and if it wasn't meet you were terminated.
bad,"As stated above, Kanawha Insurance Company was a great place to work at as they cared for their employees and gave recognition to anyone going above and beyond their normal duties.  However, when Humana took over it just felt like they didn't care for their employees and wasn't very personable.  They didn't want to pay the salary as compared to other insurance companies in the area, but they wanted 120% out of everyone."
bad,"This olace has a computer system that very seldom works. There are work arounds for everyprocess, managment has terrible communication skills with the employees and the other site locations. Latency is also a nerve wrecker, let me not forget YOUR STILL REQUIRED TO MEET YOUR RATES! IF QUALITY LACKS THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM."
bad,"The management is HORRIBLE!! They need to revamp thier managers traing in being Effevtive manager. Its all about number here! tey do not care about your overall health. If you are sick and call out, you get an occurence for every little thing! They are full of BS and drama and DO NOT help you advance into another department or position."
bad,"Poor management, poor compensation. Hostile work environment due to no understanding of what is involved in development of Oasis as related to time in and completion."
bad,"A typical Day at work was either studying and preparing for the very busy time to come. Once Open Enrollment was here, which is our busiest time of the year, you are left to your own devices. It's a sink or swim job. I believe that is the hardest part of the job, is that you cannot get questions answered when you need them. If you are like myself, you use as many resources that are made available to you and I learned not to rely on others for answers. "
bad,The only good experience was the benefits and free garage parking otherwise wouldn't recommend this company to ANYONE. At times felt the training didn't cover the subject matter customers were asking and some management seemed bothered by questions asked
bad,"I worked at Humana in the healthcare field for awhile. You will not move up past a certain level unless you know and are friends with someone. Not only I, but others have been harassed beyond what anyone can imagine, HR will ignore it, and you will be made to be looked at as the trouble maker until you are so stressed out that you leave. Very high turnaround."
bad,"If you enjoy working in a tense, unsupportive, disorganized and downright mean environment, then working for Humana's Gulf Coast Region is for you. The manager in Tampa is not bad but the nurse front line lead in the Gulf Coast Region (Sarasota down to Naples) is the worst boss I have ever had---disrespectful, mean, and demeaning. Case in point, of the four people that started  , myself included, only one was left within less than two months. The orientation in Louisville was inspiring and wonderful but the Gulf Coast region orientation was a mess! The region itself is pretty new; no one has been there more than 3 years. Most of the clinical leaders have only been there for less than two years. The bosses were disorganized and unsupportive. If you ask a question, you will not get a direct answer, just an email to refer to previous emails. I have worked in many places and I have never complained about a job environment until I got there. So good luck! But if I were you, I'd pass this one up. Don't let the job perks and the $ blind you."
bad,"quit after four and half years being in this snake pit. computer system always down and when up had major problems with it everyday. New system installed that is the worst thing I ever work on. help desk was sending over every day a  top 40 problem list and work arounds for it. when the help desk tried to solve one problem, sixteen new problems would happen. "
bad,Great company to work for. Department mangers are something else they take advantage of all the workers.
bad,work for health provider trying to get customers to use mail order service for medication
bad,Wellness and wellbeing is nonexistant.  Long hours are expected and managment tends to be out of touch.
bad,This job might be good for a yound college student with NO family obligations. Discrimination is alive and well in this establishment. Management gives preferential treatment to their favorites. Lots of forced overtime. You will have no life.
bad,Hated this place...if you get a micro manager that is insecure and uncommunicative plus no.training. If you smoke it's going to cost you $25 per.check and they will require other things to be completed otherwise it will cost you $25.¡Per check again for each instance you don't comply. No clocks allowed electronic communication heavily monitored use omg and you receive a warning. Ironically the health coverage sucks....support such.as...HR purchasing it facilities..hide behin d generic email addresses finding a human is a joke. and.the cost of dental vision and medical is much much more than what I was paying when with a another company.
bad,I have never worked for a company that worked you so much they make u forget about your family. I was promised a promotion and step over and I worked my tale off for it. I was let go because I the paperwork that My doctor sent in was supposedly false.
bad,They dont really care about employees or the members. They only care about profit.  They deny the members whenever they can.  The employees are told to send a set amount of cases to be reviewed by mgmt to see if the can be denied.
bad,Sales Agent....Don’t even apply. Not worth the stress. Great coworkers too much pressure not enough pay. If you are not part of the clique you won’t get very far
bad,"Things started out pretty well for the first 2 years and then went progressively down hill this year, with more ridiculous protocols and not enough travel time and rude clients, as well as rude phone personel"
bad,"The company has been quietly removing qualified middle and senior managers and replacing them with cheaper and younger leaders who the senior leaders trained. Instead of helping those leaders find other positions in the company, they negotiate a settlement that removes the equity commitment of the company allowing the leaders who remain to get more wealthy while the majority of those who actually do the work do not get to participate in any equity wealth programs.  The leaders were once focused on the community and improving health and now they are just focusing on making money. Many do not even live in the community, they just have an apartment there and keep their families in their home towns while they make what money they can and then leave."
bad,"worked as telephonic social worker,   managers were horrible and unstable, resulted stressful environment..managers clueless about the jobs, so you had to learn yourself, until you messed up, then they offer wrong advice..Lasted 2yrs, When I first started they hired a pool of about 21 social workers when I left it was less than 7 left from my class..started out as salaried and due long hours they changed us to hourly..Every December layoffs and if safe, another pool layoffs in April.."
bad,Little Accountability and clearly people given titles to work or stay on.  Poor Leadership and little training.  Not to taken seriously in the medical community in this area.
bad,I was bullied and treated badly by my leader daily. I believe it was due to me being the only minority on the team. I end up finding a job making 12k more and left before they could fire me.
bad,"Trabajas bajo presión y en condiciones infrahumanas,  sin calefacción en invierno y sin aire en verano a temperaturas de 35 a 40 grados ."
bad,"Humana offered contractor conversion, but thinking that Aetna would be taking over, they didn't convert any contractors over to full time employees and outsourced their jobs to the Philippines, and even got rid of their full time IT staff.  DO not recommend"
bad,"The location that I worked for was a third party company for humana. It was call conduent. this place had poor communications skills, poor management skills, and the benefits were the bare minimum. i really wouldn't suggest anyone to work at this location."
bad,"High turnover rate. Compensation is decent but not enough for the amount of difficult patients you deal with over the phone. Management is secretive and uses any excuse to fire people, like a slight decrease in metrics. Would not recommend."
bad,"I started 2 years ago and gotten a lot of empty promises.  Local Management likes to play favoritism."
bad,"Delegate work for caresource, very unorganized, always threatening employees with PIP’s, management uneducated about the population of consumers that we work with, NO REIMBURSEMENT FOR MILEAGE, caseloads as high as 125 consumers, management has no working knowledge of processes that we have to follow, favoritism, I could go on and on for days. DO NOT WORK"
bad,"The culture at Humana was very over bearing and hard to understand. It seem the training was fast, therefore a lot of understanding the job was hard. We spent 2 weeks in training for about a 5 year experience employee. A lot of the training was who every was available to train at the moment. A lot of the veteran employees where not helpful or they made you feel as if you are bothering them. As a new Agent in Agent support there was a lot of unexplained questions that was not given in training, therefore you picked up what you could, and took short cuts.This seem to work and helped you get through the day. You have to do lot in 7 minutes and you will be graded on calls and take points off if you make a mistake. The employee culture was un-friendly employees, unhappy employees, and a lot clicks. The front ends(supervisor) have their favorites so they cater to them. AEP-open enrollment is very fast pace and busy so the time you take breaks you have to re group and try to get back into the mental of things. The front-ends sit in their office and rarely come out, support, hate to answer questions, and you always had to send a Email even if they are in reach of your desk. I did not enjoy working in Agent Support, and felt that because I was part time. We was treated second hand, had to work late even if we was still new, and was not included in special events. I also felt that they did not appreciate me while I was there. It was nerve wrecking, stressful, and a very bad hostile place to work. I worked for Humana in 1999-2001 and at that time the representation of what the company"
bad,"It used to be a great place to work. That no longer applies. Like most jobs these days there are job cuts, work is contracted out to lower paid companies, cut-throat management tactics, everyone is overloaded due to budget cuts. The customer suffers as well. Humana talks about well-being but are unable to deliver it. Longevity and dedication no longer have any meaning."
bad,"One of the worst companies I have ever worked for during my long nursing career!  Job descriptions consistently change so nurses aren't meeting qa and can't get raises. Changed from salaries to hourly and Humana won't pay overtime even though caseloads are extremely high and it is impossible to get work done in 8 hrs. Nurses are working 10-12 hours and expected to falsify time cards. Personal Nurse role changed dramatically and nurses are expected to ignore their education and training and NOT provide education to beneficiaries regarding their chronic health conditions. Managers listen in on calls to ensure nurses aren't educating beneficiaries about their health conditions. Humana does not follow their own values, does not value employees or beneficiaries and only cares about the bottom line. Unless you are a nurse who wants to work in a customer service role, entering data and only allowed to speak with your patients for 5 minutes because you have a high daily call quota to meet, stay far away from this company!"
bad,Lots of pressure to make calls if people do not answer the phone it is the health coach fault; managment could be rude. Manager had different moods. I would not recommend health coach position to anyone.
bad,"I took the position there in 2015 because it was ""flexible hours"" however, after 5 weeks of training they decided we could no longer ""flex"" our hours and we had to work a standard schedule 5 days per week. I explained to them that I had school and they basically said too bad. Another employee in our large training group was fired on the spot for questioning the ethics of the management. There was also a lot of micromanagement, and the supervisor I had was probably my least favorite boss I have ever had in my career. "
bad,"The pay was good for the job but that's all that was good.  the culture is like being in high school again, not professional at all. If you like insurance it may be a good fit to start a career just not a place where you want to continue a career."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Training is based on favorites, they don't work with your schedule, cant miss work, want you to log in the computer systems before you clock in or you will be considered late, even if you were on time."
bad,"Promotions are based on who likes you not your performance. They promote health perks and rewards but 90% of employees put false info on paperwork to get the bonuses. Weekly wellness breaks.. Inconsistent processes, policies and procedures. Management favoritism determines where you go in the organization. Not diverse or organized. Leadership lacks leadership skills and training. Nice benefits but expensive insurance. Negative, unhappy and miserable employees that have been there too long indirectly influences your success to management. Your only receive recognition for a job well done if you are not smarter than they are. If you are educated and inquire about metrics, operating procedures or anything above your pay grade it is frowned upon and belittlement is bestowed upon you. Manipulative unhealthy environment. Pharmacy department upstairs is Awesome. The Departments are like night and day."
bad,"Humana allowed their managers to blackmailed their customer's service team members. In occasions they had preferences."
bad,Male dominated insurer.  Cut throat and back stabbing.  Expect long hours and weekend work with little to no thank you from upper management.  President's Club awards and advancement opportunities to grow are only available to family members and friends of management- especially in the senior market division.  Florida division a cess pool!
bad,"The upper management does not care at all. They don’t leave their office, you only see them when there is a complaint. The lack of moral is draining. I would not recommend this company as an employer."
bad,poor management no training contracted with another company which has been the worst I have ever seen.  The company would cheat employee's  out of time money wanted RN to work without pay overtime.  Never again
bad,"Very stressful, micromanaged. Very cliquey. Discrimination for differences and age discrimination. Personal grudges by management worked out through work."
bad,I worked 3rd shift and I can't begin to tell you how many employees and managers had major personality issues. There was only one employee out of a dozen that was actually nice.  And management did nothing to improve the work place environment.
bad,"Micro Management Style, Completely out of touch with experience sales professionals. Dishonest management. Attended group meetings, Worked Walmart kiosk . Set appointments and developed NW Arkansas area with focus on Washington county"
bad,This company talks about keeping members healthy. Yet there is nothing being done to help employees stay healthy especially those that have to sit on the phone all day.I do not like anything about my job.
bad,the company i worked for was c3 which work for humana and c3 is a bad company to work due to the fact that they do not care about anyone but there money
bad,"The job itself is not hard. One of the major dislikes I have about the company is there really is no room for advancement unless you are friends or like to go out after work for drinks with the management. The harder you work makes absolutely no difference whatsoever. They don't value the employees they have. They allow people to gossip, treat coworkers unfairly, and do whatever they want with absolutely no consequences because they fear HR will be called on them. It really is like high school at times."
bad,"no job security, constant changes without thinking these changes through.  Failed merger impacted amount of members enrolled and thus cost employees their jobs."
bad,Worked on average 9-11 hours a day.  What was expected by Humana was very difficult to achieve in an 8 hour work day.  They would require you to work a weekend without any notice and would not pay overtime until you were over 44 hours.  The hardest part of the job was the frequent changes of hours needed to work everyday.  One week they would want you to start work at 8am - 4:40pm and the next week it's 10:30am - 7pm.  I did not enjoy any part of this job and felt there was a lack of appreciation for the hard work that was being given by all the case managers.
bad,"On a typical work day look to have an supervisor arguing and sometimes fighting. Management will take of course their co-workers side and that will be that. Its very gross, infested with bed bugs and they dont think its a concern. Calls are back to back all day long and the phones as we as the systems you have to work with hardly work. They grade your calls on how they are feeling that day which interfers with your incenative. Schedules change by the day. Members are upset because orders dont go through most of the time which is being taken out on the agent. They whole est on green road raleigh is a mess!!!!!!!! I enjoyed nothing about the job!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"Humana paints a picture of wanting everyone to succeed. This is FALSE! You are micromanaged and they falsely advertised RN Case Manager Jobs. They need to say production environment!  Everyone here is numbers driven!  Pay is great however not worth the aggravation of micromanagement. No true work life balance. Very stressful, and no trusting environment! DON'T APPLY here! RUN RUN RUN"
bad,I learn to overcome upper management since of lost direction and valued themselves not the customers. Treated members terrible. poor management. But despite of this I was very successful.
bad,"is an insurance company and does not care about employees"
bad,"Management micro manage for no apparent reason, conduct unethical behaviors, major discrimination issues."
bad,"Pay is well, work life balance non existent. Benefits are good.. Nothing else positive. No room for advancement. ,,...,......"
bad,"Very little training to do a massive project, which is micromanaged by incompetent and dishonest people that were only chosen because they knew someone."
bad,"Management has no experience, only care about getting referrals instead of helping the members  who actually need help. No room for growth. Very micromanaged, constantly calling the same members all the time about the same program they are not interested in, Sales driven based production upscale telemarketing, Hostile environment"
bad,I was a licensed telesales agent for Humana and I will admit the pay was very competitive but that's where the positives stop. The management is the worst I have ever experienced and that pertains more to upper management not so much the floor supervisors. They force you to work insane amounts of overtime and when its not mandatory they aggressively pressure you to volunteer for the overtime. Last year during open enrollment I was forced to work 13 days straight and they where 10+ hrs a day at that. I not only wanted time off because I was tired and over worked but I needed time off because my child was sick. I took it up with management and upper management and was told if I missed even one day I would be fired so I was forced to go two weeks with no days off. During open enrollment QA does not exist but when it slows down they will spring QA on you and try to use that to get you fired if your not producing in the top.
bad,"Its a call center ran by a specific religious group and if you didn't agree you were an outcast.  This was a 3rd party vendor.  The kpi were changed to favor the "" favorites"""
bad,"Perhaps other locations are great to work in...Blankenbaker Building is not. Several ""clicks"" and discrimination."
bad,This part was working with clients and learning personal information to better serve them. I love people and meeting different people from different cultures.
bad,Was mostly a career that turned into a job with poor management. Outside of Louisville is a trainwreck. Look elsewhere!
bad,"I learned a lot about auditing and reviewing for hidden information and monies, I was able to spearhead projects for management, and my idea's were used, when I came up with a Standardized Response Tool to resolve market coder verbal message problems, it was implemented, and when I was asked by upper management to re-work the Production Tracker for a better solution to problems they were experiencing, they allowed me to correct it and implemented the new Production Tracker. I felt a sense of belonging and it was a true Team effort there.I worked on the implementation of several other projects, also was given liberty to solve problems and use my resources to fix the problems.Management delegated a lot of responsibility to me, I was a problem solver and they knew it. Also When I caught coding errors by other coders I received recognition and was commended for my attention to detail. What an awesome team."
bad,"Humana is a company that was well structured, allowed no room for failure and was completely sterile in its functions "
bad,"This company does not care about you at all. Management is only involved when you do something wrong, and they have no problem threatening to fire you. Their training was the worst I've ever seen, and then ironically they discipline you for not knowing your job. Despite the decent pay I would never waste my time working for this company, its not worth hating your life I promise."
bad,Terrible place to work. Full of pigeon holes and silos. Given their complete drive to not pay benefits and limit liabilities (read coverage) you would think they would be penalized more. They reward their leaders in creating the most convoluted systems for managing processes and information possible because it delays proper processing of claims.
bad,Leaving Humana was the best thing I ever did.  I have never worked for such an unprofessional organization.
bad,"If you like being micromanaged,constantly harassed about metrics,hold time and time off the phone, then this is the place for you. They say that they want you to provide good customer service,however, they only care about your NUMBERS. I spoke with the elderly population and you cannot make them understand complicated insurance issues in 5 seconds. Management does not have a clue and they are very unprofessional. The computer system is old and is a large reason why you cannot wrap up the call as fast as they would like. Very stressful environment."
bad,"the job had poor training you are put on the phones with poor training. A typical day is on the phones answering calls , dealing with doctor offices, the hardest part is leaders never want to help or make you feel little if you reach out for help. they was rude and no understanding. if you do a good job you get no kind of apprieciated especially if you are new and do a better job than their more veteran employees. The enjoyable part was working with few co-workers who shared my dislike about the company. I believe on higher up would rate this place work. I feel bad for the temp employees they are treated as if they do not exist."
bad,We had flexible hrs to come into work as long as you worked your 8 hrs.
bad,"At first the Glendale facility looked like it held so much potential, and then I heard from security that the front door is ""like a revolving door"" of people leaving. I was a pharmacist in Doctor Calls and had moved across the country after working with another mail order pharmacy for nearly a decade with a stellar record. The RS Humana computer was the worst system I had ever seen and I have seen it all. Even though it was so difficult to work with they still forced very difficult rates, and many, if not all RPhs had to work thru lunches, and after hours to catch up, or look for easy orders to work. I achieved rate after only a few months(one month early) but slowed down after one month, so was just under the required rate a month or so, but did not think it was a big deal until a new manager took over and wanted to change things much too fast and mess with me. Well, that is all I can say for now, since a lawsuit may be coming from me, but I was definitely treated unfairly, and definitely the worst RPh experience of my life. So sad, because I was starting like the associates I was working with."
bad,"The only good part is that was work at home , But very impersonal, but boss did work and did know what the employer was working.  The Company in EU is a good company , with good benefits but the management in PR not good."
bad,"Do not work for this company.  I was hired on 6 month contract for a remediation team.  There was a bunch of “seasoned” RNs of many years that was along with myself  we got the work done faster than they anticipated.  They ended the contract  without any heads up or notice at all.  I worked till 5:30.  6:30 pm I was called by performance, Lol.  Three months into a 6 month contract.  Well that was news to us because we had not been spoken to about performance  we all were doing the same  RUN"
bad,"They have just layed off EVERYONE in. the Atlanta office with NO severance package!! The manager of the Nurse Advisors was extremely insecure and if she perceived someone was more qualified to handle her job as Manager, she would get rid of them by ANY means!!"
bad,Humana was not great to work for in 2014/2015. I hope the management and the environment has changed. I had a bad experience with the management and their insurance was poor at best.
bad,"I thought when I got this job it was going to be a fun and productive place to work. I was wrong,  you would think by you being on the phone with members all day that would be the bad part its not, to me it's actually the best part. I was so misled in my interview Humana does not care about their employees at all only numbers management is horrible they micromanage every minute of the day the training is the worst they want you to go to their Mentor book for everything which is not user friendly by the way instead of actually having a person just show i have already decided to put in my resignation for August 1."
bad,"No job security, top heavy organization. Clinical Leads were just yes men with no authority. My first CCL who hired me was laid off the year before. The program I was hired for appears to be eliminated as company is moving home care division to contract home health agencies. Training for the position was minimal; when I was hired, it was the first time orientation and onboarding was done through video. My mentor was great but I had to drive 1 1/2 hrs one way each day to meet her for visits"
bad,"I worked there for 12 years and within this time I dealt with flimsy management styles. This mean you would have someone who would be supportive if your ideas and suggestions and then they would just feel like you were not a good employee. Over the years I felt like I was in a mentally draining relationship. Ups and downs, highs and plummeting lows. "
bad,they laid off 750 employees in one year. I would never recommend this employer. they do not care about their employees. I hat this place and the fact that you are Ma=AKING me fill this out
bad,I don't have a review for Humana. I have nothing nice to say about them...the management sucks and no one cares about their staff.  I wouldn't recommend working for them
bad,"Poor pay, Ghetto environment. They hire anyone. They will give the whole family a job. Lots of fights and drama. Very unorganized and unprofessional. Starter job only!!"
bad,"when christmas came we had fun however and excellent ability to teach and great ethics work environment, when I first started it was a promising environment with training and advancement however I moved up I was pregnant had a hard pregnancy and from time to time to time they got upset when i took to me off due to doctors appointments and took fmla once i Got off like two days later they wrote me up!! I know arizona is right to work state! But to be  discriminated against because of being pregnant which rumer flies it proved to be correct! they had no remorse or didn't care that i was pregnant and had a hard pregnancy they cared about numbers"
bad,Awful awful awful. Supervisors are really not concerned about you but how much money you can make them in one season. Upper management is worse. Everyone sleeps with each other it's just a mess.
bad,"They don't care about your outside life. The supervisors dont have a care in the world the rules are rules and youre just a body in a seat if youre there youre there if not someone else in the seat regardless your situation, They pay good but they are not flexible."
bad,"Unless you like being micromanaged 8 to 10 hours per day every day this job is not for you. The managers are absolutely clueless, And offered no assistance. I was promised an advace to grow but after almost 8 years I was sitting in the same desk after receiving reward after reward for exceeding in my field."
bad,"Good company overall but they are not good to work remote for. They micromanage everything you do. You are required to tell them when you go to the bathroom and if you are not responding to each and every email they are concerned. When I say every email I mean, they hit""reply all"" to every email about work anniversaries, birthdays, and if someone just had a ""bad day"" it was horrible."
bad,"Upon initial hire, Humana presents as the best place to work.  However, it's nothing like it's presented. Management lacked leadership qualities and there is absolutely no room for growth or advancement, unless you're favored by management.  You receive a credit card with a spending limit of $5000 that you can not spend on anything.  I never understood the purpose of this!  Also, they send you to different states for training (2 weeks) to come back to work and learn a totally different process.  I could go on and on but I just don't have the energy."
bad,"Very hard to advance within this company, HR is a joke, and management will make you believe they care, however they don't they use you to meet metrics to continue to make money for the company"
bad,"I work in the warehouse."
bad,There is no sense of direction and the company is not hiring anyone so be prepared to perform 2 to 3 or even more jobs all at once since they keep laying off employees and they do not hire anyone. Stay away from this company at all cost! They will work you to death...
bad,"Be careful applying for Humana! They have been doing random mass lay offs. Great employees have been laid off including great managers. If you are looking for stability and permanent employment, I would look elsewhere!"
bad,"The work itself was fine and easily accomplished. Constant problems with their systems led to difficulties meeting metrics unless you skipped lunches and breaks. Constant change in leadership, teams, metrics, and roles make this a horrible place to work. No job security unless you are an RN and then they work you to death. The team coaches are mostly good but some are absolute micromanagers that are completely cutthroat. The higher up managers don't care about the associates at all. I would look completely in another direction if you are considering working here. I was lucky - my coach was fantastic."
bad,terrible experience. Poor management. I shouldn't have to write about them in order to apply for a job on your website.humana has poor leadership and is going through major changes at the moment.
bad,Company itself was a good company with excellent benefits....Office Manager very racist finds fault in colored people only....States they have no retaliation policy they strongly  DONT'  honor....Once you contact Corporate with an issue with office manager they immediately inform her to rid of you...The leaders over this company only care for themselves and the higher employees such as the Doctors and PA.....They ask you to perform tasks that is unrealistic and when you don't fall through you will be reprimanded....Severe employee turnover....I will never work for this company again....
bad,"Too  much for one to handle. Management constantly provides verbal threats to one's performance and expectation during every meeting. Managment is not all on the same page and is constantly changing policy and procedure to case manangment procedure which make it hard for employees to be compliant and verbal threats don't help at all!...Working hours are out of normal and its expected at time for employees to work on the weekends. Co-works are good but, not part of a team in the time of a need. Pay is good but, benefits need to be better especially working directly with a health insurance company as big as this one is."
bad,I did enjoy working for the company but was highly displeased with the management. There was only one manger there that I found remotely professional. As for the rest it does not matter your job performance. If they did not like you because you chose not to speak in the disrespectful way they did you pretty much were guaranteed not to be a long time employee. I could go on and on about the nonprofessional experiences in my short time working with Humana.
bad,"Its a company that is hard to work for. No job security, compensation and pay is great."
bad,"A typical day at work was fun. I loved working with Humana members, Staff At Humana was not so good. Nice size cafeteria to have lunch. Work from home was great."
bad,"The work environment is toxic alot of blaming, shaming and mysterious disappearances. Unprofessional management that would publicly shame, criticize and call employees names."
bad,"I loved the job I did, but felt it was unorganized and leadership was ineffective. Sometimes, when help was needed, no one was available."
bad,"Most stressful job I’ve ever worked. Management didn’t seem to have answers for my questions and chat room took a long time to answer questions and even when they did, often it wasn’t a satisfying answer for the customer.  You are graded everyday, through an email where ALL employees see your score alongside their own. Basically, you are expected to never put a caller on hold, to complete all notes while you are talking to them, and move on immediately to the next call."
bad,"This company has become a terrible place to work for. Focus is on quantity and not quality. You are micromanaged every minute and frequent ""performance meetings"" discussing the minutes spent in  between calls and why. Increasing workloads due to employees leaving and no hiring taking place. Your performance is based on whether or not people answer the phone and no consideration given for constant tech issues affecting such performance. People are let go frequently without any warning and false information given as reason."
bad,I currently work in the military department for Humana and we have been in OT for almost a year; 10 hour days including  and Saturdays. No Advancement
bad,It’s sad I was mislead on the job description and now I’m looking for a new position. I was very excited to start this job in March. Now I dread going to work
bad,This facility offered little benefit to working there. Management was shady and the job atmosphere was very high school clique-like. Workplace drama was everywhere.
bad,"Training was not adequate and expectations were extreme. While I loved the group of people I worked with, I was not entering a position that I could succeed."
bad,"The only thing I enjoyed about working here was my coworkers."
bad,"Manager couldn't be bothered, she was too busy, or not in the office.  Poor leadership and no direction or training.  Culture was very  poor...lots of backstabbing and complaining about other departments/managers.  No professionalism."
bad,"Humana could have been a wonderful place to work if there were not so many changes.  The rules changed very often without proper communication from management.  Co-workers were great.  The clients were great.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing what change was coming next, very unsettling.  The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the clients from many different states."
bad,Had little to no interaction with customers or coworkers. It was awful. I sat at a computer all day processing claims.
bad,"You job basically depends on the person you work for. The benefits are good, but they are very difficult to work for. A lot depends on the supervisor you have"
bad,The training class I was put in had a very nice/informative trainer and nice classmates but I soon realized that all that training was pointless once we got on the actual production floor.
bad,Very little time for anything but answering calls . No Interactions w others . Very lil social interaction. No time to finish up other work . Very demanding w no time to finish & highly demanding w minimal training that is greatly needed to understand the zillion of systems you have to access to find the information you need to process calls .
bad,I was put into the role with little support and direction. Culture was not inclusive of outside ppl vs ppl who had been there a long time. Very little collaboration and support.
bad,"Not where you want to go if a long term employment is what you are looking for. This is a good stop gap while going to school. Dealing with customers is not bad, management can micromanage often."
bad,"Humana did not support their folks with effective systems. Continued problems in supporting the providers with not much support to offer solutions."
bad,Not enough work in my area.  Spent 40+ hours on computer training from home and was never compensated for the time.  Very few patients in my area so I was taking patients 1 hour away for a 15 to 30 minute appointment.
bad,Management wants quantity of numbers met at all times this is not always feasible; can be very stressful. There are times breaks and lunch cannot be taken if numbers do not look like they are going to be met.
bad,Humana is a work farm.  10+ hour days is the norm and expected.  If you work here don't expect to have any personal time during the week..........................
bad,"One of the most boring jobs I've ever had. No matter how slow the work day is management doesn't want you talking to your co-workers. I've never had a job that made me feel like I was back in elementary school until I worked here. When the management left out the door you could talk. As soon as the door opens everyone is turning back around facing their computers. Even if the systems were down they want you to sit in your seat and face forward. This department is based on favoritism.  If your not one to kiss up then do NOT apply for the Welcome Calls position. Also, when someone is let go leadership tends to share the reason that the person was let go with other employees. Which is VERY unprofessional and is not supposed to happen. Also, they started a thing that allowed you to earn ""Welcome Call bucks"" which allowed you to use them to buy back occurrences, late arrivals etc.... Only to find out even if you use your bucks you are still getting an occurrence if absent, late etc... They often change how you are able to use them and go against what was originally presented to us In writing. I wouldn't recommend anyone applies for Welcome Calls. Worst job EVER!!!!!"
bad,"I was hired as a UM Onsite Nurse for the Norfolk, VA area, however I worked out of a office in Louisville, KY. The experience I had with this company was by far the worst experience I've ever had as a professional. Leadership/Management is awful!! They will set you up for failure and if you ask questions they will become irrate. UM Department is very unorganized and managers are very unprofessional. Shortly after begininning in the dept I learned that I was the 4th person to resign from that department in less than 6mths....only wish I would have been warned. I can not speak on how other divisions within the company are ran, but speaking from personal experience I do not recommend that ANYONE take a job in the UM dept based out of Louisville, KY."
bad,"One of the most horrible work experiences in my career. Blame game, finger pointing. "
bad,"When you start Humana they would advice you that it’s a family like company !! BUT ITS NOT !! Don’t get sick or have sick children !! I had a issue with the downstairs cafeteria and was let go. My supervisor did not speak to me before hand to get my side of the story for a thorough investigation ! They will not stick up for you at all, even if you have proof ! THEY WILL FIRE YOU !! And they expect yuh to do wayyy to much for the wages they are paying."
bad,"Humana is a great company to work for but management is very unprofessional, it’s like you have to be a brown nose to fit in or get another position. Corp does not listen to the employees but to management"
bad,"Enjoyed the position at first, but when introducing myself to my team, I mentioned my military background, and my manager took offense of how I described my experience and terminated me a few days later.  Nothing was said about job performance or anything.  Beware of what you say when describing what you have done/seen as a nurse because it will be taken wrongly by the narrow minded people."
bad,I was told that it was a temp. to perm. position and that if I met sales goals that they would try to keep me if not in that role a different one but still with the company. I exceeded my goals but was still laid off. I was used and then discarded like an expendable resource not a human being.
bad,"Come in at 6:30 have a meeting and get right to work."
bad,"I was having health issues and was not allowed to work from home even though I qualified. Horrible management, got bounced around teams. Car broke down on the freeway getting to work and they wanted me to pay over a $100 cab fair to get to glendale, I live in mesa."
bad,I have been trying to apply here for a while.   How do you get experience when they will not hire you. I have went to school have degrees and still cant get hired.
bad,"Depending on what department you are working in, you could have a very good experience, or a very poor experience.  They are production driven.  I am NOT a production type person.  They do not practice good employee practices.  They say one thing, then expect something totally different.  My co-workers were excellent, but in constant fear of being fired."
bad,I love working their it was always a challenge and I love challenge. I had to get 12 referrals a day but I exceeded that number always.it was an easy job.
bad,learn alot of things and enjoyed talking to the member on the phone and learning more about the job to take on to another job
bad,hard to please management if you sold insurance and would close the sale they were quality sales. Those are the sales that was money guaranteed in our pockets but they just cared about the amount of appointments scheduled even though they weren't quality because it might not have closed but those were easy to do .. so they would acknowledge sales agent who had the quantity instead of quality.
bad,"very strict managing. new management needed without the boss like attitude and to play the leadership role to thrive together, not only as individuals but as a company."
bad,"Most of my experience with management during my 25+ years at Humana was good except for the last dept I was in, management was very unprofessional, cliquey and had no proper training for new associates. My immediate supervisor actually advised fellow colleagues not to answer questions nor assist me as I was learning the job. "
bad,"Humana is great if you have a good leader, and if you're white, male, and mean."
bad,if thinking about working here think again the team leads were unprofessional they were inconsiderate to the fact of me having children they had there clicks here if you didnt fit in you were singled out this job felt like i was in high school
bad,The company is laying off many employees at this time.  Salary was good  but work environment was horrible due to looming layoffs for my entire 2 year 9 month tenure
bad,It's a great job if you enjoy being harassed and alienated by the other staff.  The staff already has been there for a while and if you don't fit into their mold they will freeze you out.  There is definitely favoritism within the work place so be prepared if you're not a favorite.
bad,Humana terminated 5 of 7 physicians in 6 months. One of the two remaining was not licensed to practice medicine in the U.S.  60 days notification was given.
bad,"He trabajado durante casi un año en Humana, tengo experiencia en el sector de atención al cliente mas de 5 años y Humana, es de los peores trabajos que he estado."
bad,Terrible Leadership. Inadequate administration. Company sets employees up for failure. Will not recommend to my enemy. Very poor management style. No support for employees.
bad,"I can not recommend this company. Very poor training. Thrown onto phones with no practical training and told to fake until you make it, You are graded on calls immediately."
bad,"This company thrives off of belittling their employees and allowing their managers to bully the staff. THERE IS NO WORK LIFE BALANCE. They surveillance your home life and assassinate your character and have lay offs every 4 months like clock work, therefore NO JOB SECURITY!!!"
bad,"Nothing to tell about the company client passed away they wanted worlers to have a car but overall it is a good company i can say that., i do good job"
bad,"Humana was a very great job to work at , the people are helpful, supporting , and friendly . Never have I ever gone through any issues while working there and  they treat every individual as family ."
bad,talked with clients regarding their benefits and helped resolve issues of denials.  Located providers for clients. Can be a fast paced job at times.  Management ok
bad,"The money was great but the employers were not professional at all, i would not recommend this job to anyone. the quality of the company is not fair at all"
bad,hired for AEP they fired all but 20 of us. The top 20 producers. So im not complaining because I cant sell. they rewarded us with a paycut and no benefits.
bad,"the hardest part of job is the location. the job is located in Lovaland, Oh surrounded by nothing. Its a typical day of work. Management is great. you have your desk surrounded by plexy glass."
bad,"Environment was horrible, used and old computer systems, heathcoverage was amazing. Employees have no voice of opinions you are expected to do what management tellls you to do."
bad,The stylists at this shop were not very friendly.  Very stuck up type attitudes.
bad,good place to work.  Management is supportive. Excellent employer for san antonio
bad,"Recently, the company has a pedometer challenge, to get the most steps in 100 days. It was fun competing with others and sharing ideas."
bad,Dealing with negative customers. Customers explaining about horrible experiences. Excepting you to fix their problems when in all actuality you have no control over what happened. No communication. TERRIBLE work environment.
bad,The employees are great to work  very friendly enviroment. One problem they did have bed bug problem but they claim it was taken care of other than that its a good place to work
bad,"Short version:"
bad,The organization does not offer many opportunities or options to its employees. The salary was to low and it was difficult to balance work and student life.
bad,Wouldn't make it long term they are very petty....bathrooms stick..management is horrible...hepititus b going around..flu and all boo ma'am get your coins and go
bad,During the merge no communication on leadership apart. until it was to late ended up laying off a lot of people. Mandatory 8 hours of overtime hardly shows on your paycheck after taxes.
bad,"Low pay"
bad,I was put with mentor who was unwilling to help and would get upset regarding every question I asked. Management did not care about the situation and was unwilling to help me find a new manager.
bad,"Rules are set stating that they are federally regulated because of hippa, I have worked in the healthcare field for 4 years and have never been told I couldn't not wear a shirt because it had a college logo on it because it was a Hippa Violation. Also the could careless about their employees. To expect someone to not miss a single day for 6 months is not realistic. Unexpected health issues can arise and cause problems they should accept documentation from health care professionals. But they do not"
bad,fun work place with supportive team member not staff. they don't allow you to elevate within the company you would really have to do some serious sucking up to especially if your coming from an agency not and one of their associates.
bad,The hardest part of the job is being confine to a desk for 7.5 hours but there is room for advancement within the company. Team leader is more knowledgeable the management.
bad,"High call volume, high turn over. I truly enjoy my co-workers that are still there. Disappointing. Don't drink the kool aid."
bad,"If you were part of the church, you were in.  Bonus were lost quit frequent. Inappropriate advances were very common.  Very common call center.  They systems went down a lot so movies are played in the lunch room quite often.  Management didn't know how to help us at all.  It was us finding answers and 100% depending on our selves."
bad,"Aegis was the issue, not Humana, The only issue with Humana is all their system errors other than that the work itself is easy. Its the company I was employed through that was Pathetic"
bad,"Process medications for the members, making sure the members prescriptions were in order."
bad,I would anwer calls and provider auth and claims status to providers.
bad,"My day starts with logging into system, bringing up files needed"
bad,"I presently work for Humana (RightSource Pharmacy) and have never worked for a company so unorganized, unprofessional, not family friendly (contrary to what they claim). They feel micromanagement is the way to run a company and employees. The turnover rate is indicative of this companies position on family and requiring employees to work mandatory overtime (10 or more hours per week). They are not concerned with being family friendly their bottom line is the almighty dollar that they make alot of ($6 million in 2010). Make Humana your last choice for a job."
bad,"If you are outgoing and like to have fun, this is not the job for you. They track everything you don from when you clock in to when you clock out. How long you go to the bathroom. Your breaks are specifically timed."
bad,"Do what you say don’t say what you won’t do."
bad,"Thrown on a cold calling campaign (after being told in the interview there was none) and then forgotten about for over a year, little to no coaching or career planning, poor morale made coming in hard."
bad,"work day is 8 hours day"
bad,"Extremely understaffed.  They take on a new contract and didn't have the manpower to handle the calls.  They assign you to new positions with no training and no pay increase.  They downscore you for every little thing you do.  You are never to make a mistake.    It is impossible to ever feel that you are doing a good job.  They want you to fail.  "
bad,hostile work environment. Horrible work life balance. No job security. Do not walk the talk. Would not recommend this company as a good place to work.
bad,Fun and silly most work days just to help time go by for any employees! Different culture and leanered very exciting things with everyone! Daily meetings with shift to explain day.
bad,"Company’s culture was very good 2012-2014 ish but changed for the worse, health plan benefits are very bad with very high deductibles. Annual reduction in force is a regular occurance. Leadership on all levels imply transparency but this is not the case. Bright side is tuition reimbursement and overall coworkers work well with others."
bad,"management is all over the place, unstable and unreliable.  they fire people every month. unreliable, lack of job stability, lack of growth and opportunities for growth, you have to  behave like ""alice in wonderland"".  you have no opinions."
bad,It was just horrible. Plain and simple. 2 years of my life I'll never get back and probably has been shortened a little. Between lying about pay raises and 12+ hours a day 6 days a week for 5 months was unbearable
bad,"Starting with Humana, Inc. was a confusion experience, with massive lack of communication on travel to training.  But after that, I worked with a wonderful supervisor and a very unified team of employees.  A second supervisor was brought in and several of us were put under her direction.  What a great experience.  A very professional person, caring, easy to work with, available, excellent trainer.  Then a huge deal with a local healthcare company fell through and managers just disappeared and people left and since then, there has been a steady downfall in skilled and trained management and a high turnover rate.  Now, raises of any kind are on hold and a skeleton staff is trying to run the network operations.  We have lost 4 people in our department in just 4 months.  Time to move on."
bad,The place is changing. They offer work at home however they only promote certain people favoritism is bad. Procedures seem to stress providers. Changes are not explained to people so they can relate or understand.
bad,"pt. visit in the hospital to dcp prior to  dc home. provided contact information if dc with dc program, review dc order meds and md w appts- management was poor without observing issires"
bad,"Provider development for the Ohio market has a lot of potential, but it is ran by an egotistical manager that is not very organized or knows how to manage people. She is very forgetful, poor communication skills, will take your ideas as if they were her own, and  will try to block you if want to go to another department. The area has been understaffed for 3 years. Attrition is horrible. Unable to retain people because of HORRIBLE management. Humana can be great, but not contracting positions in the Ohio market under the current managers leadership. Additionally the company continues to undergoo business changes and cutting departments and people. Stability not guaranteed anymore. Focus is business more than ever."
bad,"Management in the beginning was good then there are many in the department I was working within that had intentions to overstep boundaries act as a clinical nurse and would do anything to get to the top.  Humana overworks some that are very good such as my immediate supervisor at the time which was a RN then because he was so overloaded delegated to a woman to whom began to be overwhelming and only worried about numbers so she could climb the corporate latter.  There is a lot of that in that large corporation.  Also at first you think you are helping the medicare advantage members when in reality you are just making Humana richer with no better benefits for either the members nor the employees.  They also do not listen well and assume.  It's a large power trip and I don't believe in being fake and stepping on people to get anywhere in a company.  I believe you earn it.  They give absolutely no incentive to exceed in your work.  Raises are 1 to 2 % a year, health insurance benefits for employees are horrible - esp. being they ARE a health insurance company.  They do not pay you nearly enough, no bonus plan for your years, no incentive at all.  No Christmas bonus, not even a turkey.  It's about making Humana rich bottom line.  I worked there for years.  I wouldn't recommend working there for many more reasons.  I don't think they will allow that many letters in this review."
bad,"This was an interesting place that really shows that the ""Good old boys network"" is still in effect.  Sad that places have to be so Cut Throat. The upper management is lost in their glass palace.  Not sure why they say one thing and do another."
bad,Poor management and a complete lack of regard to employees post aetna merger denial by DOJ. Lack of leadership with an emphasis on nothing but meeting numbers/metrics. No increase in pay or bonuses etc since I have been employed there.
bad,Worked for the company for many years and took a long time to move up.  Accounts weren't accurate and issues with getting health insurance contracts loaded for benefits.
bad,Not a place for people who needs work life balance not a friendly place when it comes to your life outside of work
bad,Benefits at this company is great minus the horrible medical package. Now everything else depends on your region. If you don't work in the corporate office then good luck. The management at the company is like the blind leading the blind. No one knows nothing. Seriously. They want you to create so many workarounds that the workarounds needs a workaround. I really wish I was joking. If you suck up enough you might get an award for it but don’t hold your breath because all the bonuses goes to the managers that take your ideas and make them their own but if you asked them a question about the process they stole the answer will be “I have to send that up” or “find a workaround”.
bad,The ability to advance was not available locally. You must relocate and the culture was changing due to the new healthcare options being introduced
bad,"Benefits are poor, there values are poor and they don't back them up, training is good. Job security is also very poor, outsourced many positions,"
bad,I spoke with customers about there benefits for medicare and pharmacy. Also review claims and answer customers questions about there billing for pharmacy and medical
bad,Temporary employee not treated well. Mid level management  aka team leads lack maturity and professionalism. Daily and weekly positive desk workout tips.
bad,"You are not heard sometimes. Had a boss (my last boss), that would roll her eyes at me/us, like we were toddlers; she was very disrespectful to everybody in the department. No one could stand her. She really made our lives miserable."
bad,"The only thing they care about is having someone there to answer the phone. They don’t care about anything else. They set ridiculous goals after having painted themselves in a corner with pricing, then expect impossible standards to be met. Yet another company that cares only about their bottom line, not the customer or employee."
bad,They let me go while on FMLA trying to get my mentally ill daughter help and they really did not care I was just another number and not an employee. Rockem Sockem Robots with the mandatory hours of overtime
bad,"I spent three long years with Humana just to watch the advancement opportunities to be given to less deserving individuals. Those in leadership roles I felt were great, were smudged out. You either conform or fold. Ridiculous mandatory OT forced many people to stress about chi and d care, shift bids were based on favoritism."
bad,"If I knew then (before I accepted the job) what I know now - I would NEVER have accepted this position. I have had experience with hospitals & small/large medical practices. I do not remember ever being treated and/or spoken to as if I was a child. I don’t believe, in all good conscience I could NEVER recommend that ANYONE work for Humana, particularly Central West Region"
bad,"Humana does not walk the talk. They say they promote work/life balance, but in reality it is only a tagline. They have mediocre benefits and don't promote growth outside the HQ region. They would rather wait 9-12+ months looking for the right external candidate than to give a decent match internally the chance to try.  They would rather work the existing staff to the brink of exhausting than backfill appropriately."
bad,"management micro manages, ever changing unrealistic expectations.  always under the microscope.  it is a good place to gain telephonic nursing experience but not a good place to stay long term due to the stress-very micro managed, always several people listening to your calls with subjective grading criteria.  if you enjoy living under a microscope and meticulously clocking in/out to use the bathroom, go there and stay."
bad,"Management here is terrible, no one knew what they were doing, not the SME's not the Managers not the workers. Things were always moving around and the contract was shut down from C3 to Humana because they didn't like C3's business at all."
bad,"The turnover rate is high because of the amount of stress and mandatory OT hours you work. You take phone call upon phone call without a second in between. If you are 1 minute late for break, you are reprimanded. You cannot even take off for scheduled appointments to stay healthy. You can’t leave a member on hold for less than a minute. Unattainable goals. If you have 3 occurrences in a 90 day period you lose the job. An occurrence can be being late to work or being sick, etc."
bad,"For advancement, you may have to move to another states due to the location only has a few departments. Management is disorganized. Working for an insurance company the benefits are very poor."
bad,you would think with all the info they cram in your head in their poorly time scale for training they would pay you the leads are not knowledgable than reps
bad,"If you're an immoral person  without values or a conscience,  then this is the job for you.  If you DO have values and you're a caring, compassionate  person,  you may want to keep looking."
bad,"The Managment with this company is very poor. There is zero to none opportunity for advancement. The work hours average from 50 to 60 hours per week, which is a huge change from what I was informed. Everything changed significantly, even the pay. "
bad,they really cared about the company and not the employees. you dont get anytime off from October to December due to aep but they would want you to work 13 hours days but if you where sick they would give you an occurrence
bad,"Humana Waterside Building"
bad,I no longer work for Humana.  The region I worked in is much different from all other regions. They treat staff like factory workers instead of beneficial assets to the organization
bad,Humana needs to start hiring managers that can actually do the work that they are supervising or managing. They have inexperienced LPN's over RN's which is backwards. There is too much favoritism. I faced harassment and discrimination. There is no advancement in certain departments.
bad,"It wasn't for me, but a job is a job. There were a lot of double standards, which at the end of the day is not right. Not a lot of room for moving up, and when asked about it, management found a way to blow you off."
bad,"your experience could vary.  Overall, Humana likes to be able to say they offer the employees many nice options to participate in health and wellness groups and activities.  However, they give nothing important for free like gym memberships for gyms that are in the buildings.  Additionally, because they are so focused on the bottom line and doing more with less, the employees are overworked and do not have time to practice any of the health and wellness activities the C suite preaches.  Expect your calendar to be triple booked at all times if you work here!  There is also a yearly biometric incentive.  Interestingly, Humana's goal for its employee's is below the national guidelines.  Don't want to give that money away!"
bad,"The management staff needs improvement. Its like high school all over again. There is a lot of showing favoritism and people taking things to personally. We are all adults and should leave personal life and personal feelings elsewhere. If an agent is a good agent and knows their job, then that is all that should matter"
bad,If you are older get ready to be in lay-off.  Meetings are crazy and almost totally daily.  quotas are out of sight.  professional automony is non-existent.  upside is working from home. downside is work load and expectations.
bad,Awful place to work. The CEO was obnoxious and caused undue stress. The job itself was fine as was the manager. It was just the ridiculous manner of the CEO.
bad,"fun environment to work in, little to none career progression and little to none compensation after being trained for multiple skills. best thing about work is the ability to work from home."
bad,"Humana is a good company but it does not care about the people in the call center."
bad,"If you are hired as a CSR in any of the Call Centers don't expect to ever leave. Every call and keystroke is monitored. Don't get sick or have a medical issue, they are not forgiving. If it's not done the Humana way... You're out."
bad,"loved being home  hated micromanagement and changes weekly to every policy imaginable  and tight tight restrictions .high employee turnover .  more focused on metrics and not quality of patient care even though they claim they are.  Not employee centered at all...focus is no making money for the company and CEO who makes literally millions while jobs are reduced by the hundreds quarterly over the past 16 months. some flexibility and great PTO ."
bad,"Where to start.... The training was so bad.  Thrown in a classroom with 30 other people and given a book and told read this, you'll have a test in a week.  The instructors were bad.  They had no idea what they were teaching.  They changed my hours three times.  I went from inbound sales to outbound cold calling.  The company changed its commission scale in the middle of the season.  It's just a horrible place to work."
bad,The organization is undergoing a time of great change and is very disorganized.  The communication within the organization is improving however it negatively impacts the success level they hope to achieve.  The recent  downsizing has impacted the quality of services Humana offers requiring more from the associates.
bad,"Starts off at 11 an hour that's it no raises unless you move up to supervisor no matter how long you worked there benefits are overpriced and come out of your check every week, counts going to the bathroom as a break"
bad,Failed merger with Aetna created drastic change to the company and limits career advancement opportunities. Management disconnected from what the company's employees actually do.
bad,"Multiple layoffs, right before holidays, yet big bonuses for higher ups. No job stability or advancement bc all the open jobs go to laid off nurses. Layoffs go by “favorites” as well. No rhyme of reason yet claim “HR algorhythm”"
bad,"Demanding beyond training"
bad,"If you love nursing, do NOT take this job. I was hired for the county in which I live, but was placed two counties away when my first patients came in six weeks later.  The clients are confused as to why you can't even check their vital signs.  Half of the clients were not interested in the service but my supervisor made me constantly call them again and again.  I felt like a salesperson.  My supervisor would text me whenever she wanted to, even if it was six am or late on a Sunday night.  I tried my best to keep this job but it made me feel sick, in the end."
bad,Love forming relationships with members and at the beginning was actually helping them with their health but they change the rules so much that you are only collecting data for them now and nothing else. Also not a secure place to work right now.
bad,Not the best place to work if you are looking for advancement in other areas. I have never worked at a place where you were competing with your boss for the same position.
bad,"The work was hard and time consuming.  Long time traveling on the road and after work is over, you spend a lot time charting.  Work is very hard and time consuming."
bad,The best part is being able to work from home. The expectations are too high and cannot be achieved in a normal work day. They do not care about the employee's wellness or balance.
bad,"Office politics is inevitable. Management needs to learn how to deal with age differences, cultural differences and how to not develop an inflated head from the job titles. I was sexually harassed by a supervisor. I reported it and nobody did anything about it. Work place violence is real at this company."
bad,"its a job,  the culture is sub par it is very stressful and the stress is unwarranted and unneccessary. Policies and procedures changed too frequently. little to no time to train or be off the phones, not viewed as an employee just a robot to get work done"
bad,Full time employees Not Helpful.  Management was clueless.  Poor working environment.  I am sure some departments in Human are ok but I was not so lucky
bad,"Cares about their employees."
bad,"My experience was STRESSFUL! The way they train and treat their LTE employees is dispicable. The team leaders lack of integrity, organization and people skills. They create strife amoung employees competing for full time positions. There are leaders who take advantage of their positions. They're unprofessional and unethical. As an HR professional, I am appalled at their employment practices. Beware and save yourself the frustration."
bad,"As a field care manager, you are expected to travel to clients homes and do assessments to see what resources and/or education they may need. Sounds great!"
bad,I did learn a lot from Humana but mostly things like everyone is replaceable and the best thing you can do at any company is to use the skills they give and grow and take any chance you can to learn to gain more experience as that cannot be taken from you.
bad,"I was a cog in a machine. I was hired to provide a service but my department's business model was recreated to a sales model which was so radically different from its original design and scope. The job turned from pure customer service to how many people I could run through the system. I was one of many who quit but I had 4 of 16 of my coworkers stay and one of them told me that they switched back to a pure customer service model because of the spectacular failure that the business model turned out to be with Medicare patients."
bad,Engaged environment with alot of learning and opportunity.
bad,Humana Military is a miserable place to work. There is no opportunity to advance. The company wants to micro manage every aspect of the business. The medical insurance is horrible. Employees are forced to do a biometric screening in order to get medical insurance.
bad,Humana is organized chaos. They will hire everyone that will pass their easy windows assessments. Their overall strategy is to hire as many people as possible and secure a steady workforce population based on expendability. The management team at this particular branch is unprofessional and disconnected from the agents.
bad,Humana is not a family oriented work place. Very stressfull
bad,"Micro management, no flexibility at all, no opportunities for advancement"
bad,"This job is not family friendly. Scheduling is chaotic. The company makes changes just for the sake of change without vetting out the application of the changes. Production expectations are highly unrealistic in certain situations. Leadership promises a work environment that treats you like family, when what they provide is open criticism of performance to the entire team/facility; harassment of employees; lies to justify their actions; none of leadership can ever provide the same or even correct answer when staff have a problem. Make this one of the last resort options for a job."
bad,Started working there business had inconsistant network system in place and company expected employees to take blame when a lot of issues were due to inconsistencies in work system hardware. Learned a company can let you go fo no reason in the State of Ohio.
bad,"Opportunity for training and learning, but no compensation for it. Under paid and over worked."
bad,"It was a nice place to work the he team is friendly, the training was good , once getting on the floor you felt as if a little more time in training class would be great"
bad,Humana is very lucky to have the selfless dedicated staff they have.  Unfortunately the lack of Healthcare Providers to service the Members is a true reflection of the way they feel about their caretaking staff.
bad,Don't hire new management to manage an entirely new team. Hire management that has empathy and not a slave driver.  Stop treating adults like children.
bad,They treat agents like replaceable cogs in a machine there technology barely works. Intimidation is how the director gets people in line.  Business processes change on a whim.  There no leaders only managers.
bad,"• Members frequently unaware they were enrolled in program for regular phone calls from nurse, thus didn't answer calls. RNs held responsible."
bad,Another company that doesn't care about its employees. It takes years to earn a decent wage and it feels like they are constantly trying to fire you. Their only concern is the business need and there is no forgiveness. You are a number and you will either excel or they will get rid of you. Once they are done with you they are done. It doesn't matter how many years of your life you gave them.
bad,The SNP (Special Needs Program) at Humana is very stressful & volatile with constant changes to policies.  There is constant reviewing of documentation of charts which are then returned to nurses frequently in quest to achieve total accuracy and perfection.  There is very little room for advancement with quality RN's having few opportunities.  The pay and 401K are good - not great.  Telephonic conversations are all recorded and monitored with Verint.
bad,The organization has much variability depending on the department in which a person works.  High deductible health plan for associates.  Consistently long hours with changing management.
bad,"Workload typical but depending on which manager you get you could get someone supportive and wonderful. Otherwise, you could get someone who is vindictive and vengeful."
bad,"A typical day at Humana was a slow start. I had to get my computer up in running. I had to pull open up all of the browsers, and excel spreadsheet and other documents were to be used to perform job functions effectively"
bad,"I worked for the QA360/QA720/Access Management team.  It’s 100% a contractor mill.  They’ll manipulate you into thinking you have a chance of being hired on after your contract period ends but no one ever does. I’ve seen at least 5 people come and go, many of whom contributed quite a bit and were strung along, and yet they’ll keep people who are literal HR dumpster fires, malignant narcissists, alcoholics, and lunatics that talk to themselves on the payroll. You’re told to work hard to prove yourself while all the associates do the bare minimum to simply not get fired, if that. "
bad,It should have been an excellent job.  The management was poor.  They have no idea how to manage people.  Micromanagement was how we were controlled.  It was an extremely stressful place to work.
bad,It is a fast pace job with customers constantly calling in. At times you are given the responsibility to resolve issues that might of accrued during a person visit or try to explained a person benefits that was not properly explain to them previously
bad,Towards the end of my tenure it got pretty stressful. Because you never knew what was coming next. It was stressful because we knew that a layoff was coming we just didn't know who.
bad,"I loved working there, but work life balance was not really a balance, metrics that were impossible to meet, management only seeing the numbers not the impact on the members, very high stressed job with no advancement even though i tried several time, i try to transfer to a different team and my transfer was frozen mid way, only way to get off the team was to leave all together, i had awesome attendance, i hit perfect quality every month and i always went above and beyond with my members but end of the day, it was not recognized, a lot of favortism especially that family are working together, not a very fair place to work"
bad,"stressful, 3-4 layoffs occurred in my 2.5 years there.  Change weekly formats , sometimes daily.  ====================================================="
bad,"The company overall is ok, however when you work through a vendor sight it is horrible. Supervisors sit and have team leads do their work and they get recognition for it while the team leads are talked down on when something small is incorrect."
bad,"I worked non stop and pulled the most OT in my Department. Never the less with good ratings, busting my butt in hours and full dedication I was let go. Now they are hiring people to do my job for less money. It is not the first time in this decade they have done this to thier workforce."
bad,"The office I worked in was filled with leaders who lacked integrity and when HR became involved, they were very biased towards management."
bad,"If u want to be considered a number instead of a person to upper management. ..then this place is for you!!! "
bad,A workplace with no real leaders that affects the potential of the company. Leadership with no openness to trying to improve overall business practices thus affecting employees and the opportunities of becoming successful within the company.
bad,"Assist claimants, providers and clients with problems or questions regarding their claims and/or policies, including processing and paying clinical claims. Humana is currently going through downsizing."
bad,Poor immature managers are hired often. It’s very hard to transfer with cold automated emails from HR saying you aren’t qualified. Quality was sacrificed with a constant push for quantity
bad,"Always system issues going on, you still have to work around it perfectly , which quality anylist will still score you as normal. Very stressful work place , too many cheifs not enough Indians. not easy to get promoted when your work speaks for it self. Very under paid , the job description expands at least once a week its something different , the skills we have should be getting paid way more. Favortism. can't trust anyone/ Micro managing which causes stress and depression."
bad,They work you long hours on the phone breaks and lunches. Hard to trust upper management they tell you lies all day oh and in going system issues from day one
bad,"Typcial day at work, coming in logging in to the computer and taking phone calls. the Phone calls, we would the members with prescriptions refills, bill payments, conflicting issues concerning prescriptions. Usually i would work at least 60 hrs a week."
bad,"Humana is horrible to work for as a nurse! They have no support for their nurses and  you manage over 200 members. The members are great when they want to answer their phones. The ones that did I loved teaching them about their diabetes etc.  In training all they talked about was you can take care of your members don't worry. WELL NOT TRUE!! It's all about the NUMBERS!!!! They could give a dump if their members were cared for. You have to get 8.7 SUCCESSFUL CALLS a day. That's if your mbrs want to answer their phone. If you don't get the numbers OMG!! The world will explode!! You bring your team down with you too if your numbers are low. Even If they keep you on the phone for a 2 hr conference call then a meeting you still had to get the numbers even if you have to stay over to get them. If you get sick in the middle of the day OMG the numbers again!!! If you get a great Coach, mentor that really trains you and knows what they are talking about, and a great team then you're golden but I got a micromanaging fool as a coach!!! She would ask for an opinion and I would give it then she would take my head off. My god if you didn't want the truth then why ask!! You had to account for every minute you are on the clock even if you were having technical difficulties.  You still had to get your numbers!! Yes I said it again!!  Humana punishes you for advocating for your mbrs and they only care about how they ""look"" to the world.  Good money, ZERO support! Prepare to leave this company on bad terms for a job well done!"
bad,"went through a temp agency and it was awful, then getting into the company was awful. The job description was MUCH more than what was told to me upon hire. The management is awful, you get different information from different ""tier"" employees, and their time off policy is awful. If you have a family, they don't care if your child gets sick, or something comes up."
bad,"Fast paste call center with high stress level."
bad,"you don't get regular raises, you never know when you will be let go, no job security, they say they are for their employees but they aren't, they are all about managers and directors and the little people just do all the work."
bad,"This is not the place for a person if you want management to hear your voice, and want to be considered a contributing person within the company.  Mainly seeming uneducated for all intensive purposes, you make a suggestion to leaders about better ways to do things, and it pretty much gets shot down.  Many of the case managers get treated like slaves, having to stay on late into the night as well as getting no compensation for this AT ALL.  There is no way to manage the cases without having to stay extra hours as a salaried employee, so ask for a lot of $$$ up front.  People who are lost, get promoted seemingly as they are pals with other management employees.  I personally was being trained by a nurse and she received so many IM's across the wire I asked why was she/he answering all these question appearing to be more for supervisors?  Her/his response is because management wont. I am a good employee and had been working in the field, but when I explained the job I just transferred to was not for me, I was kicked out of the company permanently.  So basically, there is no job work life balance unless you' re a 'manager' and your Lynx system turns off directly at 5 O'clock.  On compensation/benefits, I wanted to go a bit higher for pay as it was reasonable, but heck and high waters, the insurance they provide us with is horrible, deductibles as high as 4,800$.  the max out of pockets were like $12000 (yes, that's 3 zeros). That's too high for an insurance company.  Bruce you've got to get it together.  Your like the current President of the USA, making to much money and not sharing"
bad,"Insurance company with insurance problems."
bad,"This is a HUGE company.  There is an 800 number for HR and an 800 number for tech support.  Of the over 50,000 employees in the US less than 200 employees are aware of the Guidance Centers.  Impersonal, out of touch with employees.  I feel like a number every single day."
bad,"I worked for Humana on the Direct Marketing Sales team. I was great at my job and promoted a fun work environment. I was always there for my teammates and worked above and beyond my specific role."
bad,"the best part was leaving,management was not helpful, they worked like a machine."
bad,"Humana is a government contractor so they have to prove they hire and promote minorities. So if you are not in one of those groups, even your 20 to 30 year experience will not help you advance. Some kid that came from Taco Bell will get the nod after two or three years with the company."
bad,The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with the members. The hardest was lack of communication from co workers. I
bad,"I started with Humana in September 2009 on the MarketPOINT (Sales) side as an Administrative Services Coordinator. Moved over to our newly developing NNO team in July 2011 with hopes of becoming a Provider Consultant working from home so I could be more flexible for my daughter with special needs (I'm a single parent). Moving over meant losing money, increasing my commute from 3.5 miles one way to 57 miles one way. But I took the risk as a stepping stone into my next position. I was told in recent months that they are not expanding into the area I live, it's all up north, so the opportunity I saught when moving here is now gone. I have a micromanager who started in Nov. 2011 and she is destroying this team. All of us are looking elsewhere for employment. When I told my manager that I was looking, 2 weeks later I was put on a CCIP, which is basically a write up that stays on your record and keeps an employee from transfering for 6 months. Humana as a whole is really a good company to work for... the market in CA, not so good."
bad,Supervisors are lazy and want you to do their job along with yours.  They like to micro manage every minute of your day.  Many have been there for 25 to 30 years so going to HR is a waste of time if you have issues with your supervisor.
bad,"The company said that it wanted all of these aspects for the employees but I literally felt micro managed, unsupported as a mom, unable to take the time needed to complete Go 365 or even explore my benefits.  My manager was local and I was treated very differently than everyone else on our team.  I totally admired to goals for employee health with Humana.  I believe I was singled out and hopefully I had a negative experience that other employees don't experience.  I reported my boss to his boss and it was a downhill spiral after that.  I was a running joke at my house that it depended on if I would lose my job each day.  It's not that funny  but my manager struggled to give me credit for major achievements but he was very quick to exaggerate a perceived problem or question.  It's been a struggle since being terminated, even though I've found other employment, it was just December 9th.  It seemed very intentional so that I wouldn't be paid for the holidays or receive a bonus if there was one to receive."
bad,"Departments within Humana are very siloed.  My experiences are not indicative of all departments.  There is a steep learning curve to Humana which can be softened through prior health care insurance experience.  Most of my time at Humana was very pleasant and I felt the leadership was mostly trustworthy.  However, that changed very quickly when some Executive leadership retired.  The department I worked in became very caustic and ruthless as evidenced by the movement and retirement of experienced employees."
bad,"The job is unique compared to other types of nursing.  Working at home all the time had its pros and cons.  The worst thing was feeling like you’re not being heard regarding the expectation of completing a high caseload within a specific timeframe performed perfectly.  Whenever there was a significant policy issue, I was ignored until it was a huge problem.  I felt like a robot, and I was treated like one."
bad,I was employed as salary and was expected to work many more than the given 40 hours a week.  I know they have went to hourly since I worked there.  It was extremely stressful and I had a horrible manager.  When things were reported to HR about her bullying and even gave them documentation of recorded calls of what she said and did but the company did nothing.
bad,"After working there for two years to get experience in insurance, I can say one thing for sure......do not work in the call center. If you want to work for Humana, work out in the field as an agent. The call center is a very toxic work environment, with managers and their supervisors not knowing how to train new agent, coach tenured agents, how to plan an efficient business model let alone follow the ones they had already set. The upper management was honestly the worst I have ever witnessed in any work environment. They were too busy literally walking up to each agents desk, asking why they were taking bathroom breaks, when they should have been planning for the busy season with coherent strategies. When the industry's busy season is within two months, where the company would make 80% of it's revenue, the upper management should already have plans in place for agents to be successful. The only benefit to working for Humana, in the call center, is the paycheck and health benefits."
bad,"I worked for this company up until they denied my doctors request to let me process claims from home. Management can allow people to work from home if they choose. Also the management was almost always in a ""meeting""."
bad,"OVERALL, it was a good job and a decent place to work. The pay was good, the flexible scheduling was awesome, the benefits were okay. HOWEVER, and this is really only speaking for my department, the management sucked. "
bad,The company overall is ok. The customer service department is horrible. You Will constantly be lied to by upper management and moving up into other departments until 18 months of unrealistic expectations. They have a high turnover rate in the call center dept and unrealistic work expectations on a daily basis. The call volume can be so bad you don't even get to sip your drink before next call. You are expected to answer each call within seconds and are to resolve all callers issues within 6minutes..you don't get a penny more for upskill training..and if you are unlucky you will be placed with a supervisor who micromanage your every move like a hawk
bad,The gruesome overtime is constant! They do not have work life balance and work you to the bone all they care about is numbers in my department! You will receive constant notifications when your numbers are not meeting but the whole site all together are low on numbers..... in order for you to get promoted  you will have to be “popular “ I would say.
bad,Favoritisms! Always a problem to ask for time off and arrange PTO.this company is a joke! No one knows what’s going on the floor is always empty sups never around to help
bad,This company hires medical professionals for the purpose of saying that they are there. You have no opportunity to to utilize your nursing experience. You are micromanaged with rules and screen recording.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Regimented; extremely fast paced, numbers driven. Work from home is a perk however, co workers were not kind nor supportive and management had a deaf ear. I think success at Humana may depend on what supervisor you have. Some are good, many are not."
bad,"If you like a lot of stress in your life, then this company is for you!  They have you pressured from day 1 having to self-teach all about health insurance so you can sit for the state licensing exam in less than 2 weeks.  They pay the first time, if you don't pass, you have 2 more chances to take the tes - on your dime.  If you don't pass, you're done.  Same for the CMS AHIP training- 3 chances or you're out.  The phone ""role-playing"" is a joke.  This is supposed to prepare you for being on live calls - it doesn't.  Quality is always on you, and you have to be very careful what you say and don't say regarding Medicare.  Not a fun job.  Management stinks--from the call center leader on down.  If you finally get on the phones after all the learning and testing stress, then you have the stress of making sure you hit everything  you are supposed to say, and nothing you are not.  Plus, quality is always listening.  The system for directing the calls is a joke.  Good luck."
bad,"Screw you in, burn you out and replace you is the mantra at Humana. Unfortunately they are more concerned with the shareholders than they are with the employees and the insured."
bad,Was not a good place to work.  There was a lot of micromanagement going on.  Even the managers were scared of losing their jobs due to production standards and having standards that were just not realistic.
bad,"Job description is making contact with member discharged from the hospital within 24 hrs. See member asap, assist with community resources which Humana does not provide. Hardest part of the job is micromanagement wanting to know where you at all times. Best part is much accrued PTO."
bad,"Work from home position.  Lots of layoffs and management changes.  No consideration of work-life balance and no flexibility.  Management completely focused on money and neglected member's needs. Job was also not challenging and there was no room for advancement.  They did not follow through on what they preached and gave false hope.  While employed there, they took away time for medical appointments (was 3 hours/week) and required us to use PTO. We were also switched to hourly employees."
bad,"No matter the quality, production or work ethic, when it comes to getting raises and promotions it's based on who likes who. Management values the opinion of associates who they're buddies with rather than make management decisions as they should. Some people get away with things others can't. Too much favoritism."
bad,"Nice to be able to work from home, but it seems impossible to move on from the call center and advance your career. No vacation time available and the hours always change."
bad,"They wouldn't give me the hours I needed.  And they didn't like to pay overtime.  Human/senior bridge is currently in a class lawsuit for that very reason.  The people in the office, the head nurse specifically only talked to me when she wanted to get on my case about something.  Other than that,they didn't care about me."
bad,"Proficient in utilization review with the use of evidenced-based guidelines. Perform face-to-face visits with hospitalized Humana Medicare members. Assess, monitor, and attempt to resolve any barriers to discharge. Identify appropriate resources and potential programs to promote the health and well-being of Humana members after discharge. Collaborate with members of a multi-disciplinary team. Able to work independently in a fast-paced environment."
bad,"it's a Dilbert-esque hellscape of endless meetings and little actual productivity. Political infighting and laborious, counterproductive processes drag down every initiative. The entire culture has a bias towards inaction and avoiding risk."
bad,Computer documentation system was way behind the times & down a lot of the times causing delays in home health documentation for private pay clients.  Disappointing management.
bad,"You were required to work overtime even on weekends. Some weeks you would have 80 plus hours of work time in just one week. One minute you would be told you were a fax associate and the next you were only a phone associate. It was very inconsistent. No opportunities to move up within the company unless you were the ""manager's"" favorite or hung out with them outside of work."
bad,"I really enjoyed working, but the management was poorly handled. We was blamed for the NPS score not up by 35, the member gave us 100%. but Humana low"
bad,"I worked in office 3 yrs and work at home 3 yrs, there was no interaction created in office or gathering for those who work at home. Everything was focus on work and where the company was going. Productivity is pyrimont."
bad,I worked for Humana as a temporary associate with the given expectation of being hired on as a full time associate. There were ridiculously long hours and few days off. The pay was okay but it would have been nice to have a better work life balance.
bad,"It starts off solid with many promises and excitement. After being there several years you realize it’s hard to advance and they layoffs start and have continued for the past 18 months. This has left many people with uncertainty with little reassurance from management regarding the future. Work is our livliehood so uncertainly, stress, constant changes and now very low morale has left the environment to be less than desirable! It takes a big toll on the environment as a whole but more important on people who have put their heart and soul into their jobs to be unexpectedly layed off."
bad,Work was extremely stressful. They didn’t care about their employees. The training was very inadequate .The pay was very low. The work environment was just a very negative place to work
bad,"Constant change is the rule. Layoffs began a year ago and associates are informed by being called to a special teleconference. ""Mandatory"" meetings frequently called with less than 24 hr notice. Workloads are not realistic and field associates frequently work 9-10 hrs daily."
bad,Working there was great at first! But management was horrible! And an very stressful environment! They expect a lot with no room for mistakes or error
bad,"I spent a little over two years at Humana in the same department. I left for many reasons. Management was really kind of a joke.I have never been more micromanaged at any job in my life. It really made the work day miserable. They literally wanted to be notified when you go to the bathroom and notified again when you come back. I understand there are people who don't want to work and need that micromanagement but the people with good intentions who are there to work then suffer because everyone is treated the same. I had applied out for over a year trying to get out of the dept I was in which I came to conclusion after talking with others, was the worst one at Humana. I feel the way they operate, they set the good employees up for failure and the bad ones stay. I saw a lot of people come and go, mostly for the same reasons as myself. The turnover rate is astounding. That should speak volumes to management but they don't seem to care. Management never seemed to have any idea what was going on and would just tell you what you wanted to hear. It was just a very suppressive feeling job and I tried my best to move on to other opportunities within the company but it just wasn't happening fast enough."
bad,The work from home opportunity was nice and the benefit package was solid. The job opportunities to advance your career were not available for the better associates. The management was constantly in flux.   The training is terrible.  The associates on the respective teams were kind.
bad,"Work was all about numbers, they made it seem like they cared about there employees and tried to have company functions but, in the end its ghetto and you'd be lucky if they remembered your name."
bad,The company is in the process of restructuring so job security is not stable. They focus too much on metrics instead of the members. Management is not open to listening to employees concerns.
bad,The area I work on has favorites and I am not one of them. I want to get off the phones and I cannot get that. No rolm for advancement. You have to use your breaks and lunch or Pto to give blood.
bad,"Worked here for 3yrs (2yrs from home),horrible non transparent management, employees have HR as support but coaches/management have far more clout and employee desires are unheard and suppressed; was once in love with company then became disenchanted as second layoff cycle had occurred in my time there and more undelivered promises made to mbrs as an increasing amount of disgruntled mbrs and consumers grew. Overly stressful and competitive as very unrealistic metric expectations demanded."
bad,Expectations are ridiculous. No one seems to know what's going on.  Took this job for flexibility but I have very little to none.  Accepted a job that I loved and myself and my entire team was transferred to another position with no warning or adequate training.
bad,Is not worth talking about. They want to delegate a lot of responsibility that does not match the compensation.  Management need to be trained and take part in team building skills.
bad,"It, is a very dysfunctional environment at TranscendInsight a subsidiary of Humana.  "
bad,"job/work balance is horrible, job expectations are unrealistic to any given work day, a lot of OT to keep to goals, ALL nurses have SAME goals, but cases are completely DIFFERENT everyday"
bad,"This place was the pits. Leadership was a joke, the manager knew less than the new employees. They had metrics that we're unattainable and made you a wreck.  The customers we're horrible and management did nothing to help you out when it came to rude customers.  They would throw you under the bus.. I still have the bus marks on my back and I've been gone over a year."
bad,Associates are micromanaged in every aspect with no regard for individual experience or education level.  Company waged layoffs that cut too many positions and are now piling too much work on those who stayed.  No regard for the welfare of associates.  Ask why the position is available and how often it turns over.
bad,The location had a lot of loose ends. They hired a lot of unprofessional people. Vehicles were being broken into each day. There wasn't enough parking available  for employers. Overall bad experience for me.
bad,"Was told I would be inbound sales.  Actually was outbound sales."
bad,Long hours with no job security or opportunity for advancement. Very poor management style. Employees are treated like children. An abundance of wasteful meetings. Age discrimination.
bad,"Take lots of phone calls, breaks and lunches are not guaranteed, when they ask you if you can work mandatory overtime they do not tell you up front it is 2 hours a day for weeks to months at a time."
bad,"This Location has a host of problems including unprofessional management practices, inexperienced supervision and ineffective training.  Job performance is supposed to allow you more opportunities to venture into different projects.  Unfortunately at this office its not about job performance but favoritism. You can never get any results from operational manager or director.  Endless amount of trainings with no training staff to assist."
bad,"Working from home was nice, but productivity goals were stressful in the last 6 months of the job.  A typical day was outreaching to members on the phone to assist with social service support and referrals to community resources for special needs population; Medicaid / Medicare recipients and documenting contacts and assessments . I enjoyed the job for 3 years, but the last 6 months were enough to kill me; headaches, backaches, hand and feet, exhausted at the end of each day, tired eyes and hands working on computer all day...and barely a break as productivity goals were stretched, as 'work life balance' was out of balance to try to meet goals.  Management changed, and no longer were we supported.  What I learned is that Humana says all the right things, and upper management has wonderful 'cheerleading meetings' to keep staff informed of their lofty goals, but they do not listen to those professionals actually doing the work.  It was expected to ''get on board' and join in the lofty goals, but the increased production goals take no consideration of the day to day stressors.  It's at the expense of the professionals' health who compassionately do the work.  Work life balance and lovely values of 'rethinking routine,  inspiring health, pioneering simplicity, cultivating uniqueness and thriving together' all sound good, but they were not practiced when productivity goals were perceived to be the most crucial of goals.Some in management have no leadership skills, and how they continue to dictate to staff with rude behavior is amazing.  It was a challenging job but when stress from"
bad,The  process of incentivizing employees needs improvement.  Like  providing better career advancement opportunities.  Compensation and benefits are not competitive with the industry standards. Job Work/Life Balance is difficult.
bad,This could be a fit for some people. There is little room adapting to ones strengths. There is little team work because the teams are temporary or are offshore.
bad,"During the 3 years I worked there I saw the prescription load of pharmacist go from 22 an hour to 52 and hour.  At that speed you can't check history, handle DURs, correct data entry errors made by technicians.  In addition, of the prescriptions that are incomplete or unreadable, only 8% of your day's prescriptions can be sent to have the doctor called, leaving pharmacists to guess what the doctor is writing for.  The when the patient receives the wrong drug, they make a major case out of it like you were supposed to stop what you were doing at the time and chase down that one prescriptions."
bad,"Making sure the systems are working is probably the biggest challenge. I learned to be versatile in getting problems solved the best way possible. Management is up and down, because of the constant changes, based upon what is given to them. This leads to customer service woes, per not being able to fully assist the customers. The place has its character clashes, but if one is mentally centralized, he or she can get through the distractions. The hardest part of the job is paying attention, and focusing, per the numerous distractions on the production floor. The most enjoyable part of the job comes with the customer being assisted out of the crisis they are in, especially with the reassurance I am able to give them."
bad,I worked hard but was never rewarded based on my work but rather based on other people's opinions of me.
bad,"Management has the ability to do whatever they want with no consideration of their staff. I was forced to resign from this position due to horrible management styles and racism. "
bad,"This is a very racist company poor Executive leadership and no ""formal' processes they have poor processing systems and is all about ""who you know"" in order  to be successful in your role.  HORRIBLE place to work very very very stressful"
bad,"Humana the corporation itself is a decent company but the Tampa office does not follow what the heart of the corporate theme is. Many people unhappy at this location. Turnover recently has become high. When you interview they will boast about wellness and how they have a mile track that you can walk to distress indoors. Yea, right, you are always watched when you leave your cubicle and questioned about where you were--so you would never get a chance to walk that green mile as they call it."
bad,"If you work in Knoxville,TN there is no orginal Humana management in this office."
bad,"Although it started out as the most enjoyable job I had had in a long time, it quickly became an unfriendly environment. Although our day was not based on commission, we were in competition with each other, for reasons unknown to us. In the beginning, however, I did enjoy every second of the day. I did learn how to navigate through some state offices and through the Medicaid system and policy/guidelines. "
bad,"I was given referrals for members that needed additional help with transportation, paying for meds, etc. Very poor management and no support or direction. A lot of big Egos. Due to lack of direction from management, many employees made up their own rules. I was micromanaged by my mentor/coworker and she wasn't even my supervisor. When I left the position, management was very cold to me. I felt I wasn't valued. Very glad to be gone from that place!"
bad,"Has very high expectations of daily tasks pile up of work for associates to fulfill without compensation of overtime. Major technical and hardware problems lack of needed software to complete assignments, if you work from home you pay for your own internet and sometimes for your own supplies. Informal training and partial explanation of what you're doing and why. Company has a get the work done attitude with little understanding of how or why for what you do. temp staff and let go on your day off via email"
bad,Benefits are pretty good however you lose everything if not there for a yr. So even though you've earned PTO by coming to work and not using the hrs. up...you get Robbed off the money=PTO that you've saved!!! Is that right???
bad,Very enjoyable going to work everyday and watching students light bulbs come on. Teaching adults is very rewarding.
bad,you are not allowed to get up to use the bathroom at will you have to wait until break not allowed to stand at you desk if you do you get written up a 53 yr old man wet his pants because we are not allowed to use the bathroom at will then they talked about him needing to wear depends. the man cried of embarrassment. this place is worst then grammar school
bad,"a nice 9-5 if call centers are your thing, especially if temporary.  there are opportunities to move up, however, that highly depends on the organization of management.  only recommend if you like call center jobs"
bad,Career started out well but the changes made over the last few years have been intolerable. If you’re not liked personally you’ll be overlooked for career development and may not advance. Also be prepared for lay-offs on a regular basis.
bad,"Salaried work week always over 50 hours, included weekends and evening work.  Upper management would assign marketers accounts. More about numbers than quality of care in the Care Management Division"
bad,"100’s of employees were terminated across the board due to work force reduction only to outsource jobs to contractors for lower pay. I was promised by management that I wouldn’t be affected, only to be terminated 4 months later."
bad,"difficult to advance, you were just a number to meet daily metrics, no matter how many extra projects you took on didn't help you advance just added to your work load"
bad,"Don’t get me wrong.  The people, the individual employees, are good people.  The corporate culture, however, and upper management need vast improvement.  Far too many decision are made at the VP level and above that prove their immediate “go to” action to help rescue the “bottom line” from the effect of utterly poor leadership is to simple layoff lower-level, frontline employees.  I was with the company for almost four years, and not a single year went by when we didn’t have massive layoffs.  No one.  Just a seriously poor leadership.  (Make a series of completely ineffective decisions that cost the company money? Make a “bad call”?  No problem.  We can always layoff another chunk of our workforce.)"
bad,Learned a lot about managed care there. The training was not structured enough so lost nurses early after employment. Poor communication from management to staff ab out company changes or issues.
bad,"The nurses that work there are phenomenal. The change over in leadership is almost monthly. They do a great job marketing their company to bring you on board, but once you are there, they make their employees feel like they are just a number and dispensable. It's quite heart breaking."
bad,Great place to grow if you are looking for a career. Great trainers and supervisors . Wah positions available and multiple training opportunities  for learning and possibly moving up within the company
bad,Bad management all around within Humana as it is a very corporate setting that gives you little room to grow without growing important internal relationships..I had 4 bosses in 3 years so a lot of turnover which caused me to ultimately leave the company
bad,"Humana can't seem to stick to one plan for more than three months. They are constantly changing job duties, work flow, software/programs, and management without regard to patients. I will never have anything to do with Humana in any way due to their lack of consistency and vision. The first two years all job duties, work flow, and software/programs were consistent for the most part. Everyone was on the same page. Members (patients) were able to be guided and helped in staying at home and getting proper care in a safe environment. The last two years though has been a shift in the opposite direction. I don't know if there was reorganization or if their strategy was to do a complete 180. There was no reason to learn their new platforms because it was pretty much guaranteed to change three months later. They added more work each time without increased pay. The management would also get upset if I didn't reply back to them within 24 hours regardless of being sick or out with family. They won't respond on weekends but I had to be available 24/7."
bad,They do insurance well I suppose but are lacking with anything related to engineering and IT. The problems are systemic and are from the top down. The lowest level support personnel are great but leadership is severly lacking.
bad,"My manager was excellent, but overall managements are clueless. Humana, as an organization is great, the managers and the people who run it are simply incompetent. They are mindful of employees health and they should, they have an incentive from the federal government."
bad,"A typical day at work was overwhelming.  I did learn more about contracting and about the process for dealing with Medicare Advantage filings with CMS.  I also learned a lot about FQHCs and RHCs."
bad,good place to work. learned a lot there. there is nothing else I want to say about this company not sure what else I could say about things or people at that company but that I worked there
bad,"Heavily recruited into the position. Unfortunately, the company downsized within my first 9 months, within the areas that I was working in."
bad,I have been with Humana for almost 4 years but there are many drawbacks to a LARGE company....you are just a number.  I do not plan to stay with Humana forever.  I like WAH but I feel like I am always under a glass
bad,"10 hour days, all inside work only 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch, other than that it was mandatory you stay at your desk and on the phones.  Nov. thru. Mar. was a busy phone time however the rest of the year would only recieve maybe up to only 6 to 10 calls per day, so made the job very boring.  Wasn't for me."
bad,The Metrics kept going up and so did the programs keep changing.  We were expected to be licensed in multiple states.Pay out of pocket and get reimbursed later.
bad,"it was ok to work to work there not a good place if you have children with health problems that contains a lot of doctors visits, you have to request time off and if you have an emergency you have to find someone to work for you"
bad,I learned a lot at this organization. This organization is really great at development but you have to be a self starter. You have to be comfortable asking for opportunities
bad,"work life on a daily can be managed , if there is no pettiness on the floor. Line staff is looked down upon and being credentialed does not matter there. Most unprofessional management I have ever worked for, no matter how many complaints nothing was done just swiped under the rug."
bad,Humana had hospital systems when I was employed there and was a completely different company than it is now.  Very hard for me to write an objective review of a company that I know nothing about currently
bad,Motivation to succeed is very minimal. Work is very monotonous and tedious. Managers not friendly and not informative. Quick turnaround. Moral was very poor
bad,"Typical day at Humana started with managing the office with ordering collateral materials, making appointments for Senior Management, event planning. "
bad,"When I joined Humana,  it was a great place to work as a nurse and be respected for your skills and experience.  Over the past several years, the work hours in the SER became excessive and you could work 10 to 12 hours per day without extra pay, and then asked to work weekends.   No one cared.   New management in the region are hostile.  They just changed pay to hourly, so they finally care about hours worked, and planning to put us on keystroke counters to micro every minute.  Many will look elsewhere."
bad,Not great. Lots of layoffs. management was not good. It was not a great working environment. People were always worried they were going to lose their job.
bad,I worked in the Chicago market office for Humana.  The work environment was okay.  I was given some opportunities during my time there. Some of the teams aren't positive.
bad,Lots of stress due to constant layoffs. Uncertainty of continued employment. Good experience but management has ruined the program. Great clients and coworkers
bad,"Humana really needs to review their managers.  Poor leadership skills, poor communication skills.  Lack knowledge in some of the work fields to perform the job.  The Team leads are more knowledgeable."
bad,"Very biased, not professional, and quick to retaliate if you do not let things go their way(management.)  no matter how ready you are only the Favorites get the best calls and they pick and choose them according to how you in some cases ""kiss up"""
bad,"Great work/life balance, Pay structure NEEDS to change. How can anyone feed their family on a 1099 pay structure, unless you have leads readily available to flip into sales. They should offer a base pay structure to all of their outside field sales representatives."
bad,"Great atmosphere"
bad,"All virtual learning that was chaotic and disjointed. Never really felt like you know what's going on and the expectations vary from employee to employee. Poor management, poor chances for advancement or transfers. Felt more like a telemarketer than a highly experience RN with over 20 years of experience."
bad,"The job was a good job to work for as far as benefits flex time , but when they took obama care away they took our department within three weeks notice"
bad,Work at home seems amazing when you're used to 12 hours + on the floor.  Just wait!  You'll be tied to a computer and phone at a desk that becomes a prison in your home for 10+ hours a day trying to keep up with the unrealistic expectations and daily changes of the job.
bad,I love worked for humana because it was my first call center job and it open up an lot of doors for me to get other call center jobs \\\\ it taught me how to talk on the phone to customer
bad,"Superficial management. Mgmt dont have real  ""successful""  company running experience."
bad,Liked my job just did not enjoy my supervisor. The work was with the actuarial team. I really was able to work independently and accomplish many feats- but was hindered by a supervisor who micromanaged and was very harsh
bad,"Again, environment at call center and at home can be stressful due to need to speak to at least 10 people daily (metrics).   Was laid off without any notice."
bad,"Humana is a workplace where the workload almost doubled in the three years I was employed, prior to a RIF.  I enjoyed interacting with and building positive relationships with my 400+ members, and they enjoyed hearing from me via telephone, a minimum of once every two months."
bad,Very stressful work environment.  Micromanagement is the only way at Humana.  No room for advancement.  Management is very punitive if employees don't agree with their views.
bad,The buckeye location is sketchy to say the least. The place could use more bathrooms and that has been brought to the attention of management several times. It is all about who likes you whether or not you get ahead. no amount of hard work pays off.
bad,Micro management by upper management. No room for advancement. Salary range never given when asked for. Men got paid more than women for the very same position
bad,The home health division is not good. They work very short staffed long hours.  They are losing accounts left and right. They are unable to keep a director.
bad,I wish they would be more honest about what the PHC role really is during the interviewing process as I believe it would save a lot of time and energy for those looking to really make a difference.
bad,"Updating and processing claims and authorizations for inpatient, outpatient, and Durible Medical Equipment. Making out bound calls to hospitals to request medical documentation needed for claims review, take inbound queue calls to update and explain claims and or determinations made by clinicians."
bad,"Nice people to work with, a paid day to do volunteer work that you sign up for during the year. Typical call-center work, but more rigid than other call-centers. As for job security, there is none. Even the long term employees were always on edge about getting fired if they didn't meet the perfect quality assurance score every month. Twelve hour days are the norm for a few months of the year. Mandatory overtime was enforced whenever they thought it might be needed."
bad,"inbound call center, took 100 calls a day from members with questions about their plans, provide information all day, answer a lot of questions, fairly simple."
bad,many people leave because top talented is ignored and treated poorly . the good departments never have people leave. The bad departments have people rotate among them. good people who dont but kiss get frustrated and leave. people who dont get help its because mangers treat people poorly and give them no encouragement to do a job right or well.  People who do care soon have their spirit squashed.
bad,"I thought going to Humana would provide me with growth within one company, I was wrong. It is extremely hard to move up in  the company. I worked in H10-36"
bad,"Career advancement is not there unless you are a part of the in crowd politics, and if possible don't start off with lower level positions, because management is not good."
bad,"Great place to work, but the management is terrible.  If you feel sick or have a question you are left for dead.  They don't have no help walking the floors like they should, they are always talking to their friends rather than being a supervisor."
bad,Its a good working environment but the things we deal with doesnt match the pay at all. Its good that I worked with others to think critically and its a good experience
bad,"It was fine, but a temporary position. Very high volume call center during peak seasons/hours. Training was often inadequate and trainees were thrown into the metaphorical fire quickly."
bad,"I come in half an hour early before start of date to get prepared for a full productive busy quality day making a list of my expectations which always exceeds companies and go through all the soft skills and things to keep in mind when speaking with the customer as per company protocol, keeping in mind of company variation time between each call, quality over quantity, making sure to take my 2 15 and 1 half an hour lunch mandatory and not going over and keeping it professional at all times with customers, management and peers and dress code."
bad,Overall job was okay. It just extra things leaders wanted you to say or do over the phones it felt very controlling. I felt somethings were unnecessary. Some of supervisors across the board of depts just took the job with lack there of leader ship and people skills. It just gave a lot them excuses to dress up for work every day and put on heels.
bad,"their training is poor they have you study at your own pace but are pushing and ramming you thru to a bunch of classes and youre overwhelmed by the time  you get to the phone"
bad,"Administrative atmosphere of distrust of nurses, Untrained staff listening to nurse and member calls with constant scrutiny and reprimand, Unmanageable productivity expectation with focus on quantity not quality causing extreme stress. Unclear company policies/processes set employees up for failure, Poor Coach/Managers training and knowledge. Inconsistent management expectations and requirements causing constant confusion. Outdated equipment, computer programs causing constant connectivity issues and outages but no adjustment made for staffs productivity being effected. etc. etc. etc."
bad,there pay was phenomenal i was making 16 an hour plus commissions and the standard pay was 15. there was a lot of overtime opportunities that were great and training was paid and was almost 2 1/2 months. now the reality when you start working you micromanaged like crazy. those who are full time and there already are set up with the best tier-ing aka better leads and phone calls. you must fight your way to getting better calls. i did all this worked 65+ hours a week and they extended my contract week later took it back and then let me go. pay is awesome if i wasn't lied to about doing really good and having a good chance at the position i wouldn't have cared. plus its hard to get a hold of people in the company after they let you go which is unsettling because i have commission checks on the way.
bad,"The job was a little stressful, it was a lot work with little pay.It could be fun at times. I've learned about the Medicare part d."
bad,"There is a lot of  harassment that takes place there where women is being treated as meat and they are ask to sleep with management in order for you to be promoted. This may not be all management but there is a lot that does this....Humana Corporate and HR is aware and does nothing when you file a complaint nothing is done...And it is suppose to be private to disclose but is done publicly to the point you are no longer comfortable working there because they start to harass you more,"
bad,I was located in the De Pere office working on the dental side. The training was a few weeks which was good. The trainer was awesome. This was and enjoyable position and sad that I left.
bad,can't wait until new company takes over...FLL are never available and training is the worst...changes in staff and FER process are not ever the same..stress is a everyday problem
bad,Good Company with great pay. Not very employee oriented. Has let go lots of good employees due to changing business needs.
bad,"I have never worked for a company so full of two faced people.  Many employees here will be nice to your face, and stab you in the back in half a second if they feel like it will advance their career."
bad,It had a good steady work flow and healthy competition. They over worked us and didn't really have good work/ life balance
bad,great place to work. call center requires a lot of overtime. So just keep that in mind. team lead was great helped me out a lot.
bad,"This is a high school environment where your every minute has to be accounted for, with cliques, bullies, and managers who are not trained professionals.  If this is where you are in life and can stand it, it is a reliable position."
bad,Cool people to work with not actually able for advancement good place to work if you desperately need a job
bad,i enjoyed working for he company overall. a Great experience with helping others
bad,"Terrible Management"
bad,"Humana is not the Job for the serious student, they do not work with full time students as far as scheduling. While the benefits are great the turnover rate is very high."
bad,My time with this company was built on building good relations more so than increasing knowledge of the various departments and systems which could've offered room for advancement (I was younger and not as responsible.)
bad,"Its a job. I am grateful for the employment but I would like to further my career within the company that sees me for more than just numbers, which is impossible to do. No opportunity for bonus because the requirements are almost impossible to reach. The customer views on the company can cause your bonus."
bad,typical day was 10-12 hrs learned to appreciate helping customers especially the elderly very enjoyable. management very difficult to work for due to stiff metrics. coworkers were great very informative and a good team players. hardest part of job not being able to satisfy and assist customers like would have liked. due to restrictions from employer. most enjoyable is speaking and having a good working relationship with customers.
bad,"I loved my job in packing clients medication, verifying and packing it. I also enjoyed my co-workers, that I could depend on when in need, as they could also depend on me as well. The hardest part of my job was management, they should of had some kind of training on management skills.I have never work for a company where management treated their employees like kids, yelling was the way of comunication, thats sad, especially when you have alot of hard dedicated employees."
bad,Requirement of 60 -90 call intake per day. Bathroom and break times were timed and recorded. All calls were monitored for quality and tone of voice. Documentation and accuracy were recorded as well. I learned the end of Pharmacy that most people don't have an opportunity to see. Management was caring and took the time to advise and teach. Reaching out to patients and solving their medication needs gave me great satisfaction with this postion.
bad,"Like most organizations, the weakness here is management. They have a very poor organizational development vision. They have a good vision, but they do not hold everyone to this vision."
bad,Layoff's every year. Excellent people let go. Bonuses instead of raises and fair pay. Each region is like a different company...some are horrible some are okay. There should be more corporate oversight of what goes on in the regions as the Humana name gets the bad rap. Unreasonable metrics and lack of appreciation for Nurse's contribution to the health of their member's and success of the organization.
bad,"I really have nothing to say good or bad. People were nice, the turn over wasn’t so good. Training couldn’t be worse. Not really sure job security is something to think about. I actually left for a different position in my home state."
bad,I was expected to be on call 24/7 and was running myself into the ground. They did hire a part time associate to help me but she wouldn't take call. It became too much.
bad,very busy during the AEP and then too much busy work the rest of the year. Sometimes flood the market with agents and change and or cancel plans without sufficient time to collect information on those plans. Upper management is very short sighted.
bad,"My manager's first words to me were: ""I do not know why they made me a manager, I did not want this position. This is not going to go well."" He was my lead point of communication for teaching, mentor ship, and leadership for my internship. It was an awful experience. I left the actuarial world shortly after the internship. The others I was surrounded by were not welcoming and only wanted to study. I was chastised for missing a flight and wanting to take a long trip over a weekend off. There was no work-life balance."
bad,"Overall a good place to build your foundation towards healthcare career, however, very long and slow process to grow within the company even with proper education level/sj and certifications."
bad,Even though they preached life/ work balance the push was to work long & hard. Company kept increasing productive requirements without much support. I was all about the numbers instead of patient care.
bad,"This job requires you to do a lot of work with low pay. Highly recommend this job for a high school student its a great resume builder. You'll learn a lot about different health insurances, but the pay can be a little better."
bad,"it was long days dealing with angry people calling, rude co workers , and getting paid less then my male counter parts . rules changed to often "
bad,"This place is the prime example of ""People dont leave jobs, they leave leadership"" Leadership in some areas, and I dont mean immediate supervisors but those above, seem to live for finding a mistake just so they can get rid of you. There is no trust, no teamwork, and no guidance except when you do something wrong."
bad,Humana started off being a great company with great emphasis on employee moral; however the culture has changed over the years where numbers are more important than staff or members. I was very disappointed in the way employees were lied to and treated while going through a major workforce reduction that employees were told was not happening. Humana has great values but some of the managers and directors fail to execute or live by those values when it comes to staff and members.
bad,"Ok, they could have better benefits/pay, hire off the street instead of through temp agency, obtain a Director for this office. hire on quicker with benefits"
bad,"Very hard to achieve any compensation through advancement. The company will provide advancement opportunities, but does not provide equivalent compensation."
bad,"Work from home, meet  metrics, micromanaged,  calls screened, dinged if work day does not end on time,  little flexibility in work schedule. Driving 60 miles each  way daily for training was not easy in the winter weather"
bad,"I worked long, tiring hours for humana during their peak season. Plenty of times where myself and others were overworked and no help came about. I wouldn't recommend the team that I was on because I felt overworked and underpaid."
bad,"I've only made it through half the training currently.  We were suddenly pulled to the floor on calls doing things that we were not trained in. On top of that there is mandatory overtime and mandatory weekends."
bad,management plays favorites and their is to much office politics. Error system they let other people slide and offer to move them to different locations versus firing others. I know a girl who was drug tested three times in one month.
bad,"would not return to the company"
bad,"micro management while attempting to merge with aetna, then lay offs when not"
bad,"The employment with Humana began great! The position was fun, quick paced and we were able to serve a lot of people. After the failed merge with Aetna, the entire culture changed. Our positions were overhauled, the demands became impossible and lay offs came in waves, despite Humana ending the year extremely well financially with the high level employees earning millions in bonuses."
bad,"Was a great job initially, until new senior management took over the department I was working for, with aim of shutting down the program.  Towards the end of my tenure with Humana, layoffs were a constant threat hanging over employees and no support from direct management.   When I started with Humana, there was a lot of respect and support for the nurses, and towards the end was the complete opposite."
bad,"My experience at Humana was not very positive. I was able to work from home as a Personal Health Coach which was nice. To be fair I probably was not well suited to being on the phone most of the day. Verbal abuse from members was common. Humana at Home hired a lot of new associates in early 2016, but massive layoffs started in February of 2017. Management was poor. Members would receive call after call after call before being dropped from call list."
bad,The company did not allow the NP to practice to the full scope of licensure which resulted in the NP practicing as a RN. Felt the company did not listen to the NPs concerns and or address concerns that were presented.
bad,"Each day Stressful and Unfulfilled. No work life balance. Micromanaged. No time off for childcare or emergencies. Attendance policy does not allow for time off or work life balance. Employees are told everything is per ""business need"" and each week department emails go out with wording of cut backs, metrics scares and reminders that employees are not valued."
bad,"It was challenging to take on new projects as a new agency within the company and succeed, show results in terms of member engagement. I enjoyed working with the clients and receiving their positive feedback."
bad,"I travelled around DFW to retrieve medical records.  The job itself was not bad, but the people in charge are the worst. The managers here are terrible. They lack communication skills and like to watch you like you're a child. There is no room for advancement here either. Every year I was there, they kept going down on the mileage reimbursement rate. Humana is not picture perfect like most people think. They're not interested innnovative ideas and suggestions, all they care about is numbers. The pay was the best thing about the job."
bad,Everything is focused on metrics. There is no time to take training classes during the work day. There are no company get togethers. You only get the major holidays off.
bad,"The company lied and said no more layoffs multiple times and yet there were layoffs about every three months, since Feb. 2017. I was in the last group to be told the department is closing.  We were "
bad,"The job itself was very doable however the management was horrible and stressful, not to mention the constant lay offs may it hard to concentrate on job performance. If you are an employee who ask questions you will not do well in this environment."
bad,"Most recent year within Humana has been one of immense transition and reduction in force. During these times, leadership has failed to provide employees with information on the process and future leading to poor culture and work environment."
bad,I was micromanaged with a master's degree.  If I did not move my mouse for longer than 5 minutes the manager was notified.  I felt like I was glued to my seat.  The managers listen in on your phone calls randomly
bad,"Poor management using fear and intimidation.   Unreasonable expectations with limited training and information.   Confrontational management.   Other departments may be different, but this was the situation in my particular role."
bad,On phones 8 hours plus per day. Give you only 60 minutes per month to be off phones for restroom breaks. Training was not the best. Every day you are micro managed.
bad,"I worked at Humana YHA in Deerfield Beach, Fl, it's a small company that Humana purchased a couple years ago. YHA is very unprofessional, the managers are horrible and unstable, it's as if no one knows what they are doing. They treat their employees like they're disposable and they have absolutely no respect for people."
bad,Very High Paced- Lack of direction at the management level- Clear expectations not provided to staff- expected to work consistently over 50 hrs /week. Manager was not consistent in how she managed the staff on the team- things were not communicated well- favoritism was obvious.
bad,"I worked at Humana over nine years and it was a great place to be when I started there, but in the past few years the care managers are having more and more work piled on them. Stress is high and morale is low. Being salaried you are expected to meet metrics even if you are putting in ten or eleven hours every day and I know a lot of nurses who are doing exactly that."
bad,"not the best place for family person they work you overtime and there is no work life balance, Management is the worse ever and no on listens to your valid concerns."
bad,"The hours of the annual enrollment period cause the company to make you work insane hours. Show up at 8am and leave 11pm, do it all over the next day. If you are someone who likes to work under high pressure situations sign on up but to me even the full time employees are under a panic for their jobs every year and if you are an LTE you can forget about, the perks are in the benefits and LTE's don't get those."
bad,"Humana does not compensate employees for their talent and there is little room for growth except for favorites. In addition, their health insurance is poor to say the least. If you go to the doctor or have a medical procedure count on paying most of it out of pocket despite the high premiums you pay each month."
bad,"The RN work at home job is amazing in the beginning. Orientation and training is very comprehensive and you begin working from home feeling like you've just won the lottery. The pay is great. The workload is manageable and there is a lot of flexibility. Management is very supportive and caring and the teamwork is phenomenal considering everyone works from home."
bad,The job takes a toll on you as a human.  Working with the customers is amazing but the stress becomes overwhelming. They want a robot not a human being
bad,Lack of team work.  Poor direction from managers.  Great training program.  Great benefits.  Great yearly bonus.  No open door policy with managers.
bad,The name of the FMO was E-telequote.They pay very well. There training was repetitive and they do not train regarding computer platform.  I was thrown on the floor the first day of AEP and never given any training on accessing and enrolling the 20 various companies we serviced.  They never gave me feedback and then after AEP let me go without consideration of a learning curve and my considerable progress.  They don't value employees.  They treat agents very poorly and no opportunity to correct issues because of complete lack of feedback.
bad,"I am a RN managing chronically ill member telephonically.  I am expected to work eight to ten hours a day.  Their computer software is marginally reliable at best.  On a typical day I will talk with seven to ten members and review their medications, check for upcoming appointments, ad provide whatever support or assistance is available and needed.  Currently manage a roster of 180-200 members."
bad,"Working  as Member Services Representative, was kind of stressful . Do to high volume of calls, they received, and dealing with many complaints from members. "
bad,Changed the job description on me after 2 weeks of being there. Boss was never in the office so never really had leadership/communication on expectations. Not a good environment to work in. People are not friendly in the office and out for their own benefit. Do not work well as a team but rather use you for things they don't want to do. Do not recommend.
bad,"Nice place to work, learn to explain all retire customers to use the  Medicare and assign the primary doctor how they can order the medicine and if need reference to an specialist, coworkers very friendly, good managers and they help us to understood all information with the insurance."
bad,"The company has grown so much in the last ten years that the talent pool hasn't been able to keep up.  The result is many areas that are poorly managed.  Too many areas promote from within, often beyond an individual's capabilities.  Or leaders are brought from outside the company, but they are not provided adequate on-boarding or cultural immersion. Mid-level associates are the ones who suffer as the result.  Having department leadership without basic business acumen is not uncommon, especially outside of corporate functions."
bad,"Management in the Glen Allen, VA office is terrible.  This is the worst job that I have ever endured. Management does not provide any support when you need it. They will hang you out to dry!!! A lot of favoritism and cliques in this office, particular Utilization Review Dept."
bad,It was an friendly environment where everybody would do their best to help others. The thing i mosted enjoyed was being able to help others with my service
bad,Humana SHOULD be the best company to work for in the insurance industry.
bad,Company needs to acknowledge employees who have been trained by the company and show potential to advance.
bad,This is a boring position. Management does not communicate with nursing.
bad,"FINALLY, after 1 years I was able to move out of the department that I was originally hired into. Supervisors play favorites, the people they hire are TOO much (verbally aggressive/abusive), whenever you advise new hires as a SME they CONSTANTLY give you attitude and the supervisors use it against you when there is an opportunity for advancement."
bad,Humana- Doesn't provide formal training and most leaders are swamped with so much work they don't have time to train.  Be prepared to be self starter and know everything before you begin.  You will be accountable for what you don't know.  They pay well but lay off every year.  so if you are not part of the in crowd or are fairly new you could be caught in the restriction and laid off.
bad,"Management are very flexible and understanding, however there was no set structure , there were rules but never applied.  Employees cam and went without consequences.  The supervisors are way underpaid.  No respect whatsoever.  Howe ever I learned a great deal working with Humana, awesome job, difficult but the pay does not reflect everything is asked of the employees, trainers, supervisors and management."
bad,"Pay is really well but job is too stressful... micromanagement, mandatory overtime, supervisor plays favoritism, attendance policy is not maintainable"
bad,"My position was changed in a short period of time to an entirely different job responsibilities and role within  a short period of time. "
bad,"More about hiring ""friends and diversity"" then whos actully best qualified. Mandatory OT and poor upper management. Which mine where in another state completely. Id apply for other jobs first before humana."
bad,"Management is suspect. They will tell you one thing and do another. They create unbelievable pressure on employees. Like a very stressful job......but no alternatives to relieve pressure. It seems like 2 yrs. is the mark most employees make it (I lasted a little over 2 yrs.)."
bad,"Look elsewhere, micromanaging at its best...constantly bombarded with too many patients and when you tell them you can’t do all of them, they get upset and “insist” you document you saw patients regardless of if you did visit or not, worked through Giving Tree Senior Options, Bay St. Louis, MS"
bad,"The team I worked under was wonderful. However, once the layoffs began years ago and everyone from mid-level executives down had to reapply for their jobs nothing was ever the same.  The new leadership became the ""good ole boy"" system.  If they didn't like you, you were out."
bad,"Very competitive and micromanaged. I would not recommend working here. They downsize and have hundreds of lay offs every couple years. Once you start reaching your metrics, they change the metrics so it seems like you are always chasing an unattainable goal."
bad,"Numbers over Quality. A lot of Talk about Work Life balance and self-care and commitment to excellence but very poor ACTUAL practice of these. Stressful. Multi-tasking. Hyper-monitored and measured. Emphasis of marketing/sales instead of helping, guiding or caring for persons served. Colleagues all very smart, supportive, creative but too often they left the job or their ideas were discounted. Great for people who need a decent paycheck and benefits and who enjoy being two or three persons at a time."
bad,"applied for full time and they gave me temporary status. training was really good, but the management plays favorites and the sales goals are unrealistic."
bad,"Micro-managed, mandated overtime for salaried personal, have to beg to take vacation days ( have even lost vacation time due to supervisor not allowing time off ) , no respect from supervisor for employee or their family life,  treated like a child instead of a professional. Humana is a good company to work for, however front line leaders and supervisors are not trained how to treat their employees.  I retired from company and did not even get a card from my supervisor."
bad,Little to no support provided.  Management talked over employees when expressing concerns or asking questions during team meetings. Training was subpar.
bad,"I was in call center, so our breaks and lunches were decided for us. They give good vacation and sick time and the benefits are great.  It is very laid back for the most part."
bad,"First off, Humana offers its employees zero when it comes to work/life balance; it's all about the needs of the company with no consideration given to its employees. While they provide PTO, there are times where you absolutely cannot use them; if you have an emergency and take the time off, Humana has an occurrence system in place that will punish the employee to the point of termination or voluntary separation. The starting wage is competitive, but not when compared to the workload they place on the employee--in fact, when health benefits are factored in, the starting pay pales compared to what the employee receives. For an insurance company, the health benefits are EXTREMELY thin and expensive. Ever have insurance that was too expensive to use (i.e. co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles)? Well, these are those health benefits."
bad,Required to be in autodialer at certain time and out at certain time. Minimum hours in dialer monitored. Time spent on call received monitored and documenting time monitored.  Culture was stressful and unhealthy even though working from home.  I learned valuable care management techniques.
bad,I was treated well by my supervisor. Overall the company work atmosphere is a train wreck and very unorganized.  The systems never worked consistently and every hour of every day was very stressful due to poor computer systems always crashing.
bad,"Management,  gossips, play around, etc. Nothing is confidential, the open door policy is a joke. People will know your business before you get to your desk. They pay increases are an insult.  If you just need a Job please don't feel that this will be your career. I worked there for three yrs starting at $14.00 and left at $14.71, you do the math.."
bad,"be ready to be in production. Focus on being on the computer and the percent one is on the computer working. DPA - has to be over 85%. Breaks and lunches are the only times you can be away from your desk, it's tight."
bad,They've taken to automating and outsourcing a majority of the positions.  Consumers end up talking to Jamaica or Indonesia.  Not the way to keep U.S. folks employed and keep a healthy USA.
bad,Having to search through several screens and constantly being rated all the time was very stressful. My Supervisor did not make it easy for me to work at home even though she knew that was my goal since I lived so far from the job.
bad,Fast paced with daily opportunities to learn. Management is supportive and facilities training and learning opportunities.  The most enjoyable part of the job is helping members move toward healthier living.
bad,"No work/life balance in my last dept.  Mandatory OT every single week and calendar black out, so no ability to use PTO when needed for appointments and family needs.  "
bad,Changed to a desk with 2/15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunch. Had to meet metrics with rarely adjusted metrics due to meetings and so forth.  Division and Department was eliminated
bad,"You can not move from your desk, except for the assigne times for break and lunch. Micro management at it's fulllest. I would not recomend working in the welcome center unless you love talking on the phone to strangers."
bad,"Not a very good work/life balance. Management was poor and didn't communicate very effectively, not much room for advancement. Benefits were very good though"
bad,"For most of my time with Humana it was a good place to work. I then changed departments and had a totally different and awful experience. I was a senior case manager and I am good in that role but the person who hired me was fired 2 weeks later and the supervisor set out to get rid of me. I have since read reviews from other ex Humana employees that once they want to get rid of someone they are brutal and I found that to be true. Humana also is continuously making changes to the work flow. They call their members and send a lot of mail. Many members I spoke to said it was too much mail and too many calls. The nurses voiced these issues to management but they were deaf to it. Consequently, many members just stopped answering their phones so much of the day was spent leaving voicemails. You were still expected to actually speak to 10 or more members per day, no matter how many calls it took to get 10 people to answer their phones. It was expected that you must work overtime (without pay) to meet that metric."
bad,"Worked long hours (50+ per week), obtained multiple advanced degrees, was promoted, but could not obtain the pay i deserved.  Took leaving the company to be paid appropriately, and once i did i found that the work/life balance at other companies is so much better.  They don't promote internally either, lots of roles were filled by unqualified, outside employees who came in requiring a learning curve.  "
bad,"I have been laid off 2 times with Humana. I feel this company is good to work for, but you never know when they are going to lay off people.  I have been through about 5 or 6 lay offs."
bad,My experience was less than pleasant at Humana.  I was not provided the benefits that I was promised in a timely manner.  I was frustrated with their handling of the situation and their seemingly lack of concern.
bad,"New management came in and ruined a good thing. The workloads increased unnecessarily which brought morale way down. It's a shame because, at one point, it was the best company I ever worked for."
bad,"A company that touted very noble slogans and intentions but the reality of course was the $$$/profit--above all else. Do more with less. Do more with tools (software) that (frequently) did not work. Once was a job that was more Client focused and real therapeutic work occurred, but quickly dissolved into meeting Metrics and bending statistics to make 'work' look effective and successful. Great job for 1-2 years to gain new experiences/processes and connect with some very dedicated colleagues. Benefits/Pay were fair to good but also declined as time went on."
bad,No bonuses and poor compensation and benefits. The trade off is a solid work/life balance and vigorous efforts to improve employee health and wellness.
bad,Lo malo era la desorganización y trabajar todo el dia .
bad,"Well structured, however the expectations that they put into you are unrealistic. Unless your a favorite, you will be stuck in  the same promised to move quick. Position that you`re stuck in."
bad,"I worked there for a year and during that time, it was ok place to work for like about 3 months. My lead was a  weirdo and always watched ever thing I done. I always had good quality and assurance scores. I didn't have an attendance issue, but yet they stayed on me, always worried about things not pertaining to the job. Make sure you watch out for the management in mail order pharmacy, alot of cliques. If you keep to yourself and you look nice, just watch out, because they can care less about your job performance at that point. I wish I would have gone to human resources to report the management in that department because they are not right in how they treat there employees, instead I just left. I think the company is ok to work for, just need to do a sweeping in that department, as far as management goes, because theyou are loosing alot of good workers because of this!!!"
bad,I have work for Humana for three years I had many jobs and some training on some of the files that I had to work on. I was on a team that believe in different activities to keep everyone involve. I have learned over time how important it is to build relationship with management team and lead. The hardest part of the job is you will work on different account every so often. There was a lot of changes with how the state want us to work the files and how Humana want us to work the file. Many days we had to rework the files.
bad,"Loved my team, however management was horrible, the morals of the company are not true. They do not follow the protocol and don't care about their associates. No opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Management in certain FL markets, only cares about themselves and their development opportunities within the company; not their subordinates.  Very controlling!!!"
bad,"Obtains client information by answering telephone calls; interviewing clients; verifying information"
bad,"Humana-LifeSync had a lot of criteria for Annual Performance Reviews that were not practical at the level in the company in which we worked. For example, you were focused on helping people in Humana Healthcare Advantage plan improve/enhance their lives in a outbound, 12-week program. To get cases assigned to you, another Department- Customer Service, would get ""Activations"" that were supposed to be based on Humana customers confirming they had medical deficiencies and would be glad for a Clinical Manager to contact them about improving their health. However, due to pressures to get certain quota of ""Activations"" we would get clients who told CS Rep, ""I don't want anybody calling me!"" and the CSR would Activate the client anyway. If you attempted to contact client three times, or if you contacted member and they said they did not want to participate, then those ""unsuccessful completions in the LifeSync"" program actually counted against you in your Annual Performance Review. Then, during the Annual Performance Review process, the whole group of managers would have large meeting, would review each person in our department- about 75 people, and it would mostly be about who could persuade everyone else that people on their team deserved a raise versus someone else's team members, and only abt 3-4 people out of the 75 of us would get merit increases, the rest would be told ""Well, do better, produce more, and maybe you'll get a raise next year."""
bad,"I was very pleased with the corporate office that ran Humana, however, there was an unorganized management system at the local level. When I started, Medicare had still not fully moved to a risk adjusted payment system for their Medicare Advantage plans. The team that was creating the MRA system at Humana was very supportive of their MRA staff and allowed us to make up the rules as we went along, because there really weren't any besides the Medicare guidelines. However after a few years, my new manager had no managed care experience and did not understand medical billing or coding, which made our jobs as medical coding auditors very difficult. I was a respected medical coding auditor by the Chicago IPAs I worked with and was soon recruited by Wellcare."
bad,An overall learning experience that expanded my portfolio to include team management and company-wide consultation around brand strategies.
bad,I learned how to deal with people and how to effectively communicate problems and issues that they may not understand.  Also I learned how to manage my time and effectively perform at a high rate of speed with accuracy.
bad,my review basically is coming to work signing on and taking calls daily from members providers ect i did learn a lot of great things out there
bad,"We were told we didn't have to work weekends but of course we were also told that working weekends would be better for us."
bad,"Managers tend to be micro-managed and then scapegoated when things go wrong. Incompetent upper managers are protected. The informal cadre are more powerful than the  formal cadre - and you'll never be one of them. Too many managers on the clinical side (where I worked) were so immersed in line work that they could not foster or manage teams. "
bad,Received a large amount of calls from members in regards to several matters concerning claims or benefits. Good management and great co-workers who were always willing to help. This job provided me with a good platform into the healthcare and insurance industry.
bad,"Typical day was straight to the point and routine. Clock in, pull all my systems up on the computer that would be needed for the remainder of the day, make sure head phones were working and touch the ok button and start my shift. The job was consistently changing systems which we would have to learn within a days time. But I was able to help the elderly with their issues that they were having when calling"
bad,Did not really care for this job it was a temporary placement
bad,There is no structure and set work atmosphere. I can't plan a day because it is always known to change. A project can come up at noon and be due by end of that same business day. There are always constant interruptions.
bad,Worked in IT in different roles for about 13 years. Project management and implementation work.
bad,"The computer system is antiquated and slow and at least 75% of the time interferes with one performing one's job efficiently. They stress quality, but what they fail to realize is quality takes T-I -M-E and they aren't willing to give the employee adequate time to do their jobs with each individual member.(If one of your members needs extra time and you do the ""right thing"" by them and spend the extra time they need, and get behind and don't reach your quota- watch out! ) The real focus of Humana is numbers/metrics based(made up by management who is clueless on what it takes to do this job correctly). on how many ""successful "" calls one makes (of which the metrics are totally unrealistic for the quality they say they expect). The metrics are not based on your work ethic or by how well you care for your members and teach them, but on whether the person picks up the phone and talks with you or not. So if you make 30+ calls in a day and only 5 people picked up the phone and spoke with you, you failed for the day. You could have put in 10 hours for an 8 hour day (which you are not paid for since it's salary- since you're often forced to work extra so when you figure it out you only made $10 an hour), not gotten any breaks or lunch, put up with at least 1 - 2 hours and some days 8 hours of computer issues that put one further behind, and after all that get reprimanded because you didn't meet your ""quota"". (They forget these people that we're calling are retired and aren't going to wait by the phone for you- they're out living and enjoying their lives).You have no one to cover for"
bad,I worked for this company from 2007 to 2010 starting in HCPR to RightsourceRx and lastly Humana Commercial business. The pay was great; tutition reimbursement was great; but high deductible benefits were horrible to be an employee of an insurance company. No advancement regardless of your performance; but lateral moves were plentiful.
bad,"Humana is not an employee supportive environment.  As everyone is aware Humana is in the process of  laying off many employees but they are still in the process of hiring, sort of a double standard,"
bad,"This job was good at first and then once I started to have trouble with my vison in my left eye due to glaucoma and other things then I became harder to work for this company. With the glaucoma I had a hard time doing my job considering I loss a lot of vision in my left eye. I kept on bumping into people at almost station and was worried about my performance due to what had happened. The management there tried there best to accommodate me, but due to how much vision I lost it was a moot point. The hardest part of the job was trying to work around people because of my vision impairment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
bad,"There was little communication or direction from management. Many changes that took place happened well before case managers were notified and the expectations to institute those changes were unreasonable given the amount of notification that was provided to case managers. In addition, I saw mass layoffs in the 2 years I was employed there."
bad,I contracted on a temp to hire basis and after 18 months they decided to outsource the position to the Philippines.  I was really let down and so were all the other helpdesk contractors that they let go.
bad,"I really enjoyed working from home for Humana. However, once the lay off's happened, I was very disappointed and it seemed to good too good to be true."
bad,"They treat you like family and it seems like the best place to work and then they fire you. I am sure that this is not every case but I know a few people that got laid off. I remember eating lunch in the cafeteria and overhearing a conversation stating that they are laying off a whole floor of employees. Some of which have been there for 32 years. "
bad,I was hired on with the Variable Staffing Pool and it was very inhumane the way that the people were treated. It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I was asked to be let go once they started releasing people from the position. Then was listed as not being eligible for rehire because I missed the last day of employment due to my daughter being hospitalized.
bad,"Must be productive at all times, be on time, must be able to set daily goals, the company has its ups and downs just don’t apply with keystaff Humana itself it’s wonderfuk but keystaff is a joke"
bad,Case load was too heavy on most days. There was no collberation with workers and when suggests were given during a brainstorm meeting you would be told that it would be discussed one on one after the meeting or at a later time.
bad,"Job offers great benefits, vacation and retirement. But it lacks professionalism. People making decisions have no business being in management. Managers lack experience and demonstrate no trust for the people working for them."
bad,The job started off relaxed. We were for the members. But gradually the place became driven on meeting numbers. Many layoffs occurred while I worked here and my position was then eliminated. Not a secure place to work for.
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at Humana, but others I worked with Loved it.Its a Job and I will not complain about having a job. Some people are not so blessed."
bad,It is a great start up job right out of high school and also a great part time job while in school.  You can also make up your time when you have to be in later.
bad,"I left Humana 6 months ago and have no regrets. They have a lot to learn about how to treat their employees and they micromanage to the max!! I never felt so unproductive in all my career. Most of the day is spent confined to a locked room in your house calling members  who are not interested in coaching, do not answer the phone or if they do snswer, pick up and hang up. Medical Clinicians are forced to manage BH members , even those with severe acute or chronic disease. Upper management do not care about anything except for productivity. After I gave my resignation notice, my director did not contact me to wish me well and my supervisor was not allowed to inform the team I was leaving. Team members began contacting me after receiving my assignments. I was excited about work at home for awhile but then I felt imprisioned. I knew it was time to leave when I dreaded going upstairs in my home to work."
bad,"Production based day to day, have to get the numbers.  Learned more about insurance process.  Management poor and typical, more for less.  Confusing cases at times with little assistance from team leaders and higher leadership.  Production based with multiple times a month meeting with repetitive goal discussion, quality and production assessments and monthly job shadows.  Not a good place to work, feel as if you are always at a low standard and you will get a slap on the hand."
bad,"Cut throat environment, from co-workers to supervisors, always watching your back, never know who holds knife. Act like a friend to face and bad mouth the heck out of you when you are not there. Very, very disappointing. I liked my job, just not the environment."
bad,"overall management could use major improvement. ive been with the company now for 3 years with the potential to move up but with no support from current management, this is totally impossible. im more than qualified"
bad,"The company has a great potential, but corporate management, is challenging, and there is not much of a work/life balance."
bad,Decent work environment. Decent pay. Job culture could be better. I worked under racially biased management that did not support advancement.
bad,dont feel like i have a chance to get a job and i felt like iwas judged the whole time i was there and didnt feel like it ws for me
bad,This job was a great learning experience for me in how far I am willing to go and to be pushed. In the end I realized that I am not a door mat for others to talk to as they see fit.
bad,* a typical day at work work be to come into and answer calls for 8 hours a day.
bad,"You must be a life long learner.  Lots of favoritism.  If you get a fair supervisor your doing good.  You must love helping people as you will be rewarded for your professionalism and patience.  Micromanaged.  If you are not liked, welcome to OUTBOUND."
bad,"Job was pretty boring, and highly micromanaged, but not too stressful. Cafeteria and downtown area surrounding the building was pretty great. Job security very low, and promotion a pipe dream."
bad,"Great job, but the patients often got confused on why they needed me! They confused me with the Home health Nurse and stated they did not see a need for a Health care manager."
bad,into a Telephonic position and even that I thought was going ok.  They did not give enough training for the new position and they are always changes things which I do not mind at all but for some reason the changes never went smoothly always putting the cart before the horse.
bad,"like everywhere - multiple changes in leadership, alignment, day to day programs, etc. lots of work at home opportunity.  well aligned culture, various perspectives on healthcare"
bad,"The upper management cared but everyone else seemed to just go through the motions. Kind of like an unfunny episode of The Office. The technology the use is ancient, with the most exciting new stuff built on Microsoft Sharepoint."
bad,"Hired as a personal nurse for military. Training started out ok with IT, went downhill from there. Once ""bootcamp"" for personal nurse program began, training was hit or miss. It was obvious management had other meetings to attend, so they threw activities out to you, and you were left to do them, wondering ""where do I start"". Others in training with you felt the same way. You were a telemarketer, not permitted to leave a VMM stating you were a nurse...really? Most beneficiaries either wouldn't answer the phone, or agreed to enroll in the program and then didn't answer on follow up calls. I wouldn't either....we harassed them because we had to, it was expected of us. Poor management. Now role has changed again...no education permitted from us as nurses. So done with them."
bad,"This company acts like it cares so much about it's employees and members. In reality, they only care saving money. It's stressful  enough being yelled at by strangers on the phone, but then we also have to deal with leadership constantly telling us we aren't doing well enough no matter how much we improve."
bad,The job was very different than what I was use to.  It was very interesting.  I liked the people there. I learned how to take finger prints that was great.  I learned to use new equipment.
bad,"It's like any other call centers, It was too stressful for me to be on the phone for eight hours and not have interaction with people in person. It wasn't too hard, it's just taking inbound calls for insurance and working with older people over the phone."
bad,"Fantastic entry level positions, but you are treated as such. There are no opportunities to move up in the company and they will also inform you of this. As I’ve never had an IT experienced job, this  was going to be a fantastic move forward within my career. But as I worked here longer, I learn more that they do not allow you to learn new skill sets, they ar won’t willing to take time to train you with any new information that may assist you in the future, and you will always feel as if your are replaceable within your position and feel as if every decision you make your job is on the line. Weather it’s missing an email, pulling the wrong cable, not making something look pretty enough, etc."
bad,Be ready for a roller coaster ride. Process change but work at home setting makes it all worth it.  Upper Management is disconnected to the nursing process rely heavily on middle management to make major decisions.  Work at your own pace as long as you meet required productivity.
bad,"Good Work, but not is secure.  The  employees no had a excellent communications and the preference for any others was clearly.  The education background and experience no are important for them."
bad,I took a lot away with me... they have excellent training that I still use to date. I thank Humana for all my experience. Great company to work for. They also had many extra activities for employees.
bad,Come ready to work in a fast environment. Good benefits and cultural environment. Humana will continue to be one of the leaders in the healthcare Industry so the job security will always be there.
bad,"Stressful job, Management is unable to keep promises made due to the difficulty of the job."
bad,Good company to work for. Not to many problems
bad,productive call center assiting clients with new perscriptions.incoming calls.
bad,we worked 80 hours a week with little recognition - it was a very time consuming and mentally draining job. They paid well but my mental health was more important.
bad,"The Company has great benefits and all the co-workers are extremely talented, but the lack of unprofessionalism of the Management and the Supervisor are totally extreme. When you put a lot of pressure on your employees for something they don't have any fault, it cost low-self interest to work there. It supposedly has to be a stressed-free work, but it doesn't feel comfortable at all. It's very unfortunate, because this company is really great."
bad,"Very strict attendance policy and all the PTO is always gone so impossible to get any off days. Mandatory OT all year around, but they tell you it’ll only be during peak"
bad,"Things are disorganized management and some agents engage in unethical behavior. Also, managers sometimes provide inaccurate info and later its brought up they deny saying/sharing the info"
bad,"Poor Management, no professional development. No transparency. Employees feel taken advantage of, and leadership does not advocate for you. I left voluntarily for a much better role."
bad,"Be ready for them to change the compensation to their advantage.  Advancement.  They don't even know what that word means.  Executives preach a certain gospel and the middle management don't follow it.  Executives come walk around and middle management would be on their best behavior.  Managers/Leaders are a bunch of Yes men.  Half of them had no clue what the job functions were.   "
bad,"In Humana promotions happens based on who you know rather than what you know.  Humana is a good company with all good policies but your immediate manager has power to ruin your life.  If you believe in work and getting promoted based on that then you will largely disappoint in Humana.  Humana is for people who are largely political in nature, favoritisms and  for people who likes networking more then working."
bad,"I did not enjoy working here, I did at first but then the trueness comes out. If you have to go to the bathroom you get time taken off your break. If you needed time off you had to use PTO no if an or butts, if you call in sick you get an occurrence which you get a total of 6.  There is a list and I could just go on. Depending on where you start you do about 6 peoples jobs. You on the phone 24/7."
bad,"Too much expectation on your numbers. strict breaks, stressful environment. Management didn't know what they were doing and the leads were very flirty."
bad,Great place to work at in the beginning but later turns into a dog eat dog marketplace where customer service is no longer required and sales only matter no matter what.
bad,"Very poor work environment, many lay-offs, micro managed every minute of the day, high demands of work productivity in a short amount of time, no security"
bad,Nothing special about this company or the way they do things. Seem to be stuck in the past on doing most things. Not really big into caring for or taking care of their employees
bad,"I enjoyed being able to help others with knowledge of their healthcare benefits. "
bad,"I feel that I was let go from the company unfairly. I was asked to improve my stats, and I did that quite significantly over a 6 month period. It was not good enough, and I was still terminated. The management staff of Cincinnati should write a book on how to be unprofessional and get away with it."
bad,I advanced my knowledge of Medicare Advantage. I felt rewarded when I was able to help some of the special needs members that we called. I had a great supervisor and teammates.
bad,"They are ok to work for, but they could do a lot better with their management. Also when it comes to having to miss work or leave work early do to children they really could care less. It was all about them."
bad,"For those seeking a long term commitment to a top corporation, this employer offers you every opportunity to advance at a quick pace.  If your just looking to hold down a job, they will also support you in this goal; as was the case with me.  It was definitely a worth while 5 year experience with great benefits to support my family."
bad,Overall my experience at humana had many pros and cons. Every one at the job was amazing people but the company as a whole needs a lot of work. Pay needs to be more also.
bad,"Humana at Home was a fantastic company, although disorganized. Fast forward 4 yrs later. The company began to fall apart. Constant chaos, no direction, leadership has zero communication skills, are dishonest, play favorites, provide zero support, and do not care about the members or associates. Ideas were not welcome if they deviated from the norm. I was intentionally pushed out of my position. I even went to HR and was given no support. If Humana at Home can recapture some of it's initial magic and get better organized, I would be a great place to work again. After 5 yrs I'm happy I got out."
bad,"the position was not hard at all. I worked in customer service. The pay wasn't much at all, but for a college student it will suffice or for anyone who needs experience they WILL hire you."
bad,You better negotiate a good salary because after that the raises are staggered and meager. The environment is warm and friendly but the health benefits are minimal. Barely meeting Medicare Service standards and the workload is overwhelming.
bad,"Lack of integrity, disorganized, unprofessional, there is an obvious lack of passion, which makes it uncomfortable to be there on a daily basis"
bad,"Was thrown on the floor unprepared. Started hiring for the temporary Medicare ""season"" way too late but was thrown on the phones anyway."
bad,If you are o.k. with call center type of work then this is right up your alley.  Very mundane and repetitive work.  Very micro managed environment.
bad,"The company was good but the management was so cruel, although I learned so much. I really was happy to move up in the company as a team lead"
bad,Fast paced environment which requires close attention to detail. It's an environment where the employees stick together and help each other. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with my elder clients; helping to incorporate the most effective and appropriate plan of care helping them to properly age in place.
bad,"Work was fine, but unfairly ran by management. One person could get away with something while others couldn't get away with it"
bad,"a typical day was very short, we would finish the days work within a few hours, the most enjoyable part was listening to personal music"
bad,Great people to work with. Fun atmosphere. Great benefits and compensation program. good health and dental benefit packages.
bad,"Was a school  where I learn all Road System on the South of Miami-dade."
bad,Working at Humana was very productive. We got work done and maintained professional acts while having fun. The employers there really cared about the customers as well as the employee's.
bad,"A typical day at work for me would be reviewing mentor documents which allows us to see what is changing with the Humana advantage plans or medicare  changes that are going to be taking affect or has already token affect.The best part of working at Humana is the  thirty minute breaks we get a week usually on Wednesdays called ""wellness Wednesdays"" which allows  you to relax and unwind from the inbound ca;ll flow.The culture is great at Humana it is very diverse and acknowledges all holidays in every culture and supports the meaning behind different culture holidays you may have never heard of.And last the hardest part of the job can be the over flow of calls during open enrollment and  dis enrollment but there are ways to relieve stress and not let it discourage you from doing your hob accordingly."
bad,It was okay to work with Humana. It was a temporary position and not very amusing.  The job is hard to secure in a permanent position. If you are okay with a quiet work environment I would recommend this job.
bad,okay while as was there but no job security.  very fast paced.  didn't care for the micromanaging but the customers were nice and Humana pays very wel
bad,There is no real interest in employees even though the company tries to lull it's employees into a false sense of caring.  There is no support from upper management and very little opportunity for career advancement.
bad,I was terminated for fighting for my health benefits.  I stood up for myself to receive the benefits that I was promised at hiring.  I created an issue with HR.
bad,"Typically a day would go by quickly. Most of the time calls would be frequent enough that the time passed by without seeming too dull. There would be the occasional slow day but those were rare. Being that we worked where it is sometimes harsh in the winter, they were understanding for the most part about being late if the roads were bad, but they did expect you to show up eventually no matter how bad the roads were. "
bad,"I worked at Humana for many years and earned a great income.However, I had the best and latest training available at all times."
bad,"Favoritism, unrealistic guidelines, no confidentiality, annoying walkie talkies calling people out when you are trying to speak with members distracting environment."
bad,"i loved the enviroment, and the people , but overall very stressfull for little pay. takes a while to get any benefits which is 9 months and they tell you its after 30 days, which is a lie."
bad,Worked as a pharmacy order clerk.  Work was barely there most of the time.  They make a lot of changes.  Too many.  They expect you to make production even if your computer breaks down on you.
bad,I learned to multi task and be very efficient working at this job. The quality was very detailed oriented so everything had to be perfect to pass a call. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a positive attitude after having an irate customer call in and hang up. Only there after to receive another phone call before you could close the previous call. This was a stressful environment for me
bad,when you have been at a company for close to 10 years and people come in the door making more money then you there is a problem... Humana has several different department and this 1 under this management seems to play favorites
bad,My typical day is incredibly stressful. I currently work for another company daily as a Humana delegate. The Humana counterpart of my position is constantly experiencing lay offs. I fear leaving my delegate position to work as a Health Care Coordinator for Humana due to a perceived lack of stability and high turnover.
bad,"Humana has great benefit packages for their employees. However, if you are in customer service, you are tied to a phone and dinged if not in que. This can make it hard to do simple things like use the restroom. Your calls are monitored continuously and vacation is pretty much dictated by the department manager and not a lot of it. The most unflexible employer I have ever worked for."
bad,"As a CM I visit the homes of mbrs who has been hospitalized often, I assist them with: home-going instructions,"
bad,Provided  patients with excellent service.Management was not grate. Learned how to work with co-workers. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with properly filling medications. Most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customers were taken care of
good,"Save time and energy by not working for this Company.  If you are a suck up you will do just fine, otherwise your days with this company are numbered!  All lines of management are backstabbers.  Humana only cares about making $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ and nothing else!"
good,The job is too difficult for the little pay that is received. Extremely understaffed and too much mandatory overtime. No real benefits. No real authority figures.
good,"very unprofessional, everyone in the company is very unprofessional"
good,"This is not a great place to work.  I left a job of almost 15 years for Humana because I did not want to deal with the general public any longer and I was told it was 8am - 430pm m-f.  After a year in that position, Humana decided to transition all of us in my department to another department that is drastically different than the job that I had applied for.  We now deal directly with public as Rightsource Customer Care Specialist.  I was hired to fill a position in Clinical Pharmacy review where we did all the prior authorizations and only talked to Doctors/Pharmacist and on a rare occasion, a medicare member.  The job we are doing now is so different not to mention it is different hours and weekends.  It is very difficult to move out of one department to another.  I can't believe I left a job where I made almost 50 grand a year and had tenure for a job that at the time seemed promising with different opportunities to move up within the company and after almost 2 years the only thing that has changed is I  make less money and I am dealing with the general public and working weekends, not what i signed on for.  I didn't even address the mandatory OT that we are forced to do from December - March.  I live an hour away and when we are forced to work 12 hr days, with my travel time it is 14 hrs and you also have to give up one of your off days so needless to say the work/life balance is not good.  They wont even consider any other options, I have even recommended work from home opportunities but the leadership will not hear of it.  Why is it that many other companies have work"
good,"Unorganized, things being changed at the last minute, low pay, bad management team, the job doesn't care about their employes."
good,"On a typical day in agent support at Humana, it was a very stressful day from the very start when you walked in the door.  Every thing you did was monitored and it made you feel like you were constantly in a prison.  No time was given to use the restroom except on your break or lunch.  I was definitely not a good fit for me."
good,"I very much enjoy Humana, my searching for another position has to do with my leader.  It is no reflection on the company the leader I report to does not consistently apply the culture in her ways of working."
good,"I made many good friends at C3 that I have to this day. However, it was a very frustrating job to have but if you need something to pay the bills, it's not bad."
good,No complaints  I wouldn’t recommend them for single parents there hours are crazy  overtime mandatory if u can’t stay it’s points till ur fired. The managers know very little
good,You aren't allowed to be human they don't care about you as a person there is always new managers very high turn over rate..the job is very depressing because of management
good,If you want to work everyday like it may be your last then go for it.  The only place I’ve ever been at and receive a STAR award and then get laid off for performance 1 month later!  And need I say there was never any documentation of my performance being subpar.  Management doesn’t care about their employees they only care about themselves and the almighty dollar!
good,This place sucks but the 401k matching is good. Medical sucks! Only acknowledge their friends and no promoting within my current department. Laid off a lot of people but expect the same results although the department is understaffed.
good,"A typical day at work would be the systems not working that’s a regular everyday thing. Working from home isn’t always the best because when you need help there is no one around. As far as management everyone likes to point fingers no one wants to take ownership for anything. Its not a fun environment like it used to be everything has changed. You work so hard and you don’t get recognized for what you do.As far as learning new things you really don’t unless there is a new campaign that they want you to work. We’re suppose to be one big family but team leads sit down amongst each other and talk about the associates. Why would anyone want to be in an environment like that, your suppose to help the associates not talk about them behind there back especially at work."
good,"Too much fickled trickle down managment; bipolar-schizophrenic management style practices makes major changes very frequently and reprimands if you can't keep up with all of them and this is while the push is constantly on to make higher numbers, very stressful."
good,Humana management is disjointed with little to no long range planning. Management style is micro-manage sales associates with limited feed back or input from individuals. Somewhat difficult to align company growth with leadership.
good,Humana unfortunately has not figured out how to differentiate between managers and leaders.  This makes the workplace and culture very difficult to mature in beyond a certain point.  Humana is a GREAT place to start a career BUT I would say it is almost impossible self driven and self motivated person to thrive within the ranks of the organization.
good,Workplace culture is involved. Community related events and health awareness. Filled wit diverse and friendly people. I learned a lot about Health Insurance. Was able to obtaion Licenses in 19 States.
good,"Registered nurse care managers expected to work unrealistic hours to meet metrics, does not allow for life work balance-most weeks worked 50 hours on the phone with minimal breaks-changes made without notice -implementations with little or no training to changes made"
good,I have no opinion at this time.  I would rather not comment on the agency at this time and does not wish to share any thoughts at this time.
good,too many kids playing while you are trying to work on the phone.
good,The job was very stressful at times. The department I worked in could have been better managed. I fell overall the job was good but would have been better if it was in different part.
good,I would not currently recommend employment with this company based on my personal experiences. The managment was very difficult to speak to and have any issues resolved in a timel;y manner if ever.
good,Salary positions did not pay for overtime.  Expected to work overtime to meet Medicare guidelines to meet deadlines.  Difficulty getting PTO if other nurses were off.
good,"Careplus offers many perks to employees but there is not work life balance.You are expected to work more than 40 hours a week more often then not, and do not get vacations approved often."
good,"They aren't very flexible with time schedules, there is favoritism easy to advance in job position but not in pay, benefits aren't good, training is exceptional!"
good,"They tell you that the most important this is to do your job correctly, but then they penalize you for not having a high enough production. They would rather produce more claims incorrectly than actually taking the time to do them correctly."
good,"a normal day at humana is simply be ready to answer calls and make sure you to read all disclosures.. humana does teaches a lot of information at one time .. humana will help you learn all you can .. if you mess up .. theres a good chance you will be fired..  the culture is fun at times, but a lot of personal affiars get out of hand at times and  disrupt the floor.. the hardest part of the job is the constant testing to stay current with new insurance laws.. which is critical to continuing employment.. the most enjoyable part of the job are the wco,, events .. which allows us time off the phone and engaging with coworkers in different workshops.. very entertaining..."
good,"Humana itself is a good company just bad Managers that were in that department too long and the culture is very stressful. The management needs to be looked at is all I need to say,"
good,"What is said/promised is not followed tru."
good,"Call center with Mandatory OT , Breaks are short . Take up to 75 Calls per day . Pay was good and the atmosphere was okay as well. I would not Recommend this Job to a friend however."
good,Red tape.........  very click-ish and difficult to move forward unless you have something on someone. The company does pay well but they also make it hard to move on to somewhere else  as you are seen as being to over priced.
good,When I worked at teleperformance underneath the the humana campaign I thought it was going to be a relaxed job that was a mature place to wok at. As I was there I noticed that the floor helpers were rude and didn't want to help the employees out much nor did the supervisors there.
good,A typical work day is 8 hours. Management set unrealistic goals for the associates. Sometimes associates has to give up breaks to meet these expectations
good,Phone and data entry on the computer with various computer programs was daily on your scheduled shift. The co-workers are always helpful to the new comers. Training can become boring but well worth it with a great trainer.
good,"Management quality varies dependent upon the supervisor and the department.  I have learned quite a significant amount of information regarding the healthcare industry with this company; however, there is little room for career advancement without the appropriate connections."
good,working on open enrollment changing and updating Medicare plans. Working with computer software and system verifying the different types of codes; if the person is staying with humana or leaving or even if they have died.
good,"Struggling to survive in the healthcare marketplace. Disorganized, a lot of inter-team conflict, uncertainty about what's happening now they've been bought by Aetna. As a content strategist, few if any of my suggestions were listened to and they just did what upper management and production schedules had already stipulated."
good,Great if you're mid-twenties with MBA or member of the Good Ole Boy Club.
good,"Few growing opportunities, long working hours.Poor management staff"
good,Humanan is a great company only when you do not have to work as incomingg call csr rep. I learned a lot with this company but micromanagement is horrible they treat you worse then a 5 year old child but if you can hadle that for a few years you will do great once you leave the department.
good,"I worked for two different departments during my 11 months. I was hired as a Data Entry position, but the job the department performs is Application Analysis."
good,"You have to separate Humana the Insurance Co. from Humana the employer.Humana the employer is micromanaged and it is impossible to please everyone. You are expected to meet metrics which on some days are impossible. Big Brother is always watching what you do and what you say. You are rarely finished on time because you are expected to take phone calls right up until 515pm and then there is an enormous amount of documenting to complete. Time off is almost impossible. "
good,"Extremely high turn-over for managers, supervisors and customer care representatives. Narrow upward mobility path.There is a slight negative culture there."
good,"Great company, poor management since it was through a call center. I started when they first open that campaign. Too much work for little pay at the time."
good,"Thought it’d be a good job, it was very hard and the training wasn’t sufficient for the role. Not enough support either. Pay and benefits were good but it wasn’t enough for me to stay."
good,Poor pay for micro management  and being under a constant microscope of listening in on calls at any time   Standards change frequently good benefits but these people will lay nurses off at a drop of the hat   It’s about profit with them  culture is combative and they have no loyalty to you as an employee   I saw them lay people off that started program from ground up     No loyalty and Human Resources is very little help if any
good,"I enjoyed working at Humana However, job security was not one of their best assets. I worked in a division that actually was successful and helped members only to have that division done away with and let go after 3.5 years."
good,that's all I have to say. The CEO gets paid a lot and still gets a massive bonus while people lose their jobs. It was fine to work there the people are pretty cool but the management is shady.
good,It was a good place to work at but the managment was not that good. The training was very rushed and my whole training class quit within a month on the floor because most of us didnt get the correct training.
good,I liked my job when I started. It was a good place to work. You could work at home and I still had patient contact. Then new management took over. They laid off nurses and you where told if you don’t take voluntary retirement we will fire you.
good,"Was hired for inbound  new medicare sales, was placed on outbound  medicare  conversion sales from PDP to medicare Advantage plans. No option to be inbound unless you come in early and do overtime"
good,"I had an absolutely wonderful immediate leadership team, but at the end of the day, Humana as a whole simply treats you as a number and doesn't truly value their employees as individual people."
good,In this position the job function itself was seamless. The management  there at the time I worked were very unprofessional and played a lot of favoritism to certain employees.
good,Be careful what you wish for. The Tampa location is stressful on the phones. Hard to schedule time off. No real growth opportunities. Its a Upper mngmt doesnt really implement whats suggested. Lower mgmnt just goes with the flow. So very little changes for the better. . They dont appreciate those that do the job correctly with integrity vs those that cut corners to get by. .
good,"Many jobs often depend on management. Same situation at Humana as my initial 2 managers were good, 3rd was so bad, it was decided that I leave my position. The job culture was not good either after the failed sale of Humana to Aetna."
good,"Due to the cutthroat nature of the business, I never had more then 4 patients per week to see and a few times I had no one. I enjoyed assisting people with resources and depression counseling when I had someone to help."
good,"Pay rate is very lucrative, not too many companies can compare in that respect. Also great discounts and perks with working for Humana but when it comes to the stress level and the management in the Customer Service department, there is a lot to be desired. Calls are stressful enough but management don't make it any easier. Not the type of department for people with children as we were told in traiing ""the main reason people are fired are due to attendance because of their kids"" The opportunity for advancement is not easy and seems like it's on a ""who you know"" basis."
good,Its a good company to start off with if its your first job the turn over rate is high. taking calls back to back you have to beg to do a callback but they expect you to maximize and offer call backs to the member. You have to be in good with the managers to get a promotion. Most enjoyable part of the job is working from home.
good,Call center was very rigid and stressful and my manager was not on task. Too many rules to complete a call the correct way and the customers feeling had too much input on your perceived job performance.
good,Typical insurance environment with lots of over-time requirements.Friendly co-works and effect work place environment. Communication between staff and managers could be better.
good,"Upper management is out of touch and only focused on the bottom line and their pockets. This company is out of alignment with its mission and they've done a reduction if force every quarter since January 2017."
good,"I take back to back phone calls and with the training I received, I feel that I am giving inaccurate information out to veterans and providers. This bothers me because I like to give accurate information out especially concerning their health and benefits. We work long hours and have our breaks cut and no flexibility if we need to go to the doctor or any other appointments, expected to work mass overtime and have no life outside of work."
good,"Hit the goals that were given to me in the beginning, not a very secure job or company. Management really needs work at valuing there people and providing a work life balance."
good,Humana thrives on healthy employees but it only seems to apply to management because everyone below management / lead has no life outside of work and if they do it conflicts with work hours and they may have several occurrences.
good,"If you like to be in a monotonous workplace, doing the same thing all over again, everyday; talk a lot and talk and listen to elderly people, then this place is for you."
good,"stressful job - long hours, very little increase in pay. manager partial tocertain people and others ignored  left company for another job. "
good,"This job was not that good. The manager were rude asf, and didnt really care about the employees. I would recommend this job to somebody that need something as soon as possible."
good,Humana is not horrible. The people are. The CEO is not a good person. Management is not the best. There are a lot of things going being done wrong in different regions. Mid-South really needs a lot of work
good,"Not all departments were as bad, some provided better management and work/life balance.  Any attempt at career advancement creates a very competitive atmosphere and people are more likely to knock you down to advance themselves than to lift you up, or let you do your own thing!"
good,"Some of the managers were rude and felt entitled, the others you couldn't even believe were managers. Josh was really nice but Melanie was sometimes rude and condescending. Caren seemed like a ""yes man"" because she didn't belong in that role as a FLL. She was grateful to be there yet afraid they'll realize she wasn't FLL material."
good,"a typical work day consist of very confusing and hectic calls with hardly any type of direction from managers. the policy constantly changes on a daily basis leaving no consistency and lack of job security due to ""nit-picking"" in quality. "
good,"Management didn't care about the employees. Overtime demanded without care of your outside life, the job came first. Low pay for responsibilities given to job."
good,"I would assist customer and providers with benefits, claims, and prescriptions. I have learned to be patient. The management needs a little work and organization. My co-workers were very fun people to be around. The hardest past is management treating you like a kid and the most enjoyable was getting to know my co-workers."
good,"My responsibilities were working with health insurance providers to obtain, prepare, and disseminate clinical information for Medicare members."
good,What's glittering and gold isn't always what it seems! Some of the supervisors are very nice and supportive but some aren't and the company does not care nor do they give you a chance at a permanent position.
good,"Lazy people were promoted over hard working people."
good,"very stressful environment, but the work was enjoyable for me"
good,"I love my manager and hate to leave Humana but the culture of disrepect and lack of kindness is just too much.  Nobody thinks twice about blaming others for their failures.  Managers are too nice and seem afraid to hold the guilty parties accountable.  I love working from home but not when I make $20,000 less that I can somewhere else.  I work in Corporate IT and I can't stand our customers.  They are workaholic witches with nothing better to do than make IT feel like nothing we do is good enough."
good,"Decent place to work. Good benefits pto, health insurance, 401k. Management is a bit unorganized.Not concerned with work life balance just meeting their bottom line."
good,"One of the better health insurers to work for but don't become too comfortable in your role.  Change at Humana is constant. Sometimes necessary sometimes just so another department can make their jobs easier.  Overall was a decent place to work for, but too many changes to leadership, processes and market related aspects (one size does not fit all)"
good,"Las compañeras de trabajo en general son buenas en lo que hacen, cada quien sabe lo que tiene que hacer. El problema son los jefes, creo que en casi todos los trabajos en donde hay una cantidad desbordante de jefe, sub jefe, jefe zonal, supervisora, encargada de local, etc. La comunicación se ve afectada ya que el mensaje que por ejemplo se quiere entregar llega de manera errónea a las vendedoras y al final a las que regañan o tienen la culpa y ponen la cara son las vendedoras."
good,The Health benefits are the worst that I ever had.  Humana also created a position that could have cut costs but made it so regulated that you had to call members just to make your number.  Humana needs to listen to it's employees more
good,"I gained some good experience during my time at Humana.  The company promoted a lot of engagement activities and tried to promote a fun workplace.  However, the way some managers treated their staff was contradictory to what the company promotes.  But I have heard that since I left, the company has cleared out some of those bad seeds."
good,"Initally was the dream job being able to provide case management to members remotely from home.. However, the metrics and micromanagement got to the point it was too stressful to stay in this position. I left because everyday meetings about what we were doing wrong."
good,"I have had a lot of experiences at Humana although some may not be all positive, I do believe and appreciate that each experience has taught me a skill to use as I move up career wise.  I loved traveling for Humana; if you are able to do so you will definitely enjoy it! I would like more of an increase in my salary but they have been small.  There are different perks as far as health and well being.  I think your time is dependent on management, but that's with any career."
good,I worked as a sub for this company and they were the hardest company to get thru on phone you can only get thru to pharmacy which was good but all the others in the company did not want to be bothered Hosp. still call me trying to get referrals taken care of. Not good
good,Way too much overtime. Ideas are not take seriously. Suggestion box was implemented for techs but every answer to it was an excuse NOT to do it. Lots of favoritism.
good,Worked in a fast pace and steady environment. The people I worked with was very nice people to work with. The sales representatives was great to work with. A typical day was a busy and fast paced day. It required a fast pace and organized employee. The hardest part of the job was often we were sent home for hours to be minimized to save cost to the company. The hardest part to accept as a hard working employee was the benefits. As an insurance company you would expect them to offer fair benefits but the policies they had to offer was very low. There was very little options to advance and move up in the company.
good,The best thing about the job is the pay. The hours are decent. The schedule is decent also. The location was really great close to home not that much traffic.
good,"Overworked and underpaid. Working way beyond title and salary with high expectations and no recognition. Although the work itself is rewarding, the stress of the job and long hours with multiple last minute deadlines does not promote health and well-being."
good,"A typical day consists of answering a multitude of inbound calls in reference to mail order medications. I'm learning to be more empathetic to the needs of the member/patient.Workplace culture is the environment that you create for your employees. ... It is the mix of your organization's leadership, values, traditions, beliefs, interactions, behaviors and attitudes that contribute to the emotional and relational environment of your workplace. If I had to describe my work place culture it would be lack of maturity. The work place should be professional at all times. There's definitely room for growth in that area. The hardest part of this job is making sure you pay attention to detail. Most enjoyable is resolving the issues of the member's."
good,"The atmosphere was very relaxed, causal dress code with flexible work hours. I met many good friends there. It provided free parking to employees and visitors."
good,a typical day at work includes answering phone calls and making sure the patients rx are filled and will be shipped out to them accordingly. Also making sure the patient is satisfied.
good,Many things wrong. The first would be its political but what corp job isn't. Theyre not afraid to make sudden changes and decisions. This company is still alive but barely breathing aka for sale signs are everywhere.
good,"taking calls up to 40 per day while doing other tasks in-between calls"
good,"Contractually worked for Comforecare who contracts with Humana."
good,"The job was not the best and the people they hired were very young and extremely unprofessional. Customer Service was not really a concern, the management were more focused on meeting sales goals rather than the quality of service that was being offered. This pushed some agents to wrongfully enroll insurance members and having their medications lost."
good,"It's a call center. The day begins and ends with servicing all active- duty members and their families, including non-active duty members and their families. Typical work week is at least 55 hours. There is no work-life balance, especially for those that have families. Management doesn't seem to care, especially with the transition that took place at the beginning of 2018. There are no job resources to assist after training and the user is pretty much winging it most of the time. The employees are very helpful since their are no supervisors to gain assistance with the calls. That is how most call centers perform."
good,"Busy season long hours, fair pay, not much room for advancement, great benefits especially 401K, college reimbursement, good hsa matching, great coworkers"
good,Humana is a good company with good benefits.  Management needs to be overhauled. Was a good company to work for until merger/takeover with Aetna failed.  Company appears to be positioning itself to be sold.  Cutting back all over.
good,"Upper / corporate management only care about the bottom line not the staff, their training or the patients. Did not want to make changes based on area and the patient population.  Poor training for newly hired CNA's  or nurses.  Pushed people into work with little training.  I was there for 4 months was never truly trained in my job duties.  I was given stuff to read and that was it. When asked for more I was considered a problem.  Office staff very ""clic-ish"" and not helpful at all to new hires."
good,I was able to get my health insurance license through Humana.  Sales tactics were reasonable. Unlimited overtime.  Frontline leaders were not working as much as the LTE employees.
good,"a company that invests so much time and money into hiring and training only to turn around and downsize within 6 months doesn't seem very business savvy. great nurses on my team, but constant changes as to what is expected of you, and OT is almost mandatory in order to meet all their expectations."
good,A typical day is filled with many challenges and barriers of a lack of communication and collaboration.  The workplace culture is filled with fear of losing your job and frustration in lack of communication within the company.  The hardest part of the job is just never knowing and waiting for the other shoe to drop.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with members and helping them with their healthcare needs.
good,"One would start with clocking in and answering calls immediately. One would deal with helping Agents to get licensed, accreditation, contacted, and appointments from states they were wanting to sell Humana Products. The management seemed to overwork a few leads/supervisors while others remain untapped resources who would not help. The hardest part of the job was getting critical information to Agents because management was limited or not there altogether."
good,"Management is unable to communicate clearly and effectively. Many times they refuse to explain any change or expectation. Most managers are allowed to do as they see fit, and do not have to explain their actions. There seems to be a lack of appreciation as a whole within the company.. have no fear, you are replaceable."
good,"This company is not concerned about the consumer, and is strictly numbers focused. Humana provides an opportunity to work at home while micromanaging their employees to an excess and making it difficult to take breaks, lunch, etc."
good,"The work pleace was stressful, you could not really speak to people, you would have a quota to get per day,when you needed help, it was hard to find. I felt like that there was no one you could approach to talk to about anything that was bothering you. I had ask many times to be moved because the associate next to me was making strange nocies and it was very hard to concentrate on your job."
good,"The company itself might be better but, due to the fact I work for a 3rd party vendor we do not get benefits and the pay that we should, but overall it is a ok job and I love helping the elderly."
good,"The company has a very nice management, they are open to hear fresh ideas and new points of view for ideals that could build and expand company. Company is willing to spread those ideas with department heads and other departments in different locations."
good,"I love my job and what I do, but I have come to a place where I feel under appreciate and under compensated. I do the work of 3 people. I love learning new things and keeping busy. Here I will never know the meaning of being awarded for greatness."
good,"The management did not take the time to get to know their employees, the management always had drama and made it known to its employees that they talked about people. Not a good work environment."
good,"Hard to say you know your job.  It changes with training. Employees are Moved from different jobs (mandatory) sometimes,  Very difficult to not make mistakes, they are demanding perfect work."
good,No advancement. Not well at addressing issues in the workplace. The people are good and enjoyable to work with. The benefits are alright.
good,unpleasant. FAvortism is played but there is a good employee employer relationship gained with seniority. Decent company non the less
good,"About this company i would like to say the experience was 50-50."
good,"At least in the Humana One On-Exchange department, we have been on overtime status for almost two years (since the department opened including weekends). There is no time to do any personal chores or spend time with family members because you're almost always at work and when you leave work you're too exhausted to do anything else than rest. Management is terrible, there is no clear goal as to what company wants to achieve as a whole and they will step on you in any way that they can. The lunch area is terrible since is a small place with a fridge for approximately 500 employees, therefore lunch time is chaotic. The bathroom situation is also very terrible. The best thing about this place are the co-workers because they are always on an optimist view of the job and will make your day at least tolerable."
good,"The company is fine to work for. However, there is not a lot of room to actually help the members without having to jump through a ton of hoops."
good,The company claims they focus on job advancement but is unrealistic in what they view as job advancement.  Even if offered a position that can or could lead to advancement job freezes are in place that will not allow employees to transfer for 3-4 months so it is just easier for hiring managers to hire from outside the company.
good,"The hours are good. The pay is fine. The guidelines on which you are judged by for your calls are constantly changing, sometimes without rhyme or reason. If you are unaware of the changes you will find yourself in trouble, even for small mistakes and omissions that don't affect customer service. The management seems unable to understand or, at least, be able to explain the changes that occur. Management is largely ineffective and is more concerned with appearances and pretenses than with what is actually happening within the department. Certain supervisors are given free reign to do as they please, with little to no repercussions for their actions. Recourse against these supervisors, to this point, has been futile, even to the call center's overall department head, which only netted an email sent to the location head alerting her to those that had ""snitched""."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is education consumers regarding available options in their area. Once I meet the consumer needs based on their response it makes me feel very productive.
good,"Learn great deal of one to one patient care, great experience taking care of the seniors stage since it was the the first time that i have the pleasure to work with the golden age patients"
good,"Employee of 10+ years...stayed because of NEED for health insurance...no room for advancement (unless they feel you cannot produce/sell)...if you want to advance, do NOT become a top producer (you will be stuck with no increases in pay and no advancement)...peers were wonderful but management is substandard in performance...also, Insurance premium increasing year after year with a significant DECREASE in coverage"
good,A typical day at work consist of answering calls from customers and explaining health care plans. Learned about Medicare and health care. Management is not friendly or motivating to the employees. The co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management
good,"Humana was a call center in the co workers were well experienced and professional, I learned to try to move around in the company. The hardest part was to make calls in such a busy environment."
good,"I am currently a customer service rep I have been year for 6 years and I am not happy with it at all. The only reason im still here is because i dont want to go to another company and start over.Its hard to grow here.Customers yell at me all day,you have to meet certain stats."
good,I loved working at Humana with the limited term assignments I've been aside to but as far as me finding a permanent position there its seems in possible to get. 
good,"The Humana associates are a great team. You can count on them to produce outstanding results anytime, anywhere. The work was difficult and demanding. Once known as the 'Humana Family, it quickly became a hostile environment with few rewards which is a sad note, especially for such an incredibly talented team. As for me, I will always remember the friendships I forged, and the relationships I have maintained with my fellow associates."
good,Every day was a very productive day with investigations of reworked claims to determine the root cause of why the claim had to be reworked with it either being underpaid or overpaid. I have extensive knowledge of Medicare and commercial policies. During my time with Humana I had wonderful experience with diverse co-workers. As for the hardest part of the job I can honestly say that I did not find it difficult. The most enjoyable part of my positions held at Humana was the friends that I made.
good,"7am check the lead system and assign leads, check dispositions and make sure they are at 100%, Call each agent and review their day or week, handle Broker Medicare Certification classes all across the State. Field work with agents daily - field evaluations. throughout the year. Learned how to manage my time better/as a virtual manager - I handled all admin responsibilities, reporting and complaints. I love to help people build their insurance practice and seeing them grow and blossom. Monitored all sales/non sales, coached all agents under my control. Reviewed compliance in all settings and investigated allegation for Humana. Drove about 1000 miles a week."
good,"Limited training mostly learn as you go. Very focused on the numbers. No real personal contact. Lots of discrepancies within the data bases and mbr acct error, frustrating."
good,"In general Good people."
good,Humana is a great company if you work in the field. If you are contracted through a third party you are treated like less than. We were given 48 hour notice that they were closing the sales department right before Christmas.
good,"Management has its own clique. If you are a part of it or they like you then you can succeed.  Many Mgrs/sups don’t have people skills and don’t empathize with employees well, unless you are one of their favorites. Employees do care about the customer."
good,This company is constantly sending all of its IT technical jobs to offshore contractors and has very little upward mobility available.  I was able to work from home for about 2 years.  Management here has gone downhill in the last few years and I do not see it stopping.  The employees/coworkers are some of the nicest people.
good,"Humana has very good benefits, but employees are often promised things and are lied to. This last department has been a headache since the begging; no life work balance, current manager is not reliable and doesn't do anything for her employees and when brought to supervisors attention nothing is done."
good,I've been working as a production support engineer and also assigned for another Analytics project. There is too much to learn new things in this project.
good,"Great company; poor management, alot of who you know and not what you know. company constant changes and have to adapt. The hardest part of the job is dealing with poor management and poor communication"
good,Great place for temporary work or students. Not much in the way of career advancement but there was room to transfer to different parts of the call center to work on different project with different companies
good,Humana is like high school for adults. my dept is very unorganized and management is subpar. it has great potential but it does not promote growth. I wish that I could move forward and expand within the company but the department i’m in limits that opportunity
good,"I liked the nature of the job although it was temporary.  I felt the culture was predominately Hispanic and felt a little left out.  My boss did try to keep me, but I also know he seemed distant.  I don't believe he liked my age.  Even though he did try to keep me, I also felt he wasn't thrilled to do so.  He didn't give me a chance to learn how to work in the field.  He wasn't totally fair in his assessment, but he did tell me I was effective in getting the medical records turned in."
good,"Micromanaged"
good,"Great work hours. Constantly changing work processes, retrying previous unsuccessful practices. Very frustrating grievance and appeals department without the ability to transfer to other departments."
good,The management was horrible & constantly changed. Extra hard to get assistance until days before the case was about to go out of compliance. Of course we had to complete cases within a specific time frame. The job description I applied for isn't what we were doing. Thid department was like an abusive relationship...even when I did exactly as I was told therr was still backlash from higher ups. On top of everything else pay wasnt enough to deal with the anxiety nor mental exhaustion
good,"Humana could have been a much better place to work if it did not have such a limitation on advancement.  There was not a clear career path to get into a bigger role or contribute if you were not ""liked"" by management and this was not based on phone stats or what skill set you may possess.  This was several years ago so I am not sure what has changed, I hope it has changed for the better."
good,Good experience overall.  Able to increase job skills.  Very demanding job.  Lots of use of different computer programs to do the job.  Every thing done on computers.  When glitches happened.  Which was often. Unable to get work done until IT fixed glitch.  Work was still expected the same day.  Which could mean 10 to 12 hour days.
good,"Good work environment.  Associates were helpful and friendly. Management was hands-off type management and did not micro manage."
good,"Very good commissions"
good,Major disassociation between policies and procedures and customer satisfaction .too many  escalated issues created because of policies and procedures vs customer  satisfaction and  account  management
good,"Overall not a bad company to work for. in fact the first two and a half years were good to me. Good health benefits. Management is terrible and can really make you hate your job and everything about it. I would say if you're lucky enough to get the right people on your team, great support from your leaders and if management did a complete 360 on how they run things, employees could actually be happy and successful here."
good,The training is poor and management was very poor.  The typical work day was basically date entry and you coiuld not rely on management to fix the problem
good,"Schedule was awesome , poor training and compensation was not great . Lots of changes but difficult knowing if you will have a job in the changing market"
good,"Humana were great with work flexibility."
good,Maintenance department is divided by lack of management people skills. No Career development program. The upper level manager does not trust the maintenance manager.
good,Management takes little interest in employees and didn't even approve of peer contact. It was a very quiet atmosphere and all were discouraged from speaking to each other.
good,Terrible job security. Constantly changing. They are more worried about numbers than actually helping people. Managers micromanage and there is no freedom.
good,The training is done on web x- poor follow up to complete training. The opportunity to work from home is offered.  There are a few seasoned employees/managers that want to keep their office with the same people.
good,company has gone through two rounds of layoffs in the last year.  Do no feel any kind of job security.  Very poor support system within company to support their employees.
good,"I enjoyed working with the company, however the training for contract employees was not provided. We were often held accountable for information that was not provided. The contract employees are not protected from termination or immediate discharge."
good,"Scheduled VA provider appointment"
good,"The Humana product and line of business is amazing, very fulfilling and rewarding."
good,Room for improvement and compensation. For the amount and level of work done. I feel Humana doesn’t compensate employees nearly as much as they should.
good,"Nothing special  - it's a job..  Favoritism shown to who you know.  Management is marginal, if you're liked, you get help, if you're not, you're on your own."
good,"High stress/high demand; constant change. Recent Lay off. Sums it up from beginning to end. Hardest part of the job was the constant scrutiny, change. I learned a variety of skills working telephonically. workplace culture varied. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with and getting to know the many members."
good,A typical way started straight to the phones. You were not given enough time to use the bathroom or for anything else. You are always rushed on the phones. The culture was different for the morning till the evening shift. Management was good at first after the primary manager left the acting manager was very rude and disrespectful. The most thing I enjoyed about the job was leaving in the afternoon.
good,"I first worked for Humana in 2010 and found it to be a very rewarding company, work standard and work environment.  After a year or so they hired a new CEO who changed the entire spirit of the company from personal and caring to business as usual.  The nurse managing my department was ruthless and inexperienced.  That combined with her endless ego and ambition made working there intolerable. As nurses we were mandated to call members 5-7 times a day until reached for follow up/surveys.  Humana also installed their own homegrown computer program which was most difficult of all I'd ever used to navigate.  Humana became a nightmare, and I became very verbal for which I apologize to Humana.  I loved the company at first but with all the negative changes I felt I had to leave for my own personal/professional welfare."
good,"The company may want to do right by employees, but the immediate supervisor was horrible and despite many complaints from employees they chose to keep her and did not take actions."
good,"My day starts at 8 am and ends at 6:15 unless there is mandatory overtime. I've learned to treat customers with the same respect as any elderly person deserves like I would my parents. My immediate supervisor is the most caring and teaching supervisor I've ever worked with. The most difficult part of my job is getting calls from people that want to blame everything on the company and not themselves, but with the guidance of my supervisor I'm able to stay focused on their issue and not their behavior."
good,"The culture sucks the life out of you.  There are too many inexperienced, micromanaging leaders and cliques.  Most managers are more interested in getting ahead than developing their employees.  You’ll only get promoted if you are in the right clique."
good,"Most of the work you do at Humana involves fixing other's mistakes. A lot of the work is production based, so employees tend to place tantamount importance on meeting certain production goals, which are set by management. If you do not meet your production goals, you will eventually lose your job, so people do whatever it takes to meet those numbers, even at the expense of quality. A person must become friends with the right people in order to advance their career. Career advancement is primarily based on who you are friends with, so if you are an introvert or like to keep to yourself, it's possible to get stuck in a role for a long time, regardless of how good your work is."
good,"I used to like working at Humana in the beginning.  However, as the former CEO left and the current one came, it has not been the same.  I don't like that he got a huge bonus while so many people lost jobs.  The values sound good but are not really being followed."
good,Contract position so i was not able to really enjoy the position. It was through a staffing agency who did not pay me for 2-3 weeks and i was commuting from tampa to st pete
good,"In general, a good company to work for.  Some pockets of poor management and confrontational culture.  It used to be a more enjoyable environment, over the past couple of years, organizational changes have caused several negative consequences."
good,"I am looking for better opportunities and potential. I'm a hard worker, dedicated, I tend to go over and beyond for customer satisfactory. I pride myelf on my capabilities for attentive listening, articulation in communication."
good,"Not much in way of a work / life balance. Inconsistenet management, both in style and among leadership. Pay is quite low for the responsibilities."
good,"They have a rotating door policy. Employees are not treated with a lot of respect. The ones that have been there for a long time, are the ones that are able to tolerate being paced up for promotions and the low pay. I was lucky enough to have a great supervisor and when she left I was soon to follow her."
good,"too management heavy and management style does not match the current workforce or productive philosophy. The office is great with great co-workers, but managers need to constantly start the building on fire and then yell, ""there's a fire"""
good,"Humana was a good place to work in 2010 but digressed around 2014 to present. Effective and productive workers, previously identified began to be ignored and environment became collaborative only on the surface. Ironically, those who did not demonstrate passion or innovation but did the minimum per management guidelines became the more recognized employees."
good,"Humana was a great work from home job but if you don't meet your quota for the day and/or week you will be up for lay off.......it is challenging trying to contact 10 members along with having quality talk time.   There is no social life with working at a desk for 8.5 hours , everything is virtual!"
good,"My supervisor was on vacation or time off due to personal family illness for the first month i started working there, i was trained by my employees and when i had to supervise them the were resistant and complained to my supervisor who than wrote me up"
good,Humana provided great pay and benefits but the company culture was very cut throat.  People would constantly find ways to step on each other to get to the top.
good,Humana was going through a reorganization which was handled poorly. Management was poor with little support offered for staff. Was a very competitive company. Stressful work environment.
good,"Some folks at Humana simply don't count very well. Two layoffs in 3 months (the second layoff followed denials there would even be a second layoff). My immediate supervisor was top notch, enjoyed my teammates, as well. After that, it's fairly normal corporate stuff: use 2500 words to say nothing, rigid thinking, rhetoric over action. All about numbers - which management does its best to make harder to obtain. Is there anything more sacrosanct in corporate culture than a ""meeting""? No sense at all that ""super"" ideas piled on employees on Tuesday follows what was piled upon Monday (and the week before). Not that bad, not great. About as condescending and untrustful a management culture as the nuns I've worked for."
good,"My first two years there was wonderful. I had a great manager as well as director I would say on average 50 hours a week. The department then got shaken up with a new manager and director literally everyone on my team has left the company now was putting in close to 80 hours a week working with both onshore and offshore team members, maximum stress."
good,"If you're looking for a job with great flexibility, this is one for you.  You are in total control of your work schedule.  After performing home visits as required, all charting is done from home.  So the down side is that you go out during the day to see your members and when you get home, you still have at least an hour or more of charting to do.  You have to be very organized and good at time management."
good,Upon successfully completing training you are basically thrown into your position with little help. The supervisors really don't know the job so asking them questions leave you more confused. The leads are helpful at times but when asking them questions as well they have attitudes and act as if you should know everything. The rules change daily and it seems as if the people who were more of a distraction during training and on the floor got permanent positions. The job is very challenging and if you never worked with medicare or Medicaid it can be hard to grasp all of the rules and enrollment process. I love the pay but this job was very stressful. Once the work for open enrollment is completed they start getting rid of people one by one.
good,"I filed and refiled products with departments of insurance, attended"
good,"i loved the employees but was very micromanaged, once I left I felt like an adult again. Their benefits were the worst I have ever had and that is sad for an insurance company."
good,"I did not work directly for Humana, but through NCM. I feel the best comment I can make is that Humana seems to have great intentions to help their members stay healthy."
good,I learned a great deal about the healthcare industry in my time at Humana. It has given me a firm understanding of the health insurance field and a comprehensive grasp of how to deal with customers in an insurance related market.
good,"fast passed and challenging;"
good,"Good work environment with a positive work atmosphere with the ability to move up and learn more, good job schedule that is flexible and easy to work with."
good,work life balance is great if you can work from home. no real room for advancement and directors pretty much select their favorites and the rest is history.
good,"High productive work environment, I learned how to be more accurate with my coding, I met a lot of interesting people at Humana. The hardest part of the job was the moves. The job is always enjoyable and the time goes by quickly."
good,"Overall, Humana was a good place to implement some effectual changes. However, the gap between HQ and other markets made it difficult to move forward with the changes. "
good,"I had to opportunity to become a licensed health insurance agent and learn a lot about the Medicare program. Management lacked professionalism. Unfortunately once I completed my MBA, I tried to apply for another position in a different department and reality set in. I realized for myself and learned from other employees that you are basically stuck in that department. I was advised that a number of employees have had the same experience and management would do whatever they needed to prevent you from transferring. I later resigned for another opportunity with another company."
good,"They will demand high goals but not provide you much to reach them.  Management in Indiana is awful, however, maybe it is just that way in this state.  "
good,Management never let you know your next weeks scheduled until 4:30 on that Friday before. Almost every week had mandatory overtime. No real work life balance with this job.
good,"The job description does not match what your job truly entails. They are great at lip service, and I personally would much rather prefer an ""I don't know"" versus fancy words that leave you hopeful for change. Change takes awhile, but we're all adults here; being upfront about the companies merger and positions that allow a site in a different state to apply for before telling the home site can be frustrating"
good,"A typical day at work is coming in, logging into your computer, taking calls and going on short breaks."
good,"Answer 30-60 inbound calls daily, enrolling potential Humana customers through "
good,"Great place to get a start in project management. Can be time consuming, so please be prepared for that. However, great for young professionals."
good,"sitting in the office ear phones in posting payments.  I learned I was good at data entry.  the management was not very informative but nice.  Well divers group of women, not getting bored, over achieving."
good,Team Lead runs the department and is very very rude. They tell you to ask questions and when you do they hold it against you.
good,"Humana is a good stable employer, but there is a great deal of promotion of unqualified associates and little to no accountability."
good,"I worked in the Medicare/Medicaid customer support rep., primarily working with claims and benefits.  Humana's quota was eight calls per hour, which included verifying identity using HIPPA rules, which would take as much as five minutes each.  Each call was required to last seven minutes, no matter what the circumstances were.  This included claims resolutions, and explanation of  benefits, which would be quite time consuming.  These services were provided to members, all types of providers, including doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, durable medical equipment providers, et.al.; many of which had very complex issues.  "
good,it was a mail order pharmacy call center so i answered phones all day filling the members perscriptions and anything else they needed
good,Was expected to explain entire Medicare program after only 3 weeks training.  Constant micromanaging made it impossible to advance.  Management only allowed favorites to move forward.
good,"Job is great, Great workers, A great environment. Amazing computer system to help with the enrollment process. The pay is very good as well since they offer overtime which is double if you work nights and weekends. Their is little bad to ay about this company other than i wish it would be full time and not a contract"
good,"The organization is changing and attempts are aimed at creating a culture of inclusion and diversity. One where fairness is an everyday practice, but it is still just an idea that may of the leadership talk, but are really not about. Many of the old heads with that are nostalgic for the way things used to be, are still hanging around like a bad cold."
good,Typical day at work receiving incoming calls from providers inquires on pended and approved authorizations. Outreach calls to the providers requesting clinical information for review for pre-authorization. Enjoy working with a great group of hard-working people.
good,This position required alot of knowledge in regarding to healthcare policies and benefits . Overall I would say they truly care about there clients from a customer service point of view .
good,"Humana is an amazing company with the best benefits, including 401K I have seen in a long time. Humana thrives on being a Wellness company and wants every employee to be their best mentally and physically while thriving to achieve the success each employee desires."
good,"I spend the day verifying patient information matches with what we have in our records."
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering inbound phone calls, assisting clients with dental insurance information. In my 5 years with the company I have learned the professionalism of perfect customer service and the health and dental field of insurance.  Management has been fine over the years always providing positive feedback to ensure I am conscious of the duties of what the position requires.  The hardest part of my job is maintaining a positive attitude while working with difficult situations in this contact center environment.  The most enjoyable part of my job is having developed a positive relationship with each member of my team, there to assist each other and ensuring each customer/client is satisfied with the customer service provided."
good,"A typical day would consist of reporting to work at my desk and logging into the phone. I would then check voicemail messages that may be clinical review on a member that was hospitalized. From there, you would work on what that member may need for the next step of their care. You had a caseload of anywhere between 5-15 members that you would follow. You would also make calls to the hospitals that your member was admitted to, and receive clinical review. Discharge planning would start from the time they were admitted to the hospital. I was help to coordinate those needs at discharge, whether it be DME, home care etc. I learned a lot about insurance and how to better understand my own insurance policy. The co-workers were wonderful and very helpful in all situations. We worked in teams. Many times the managers were people that were just like us, and may not be appropriate for those positions. The hardest part of the job was being restrained by some of the members policies and not being able to give them what they needed. The most enjoyable part was working with many wonderful people."
good,"i did not like working at this company .. company did not believe that their workers had a life outside of working, and the pay was only 9.00$ per hour with no overtime or holiday pay, i believe the workers did way too much work for such little pay and no understanding of life from the boss"
good,Answering telephone calls pertaining to customers concerns about their billing problem with their insurance policy
good,This was an ok job lot of mandatory over time expected. This job will let you go if you cna not work 3-4 hrs ot a day plus 8 hrs on your day off during the week.
good,Contract sales no leads provided must purchase own marketing tools difficult on small budget.
good,The department I was in didn't give me a chance to advance. 2 years with a lack of growth doesnt work well for me.
good,"As walking into the production floor, all supervisors checking and getting agents on the phone. Agents looking for Headsets, trying to get into the system. Co workers assisting supervisors to get the team in production. As a Verification Specialist i learned to manage time and handle a call while answering the member's questions. When the systems are down we have to find options to be able to assist our members without loosing the call. When the whole production floor stops, for game and prize time."
good,"The salary was a bonus but job security is scarce. They continuous lay off, at any moment you could loose your job one plus is that i received a severance package. The WAH perks are also a plus."
good,"Leadership of the BI team over Pharmacy Workforce Management doesn’t know how to communicate professionally, do their jobs correctly, or offer the human touch necessary to provide service to their stakeholders.  They spend way too much on non-essential travel, which is terrible for the environment, and cannot provide a real ROI on any of their work."
good,"High pressure position requiring outstanding time management and multi-tasking skill set.  During my tenure, the compensation was quite fair, but now sure how it looks at this time."
good,"Started out balanced and clinically focused but ultimately became a Metrics Marathon. Work Life Balance declined. "
good,"Productive however high management turnover and low morale, As an work from home employee, Worked from sun up to sun down.  Enjoyed auditing, however management's high turnover rate made it difficult to work to ones best ability cause they changed the process and them move on."
good,It started out a good company to work for. Very relaxed & they showed they cared but after the Athena merge our jobs felt threatened & we kept seeing people in high position walk out & quit & people on our teams getting fired for no good reason.
good,"9:00AM-5:30PM Monday- Friday"
good,Nothing to say here I worked here for 2 years good pay and benefits poor hours and expectations management has no idea what’s going on and plays favorites
good,"Have good co-worker, were like family. we help out each other with some of the cases. that we get each day. Each case is a puzzle, but we see accomplishment when is resolved."
good,"I was subcontracted by a home health company and did not work directly for Humana. My ratings do not include Humana but the company that hired me. The company that I worked for was subpar to par. I would not give them a good rating. "
good,"No real job security and has layoffs every year. While Humana claims to support a work life balance, the workload prohibits it. Lots of favoritism. Work at home makes some of the negatives less painful."
good,Not organized. Only called through phone to assign clients . No steady work . Did not stay long . Staff was rude . Waste of time . Not enjoyable company .
good,"Leadership micromanaged however the benefits are amazing! There is a lot of team bonding and activities, they encourage togetherness'. There was always food trucks on site."
good,"I learned quite a bit about work and personal life balance. It was a decent company to work for. I had some of the most awesome coworkers and we made sure that we helped each other any way we could. I loved my supervisor and she was super supportive. Unfortunately, my supervisor did not have the power to reduce long work hours."
good,"This was a term position, so you really don't feel apart of the company.  There should be only full time or part not term positions there. I think the company would get better results from employees by not offering term positions."
good,"Making outbound calls daily for about 4 months."
good,"Work at  home micromanaged with assumptions you are not doing your work until they bought a system that tracks every mouse move and it was proven I was doing my job.  I have had 4 positions in 7 years and this last one is great except for the management.  Training is the poorest I have ever experienced. Just got a "
good,"the most difficult part of the job was two-fold: "
good,"Take advantage of every perk. They will only promote who they like. Dont expect any pay raises and if you get a bonus you will be let go soon. Also, keep any negative feedback to yourself"
good,"The best and worst part of the job is, of course, dealing with the Customers. "
good,Would not suggest.  The pay is competitive however there is no room  to breathe.  Manager is not clinically trained an yet supervises clinical staff despite the issue being addressed at a HR level-
good,Tons of tickets with little guidance as to when mistakes are made. Was let go without any warning. Clique type work environment at times playing favorites to those with tenure.
good,Patient visits post hospitalization to analyze their condition and provide any needed education and update any new needs. These visits were contracted out to attempt to minimize rehospitalization.
good,I had a rough supervisor that was not a good fit for the mission and values of Humana.  It was felt that way through the team as well as through other teams in the department
good,"Humana was all about who you knew, how you dressed and your social connections.  They did not value hard work or dedication.  There was very little opportunity for growth and most of the employees when I worked there were very unhappy."
good,Good company but leadership lacks. Very stressful. Would not recommend. I think I would've enjoyed working more if there were more opportunities for growth.
good,They don't shadow which is something I do enjoy an it's very relaxed an laid back. They don't micro mange an having a child they are really understanding about family comes first. That's a huge plus.
good,"If you live geloning people and providing information that may not be known, or meeting people from all walks of life this is the place to work. The only downfall is no advancement in other roles unless you are placed with a leader who is willing to push you to your full potential"
good,"This was a good place to work. However, the pay and the benefits were not sufficient. There was never any room for advancement even though my skill set was appropriate."
good,"It is an enjoyable working experience, I had many opportunities to advance myself and my career which I tried to do consistently in a culture where possible failure is viewed as a learning experience."
good,"Enjoyed working with the members I seen. Did not always agree with how members services were determined based on ""a score"" that someone that had never met this person calculated vs. the Care Manager who was actually seeing the situation first hand."
good,I have enjoyed working for Humana Inc. the past six years. I have worked in several roles but my current role has me on the telephones.  I feel its time to expand to other roles that are not phone related.
good,Lack of control over floor management and poor customer services training. Reps are not equipped with enough knowledge to adequately assist members...
good,"It is difficult to change job tracts"
good,"Humana was a great company to work for.. I unfortunately was a dod contract employee and didn't obtain the same position, but that is one company I gladly go back to working for"
good,"Thankful I got a chance to work as a contract worker for Humana, we really did feel good about assisting the clients and getting them set up with a care manager."
good,"I have the opportunity to develop my customer service skills via phone, while handling details of the members concerns to rectify each situation.  Working with diverse people on the job and on the phone.  I work mainly independently as well working with supervisors to answer questions I my have."
good,"I was hired for seasonal assignment with the possibility of pernament employment. Although, I was not chosen to remain in this position, I would have like too."
good,"La opinión de la encargada de corner se veía influenciada por la amistad que tenia con algunas trabajadoras y no por el trabajo de cada una. No sabía las cosas que tenía que hacer, se veía desmotivada, hacía demasiada preferencia por algunas personas y por último no sabía de los aspectos legales que involucraba su trabajo."
good,"Although I learned a lot from working at Humana, it can be a very negative and exhausting place to work at. There is a lot of mandatory overtime, micromanagement, a lot of the people who have been there for a long time get away with a lot of stuff, and some of the managers are just plain rude. The job itself is very easy, though."
good,"No raise, and I have been there a year and a half. They gave a bonus, but taxed it 50% and called it s raise for the year. They make it almost impossible to advance. The job is extremely stressful, and the shift changes every 3 months."
good,Work with resolving agent's Commissions and Licensing issues.  Provider customer service to agents and assist them with their state licenses and appointments.
good,"I was assigned a manager to oversee Recruitment who had no experience with recruitment or basic knowledge on the obstacles that recruiters face. Instead of focusing on numbers, I dealt with a micro manager who'd look for any reason to write me up. It was a very stressful experience once the original manager in which I reported to left. Fellow colleagues were nice but many had complaints as well."
good,"Great pay, busy schedule if you like staying busy. Lack of communication from management. Usually a contract to hire but no one communicated any info once your time is reached."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers. The employees are hard workers and very dedicated. Some of my best friends are former team-mates of mine!
good,Good company depending on what department you are under. Few career advancement options. Management in DMS is not professional and do not communicate well with their agents.
good,"There are both good and bad aspects of Humana. I would not take it upon myself to either pass judgement on anything I disapproved of, nor would I make the recommendation to those looking to work there. As with any job, I would expect most research of the position should speak for itself."
good,Work from home position was great.  Management needed improvement. Not knowing if your job would be safe was a concern. Enjoyed the work-life balance.
good,"Metrics expectations based on many uncontrollables... Cold calls to engage those insured into services. Data entry programs with continual issues, latency, failure to save work. No room for advancement. No clear pathway for advancement... all depends on who knows who.."
good,"work at home.....fast past, productivity, quality, screened thousand of medicare claims and sent them where it needs to go.  Expedited cases and PDP cases( prescription drug plan) cases sensitive set cases up to send to the next area were the case can be worked and processed."
good,The pay was competitive and Humana offered good benefits. Humana is not a stable company. Humana fired several departments. there was no work balance. You were expected to work at your desk without any relief.
good,"For a call center its not band, however you actually cant have a personal life working here. The pay doesn't match the work they want from you. Depends on the person"
good,Every company has likes and dislikes and pros and cons. Humana is no different!  I am appreciative for the time I was there and the things I learned will prepare me for my next role.
good,"It's a big company that's lost its small time appeal. The Aetna merger fail was a blow to the future vision and affected jobs, yearly Summit meetings, and pay raises. The values they so highly preach are hardly practiced within the organization.."
good,If you like being micromanaged you will like the job. It’s a Call center all the information about the benefits are available online but the benificaries want to Call and get angry about their bills and the policy.
good,"Competitive, very busy, fast paced. Current public knowledge is that Humana is downsizing and trying to get sold, so cutting workforce in general, causing a great deal of work for current employees to complete."
good,"It was the ""how did I get so lucky"" job that turned into stress and multiple RIFs while mgt still got massive bonuses.  My supervisors were awesome.  Loved the many opportunities within ERGs.  Would've stayed if I hadn't been RIFed."
good,"Great benefits, but there was a lack of communication from management and the moral was not good. The managers range from being micro-managers to very relaxed. Humana is constantly changing from week to week and is not a good place to work at if you do not like change."
good,"Currently working at Humana, but notified recently of being included in a work reduction layoff notice.  Hired in August and last day for work scheduled for January 2nd."
good,"When I first started working at Humana I had a caseload of 100 clients. Within 3 years, my caseload was 350 and I had to work more than 12 hours per day to meet the work load and they still expected very high quality of work that was unrealistic. It became very stressful and a lot of people ended up quitting.  I loved the job but the work load was very unrealistic to be completed in a 40 hour work week. All of the health coaches felt very stressed out so it was difficult to talk to our members about stress management!"
good,"This was a work from home position. However, the work environment was very stressful. It was always pressure to ""get your numbers"" no matter how long you had to work."
good,The main perk at this company is having work at home days. No one in NYC uses Humana as an insurance and it is really hard to find a primary care provider who does. There is no job advancement I have seen a lot of people leave because they weren't really moving anywhere.
good,The department I work for has brand new management and everything is changing. I've been here 2 years still have not been offered a raise all I keep getting told is you only get a raise when you transfer depts.
good,"If you chose to work here you will find out soon enough how the dynamic works, .lots of favoritism....no reward or kudos for a job well done. Too much turn over"
good,"If you're looking for a company with career advancement look elsewhere. The medical benefits are so horrible. Regardless if you are single or have a family, you better pray you never get sick. The work-life balance is non existent."
good,"Working at  the Louisville office was terrible for me. The Team I was in had several folks that acted as though they were still in high school. Luckily, I was hired to support the Work at home (WAH) project, so i started working from my home in Winchester. My Manager, myself and a Team member were layed off due to the failed merger with Aetna."
good,Has had a great amount of layoffs. Not much job security unfortunately. Has good pay and benefit. Has good training programs. A great deal of changes recently within Humana at Home organization.
good,i loved working at humana the people are great and the oay is great. i love that they have paid training before you get on the phones . i love that when you have an emergancy they have  no problem trying to help. I was not happy with the benefits not thats good . i did not like that we had such short luches
good,Typical day was putting out employee fires. Learned on my own.  There wasn't a training program nor mentorship. Management was non-existent. Culture was always uneasy and looking over their shoulders. Hardest part of job was winning trust of employees. Most enjoyable part was traveling to locations.
good,The schedule was great. 10 hrs a day/ 4 days a week. You start temp and the pay is great but then you make permanent and your pay goes down. But other than that good place to work.
good,"A typical day is arriving at 8:00 am and attending meetings from 9:00 am until 4:30 pm. Working with my direct reports on distributing projects, project progress and issues, and various needs of the team."
good,"Humana was previously a great place to work but with constant changes it has become a challenging place to work. Recent re-org sent many people with 20 and 30 plus years packing. No loyalty. No seniority."
good,"Office atmosphere was nice and so were co associates, however, the managers were constantly is disaccord.  There were times when associates were pressured into joining or accepting certain politically questionable causes."
good,Work from home is great due to flexibility but it is more than 8hr daily. Total week hours vary between 50-60hrs. Leaders are supportive. They provide equipment but your are responsable for internet cost and office supplies.
good,"This is a very good company to work for if your are looking for a change in your nursing career.  The hours are very flexible, and there is always ongoing education.  In addition, the support system is very strong.  The most enjoyable part about this job is the different people that you will encounter, and how grateful they are when you assistance in any capacity.  The hardest part of the job is the travel."
good,"As Care Coordinator for HAH SNP program, I would provide telephonic case management services. Management showed disorganization and overall low morale.     "
good,its a very great place to gain sales skills.there is room to make alot of money during the holiday seasons and valentines day. Management could be better. the turnover rate is also  very high.
good,"Humana's best qualities were the flexibility to Work At Home and the amount of training offered to Employees."
good,"Management changes constantly and education or updates are not given in a timely manner thus hindering work production. Requested to drive over the limits discussed during hire, and increase in job priorities without notice."
good,"Good place to work the, but the pay and management not so good. Overall, its ok, but for single parents with more than one mouth to feed, its not that good because of the pay."
good,"I had some fun and nice co-workers. but on a typical day everybody would be yelling somebody getting into arguments. The management was terrible. They never know what was going on, he barely knew how to  work our mail machines. The place as a whole wasn't a good place to work."
good,"I perform telephonic phone assessment to Senior Medicare Advantage members.  I provide medication education and partner with members to help them manage their health independently at home."
good,"defined vision, continue to work thru changes due to new healthcare regulations.  Worked with a great team"
good,"Proactive solicitation and reactive response to all targeted  quote activity in 2 to 299 space including all single and multi-lines. I've learned how to build a solid rapport with brokers and agencies in my sales market hierarchy. Developed strong priority and time management skills, while working within a Sales POD (sales team) format. The hardest  part of the job was maintaining/reaching sales goals with an uncompetitive product in my particular sales market. The most enjoyable part of the job was the support and camaraderie amongst coworkers."
good,"very clique enviroment if you don't belong to the group there really is no advancement, it's all in who you know in order to possibly advance within the company"
good,"Yakima is an under represented rural area with little to no resources from Humana, the challenge is to get to most if not all Medicare eligible to provide information regarding their Medicare benefits."
good,I currently work as a Customer Care Specialist for Humana's mail order pharmacy. My responsibilities are to assist customers with refilling their mail order prescriptions and provide order status as well. Inbound calls average from 90 to 120 calls per day. It extremely busy and from my point of view very unorganized and extremely micro mananged
good,"A nice environment to work as far as what the dress code and location, very friendly people to work with. Learned the backside of the insurance business. the leads pretended to be helpful but once we were out of training they made you strive for yourself. Stressful at times with the loads of information you had to obtain."
good,"Office environment is very unprofessional and management is not engaged.  In addition, management spends too much time on conference calls and out of the office.  The best part of working in the office are my co-workers, we are very supportive and encouraging of each other.  Another, plus is the pay is good and it's an easy commute."
good,"My review of this company is not good."
good,"Bonuses were given to people who produced eight calls per hour, no matter what they had to do.  Most people did cheat, in order to get the $600.00 per month bonus, hoping they would not get caught, which was grounds for dismissal, but few got caught."
good,"Typical day at work:   Data Entry- Verifying and processing patient information for Humana/RightSourceRX members to fulfill patients"
good,assisting customers make healthcare insurance choices based on needs analysis.
good,Typical day was traveling around North Dakota assisting all clinics and hospitals with any needs they may have.  I had great co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was traveling in the winter.
good,You are set up to fail watch out if you work here. many people get pushed out the door and treated unfairly by the lazy management taking 2 hour lunches almost daily and not treating their employees like people
good,"Humana offers the ability for employees to work from the comfort of their own home which is very nice.  However, their focus is too much on quantity of work rather than the quality of it. The work itself is not difficult, but the lack of communication between management with their employees makes staying up to date on all new policies difficult. Also, the atmosphere is usually one of high stress due to the sometimes unreasonable work demand."
good,"Humana talks a big game with regards to salary and benefits.  Unless you are actively recruited through their collage recruiting/internship programs, you will be grossly underpaid.  And their medical benefits are terrible (HDHPs with deductibles on the higher end of what is legal). Dental and vision are pretty good."
good,"Walmart employee's I worked with in the pharmacy are always uplifting and great people, smiling, making you laugh and good work ethics even with the hard fast pace of retail pharmacy. company during my 9 years was changing greatly from the sam Walton view of customers first to the feel of large company, do this per policy no matter what and that didn't feel right to me any more."
good,"Humana Insurance is a well respected company with hands on clientele who value the overall perfect customer experience. A typical day at work entails answering questions regarding a current and or prospective Member and the status of their account. It was our job to be the ""fixer."" Meaning that you were never prepared for the question that you could possibly be asked other than what you were taught within the program. No matter the task it is your job to fix it, and when you do in some small way there is a sense of accomplishment because you overcome an obstacle each time a call ends. The hardest part of the job is simply when you cannot be of assistance. When there is nothing that you can do to help a member and sometimes the situation can be critical. Yes on the outside it may seem simple just dealing with claims and billing and even to the point of enrollment but in actuality you are dealing with people's lives. If they are not able to access their healthcare then it is your job to figure out why there is an issue, what is the issue and how can it be resolved."
good,"My current role is as an Operations Supervisor Managing an Inbound team of twelve agents while simultaneously providing floor support for agents under five additional supervisors in our campaign. I am responsible for directly training and developing agents via side by side, behavioral coachings, and QA coachings via development sessions. Additional duties include: supervisor escalations and callbacks, candidate interviews, monitoring and tracking adherence for all Inbound agents via RTA (Real Time Adherence) and Five9, submitting service and trouble tickets for agent issues, and being available as a resource as needed in any capacity. It is also my responsibility to communicate changes in policy, scripting, site updates, and QA changes effectively and efficiently, not only to my team, but to all Inbound agents I support. "
good,Great Company to work for as far as benefits and work/life balance. Just too much corporate bs to really get anything done.
good,Typical work day at Concentra was unorganized and stressful at times. There are people in positions that clearly shouldnt be
good,upper management has not successfully trickled down their ideals to lower management..
good,"Position as an Underwriter was exciting and challenging.  Due to position being new at times, organizational objectives and management were not alligned.  Great coworkers & work environment"
good,"Assessed 200 member rosters telephonically from my home, of Medicare and Commercial and Group Account members in 7 domains of functioning; evaluate needs and requirements to achieve and/or maintain optimal wellness state. Guided mbrs and their families toward and facilitated interaction with resources appropriated for the care and wellbeing of mbrs in collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team, employing a variety of strategies, approaches and techniques to manage physical, environmental and psycho-social health issues, using HEDIS and aligned activities with STAR initiatives"
good,"I really enjoy the work that I do at Humana. We are helping others, and I enjoy doing that."
good,"Humana offers an excellent training program to new employee. During the annual enrollment period, the monetary compensation on commission can be very rewarding. As for advancement within the company I would say the chances are very slim for most employee,in the 9yrs that I was employed with Humana they prefer to hire from the outside then to advance their employee. What I learned in this job was organization and time management skills which gave me the ability to always meet or exceeded my goals. The most enjoyable part of my job was that you were helping people to fine the best health care that was suitable for them and to hear them say they were grateful that they found a person to explain the plans in a clear manner. I worked with a great team and a good manager but unfortunately most of them left the company. Their was never any part of my job that I did not enjoy, but I never felt in the work environment job security."
good,"Orientation was 3 separate trips to Louisville, KY to learn the basics of the software system used by company. Mentoring was sporatic, as the associates assigned to teach had multilple facilities of their own to manage. The mentors had different ways of doing their job throughout an 8 hour day and learning was not condusive. Co-workers were great people and all had a lot of experience from different medical fields to share. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to a different working environment from having worked in the field for 10 years."
good,Very laid back but the managers were about numbers only and NOT THE EMPLOYEES. With this company it's all about who you know.
good,Humana employs long-term employees with minimal exposure to innovation. New ideas were frowned upon.
good,More management guidance and help is needed to provide better insight into operations. Too much territoriality across the spectrum of the business. Rapid growth covers up a lot of these shortcomings.
good,No room for advancement. Friendly coworkers great working hours just no room for advancement unless I move to another state.
good,"Don't want to waste anyone's time so I will do my best to keep this as short as possible. If time permits, which it usually does not, I will give a good review. Humana is ok."
good,"Great work from home opportunity; however, every key stroke is monitored and they virtually watch you during the day.  They are inside your computer and can tell exactly which screen you are viewing.  Don't take time to understand if there is computer issues or workarounds."
good,"Training was great for this job, they spent enough time reviewing and refreshing all information. By the time I was on my own, I was pretty confident in my work. However, once the pace picked up, there was no time to spend on anything but incoming calls. I barely felt like I had the time to use the bathroom without feeling pressured due to calls on hold. Additionally, all calls have a script, and you have to hit every point on the script. If you cant handle being micromanaged, this job is not for you."
good,"can be a Conducive work environment, great benefits and job security. The location is a plus awesome retirement package. Management can be on a power trip"
good,"Would not recommend to anyone.,it was OK overall just treat like you are a child and doesn’t really seem to have higher positions available, overall not too bad"
good,They were an overall good company that brought plenty of opportunities to each employee. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a decent job to apply themselves.
good,There are plenty of opportunities to expand your knowledge in the learning center. You can also find a clear path of growing yourself in the job shadowing program
good,"Not a bad job for a tech? Just don't work too hard, won't get you anywhere. If you're friends with mgmt you'll be promoted in no time. Little opportunity for promotion."
good,"Is a nice place to work for compensation. The rules are strict,  and they don't really consider family life,  even though it's an insurance company. The hours are long, and you get a thirty minute lunch break."
good,"I was a work at home employee and conditions were favorable to me, benefits were excellent and compensation was good, the culture and values are those i live by but they are only spoken of, not enforced or honored.  The best part of my job was serving our members and ensuring that they had the perfect experience with every call and or visit, and obtained all the resources available to facilitate long life wellbeing. "
good,"I learn management and supervisor responsibilities. I learn referral and insurance authorization, & strengthen my customer service skills. I helped patients with there appointments."
good,I enjoyed working and helping my patients. I also enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers. I feel that based on my management and leadership  experience I could have been paid more.
good,It was a great place to begin working at since it provided lots you a lot of freedom on how to solve problems. This meant I got to learn a lot during work which I really liked.
good,Forced OT..no advancement. Training was in depth but when you are on the floor you are held accountable for things. Performance is based on customer surveys who grade low before you had a chance provide customer service.
good,"This place has the highest turn over rate I have ever seen. The rules are unclear, there is no HR. Everyone starts on a contract through an agency then after 480hrs your able to apply for a position with Humana. I had 20 people in my training class within two months it’s only five of us left. Mainly do to being fired or new opportunities. This is a good place if you’re in between jobs. Weekly pay at $14 per hour. What’s most stressful Is that they fire you for anything. Such as being late 1min pass your break, being tardy 1 minute pass your clock in time ..taking too long to hang up the phone in between calls. Really petty things. However they do do NOT fire you for not hav wing high bookings. Oh and if you try to put your two weeks notice in they’ll fire you for that too. Everyday your on edge not knowing if it’s you that’s going to be fired or not."
good,"If you like to work in a call center it is ideal, lots of overtime and opportunities to work from home. That said not a very good work life balance. Long days, Very Strict rules to follow."
good,It's a good place to work and good pay. PTO and 401 is great. If anything breaks down management panics and overtime is mandatory. People here are in there own little groups and not to friendly.
good,A good company with a good goal of having a strong work/life balance. But unfortunately that culture was not adopoted in my department. We were micromanaged and scrutinized to the Nth degree. This pushed many great nurses away.
good,"Working there was great manager not so much. There was a lot of miscommunication between lower level and higher ups. Continually changing daily which wasn't a problem, but if your not told then it is."
good,"I worked for Humana for almost 8 years. Within that time, I used tuition reimbursement to finish my bachelor's degree and get my master's degree. Management could be a bit difficult with a few micro managers but there are some incredible managers there too. You've honestly got to create your own career path because the pay won't do it. They pay under industry standards. You will have to negotiate for any sort of pay increase"
good,A typical work day with Humana is pretty calming. The environment is very productive. I have learned how to come through confident on the phone along with placing orders for medication using the various systems.
good,They told all of us that we would have a chance at applying for full time position but when that time came there was only 3-5 positions available for a whole department.
good,"pros: good money to make, good health benefits if your permanent."
good,"Poor review process, poor summery of work mistakes.  Dept leaders were extremely disconnected, they always talked about transparency and the ability to come to them with any problems or suggestions but everyone was afraid to speak up for fear they would be let go."
good,"i enjoy my time here. great atmosphere, but if you are not ready for an extremely regimented and a call center this is not the job for you. "
good,There was no work life balance with this employer. Working from home and visiting 2 hospitals every day didn't leave time for family. It has been too long and was such a short tenure that I don't remember much else.
good,"As a remote employee, Humana is a good opportunity for someone in a residential area with an internet service that will support Humana's equipment.  Frontier, decided to change settings and no longer support Humana's Aruba device.  The only other internet option for me is a wireless service which Humana does not allow.  Very disappointed in this as I am a single mom who depended on this income."
good,"I worked here for 6 years and was very productive, hard working and open to learning new things."
good,It's very hard to move up in the company. The most you can make are lateral moves unless you personally know the hiring manager. Unfair treatment of employees. The company does a lot of outsourcing overseas.
good,"Overall good place to work.  Been there 15 years until I lost my jobs to outsourcing in the Philippines.  New management was more concerned about the cost of providing tech support then providing quality support based in the US.  "
good,"Humana was my client and I was working with the vendor company for Humana."
good,"The programs were easy to navigate, the que was very steady. FAce paced position that was very repetitive. Management was hit or miss, some members are extremely attentive while others are unapproachable."
good,No comment.  Prefer not to respond at this time.  Humana can be the best place and the not so best place to work.  Organizational changes dictate overall job satisfaction.
good,"Working on the Humana Military sector is very fast, stressful, and the company hemorrhages employees in that sector. Mandatory overtime makes for very little time for your personal life and i have seen many people leave due to that alone."
good,Growing company with not enough employees to cover incoming work. Overtime is mandatory and this year has lasted over 8 months compared to the 2 months it should've been. CPhT should be paid more for the work they do.
good,Overall Humana was a good company. They did a good job of making sure that I was ready and knew the information but the leadership is only there to try and move up in the company and not focused on helping the workers
good,"A typical day at Humana usually begins with you having to work mandatory OT 1hr before and or 1hr after your scheduled shift. There are usually changes daily to work process and or procedures requiring you to review Mentor for all updates and revision while handling calls. This requires you to be able to navigate the system swiftly, effectively and accurately to assist a member and to possibly avoid call escalation. If a call reach the point of escalation you then have to find a member of management that's willing to take the call in the event that you are unable to reduce the intensity of that call."
good,I  received severance package after 19 years of service due to my sonority.  Would not recommend Humana as they are very unorganized and work their employee to the bone without compensation.
good,"Although at times it is hard to navigate to the correct tool Humana does provide ample tools for employees to thrive. Communication isn't a strong suit. Each department has leveled up leaders that guide you when you struggle, it can come across awkward or that you are an annoyance to the leader that either emails you or comes to work one on one with you. Performance standards are a known must, how can any company thrive without set expectations on any team member, and plenty of time upon hiring is given once you have met the ""ramp up' period, if you don't meet the levels expected then fear is pressured on you that at the end of the month you may need to prepare to pack your cubical. It isn't hard to meet expectations, but with that said, meeting a set expectation fearing your stability in the position you hold does cause a ton of pressure. That alone gets into your head and fogs your mind for performing."
good,To many webex meetings and not enough face to face discussions. Difficult working with different groups of IT that are spread in many locations and time zones.
good,Is stressful due to unfairness of management and unwillingness for employee input. Benefits are much to be desired. Morale is low. Management needs to allow more employee input. There is too much partiality and favoritism.
good,In the process of transition from paper to electronic filing caused a few problems that management handled. No longer needed the larger staff and consolidated their workforce.
good,"Large employer in Brown County, WI. Many employees work from home. Many web-based meetings. Many contracted offshore employees. Headquarters in Louisville, KY."
good,Productive place.  It’s a nice place to work with nice pay. Requires a lot of overtime for the position I was in. Received benefits and paid time off. Receives bonus for production.
good,"A typical day at work would be, constant inbound calls to help as many members as we can. Moderate atmosphere moral, Low supervision, mostly working on your own. Clean surroundings and our building is well maintained. I've learned alot about drug prescriptions and taking care of .the members needs when it comes to their drug health.We monitor accounts and take payments and fill orders for their medication.The hardest part of the job is when we are unable to fill an order do to their mistake or their mdo not responding in a timely manner, the medications are too expensive or they did not call in before running out. The most enjoyable part is totally helping the member in every way possible and making sure we complete the call with all their needs are met concerning their prescription health and wellness, sometimes just listening to them talk is always so rewarding and the best part, because you hear them smile through the phone and appreciate your help/"
good,"Initially working for Humana seemed to be the most pleasant place to be. I met some of the most awesome people in the world there. However, the work life balance was most definitely not a part of the culture.  There was indeed a lack of professionalism and council in the management was null and void.  The true colors of the internal working were seen."
good,"Poor managment, metrics, constant meetings regarding phone calls and number required. Management does not encourage growing. Unstable and poor.recruiters"
good,if u dont sell anything they will fire you i really liked the fact that they will hire you on and pay for your Lic and certs its not a bad gig just got a shadow trolling ur everymove
good,"While I consider the company big enough that allows individuals to learn many different skills and try varied projects, it wasn't the company for me because results were valued more than people."
good,"It's a great corporation with flaws at mid level management that prevents regular employees to advance their career and, foremost, prevents better outcome for company's performance and goals."
good,It was ok but there are better jobs that will respect you. This just wasn't it for me. I know people that love the job but to me the manager was what made me dislike and leave the job..
good,Job was continuously under threat of being eliminated and downsized.  No job security and huge workforce reduction acts were implemented with no warning.
good,"Humana has been providing a positive WAH experience.  However, there has been many rounds of layoffs lately and more to come.  The culture is very unhealthy with management changing often and not for the better."
good,"Only complaints I have is not enough opportunities to advance and yearly raises are not good. started out at 15 per hour 4 years ago and with the new tax bill, Humana has raised minimum wage to 15 per hour.  4 years later I now make 15.92 just above minimum wage."
good,Job was overwhelming. No work life balance. Based on quantity not quality. Too much aggravation for type of job. Difficult meeting metrics that were ever changing.
good,"I held a position as a personal health coach. It was a work from home full-time position. The first year and a half was amazing. However, the company made some changes and the culture of Humana and the work from home experience suffered in the process. The job became very stress and numbers orientated. It no longer focused on the patient and their needs but on the number of patients we called within an 8 hour time frame. Some of the managers were unprofessional and rude if you didn't meet your quota for the day."
good,Great benefits 401k health insurance dental insurance vision insurance life insurance. I have nothing else to say. Everyone has their own experience.thanks
good,"was seasonal work laysoff came without proper notification, parking is a joke you have to park four blocks away and wait for a trolley to come and pick you up"
good,"Humana is not like most company. I liked working for Humana, but most managers sucked. They tried to secure their job by criticizing others."
good,"No benefits but the mandatory overtime was good."
good,"Nothing bad to say  other than lack of training, and management turnover.   Love working from home and my weekly schedule.       Pay was above  average."
good,"As a temp you are in the office more than you will be retrieving records off-site.  No progress reports from management.  Job performance appears to only rely on numbers, so you never really know if you are getting too much or too little."
good,Stressful work environment with the failed merger and continued cut-backs.  This is still a great company - just wish things would settle down so people could concentrate on doing a great job for customers.
good,"A typical day at Humana can be very intense. I am dealing with customer account and life or death when it comes to benefit insurance information. Education the customer to the fullest, advise what is beneficial and recommended."
good,Although work is stressful in my department the daily activities they do for the elderly make it a bit enjoyable to go to work. I was hired as a part timer with full time hours but honestly feel that no one in management knows what they are doing. Constantly getting tossed around that will be a full time employee but NOTHING!
good,they wanted me to sell the product that was government susidized but it was not good product i sold a different product that was better suited to the clients
good,The pay way okay but could have been better. I was not a fan of the mandatory overtime it was 12 hour days Monday-Friday for 3 months. Yes the pay checks were good after that but with having a small child it wasn’t worth it.
good,Typical day at Humana was a heavy workload and the learning experience was busy.  The workplace culture was diverse.  The hardest part of my job at Humana was the busy commute in NYC and the most enjoyable was working with a great team of co-workers.
good,"Good place to work, but, it completely depends on the area you are in.  Some are great, others, not so much.  There is decent opportunity for advancement, but sometimes it might be more about how you play the corporate game."
good,"Advancement opportunities are few and far in between!  I received a very small salary increase after 3 years without any type of increase.  Management hazes employees and creates a lot of what they call ""healthy tension"""
good,"WAH is nice; however, there is no flexibility for a salaried position. Every move is monitored, lots of extra hours worked without and flex time. Now adding in weekends and holidays. All about quantity, not quality which impacts the members. There are people who audit the auditors who audit those auditors etc etc.  In other words, lots of chiefs. The company has an excellent appearance and package that is presented, however it is not reality. I enjoy the work, but not the culture. Most insurance companies have a bonus structure, they do not. No pay partial benefits, i.e. increase in pay if you don't elect to use any company sponsored benefits."
good,answered phones and help members reorder meds and answered questions I was able to with in pharmacy guidelines. helped members with info on new insurance guidelines
good,Steady pace workload while multitasking your work. Coworkers make the day go better while completing your job. Many different locations to work from as well as working from home.
good,"The company itself, or at least the area in which I was employed served those who served, were serving, and its dependents. That alone was a great factor. Management was poor, and lacked not only management skills, but the emotional intelligence that management should possess."
good,"I love Humana, and it's a great company to work for with some amazing benefits.  Some departments really focus on work/life balance and helping their employees succeed.  Unfortunately the department I was in was not that way at all, we had required 20-30 hours of overtime each week for almost 2 years straight.  They were also not helpful in career advancement. I would have loved to stay with Humana but the constant holding me back from deserved promotions forced me to look for employment outside of the company and eventually leave."
good,Humana has been a blessing to me and my family. I love my job and love my job duties. I've worked for Humana for almost 13 yrs. I also love working for this company because they promote growth and well-being.
good,Would not recommend to anyone unless they absolute need a job now. Do not look for advancement here. Employees are seen as ignorant/replaceable. Favoritism runs RAMPANT here
good,"Busy call center and high stress level, limited time off and hard to secure time off.  Company going thru many changes and layoffs.  Downsizing as losing all commercial business and focusing on medicare"
good,Unhappy with job security. I got sick and because the third party vendor did not approve necessary time off I am now unemployed. I would figure they would be more understanding of my condition being that they ARE A HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY.
good,If you like to help the elderly this is the job for you. However you do not have support from management. You will have to drive long distances and use yor phone at the sametime.
good,"I worked in the mail order pharmacy section of this company. Although the PIC of the facility was amazing, the culture of the entire pharmacy was lacking as a whole."
good,"Worked her after applying for several years and finally got hired on just to have a snake of a manager who didn't want to really work or fix problems set me up and I was let go. Management has way too much power if you get a good supervisor you are well on your way but if not, you can forget it."
good,"Working from home has advantages such as saving money on gas, clothes and food. The difficult part that I've experienced is the feeling of isolation."
good,"other then fun environment. much more stress now since alot of changes has been done."
good,"My experience with Humana was great in the beginning but the Supervisors there can really ruin your experience there. You can be the best rep on their team, get top performer for several months and they still wont allow you to move to other internal depts. There's also no work/ life balance as its really hard to get approved days off"
good,"Poor work/home life balance.  Difficult to advance in company. Number driven. Management not supportive.  Virtual environment, no face to face contact with other employees.  Member needs outweigh the scope of the program."
good,"This is a good place to start your professional life. There are alot of people that are very helpful.  The issue if forward advancement.  In my department roughly 80% of the people that are hired either quite, or get laid off.  This creates uncertainty, and also a culture where education and hard work usually go unrecognized."
good,The people were very nice and always helpful.  I learned something different every day. It was a pleasure working with Humana the time I did. The staff were fun and genially cared about their co-workers and the customers.
good,Very high stress workplace. Inbound calls in queue constantly. Short call times required. Must meet goals given by management. They try to promote a healthy workplace.
good,My experience was not that good compared to others. LifeSynch was an subsidiary of Humana. The micro management and lack of growth made it very hard to stay with this company.
good,"I loved the work and most poeple their. This was the first company that had so many family members in the same department. It was brought to their attention that the apperance of favorism was there."
good,"Any job is pays you is something to be thankful for. When it comes to Humana, that's about as much as I can say on the positive end. It was almost a month before I have a conversation with my supervisor and she sat 2 desk away from me. I would say I, and attempt to engage but had no luck. I had to respect her space so we did not speak much."
good,"Overall a very nice place to work, but the training of new employees on the basics of the Insurance industry relating to your position need to be improved."
good,"unpredictable, insecure ..i didn't like it there. no job security and too much work pressure. My manager was very rude and arrogant."
good,"Management is not very good, there has been a lot of turnaround in the last year. It is not as fun as it used to be. we used to go to events for Christmas and in the summer but was cut out due to the merger"
good,. The job was a tiered job all new hires were supposed to start on the phones some new hires that were hired by the frontline leaders were their outside friends that never had to start out on the phones. Their was a lot of favoritism when you got on a frontline leaders bad side people were humiliated and manipulated. The stress level was very high and caused some to cry almost everyday one girl blacked out and had to be sent out to the hospital then another time the same girl had a seizure and had to be taken out to the hospital. She was not allowed to return to her job.
good,"The job was very fast paced, which I enjoyed staying busy,  I learned a lot about health insurance, Medicare, state refualtions and mandates.  I learned about how claims are paid and provider contracts.  You spend a lot of time there,  There's a lot of work to be done, If feels like your second home,"
good,The management was horrible and never checked on its team but my job was fabulous. They encourage good health and often have different activities for the employees.
good,"In MIT depart which required production work & phone. Most of the phone representatives were on the phones mostly and were given the proper opportunity to increase their production numbers, except during overtime hours, when they came to work early or stayed late. Very rarely were they asked to get off the phone and work fax production and try to meet their numbers by the end of the month. Also if an employee was out on leave, there was never any up-training, they just had to continue with the knowledge they left with, all except for a few print outs given upon returning, which at times could be confusing."
good,"It is usually not the company thats bad, it is the people that's in charge of the company.  Stay clear of the behavioral health Division...run  "
good,"job security is based on revenue and departments are  operating in very segregated silos. My department was very laid back and the dress code was lenient most of the time. "
good,I learned an enormous amount of information about insurance processing of claims. I was responsible for reviewing data and providing reports on various claims.
good,"Pros:"
good,My job is'nt the worse but its not the best.. I just want to work in a company where am appreciated because im a very hard worker
good,"The money is great. You will work OT. People are very judgmental. They want you to stay at your desk and remain silent, like kindergartens."
good,I do not care to talk about this company in any fashion. Please except these words as my submission. Thank You for your attention to this statement.
good,"Learned quite a few skills sets such as B&E, Claims, Group Medicare.  Most difficult part is multitasking and working at a fast past while confined to your desk."
good,Unrealistic expectations. Unsupportive management and all about the numbers. Did have great opportunities for growth and development.
good,Not a lot of room for advancement.  Plenty of training opportunity.It can definitely educate you on health insurance and how physicians are paid.  You learn the ins and outs of medical billing and claims.
good,"Very productive and fast work pace,to beginning of the shift we retrieved the drugs from different locations to bulk them into containers for automated dispensing in work team, the hardest par of the job was to carry a heavy boxes, and the most enjoyable part of the job was fast pace and 20 minutes breakes."
good,"Need to clean out some of tenured management who can't get beyond""that's how it's been done.""  New people new ideas happy employees. The nasty management style does not promote positive work environment nor will it keep good employees motivated!"
good,"I liked this job.  I love helping people and this is particularly one of my forte's as I have a long case management career in customer service before getting into healthcare insurance telesales. This job was not directly with Humana. It was an FMO or outsourcing company.  We had 20 plus companies we represented with Humana being the biggest.  Like all other  primarily medicare tele-agent companies, it was just temporary work during AEP ( Annual Open Enrollment) For medicare.  The people were very friendly and the supervisor's very helpful and professional. The longevity is the key complaint i have.  I started on the floor with no computer platform training related to the 20 plus companies we represented.  The way we tracked our prospective customer call backs was cumbersome and difficult to use.  I started knowing nothing but product knowledge on an unfamiliar computer system on the first day of open enrollment for medicare!  I was just beginning to make my learning curve when AEP concluded.  They hire agents in mass in anticipation of this 6 week period each year.  Usually only the longtime employees that have worked there many years are kept.  The went from 2 different shifts (every other day) of around 60 agents (120 total) down to 25 total agents after AEP was over."
good,Humana is very costumer/ member friendly. they work together and we try our hardest to solve any issues that our insurance members have.
good,The job was basically just a job without any professionalism or integrity of patients rights and privacy. I was great meeting new fellow co-workers and passing the work hours with them.
good,"I worked in the Clinical Intake Department, it horribly mismanaged. There was an incompetent director and she hired and promoted unqualified employees to insure her own job security. The process manager nearly lost her nursing license due to narcotics issues and the frontline leader could barely write a sentence. Overall, it was a hostile work environment for me and the company actually feared litigation upon my resignation. However, the other departments did not have any of those problem. Many of my coworkers were leaving the department, those with seniority were transferring and other left the company."
good,"Management is really unorganized, and even though I do well for myself at work, I can sense favoritism within the workplace between the Operations Manager and other agents"
good,helping agents on the phones manage accounts and guiding thm to find the correct information for the customer.
good,"The people with whom I worked were overall very hard working and tried to do their best.  I met and worked with many folks for whom I have the deepest respect for their work ethic and their integrity."
good,Ok company to start in pharmacy/health insurance but will probably have to move on due to no/slow advancement opportunities.
good,I learned about medicare and how to process the applications. Did not care too much for the a lot of the co-workers due to they were just manipulative I respected them as my co-workers and spoke to them but not on a personal level. Hardest part of my job was when the supervisor and team lead did not the work we were assigned therefor leaving stuck in dark when we needed questioned answered. The best part was when we did get together as a team and had lunch or played games to get to know each other better.
good,"The department that I was in HCPR is still finding its way. The department is understaffed and over worked. Seasonal employees are hired, but not enough to man the forecasted work."
good,a typical day was that of fear of job security.  We had strict sales quotas and there was always the threat of the whole unit being closed.  This eventually happened in October 2012.
good,"Good company but you are a little fish in a big ocean   Very professional - be prepared to use ""corporate"" language."
good,"Love working for the company. There are great benefits and room to move around within Humana. Management in CIT is poor, they can do better!"
good,"Processed Medicare Enrollment Applications,Communicated with Dr's offices."
good,"My day was fast pace and consent.  There were new policies and updates daily.  The management was focused on the bottom line and not level or moral amongst the employees.  My co workers are hard workers, team players. The hardest part of the job is not being able to service a member with limited tools.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having a member totally satisfied with the service."
good,A typical day at work really just depended on the days workload. The co-workers made the day that much more enjoyable. There was no hard part to the job.
good,It long and a lot of busy work.  I been here for 6.5 years and have not been able to move up in my role. They usually promote nurses.
good,"I enjoyed working for Humana, I learned a lot of new skills. I'm glad I never lost my position due to outsourcing. It was very scary to know that a major healthcare insurance company would outsource overseas."
good,"Typical of management, they made decisions that turned out to be wrong, downsized a whole department just to realize they screwed up and rehired all the positions sent offshore. I had great coworkers and the job was interesting enough. Just can't get past stupid decisions like outsourcing."
good,"What I learned:"
good,enjoyable work environment. Ordered supplies. Some data entry for the files.
good,"The hardest part of the job is: While the mother company has a longevity of caring for people, the management seems to be mismatched with each other, and pulls in opposition to each other.Co-workers are very hard working and caring individuals, in a word, enjoyable. A typical day at work is full of tasks that eventually work for the best of my patient load."
good,The most enjoyable thing about the job is we are helping people with there insuranrce and also the pharmacy in claims.
good,"A typical day at Humana, starts with customers calling regarding ordering their medication for 30-90 days orders. Answering any questions they may have regarding their order. I have learned so much about the process for ordering and names of medicines. As a hold management is sensitive to the needs of the staff. Co- workers are very helpful. Hardest part of the job are unhappy clients. I enjoy being able to help and solve clients problems"
good,"Ok compensation, ok benefits, management is incompetent."
good,This is not the job I thought it would be! Coworkers are great! Management is not the best and there's no where for advancement in the company - can hardly get a raise!
good,"I would handle members inquiries about, billing issues, unidentified charges, and any and all service questions,working with management and co-workers ,to provide the member with a memorable experience.the hardest part about this job was not to be able to preform the task at hand, the most enjoyable part about this job ,is when everyone is satisfied and I've done what needed to be done in a timely manner.."
good,I liked the work there was too much going on in my department between management and employees.
good,Management put to much pressure for sales of products and members became angry with 10 to 15 phone calls from Humana daily. My supervisor was located in another state and their was not guidance for the potion.
good,Felt like I was a salesperson more than a nurse. Was micromanaged with our time. Every minute had to be accounted for. I never liked having someone watch every minute of my day monitored. I am a professional and know how to do my job and get it done.
good,"Management focuses more on results than training and retaining. It's been my experience of little assistance. For an entry level position, I'd expect more guidance."
good,"En typiskt dag var, väcka personen, hjälpa till med alla hygienrutiner, laga mat och mata, spela spel, städa, ge medicin... "
good,"Liked the work and pay "
good,"Pays good, No Job security, Bad Training, Needs more work on how to actually do the job compared to learning terminology. "
good,"I feel that I am micro-managed 8 hours a day / 5 days a week. I am told when to take break, lunches, and practically restroom time. I went thru training but it was seemed like did not learn much in a short period of time for the volume of information that was given to me. I try to get help from supervisor or leads it just brushed a side a lot of times. Good, thing about working here is the other people, whom i work with."
good,"The company went through changes causing the flexibility of work life balance to go away.  It was not a fully remote position.  When that left, I left"
good,The culture of Humana is business oriented and focused on  making money but EAP is about helping people and there was a continuous tension between company profit and trying to serve customers.
good,"It is a great company with lots of perks and great people.  However, after two reductions in work force in just 1 year and the behavioral health department being torn apart, it was very disheartening."
good,"This place all in all is a good place to work and would be better if people were open to truly being innovative and working with one another, it seems that people break into groups and that tension in a small workplace makes it somewhat uncomfortable."
good,"Great Place to work ! the office employees , nurses , and schedulers were friendly  to work with patients were sweet to work with on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with patients everyday and seeing them smile"
good,There are benefits to here but the moral has changed in the last couple of years. Lots of changes with upper management they ultimately effects the little people.
good,"No work life balance, and they make it difficult to take time off. Once you get in the company the it's difficult to get promoted and move to other departments."
good,"What I liked best about Humana was the ability to work remotely as necessary.  What I didn't like was the secrecy and lack of sharing of company information by upper management.  Some info. was shared during town halls, etc., but not the important stuff.  One of the hardest things was focusing on getting work done while conversations and phone calls were going on all around due to crowded and cramped office space."
good,There are opportunities to work from home and available gym for employees. One of the issues is that there is not a good agile environment. There is a PMO group that hinders the Agile model.
good,"A job is a job but privatized healthcare is a pyre of evil, and you don't even get good health benefits while advancing their debilitating rhetoric. Avoid if able."
good,"This used to be a wonderful place to work, but recent policy changes and treatment of employees now shows they are just a number and not respected. It has changed from a self empowered staff to one that is micromanaged and stressed"
good,"some departments are better than others, lots of different opportunities, great facilities, lots of knowledge about insurance to be obtained, great people."
good,"The team was awesome. Hardest part of the job is ""helping"" members with all their issues. Humana has a lot of work to do on the conversations between the customer service agents and pharmacy technicians."
good,"Good Company over all. The hardest part of the job is not having HR onsite. I had 5 plus years in Humana, started from bottom to the top, with expectional leaders."
good,Humana is a very diverse company to work for. They offer a lot of great incentives. It can be stressful at times because the company changes so much internally. They can be really flexible with the hours but I have noticed that its changing in some areas.
good,"Working for Humana, I believe you get adequate training for the role that you're going to take on. As a consultative pharmacy technician, you get about a month of training on the 10 systems that you'll be using. Even though there are an excessive amount of systems that you need to learn, most of them are pretty simple when you get out on the floor and use them. My managers were understanding, but I lucked out; there is a 50% chance you could get a lousy one. The insurance could have been a whole lot better, but it's not terrible. The company tries to do things to motivate their employees, but the nature of the job and the excessive amount of hours you have to work pretty much guarantees you will be burned out at some point. If you enjoy working at a call center for 8 to 12 hours a day, having rude customers belittle you at every chance they can get, having me occasional nice customer praise you, and following strict protocols and metrics, this is the place for you. I worked here for a short time and found out that a call center type environment where I sit more than 8 hours a day and then required to work Saturdays is not the place for me oh, so I left."
good,"I have not been here long enough to give a strong evaluation of what I think of the company. I have no real complaints, I was told I could have a prescheduled vacation ( 8 months from the hired date) and once I received the job I was not granted the time off.  New hires cant get the time off because the time is already taken up."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Humana.  I believe they treated you fair if you followed through and did your work.  Throughout my tenure I gained a lot of experience that I was able to utilize with each promotion.  "
good,"If you're new to health insurance and would like to get into selling Medicare and make a good salary with commission, Humana would be a good option. They have extensive training and help you to succeed with sales workshops, coaching, and peer mentors. It's a great stepping stone."
good,"Humana is putting effort into becoming an Agile development workforce.  They are getting mixed results with their Scrum implementations, but they are working hard to get there."
good,The company made it very easy to work around your family and family life. They were very attune to health and staying health. They had a wonderful benefits packages for having healthy stats or trying to get healthy.
good,The layoff was brutal. It was ok before our position was eliminated. We were told that our position was secure and were laid off despite the promise of job security.
good,It was a good position we handled calls from Medicare patients. The environment was not the best at times. there were lots of favoritism shown especially with upper management
good,"No meaningful focus on holding leadership accountable for developing, coaching, or guiding the staff reporting up through the chain of command.  Team building concepts not integrated into daily work life."
good,working for Humana is not what I expected you were overworked and underpaid. the workload was always a lot and the phones was another thing. the management show no appreciation
good,"When things are good, they are really good. Loved working there. A bad manager can ruin all of that. It became stressful because of lack of leadership and the confrontational attitude the manager had with her employees. There was no trust. She made up things to suit her side of a discussion. With good leadership Humana is a great place to work."
good,"Humana use to be a great place o work but with the new CEO it has become a totally different culture.  We use to have the member's best interest, but now it is about making money."
good,"Manager continually aggressive, demeaning. No job security- always worried about layoffs. Metrics always increasing and difficult to meet. Decent benefits but could be better considering the company is financially doing well. A LOT OF OUTSOURCING to other countries- eliminating US jobs to send to Philippines and India."
good,"Good while it lasted. No guarantee of hours worked each week. Pleasant at times, then Panic when weekend hits and there's still a lot of work to do. Liked coworkers."
good,"High stress call center environment"
good,"I learned that some managers took a hand off approach, while others tended to micromanage. They encouraged you to learn different skills through class offered, but would get upset if you had more hours than normal because of training."
good,"the job is stressful "
good,"Too much overtime required for my situation, but that's a personal issue. Some people needed and enjoyed the OT. Otherwise it's an okay place to work."
good,"I did enjoy my work atmosphere.The pay was alright, responsibilities of course were stressful at times, but overall a great work environment. It is a Business casual workplace. Training is efficient and growth opportunities were presented with time."
good,"Paid leave, 100% paid parental leave up to 6 weeks for mothers and fathers, health insurance, 401k matching, HSA funding opportunities, health incentives"
good,"Allowed to work at home. Flexible work schedule. Learned how to process claims, read claim submitted buy providers. Learned to read contracts, assist members when they call in a pleasant way. Enjoyed activities given for associated for different occasions, (ex; sports, festivals, birthdays, etc)."
good,"I enjoyed working with the clients here, management no so much. Overall it's an okay company to work for. The money is not great but the clients make up for that."
good,Humana is a great place to work if you are single with no kids or family.  The pay is decent I suggest if you are a Field Care Manager to purchase a field car because you will put a lot of wear and tear on your car.  There is no work life balance you will be working 7 days a week.  The good part is they are paying over time for now which compensates for the overtime worked.
good,Pretty cut and dry. Seasonal medicare during open enrollment. Not very clear on the pay structure until you sign on which is a bit irritating. Most of the contract is simply getting ready for a few months of Open enrollment.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my assoicates and learning that not all associate learn at the same pace."
good,Humana overall is a great place to work. Not a lot of consistency when it comes to associates and transparency could definitely be improved. Leadership varies in all areas.
good,"Für mich persönlich ist es nicht passende Job, weil keine Chancen für zukünftige berufliches Leben habe."
good,"A lot of favorites were given, not much opportunity for advancement or pay increase. Unrealistic goals set.  Managers not always available or helpful.  Not always pleasant to work there offered time for community volunteer projects. Not always clear instructions"
good,The job was ok but I feel the pay should be more for all that you do especially being a claims rep. Starting out as a benefit rep was very helpful and easy to allow you to gain call center experience.
good,"While I was there, many, many doctors came and went.  Many good doctors left. Constant rotation of doctors. Not being able to find Dr's to work. Patients very upset about being switched from Dr to Dr.  Patients stating they never knew if there doctor would stay or not.  Lost many patients because of office manager lack of concern. We had 4 office managers in the 9 yrs I was there and countless doctors."
good,"Computer operations specialist for about 5 years (was called Systems Analyst when hired but all in all essentially a help desk tech). High stress and expectations but good job over all some of the perks included:  Work from home, good pay, good benefits with good amount of paid time off.  Only problem was they started contracting and off shoring our jobs.  I and about 20 other techs trained people from Manila Philippines to take our jobs and that they did.  We were all laid off as of April 2018."
good,It was an employer I will not return back to  due to lack of employees taken into consideration and lack of management communication with its employees.
good,It wasn't a good fit. I worked for a company that was acquired by Humana and the culture was very different.The management was constantly shuffling around with different directions.
good,"The second supervisor I had is the reason why I am leaving. She mircro-manages everything, does not recognize her individuals accomplishments, she only focuses on the negative."
good,Constant changes to the company and how business is done. Employees are often guessing about what is coming up next. Lack of adequate communication from upper management.
good,A typical day at work consist of ordering medication for members. Calling the doctor office to confirm prescription. The most enjoyable is helping members.
good,"Working with Human has its advantages. Nice people to work with. "
good,Worked very hard. Was under  appreciated. great location. great coworkers. great  company spirit. group that i worked with was fun. great team feeling.
good,Overall a relaxed place with flexibility regarding work schedules and ability to work from home. Helpful co-workers enable each other and provide insight into the job. The hardest part of the job was the lack of training provided into business decisions.
good,This was probably one of my most stressful positions. Long days and overtime. Management was poor at having team moral. Heavy work loads and little time to accomplish them. The work environment was stressful and cut throat.
good,Too many expectations and lack of involvement from company overseeing employees.  The pay far undermined the tasks that that were expected.  Little help when starting out.
good,Humana was a disappointment in my later years of employment as they eliminated an entire segment of coverage and chose to only stay in ancillary and government business.
good,"Collaborate with internal teams to develop project objectives, business requirements, financial feasibility studies and deliverables.  Manager of Product Implementation, Project Managers and Program leads.  This is within the Advance Manufacturing Systems group.  One of the projects was to create an Over the Counter (OTC) operations mail order factory.  I developed a financial supply curve for a supply and demand diagram, for their new Over the Counter (OTC) factory.  This helps directs marketing and sales to know where the loss, break-even and profit prices will be and to find the maximum price point to yield the maximum profits.  I also developed a feasibility study for the new OTC factory."
good,Can be stressful to meet the AHT (average handle times) but friendly atmosphere. There are 3 ping pong tables and several walking stations. On site café is nice.
good,working with this company allows you to grow in so many different ways. I enjoyed meeting new people almost every day and offer them insurance with a piece of mind.
good,A typical day at work trying to complete my required task in marketing and sales and give great customer services. I have learned how to put prospects and members first in regards to their medical needs. Most times I am on my own unable to get manager assistance. There are a variety of different cultures. The hardest part of the job is the unfair monitoring of incoming calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding the best plan that suits the prospects and members needs that finalized the sale.
good,"Ok if you are amazing. Otherwise, just average. Not enough calls for the amount of people who are hired. Too much outbound . Most employees set up to fail."
good,"Good pay. Worked overtime when offered. Healthcare field changes constantly. Got layoff would have stayed if not. This was a work at home position, culture is okay."
good,The actual work was great but the culture is a bit cluttered with poor decision making and IT is always having issues which makes work at Humana very stressful.
good,"Every person on my team loved the work they were doing, we all had a personal connection to it that made doing it correctly important to us.  Management/Supervisor turnover rate was high (7 supervisors inn 5 years), and each made changes that was objectively detrimental to work accuracy, despite constant objections and suggested fixes, causing increases in errors, and exceptional employees losing their jobs."
good,I enjoyed working for Humana.  My experience was valuable. Management was turning over to rapidly for my taste.  I was able to apply my skills and education to each new role.
good,"nothing out of the ordinary, not many incentives - typical call center atmosphere, nothing around to really break up the monotony - i wish they would give actual feedback on performance"
good,Challenging over the last year due to five reductions in force within 13.5 months
good,"Typically I worked 8 hours a day except during AEP of which I work an average of 12 hours six days a week."
good,"Great Pay and benefits, but expectation (called metrics) are very high,  Many of my co-workers had to work through breaks to meet metrics. NO JOB SECURITY. Humana going through transitional phase, no jobs are safe."
good,"Everyday I have issues with my computer and help desk was no help whatsoever. So many software's to login to. If you forgot your password, you'd have to restart everything over again."
good,"Extremely Stressful, competitive department"
good,"Too matrix of an organization.  Lack of clarity in goals and objectives.  Too many levels of approval.  No opportunity to advance.  Poor direct leadership, didn't help with growth."
good,"My manager was great to work for. With health care reform many people were laid off or offered early retirement which cut the workforce down to below minimum. All the work that could not be out sourced stayed with the few that were left. I originally loved my job and working at Humana but it has been increasingly hard to stay with the volume of work that is required.  Job security is not good, talk of another layoff beginning this year. Too much work required for one person  to handle. I understand and agree for the trimming of the fat at company's but this is beyond. Stress level is very high."
good,It is good employer with good employee benefits and fostering employee personal and professional growth fostering culture.  Also technology wise they are ahead of the market which enables to learn new things in the market.
good,"on typical day took a lot of calls about medical insurance benefits and claims , fast paced."
good,This deparment is compliance driven. I have learned all about medicare and all the different kinds of policies. A perk for working for this company is that you are able to get cross training in other supporting departments so that your job is a little easier.
good,"work with customer about their EOB and answer what questions I could I don't remember to much about this I only worked hear a year "
good,"To begin the manager was replaced 4 times in 1 year, no one stays at Care plus for more than 12 months. Managers only look at numbers not open to listening to ideas that will better the job in general."
good,"I have learned a lot about the pharmacy piece and how the insurance is applied. However, I have insurance verification experience, but it always good to learn more skill. The hardest part of the job is trying to assist members that are going through so much with their sicknesses and sometimes feel helpless."
good,"Humana overall is a good company to work for with competitive pay and comparable benefits with exception of high deductible plans and not even company match on HSA for families. Advancement is low, management plays favorites and leaders lack leadership in some departments. Culture is fun, relaxed and very diverse but work can be stressful. Lack of communication and uptraining department to department makes for unclear and confusing processes."
good,"constant re-organization, downsizing, early retirement, etc. The environment is good which keeps some people but otherwise it can be very scary with the constant changes"
good,I worked at Humana for a year and a half in order to learn the Medicare business and I was taught a whole lot about the industry and I took that learning and went independant.
good,Working as a pharmacy customer care advocate didn't offer much work life balance.  The data systems would constantly change and there was not much time to adjust and learn the system. Raises are not much either.
good,"The overall culture is great in theory, but in practice the company was very stressful.  Job security was never solid due to constant threat of corporate layoffs."
good,"A typical day is go, go, go.  You must stay focused and not deviate from your work lest you slip and not meet the goals assigned to you.  Management can be aloof, but usually come through when needed as long as you maintain a positive attitude."
good,"Be careful - very backstabby - indirect communication kind of place.  People do not directly tell you if you've made a mistake - they go to their manager, who then goes to your manager, who them comes back to you."
good,Work at Home position consist of monitoring throughout the day. several meetings and trainings while having to meet your work performance goals. Various inconsistency in management roles.
good,"I love working for the Company Humana, it is the management team/supervisors that make it hard for the employees. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the supervisor attitudes, they need to have more people skill training. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the members being able to assist them with their questions and their medications and working with the nurses and provider offices."
good,"It is an ok work place but it really depends on where you want your career to go.  You have to be able to adapt to change (which I am) because if you are a person that wants things to remain the same, this place is not for you. Great pay also but keeps you stuck here if you try to go anywhere else because chances are that you will not get the good pay elsewhere."
good,Management poorly trained.. most do don't even understand role functions of direct reports. Since merger did not go through everyone is lost in the weeds.
good,"Humana is a great company to work for, great benefits, however, it is hard to advance. I have been in the same position for over 3 1/2 years and have applied to over 30 positions, with 2 interviews, i feel stuck.  I do love Humana though and do not want to leave.  I just wish it was easier to advance and continue to make a difference."
good,"I loved the atmosphere, but this was a temporary position.  Unfortunately, the timing was not right and they were letting people go versus hiring on full time."
good,"I work from home so that is a great perk of the job. "
good,Humana can be a great place to work if cliques don't bother you.  The management is tolerable if you are a good employee that meets your production goals and come to work everyday. But if they don't like you for some reason your days are numbered there is alot of favoritism.
good,Work at home. Long work hours. No time for home life. Expectations are excessive. No concern for employees own life. Salary and expect work to be done no matter what it takes of your own life.
good,Working for humana has been a great experience. Very great company. Diverse management. The company cares about the wellbeing of their employers. They are expanding work at home jobs.
good,I would love to be rehired too bad I was laid off i like the environment and the chance too advance  flexible hours good benefits cheap insurance and a great 401k plan
good,"I have had some great managers, one's who push you to advance and move up in your professional life.  There is room for advancement dependent on management.  I have also had a not so positive experience with management.  The work at home option is amazing, traveling for the company is also another great experience. I did learn that once I reach the peak of my career, always be willing to teach the person after you."
good,This is a company that favoritism is very popular where few people are being place in position base on who they know. You need to be part of a click to really experience the opportunities the company offers.
good,"•	Continuous interaction’s with members and providers"
good,t was ce learning how to do Prior Authorizations and learn the back end of a pharmacy. I really enjoyed the job. Job was not flexible with your schedule
good,"Management is inconsistent within the department. Managers inexperienced and if under upper management with poor people skills, then doomed for success."
good,"first year is the best for anyone thinking of applying...after first year, don't count on commissions, after completing second year, was placed repeatedly on programs with no commission involved for rest of time..my commission dropped by $10000 each year"
good,great  benefits great  company  to work for feel as though management is not held accountable by  any higher up.  however they are really a great company  to work for the pay  is excellent and they  take really  good care of there employees its just hard work and long hours
good,"The company has merged with another large company and the effects of this merger are still unknown long term. "
good,"good pay, micro managed.  strict attendance policy.  work holidays. cafe on site but expensive.  benefits but health care coverage is not great.  high deductible plans"
good,"Humana's culture has changed over the years, not much flexibility. No sense of structure. Most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with external partners. Aetna is in the process of acquiring the Company which I hope will bring about positive changes."
good,At humana career growth is pretty slow compared to other company out there. The work environment is friendly and easy to deal with. There's alot of red tape so to get simple things done you need to involve lot of different groups. It waste lot of time just getting approvals to make minor changes.
good,your expected to learn new material all the time and aren't given the proper materials to actually put the learned information into practice the people teaching the information aren't sure of the lesson be taught.
good,"Humana can be a hectic work environment. From the start to the finish of the day, you never know what you are going to be dealing with. Different types of calls and different types of people can be dealt with. It is okay though, because at the end of the day, you helped a numerous amount of people without even realizing it and being on the phone all day with so many different data base systems up and running."
good,"Job was very enjoyable. Teammates were of energetic people. Very casual environment with a nice, clean office feel. Personal cubicle, desk, and organization management. Friendly competitions and competitive pay/bonuses."
good,"I worked with multiple members and providers speaking to them daily and assisting there questions and concerns. It was fast paced and not very much down time. "
good,A fast paced pharmaceutical shipping location with plenty of work and available overtime. Coworkers are pleasant and the 10 hour/4 day work week is nice.
good,One manager makes the rules and then everyone has to listen and do as the manager says. I felt bullied. Hours were crazy. Felt isolated and not part of a team.
good,Learned Hippa regulations and how to apply them to prescriptions business. Learned how to use computer systems and keep up to date with programs.
good,"Humana is a good company to work for. What I learned from being there for over 4 years was knowing how to put the customers first. A typical day at work was answering inbound-calls from our members, problem-solving and/or trouble-shooting to help with their issues."
good,"It has given me an opportunity to learn a side of the insurance company that I never knew existed.  I support clinicians who support members who have been hospitalized and are in need of health care services.  "
good,"Overall great atmosphere and work environment. The management were very open to new ideas, my co-workers were pleasant. The hardest part of the job was having to correct oversea accountants mistakes."
good,"Very busy environment, high prescription volume and having physicians in house required  working closely with medical staff who often had time restraints. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customer's satisfaction and appreciation of my services which I gave  110% every day.Had to be a strong leader and be able to make decisions  and communicate well with the  leadership and other  members of health care team."
good,"none like clients lose supervision, not friendly co workeers"
good,I enjoyed working with the group of people I worked with. I maintained the cleanliness of the company we cleaned for. I also assisted my manager with timekeeping for payroll and ordering supplie.
good,"Some do the same exact work as others, but get paid much less. Huge pay discrepancies that are unfair."
good,"Just like any job your experience is heavilly weighted on your supervisor and management team. Humana as a company is great, decent benefits package strong finacial position and a household name. Co-workers are upbeat and the work environment is pleasant for the most part. With any large company there is always office politics and some handle that better than others. Overall my experience with Humana has been positive."
good,"To met the demands and comply with all regulator requirements it is concerned the hardest place I have ever had to work, but there is great opportunity for learning."
good,this was a rewarding  position because it allowed me the opportunity to assist patient with getting the  medications they needed in a  timely manner
good,The most enjoyable part about the job is helping senior citizens.  The hardest part about the job is too many system issues.
good,Fun place to work. Minimal supervision required. Worked with many other departments
good,"After 7 1/2 years of working experience with Humana Medicare I can output that its a solid company but they have a lot of issues with the communication in between top level management, mid management and associates."
good,"Answering calls from prospective and current Medicare beneficiaries. Probing to determine the best insurance products to fulfill their individual needs I learned about the Medicare and Medicaid benefits, as well as other insurance policies such as Tricare and VA benefits."
good,Great company to receive thorough training in the field of insurance.
good,it is a job depending on what department or people that you work with that makes the job fun. the pay and benefits are good. also a company that tend's to value it's employee's and helps them out with trying to better their life. the only downfall is that rules and policies can tend to change at the drop of a dime and daily work task can become boring and tedious
good,"Humana is agreat place to work for, I do wish that there was more room for advancement prior to the 6mos of employee time period and the pay scale at leat one dollar higher. I am grateful for the experience I have obtained."
good,"I worked in the west chester area, in 2007 and 2008, I loved the place. Friendly people, nice decor, breakrooms, cont educ, decent pay, good benefits. But, I lost my job there, of no fault of my own relating to health issues . I do wish Humana would give others such as myself a 2nd chance to learn and grow with there company. I met some really nice people there, and i had high hopes for a wonderful career.. If so, i am ready to come back, if you would give me that chance."
good,"Thousands of associates laid off after holidays due to merger not going through as block by the federal government. Fair pay, a lot of changes happen."
good,"Flexibility to work from home          "
good,Working for Humana Call Center was very informative. Learning how to assist customers in the insurance industry has taught me the importance of patience and clarity.
good,Humana is a company that believes in health and wellness for employees . You can get a lot of perks for being healthy. Very faced based and new changes monthly.
good,Learned allot and made great friends and were committed to each other. Culture was based on team spirit and camaraderie.  Training was extensive and leaders were dedicated to success.
good,"The management selects who they want to succeed, Was producing more than tenure representatives but the still did not hire me after open enrollment. I went over and above and they laid me off"
good,It was an experience that ill never forget no one wanted to be there. It always had a vibe to it like there was something wrong. It wasn't the best but I didnt mind I put my best foot forward and got ready for the day
good,"Stressful, constantly changing expectations, little time off. Company watches your every single move and monitors if you even get up to go to the bathroom"
good,I was able to collaborate with other disciplines and seek resolution for patient's problems.  Promotion of patient's health conditions was high priority.
good,I think that the environment at this particular establishment was a great place to work and during my employment here everyday was a new opportunity to grow and learn something new
good,"I enjoyed  working at Humana , I just wanted something closer to wherever I live . The traffic was terrible. The new job I went to was closer and more money."
good,"Enjoyed working there, progress is slow, not a lot of work at times where you have to use your paid time off to equal up to a week's pay. Management shows a lot of favoritism."
good,They cut the whole program that I worked in and laid off a lot of people. I loved my job except phone call length expectations that were unrealistic for most clients.
good,"If you become an asset to this company and network, you can have a career here than would be rewarding. If you plan to do the bare minimum required - you will not last."
good,"If you enjoy a desk job and doing the same couple tasks over and over all day long then you may like it. It wasn’t a horrible job, but got boring fast. The mandatory overtime every single week gets old as well. Everything is about numbers and production alone. The pay is decent and benefits excellent. Most of the people were nice but like every place there will be some drama. Very high turn over"
good,The Humana allowed workers to work from home that was essential for a better work life balance.  They provided decent wages.  The manager's micro-managed workers.
good,Felt as though it was a telemarketing job;  didn't feel I was utilizing my nursing skills; Isolative job; prefer working face-to-face with patients and families;
good,"Working within the MYB dept, mandatory OT during the early-year due to Medicaid renewals. Environment was fast paced where they expected superb customer service without a multi-transfer call; however, doing so reduced call speed which caused for coachings. Also during completing the DME reviews, we had the opportunity to switch members for multiple cases to reduce calls to members; however, Management would not count those in our daily production numbers which further reduced their perceived productivity and resulted in more coachings. Dept does not run in an efficient manner and caters to its cliques."
good,I do not have a review as not there. Worked there for 3 years helping customers with health needs. I was the one picked to talk people down that was angry and by the time I was off the phone the customer was happy
good,"The pay was fair. I enjoyed being able to work from home. The supervisors were nice. I didnt like the chaos that was there, meaning the lack of training."
good,N/along with the rest of the week and I will be willing to help you out with that we can get the ball rolling on this one. ...... management is lazy and is not
good,They really no room to advance after a curtain point. Also the management is just a bunch of kids who have no experience and the ones who do are out of the picture
good,"N/A"
good,For me it was to much of a desk job. I did not enjoy sitting at a desk all day it made the days long and hard to get through. recommended for people who enjoy desk jobs.
good,"I enjoyed working for Humana when it was under a different Director/management.  "
good,It is a sales job so one should expect to be under the gun to perform especially during Medicare Annual Enrollment.  Not all Supervisors are created equal so been assigned to a good one is highly beneficial. Your sup should be invested in you learning and improving daily but some truly only care about how fast you sell so that their bonuses would be fat
good,"Excellent team, but no work-life balance due to understaffing. The physician teams are excellent resources, particularly around the peer review process for QOC investigations."
good,"Liked company, work, teammates & leaders. Interned during college part-time. Paid pretty well but didn’t get to do as much stuff I wanted most. Fulltime offer in Green Bay but wanted to live and work in CO for a year or two. Good company tho and would definitely return.......if I ever move back home!"
good,"fritt arbete med fantastisk kund, dock finns inga vikarier att tillgå och ledningen är ej lyhörd"
good,Great co-workers.  Internal promotions very difficult.  Excellent training & development offered but leadership not trustworthy.  Supportive team.....
good,"Don’t do it unless you’re licensed or else it’s a big waste of time and money and effort."
good,Ok to work for but when job eliminated I couldn't transition into another position within organization without having to drive an hour and take pay cut
good,It is a good company for call center agents because agents can bring food inside the production floor and they do all that they can in order to help the employees improve.
good,"Based on who your center administrator is, you will be able to learn a lot of things. You become the right man of the providers. An employee has to have the right frame of mind to work in certain departments because it does get overwhelming."
good,"I worked with Humana during a time of layoff and turn around with the company. Not sure, what to write or say about Humana the leadership was not the best or friendly when it came to associate handling complex questions."
good,"They expect high quality and high productivity which can be a little stressful for some.  However, it can be a nice place for people to work at.  There is a bunch of room for promotions which makes it even better to work for a company like this."
good,Subcontracted thru HealthForce.Flexible schedule. Mileage not reimbursed. Excessive documentation time.Would've preferred to work for Humana directly.
good,"A typical day at Humana, was very peaceful and calm environment.  Management, was an open door policy.  The were very effective,  an allowed us to produce without micromanaging. The culture, focused on proper health (eating, exercise etc..), always."
good,They definitely need to expand provider network in certain areas to be competitive. They need more internal incentives for the captive sales force  to motivate them.
good,"If you know anything about insurance, you know there is no such thing as a typical day.  "
good,"I worked for a third part who was contracted with Humana. Humana was stationed in FLORIDA, I worked out of Utah. The review question are specifically for Humana and not the company I worked for which was C3."
good,En dag var aldrig den andra lik! Man visste inte vad som skulle hända under dagen. Varje dag ett nytt äventyr!
good,"answering phones, resolving issues on coverage plans, collecting payments, doing daily, weekly, and monthly reports. I learned the insurance laws of Tennessee. The culture was clicky within the different teams. Hardest part was getting supervisor approvals to get things corrected. Enjoyable part was getting to know the company contacts from the businesses and making trusting relationships with them and how thankful they were for my help."
good,"This company came very early in my working career, I don't remember much abuout it other than at te time the pay was good, the people was nice and they"
good,"Humana is a great place to work, but requires a lot of overtime. The pay is good, but  the job it’s self is stressful. There is a lot of micromanaging also. The 401k is great."
good,"Sold health insurance plans to seniors and disabled individuals."
good,I was hired as a temporary employee. I loved the actual job. Manager was terrible. If you have a disability don’t work here. I wasn’t accommodated at all. My manager didn’t even know what the ADA was. I have no idea how he even became a manager.
good,Telephonic chronic disease management of Humana Medicare members. Work from home. Enjoyed helping the members but the role of job changed continuously for no good reason. Workplace culture was not positive. Employees were not appreciated.
good,I gained new experience working for Humana. I was able to meet great clients whom through assessments gained more knowledge as a Personal Health Coach.
good,This company was not the best company but it has improved over the years in my opinion. The company was going through a transitional period and was not a good fit for me at the time.
good,"Overall, it was a great experience.  The first thing I did not like was not receiving feedback.  I thought everything was okay until they said you will be released because you ""were not the right fit"".  Second, a new manager came in.  Overall, he was okay, but, the issue above did not help, plus this ""unwritten rule"" about emailing stakeholders to a point where a phone call was needed.  I guess I did not fit because I would not get to the point of getting a phone call, even though there would be several emails bouncing around nailing a date and time for the call.  Go figure."
good,I thought that I would retire from Humana Military. That was not to be. I was one of several affected by a rare layoff. I understood. You cannot assume that you have job security in any job.
good,I liked the people and enjoyed working here but a life-changing event kept me from going to work and I am now no longer eligible to be hired here ever again. There needs to be a bit more human understanding in the corporate world and situational occasions need to be handled on a case by case basis. If employees are valued and challenged properly they will be more productive and enjoy their work more.
good,"Great place to start a career in nursing. great training, mentorship, and an opportunity to learn from not only other nurses but the physicians ensured that any questions about the patient condition was effectively communicated."
good,"Did not have that great of an experience with them. There were not very organized, which is hectic at times, but were very unprofessional in running certain operations."
good,"great place to work most managers are readily available to help you,  but its easy money and its good money ,mostly friendly work enviroment ,relaxed."
good,Production is important. Pretty much you work per project. Management keeps the open door policy. Quality needs an option for rebutttal. Sometimes the feeling of not worth it under quality guidelines is overwhelming.
good,Dålig information mellan företaget och brukarnas familj men alltid trevlig personal via telefon. Skulle rekommendera för en vän.
good,Humana is a very large company. Some people really find work that fits them there and some do not. Humana is very meeting focused. People who work there should enjoy meetings.
good,"A typical day was fast paced worked lots of overtime . Enjoyed servicing customers and helping them with orders, problems with product etc. Lunch breaks too short."
good,Typical work day required you to be on the auto-dialer to connect with patients and introduce free services offered to them. It was difficult to talk on the phone all day. But it was enjoyable to guide the patients in the right direction for assistance.
good,"Enjoyed on the job training and training other associates on new systems. Loved my job and the multi-training I received throughout my work history that allowed me to analyze Customer inquiries - research root cause of problem - know what department could assist in resolving issue or be able to resolve issue myself due to the cross training that I had received."
good,"fair hours and pay. moved from another state to gain employment, Fair pay and hours, room for advancement, i enjoy the atmosphere and you are able to work from home in may positions"
good,Humana is a decent employer with good ideas..  depending on what area you are hired into and what manager you have will determine if you actually get to take part in the company's vision.  Information Technology is a good old boys club and not very female friendly when it comes to promotion or recognition. it is also operates by who you know and not what you do to get raises or promotions.  I would only recommend it as a stepping stone in your career until they clean house of some very bad managers.
good,The experience has always been positive and great opportunity for growth and education expansion. .The staff is great and supportive and the management is supportive.
good,"Start up time is  15 minutes before auto in to incoming calls. I receive as much as 85 to 100 calls per 10hr shift. I quote benefits plan far as prescription drugs, medical, group insurance coverage"
good,"Xerox, the 3rd party company, is very unprofessional but easy to get hired. Humana the company itself is great and get paid very well, as I have been told."
good,It was a good place to work. But you have to be 15 minutes early and not 1 minute late. Which was hard for me because I was pregnant when I started. But I was considered a LTD Limited term employee. So it wasn't a permeant job like I was lead to believe.
good,stressful to meet a quota it was ok to work management was fine had to be on the phone quite a bit I did enjoy being able to have different activities that raised morale
good,"A typical day at Humana would be call patients that have an In Home Health Assessment coming up and trying to schedule an appointment for a Nurse Practitioner  to come and give them an evaluation. I have learned to map where there nurse is to see if their is enough time for the nurse to make it on time to the next appointment.My manager was very understanding and compassionate. The culture has a variety of people from races to economic status. The hardest part of the job is to keep calm when a an elderly person is in a bad mood and try to schedule the nurse ,so she will get there on time. The most enjoyable part of the job is to make the elderly person laugh."
good,Humana was a nice place to work.  There are many talented individuals that are available to help you learn the role and to guide you in your career path.
good,I really enjoyed what I did for Humana but the mileage compensation was bery poor and the over all pay even though per hour was not based on the hours in the field but by the charting of the patient visit.
good,It was an experience. I worked for them for a few months before the contract with Humana ended. I had a great shift working from 5a-1pm with weekends off.
good,Humana for what I could see it was a good place to work and management helped you whenever you need they were there for you. Productive and fun place with dance groups during down time to relax you.
good,"Helt ok arbetsgivare. Jobbade där en mindre tid, men har absolut inget dåligt att säga."
good,A typical day for a sales representative would begin with an analysis of a potential clients health insurance needs and matching those needs to the company's products being offered. Then you would begin the sales process to fulfill the customers needs.
good,It was a good place to work with kind and nice people over all. There was always so much more to learn. It was just hard to get on  and be able to work from home static.
good,Typical day was scheduling appts with Drs offices to audit medical records. Usually wasnt very welcomed at these offices since I was reviewing their records.
good,"The commercial part of Human was a fun place and learned on how to build an authorization.  But when they down sided and transferred to the Military part, it was very stressful receiving inbound calls from beneficiaries."
good,"It is my first project and I was just a contractor from TCS, so had very less exposure, and gained some good information as a start up. It was a friendly place"
good,"Answered phones, created claims while adjusting 27 claims per hour initially.  Department leadership was not very open to suggestions or improvements in processes.  Very hard to post out of Claims, limited movement."
good,"I learned alot but the job was very stressfull "
good,"Clinical Review for UR/CM"
good,"El ambiente de trabajo era agradable, las compañeras eran muy trabajadoras, y te ayudaban en todo."
good,I don't have a summary I want to provide.  I worked there for several years and mostly enjoyed my time there.  Some of the people in management positions should have those positions
good,I would like to get back to work Humana at Home program.  I work with a Subcontractor and office closed down. I helped Member/Client stay healthy and out of Hospital as much as possible. I traveled about 700 to 1000 miles a week. I really enjoyed helping member/client learn about getting and staying healthy.
good,"A typical day at work for me is to clock in the payroll system, pull up my systems, check email, and then handle inbound calls. I focus on meeting my goals with quality, net promoter score, and customer satisfaction. There are times when the team exceeds and falls short but we remain a team. I laugh with members and coworkers which is the best parts of my day. The hardest part of the job can be listening because when you do not actively listen to everything being said you can cause confusion and miscommunication. I have learned to listen and not to take everything so personal."
good,The program and project management community is not very mature and needs to be overhauled.  Projects and Programs are not being handled consistently across the organization and communications are very poor.  My management did not keep employees informed and was a micromanager.
good,"Worked in your bin processing request faxed in to the system.  You have assigned request which are processed by timeframe. The hardest part is trying to process and incomplete request and figuring out if the request requires management or was misdirected to OrthoNet in error. Lunch would be the best part of the day, eating in the breakroom with your fellow employee and walking around the property for your remaining time."
good,"was keeping up with all the statistics, volumes and volumes, took time away from the needs of the workers. Multitudes of daily meetings, travel and not enough time focusing on patients"
good,I have not worked at humana for over a year and feel it is not fair to do a review given their culture may have changed for the better for employees. I would recommend to college students
good,"My experience with this company was through a third-party, Covergy's.  The hours were conducive to home life needs.  The work load was minimal and easy to achieve."
good,Fast paced environment very helpful co workers. I learned how to deal with irritate customers. Management was very fare. Workplace culture was good. the hardest part of the job is switching from English language to Spanish language.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customers fix the problem.
good,This was a stepping stone for me. Work was not very hard just the company really didn't know which direction they were going in at that time with so many changes.
good,Humana overall is a good employer.  
good,"responsible for helping fill prescriptions, and helping Humana members register for Rx enrollment. Helping members keep a constant flow of medication."
good,"I enjoyed the position until they changed the description.  I started off with one set of responsibilities and then they added more responsibilities with no pay.  In addition, they changed the schedule."
good,Not a good place to work as you work temporary up until they let you go and then you apply for another position and they deny you every time. So no purpose of keep applying
good,Lot of changes since I started in 2001.  now all enrollments are done by phone and new system with new contract doesn't work as should.  sadly lots up upset benes
good,Just looking for Advancement in another Company to Offer Work Life Stability and Better Pay as well as Work Hours.. Humana Overall is a Good Company Despite Certain things can change.
good,"Humana pays fairly well for this area. The company has built a strong financial position through its legacy performance though is facing more future uncertainty with its position which has led to the continuous merger/acquisition activity since 2015."
good,Here I worked medical records for about 4 yrs and then I moved over to the Medical Assisting side after that.  We MA's all had to work with a nurse that was with a Dr.  It wasn't so bad.
good,"I had many Company benefits. Meet a lot of people. I worked with many departments. Enjoyed learning new program systems training. "
good,"A typical day at Humana is sitting at a desk for 8 or more hours. During peak season, you can count on a mandatory 2 hour overtime, and if the department does not meet service level, the next week is guaranteed mandatory overtime. If you work here, you can say goodbye to your social life. "
good,"Again, the pay was amazing and a lot of the benefits are worth working there. Just the goals for gaining permanent employment may not be achievable for everyone."
good,Decent job but not much room for advancement. CSS have very limited room to grow within the company. The culture of the company has changed in the last few years.
good,"I was unable to grow my case load fast enough. I had 1 patient per day and had to drive 2 hours one way to see them. 75 per visit seems like alot but not for 5 hours worth of work...2 hours there, 2 hours home and 1 hour visit. Not worth it."
good,Only worked there for a short period but was an ok place to work.  They did provide the tools you need for your job.  Pay was where it should have been for the work performed.
good,"It was a good place to work. i just didn't see any growth there, the management staff was not very helpful when you have personal problem ""death in the Family"""
good,"The job can be stressful at times constantly answering back to back phones call regarding Medicare calls, billing such as processing payments, and providing benefits information"
good,overtime is mandatory and if you don't work it you can get an occurrence which count against  you. Also have to notify superior when you will be steeping away to use the restroom.
good,Benefits extremely expensive and lack of advancement in certain departments ..but oversll a good company to work for but the benefits could be alot better..
good,Good work life balance; I enjoyed working with a diverse workforce as well as interacting with the provider community. Working for Humana was a great learning experience.
good,Great place to work if you work in the pharmacy. Customer service supervisors lack work ethic. Coworkers are good people to work with. Good overtime during open enrollment season
good,Humana is a great place to gain valuable skills.  It is difficult to move into senior leadership positions once you have proven yourself. Great place to gain experience but you will likely need to move on if you want to move into leadership.
good,"Nothing really to say, just not my favorite place to work at, feel like company is unfair to worker and workers get unrecognized. Company not upon hearing what employees have to say"
good,"productive fast pace, overtime hours available, friendly environment, teamwork, advancement,career progress,health care insurance, clean workplace environment"
good,"When I started working for Humana it was a dream job. I sincerely mean that. The culture was wonderful. You would walk down a hallway and everyone had a smile on their face. From the folks that cleaned the offices all the up to the CEO, everyone was so happy to be there. That has all changed. It is now a very stressful environment with everyone wondering if they will be the next to be laid off. Big businesses have to make changes but the changes at Humana are just too much, too fast and this has created a really toxic work environment in my opinion."
good,"The job was easy, however there was a lot of micromanaging, the job at times was stressful with trying to reach unrealistic quotas. I would go back but in a different department."
good,working for humana at first is great training is hard but paid and they give you all tools needed. however once you are put on the floor its fight to survive with no assistance in accually doing the job just getting your license.
good,The culture was interesting as it was a contract for Humana in a call center environment. The training was long and comprehensive if not a bit slow paced for experienced agents.
good,"very dynamic workplace, the job culture was not the best but overall the supervisors really cared about the job quality and taught me how significant it was for me to maintain a positive attitude and be cheerful regarding the variety of different callers. I learned how to resolve member issues through in depth research and also how to use multiple databases to verify and inform callers with accurate information."
good,"When I first started here I enjoyed it, I started off with Medicare Rewards and loved my job then all of a sudden we go super busy and took on two other departments which was Over The Counter (OTC) Rewards and RightSourceRx. Working all 3 departments at one time day in and day out became exhausting at the time because mandatory overtime was in effect and calls were back to back and because of constant rule changes we were so behind in our Over The Counter department that caused alot of orders to be redone and caused an inconvenience to members which at times the members ended up losing out on the monthly benefit due to orders not being recieved or processed efficiently."
good,"ok company to work for, raises have been put on hold for 2 years. I enjoyed working with them, but received another opportunity to work from home full time."
good,"I was promised many different products to sell and that never materilized."
good,"Humana when I worked there was fun and engaging, Humana Cares had the best model of care with the appropriate people at the helm. As the mergers began, so did the decline and focus on the members and the employees. Humana used to be heavily invoved with its associates engagement and invested in making the associates happy, and therefore driving up the production numbers. That was on the decline at my exit."
good,I was part of a team within the managed care industry that worked with the Medicare and Medicaid population for members in Virginia until the company lost the contract to manage this population.
good,"Working environment was appropriate, achieved standards and worked beyond what was requested Achieved matrix standards and was a team player in work assistance to co workers and activities"
good,"It is not what you know, or how well you do your job, but about how you follow orders even if you don't agree or if it really does not help your clients"
good,"At the end of my time there, I had to go work at home To escape people wearing too Much perfume, Body Sprays or Cologne. Even Though They officially they did not allow people to wear strong Perfumes Etc. They did nothing about when someone did,"
good,Humana can be a great company if management was more educated on running an effective and supportive office. They don't really know who you are your just a number your put on the phones with little to no knowledge and I was let go without notice just called me in the office and was like business is business today's your last day! I had a bad run in with the company doesn't mean anyone else will this is just what happened to me.
good,My time at Humana was uneventful. I didn't get the opportunity to learn much as I was the only person in my department at the office. I left to seek more opportunities elsewhere.
good,">>provides helpful trainings"
good,I Worked at Humana for 6years. I received Perfect attendance for 6 years. I also received awards for my outstanding Customer Service Work. Also help trained new employee that join Humana in my department.
good,"I enjoyed my position and the company initially, however, the coders have not been coding since late last year and there is no indication that it will change.  There is no transparency regarding the direction the department is taking and what, if any, role the coders will have."
good,"I liked the people that I worked with, but Humana brought us all in as temporary employees and never hired us in until three years has passed and it was very stressful not knowing if you was going to have a job from day to day."
good,"It's a great place for an aspiring actuary to develop necessary skills and to work in a collaborative environment."
good,not a bad place to work.Coworkers are very nice to work with. The workload is manageable. The most enjoyable part is the flexibility it provides for the nurses. the hardest part is doing home assessment in a high crime area.
good,"Health insurance plans and related healthcare benefits for Medicare, individual or group health insurance. Manage your healthcare choices with Humana."
good,It's a great company depending on if your not looking for growth. Lots of leadership changes. More consistence is needed. More focus on the staff. More focus on career driven people
good,Simple call center. Positive and environment but leads are poor. Management try to maintain an upbeat environment but communication is limited. Overall a solid experience
good,"Very stressful environment, nice people. Just don't mess up or they won't cut you any slack . Kind of job that you need to really be mentally prepared for"
good,"Humana is an average place to work, depending on who you are and for whom you work.  I enjoyed my time there.  I made a lot of good friends, with whom I still stay in touch."
good,PTO was good. Benefits were ok. Work at home was wonderful. Did not like the office environment. Company is too big to feel comfortable. Great Inclusion and Diversity
good,I was just a temp worker so I didn't really care about much of what was happening. I feel like all my other co-workers hated being there and they weren't nice to each other.
good,Working for Humana was only great if you worked in Sales. The customer service side was hard because we had to follow Medicare regulations.Its hard to do whats right for people with so many government restrictions.
good,"Within the last year, there are 3 new managers and team leads. The entire department has changed, sometimes change is not always good. The culture is excellent, but the management isn't the best."
good,"It was a good peaceful place, always a lot of people trying to throw pot lucks, a lot of people everywhere seems like they are happy, food trucks weekly"
good,"Easy money, The job is not hard. Just show up on time, do your job, and learn about everything. There is opportunity for growth, if you stay focused. Your'e your own boss for the most part."
good,every person has a different opinion about a company and the experience is a learning lesson on how to improve for the next employer. humana gave me a opportunity to realize I am not meant to do sales and that I am a stronger customer service agent
good,They were not very compassionate about my health condition.  I had FMLA and used  it quite a bit and they always seemed to have an attitude when I submitted it.
good,It my be different now but the no sick and always having to you personal or sick time.  Became a problem when you get sick and use up your PTO.........
good,"work at home is nice benefit,there are good benefits, but I was laid off so I am unsure about t he future security  of the company.  401K contribution was nice."
good,Jobs vary so I'm sure everyone has a different opinion of this place. Over all wasn't bad.I processed claims. Came in did my job and left. No much pressure on me.
good,Working in the call center was a very interesting experience because I got to work with people from all different backgrounds and cultures. Working under different leader ship styles proved to keep the job interesting.
good,"Good company to work for, fun environment, our team was good, people helped each other out when needed to complete tasks.  I was laid off back in 2002"
good,it was a great experience working in the call center. it was a opportunity they gave me and It was a success. somethings could be more organized and more arranged.
good,"Fick stressa mycket, men kul att träffa äldre och prata med dom om deras liv."
good,"Overall ok..working for the company, it did get a bit stress full at times but what job is not.. I, utilized the benefits at Humana, and it was an awesome experience with the benefits and the workers."
good,Very busy job working with senior citizens.  Lots of activities and customer service.  Friendly atmosphere just not enough hours.  Position I was in was variable staffing...no room for advancement.
good,Being there for 12 years gave me an opportunity to have various responsibilities and I gained a great deal of experience.  I am thankful for the opportunities I received while employed with Humana.
good,"This company has good benefits, including good starting vacation time. It's a really good place for young actuaries to grow in their profession, with a nice development program."
good,"Position was go at your own pace, however the required documentation deadline was difficult to make with companies technical difficulties.  Hard to communicate effectively with current communication system."
good,Humana can offer a lot to a company and provides some great benefits to you like PTO. The hardest part of the job would be the constant change that happens but that comes with the insurance world.
good,Good to work from home. Flexible hours. I learned a lot about telephonic RN case management. I learned how to help patients keep their body healthy and move toward their health care goals.
good,HumanaVitality was a subsidiary of Humana that functioned as a start-up company.  It was a fast paced environment that required everyone to expand their roles and perform additional tasks when needed.
good,"Previous employer merged with humana and we had to work the product for the state of KY.  This would not have been my job of choice.  Eventually promoted to supervisor for 25 employees, too many for one supervisor."
good,"Very stressful. Triage for Nurses. somewhat stressful, changed day by day. Trying to please the Manager.Working with good people. When they hired a lot of Nurses to take over the jobs we had they did not know what they were doing and they had to hire some more Customer Reps."
good,Humana is a nice place to work. Not too quick paced to where you can’t keep up. But enough to keep you from being idle. Friendly staff and plenty of growth opportunity.
good,I worked in the Fort Mill Office and that is where I started my day from. I was assigned a book of accounts for Chester SC. I had a difficult time with my book most people were out of work for more than a year.
good,orking cond not bad but stressful on the numbers you're watched on the system if its active or not ressful on the numbers you're watched of never will be
good,"Overall good job with plenty opportunities for advancement, good benefits, good pay, but upper management was not honest about job security towards the end."
good,job place were good but the company is fully reliable on third parties vendor callled TCS which was did a lot of illegal practice inside the company and many indian manager were involved too.
good,Working with team to get Claims to go through first pass.  via Excel Macros to programming changes. Up till the last team I was on the managers were great.  the last one was not
good,"There for a short time, enjoyable job, the culture was too relaxed and not too much of a challenge. Supervisors have been in positions for 5 plus years and not assisting agents to advance their careers."
good,"Organized, well managed company. Speaking daily with mbrs and acknowledge there concerns and provided guidance throughout the insurance plan, primary doctor and community services."
good,Please do not ask me about previous company because I do not care to judge anything that goes on. I feel that is private about the company in the things that goes on.
good,"Humana is non existence, because another company bought them out after I left. But if it was still in existence personally I wouldn't go back to them."
good,Extremely stressful work environment. They did attempt to make the work environment less stress with providing activities and  incentives.  Decent company to work.
good,I was not happy at Humana. I just sat in front of a computer all day long and paid claims. I was told I would be able to advance but that never happened. I was moved from department to department because I was good at my job but never compensated or taught anything new.
good,"A typical day includes answering phone calls and trying to sell insurance. You will learning insurance for health. Glass door for woman, it is hard to move up."
good,"The job pays well and you could move up if you worked really hard or knew the right person(s). They have a cafeteria which is nice, but very expensive. Same as the gym. The people are fantastic, but forget being able to get to HR easily. I had the hardest time figuring out how to put in my two weeks notice when I found out I was moving and was late getting it in. It isn't very personable. You are a number in a system. Also, the elevator system takes forever."
good,"Humana used to be an enjoyable place to work. Now there's lack of leadership, micro managing and favortism. Management can't be trusted The pay is good but not worth the stress."
good,you have to do your job and not be questioning why they do some stuff. i didn't like the bait and switch for the seniors. most managers shouldn't be. g
good,"Humana has had three lay offs already this year and more are planned.  Very stressful and no job security.  They continue to demand higher productivity levels while increasing work loads and responsibilities of those left after layoffs.  Atmosphere is ""will I be next?"""
good,"Productivity is extremely important."
good,"I loved working from home. A typical day was signing in , calling your members and educating them on their chronic health conditions. The work culture is stressful having to meet utilization weekly. The hardest part of my job was trying to fit trainings in during the day. The most enjoyable part of my job was working from home."
good,"held multiple project meetings daily "
good,Good benefits and time off. A supposedly confidential survey was not confidential. My manager used my answers against me. Other than that problem I found the company good to work for.
good,"Meeting numbers/metrics is prority. Little respect for individual persons, more about meeting numbers."
good,"Favored young people over older adults, difficult to meet compliance when other departments did not respond on time. Steady hours with breaks and lunch."
good,Would answer the calls from members with question on their benefits that were in their plan.  Process the call and answer the question that I would to the best of my knowledge.
good,I expected a medical company but the department that I worked in simply had to do with programs that were offered to those with insurance. The database was put together in pieces in a small shop that included columns that were no longer valid or used.
good,"If you enjoy sitting at a desk all day, it is not that bad. The management was really nice. It is a heavy flow of calls coming through constantly, so if you do not like being on the phones all day, I would not recommend this job for you."
good,Its an ok place to work. The managers are very friendly and the environment is okay. The pay however leaves you wondering if its worth it. Its okay if you ar young but if you have a family it won't surfice.
good,"CM's are constantly being written up for the smallest things. They are being coached and pushed out by management. Even supervisors are being pushed out the door. Pay is poor compared to other HMO companies. Job is enjoyable because I love what I do. However, they are pencil pushers there."
good,Way to much is expected and the new metrics are tough to maintain. They are trying to have you be a one stop shopping for the caller and to reduce transfers.
good,It was a good job if you like working on computers all day and listen to people on the phone then listen to people on breaks about how their calls went and can work on 5 or more program on a computer at once.
good,"Too much work at not enough pay,most jobs are very stressful and the work load is way too much. Has its ups and downs the main thing is that it's hard to get a promotion. They don't value their workers although they pretend to promote wellbeing. Probably one of the worse companies I have ever worked for but I am thankful because they do offer work at home. That's the best part of the company. Just thankful to have a job at this point."
good,"fast paced positive work environment, organized and professional management, educational useful training to ensure you can complete job tasks efficiently"
good,Learned claims and ancillary work. Nice people and opportunity for growth. Very accepting of all cultures and respectful of all lifestyles. Workplace is clean and comfortable.
good,its ok job if your looking to get experience. The pay is decent and it can start you off in a sales role if thats what you desire to do . Cons very heaving micromanaged. job
good,"Most everyone you would meet was happy to be there and would smile in the halls.  One of the major problems was health issues that several people suffered from.  We were told that the building had mold problems and the issues had not been rectified, which resulted in chronic health issues for multiple employees who'd never had any problems prior.  The hardest part of the job was the lack of available overtime and little availability for growth.  There had been freezes put in place for over a year which resulted in little opportunity to move up within the company.  They also started laying off departments in response to the upcoming merger which has since been blocked."
good,"able to work from home, upper management not the greatest, workplace was very cultured, I learned great communication skills with Medicare recipients."
good,"It's a ok place overall, you have your pros and cons in every work place.  The work at home jobs are hard to get, just keep telling you in a few months and it's been 2 yrs, and I'm still in office."
good,hours were very flexible but job position was temporary so humana project can cancel on you at anytime with prior notice...I have faith that each year will get better
good,"As a coder, productivity is very important.  Dealing with the insurance companies and patients, verifying patient insurance.  Other than that the place was very communication and relationship, and celebrating the employees."
good,"It is a hard place to work for. Lots of changes and uncertainty. A lot of jobs have been outsourced overseas. "
good,"Bra jobb för de som vill lära sig."
good,"it is a good place to work, they lay off just like any other company does but not that bad, the pay was decent as well and had good benefits as well.."
good,Good culture that promotes work life balance.  Ability to gain experience in new areas by being assigned to new projects.  Management is demanding but fair in their assessment of employee performance.
good,"great and fun place to work with great benefits, such as students reimbursement program and 401k. good management and wonderful work environment. very friendly coworkers."
good,"micromanaged and no one listens to you, or cares what you have to say. the raises are not good there either, the work is easy but very micromanaged...."
good,"Typical day of work is constant incoming calls, learning about Medicare and member needs daily. Management is OK. Workplace can be a fun and nice environment if your within the right dept."
good,A typical day is usually balanced. Taking outbound calls from their members. Some nice some are not so nice due to the fact that the sales recruiters were not honest in regards to the benefits. Just getting the sale!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Typical day was helping people with their census"
good,"This job is for those that are retired that just want something to keep them occupied. You may become bored very fast because the job is repetitive with no excitement,"
good,"Poor management, no support when working in the field as a Care Manager. Work conditions at times very dangerous no support.  I really don't like to do this in the first place why can't a person apply for a job without being forced to do this."
good,"Humana is a great company. Plent of room to grow, and lots of new opportunies are given. definitley has culture. will always look forwsrd to come in to work."
good,Pay was great  but nobody knows what they're doing the training is way too long but everybody just puts up with everything because they pay so great it's a great job to have only because of the pay and you do learn a lot but the training is insufficient
good,"Before Aetna bought them out, the plans they sold were very competitive.  Both on the Medicare side of the business and for individual Dental & Vision plans.  Which made bonuses very lucrative as well.  After they bought them out, they started to cut commissions, lay off people, cut benefits & hourly pay and change the plans Humana sold.  An unfortunate turn of events."
good,"Support from coworkers. Lots of change all of the time including role,schedule and expectations. PTO and holidays off- most weekends off depending on the role."
good,"Although Humana was the contracted company that the outsource company contracted with, the Humana Family was extremely welcoming and a pleasure to work with on a daily basis."
good,I haven't worked there for over 14 years. Don't feel I could give any per taint information at this time...............................................
good,"Not what I expected, not rewarding as a nurse, not challenging, work at home is nice, have to be self motivated which is not a problem but not all coworkers are"
good,Working from home has been great. I enjoy the members I speak with as well as my teammates. The hardest part of this job is sitting all day on the phone. I really enjoy talking to people and educating them about their health conditions and being able to provide resources and support to better their health and well being.
good,"Structured, by the book, knowledgeable management, strict, employee reviews given quarterly, friendly co-workers, productive, advancement isavailable."
good,Enjoy the work from home opportunity and man of the benefits. The health insurance is very expensive and there is little for growth unless you are an RN or have an MSW. Had multiple large number lay offs past few years.
good,Humana is a great place to work especially if you enjoy helping others. I work in the pharmacy department so I help refill medications for members and I do get a joy out of doing so. The pay is great most of the people are as well. The department I am in does bonus every quarter again it has great perks.
good,"Most days, hold something new, so you don't face the typical redundancy of day to day work load. Sometimes, the hardest part about the job is work-life balance. The culture is good, and very health and education driven. There are ample opportunities for growth and development."
good,I think that this is a good place to work to get an understanding of insurance and how it works. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to work and providing excellent customer service.
good,"there is a chance for professional growth and advancement"
good,"It was fun to work here as it was a brand new facility. It was for-profit so only had market segments that would make money-- women's center, ortho and heart."
good,"Great job for high school students. Not much room for growth unless you have a career in retail. Long hours and low pay, but it comes with the territory."
good,It was a fun environment. The supervisors are pretty good. I had fun helping the seniors with their medicare insurance needs.
good,Place refill orders and track packages and provide overrides for members needing their medication. The most enjoyable part is hearing the sigh of release from members once you've solved their problems.
good,"quite a productive experience, management is superb and very professional atmosphere.  A very fun loving and easy going place to be in"
good,"This was a challenging turnaround. The model wasn't set up for success. For example, we took walk-in traffic as well as people making appointments. Depending on the acuity of the walk-in, the person with the appointment might end up waiting 4 hours to be seen. Interesting challenge."
good,"A typical day at work, consist of meeting production, The opportunity to learn new processes and systems to better help process claims."
good,"Majority of time spent on global initiatives to improving operating expense and consumer experience. "
good,"i gained a lot of customer service experience from working at Xerox. I learned about Medical claims, benefits, billing, and insurance. the hardest part about the job was telling members what they did not want to hear. You can hear the disappointment in their voices and I did not like that. But overall it was a great place to work"
good,Jag har lärt mig mycket genom att vara arbetsledare hur det är att bedömma olika personer i en anställningsintervju om dom skulle passa i vårat team och fungera med brukaren.
good,Typical work day would include educating members on there accounts and with various issues. Being able to assist a member that would be having an issue and not fully understand or frustrated was rewarding.
good,"Working in HCPR is a fast paced environment. The training is about three weeks long. After training, job shadow is a week or long depending on the individual.

good,A typical day at work consist of me taking customer service calls for a mail order service that delivers medications for people over 65 with medicare although the job is not professional at all I have learned a lot at the job and the hardest part about leaving the job is leaving some very nice people.

good,"Very busy enivorment with ample room for growth"
good,Its the worse job ever if your thinking of doing this job just don't! They will get after you for every little thing you do wrong if you are at all centavo to critics this is not the job for you. The customers are really bad but the management is worse. The other employees are the only thing that kept me there for a year. I loved the people I worked with.
good,Taking care of members needs by assisting them with their healthcare management. Assisting members in getting services to help them in their disease management.
good,This is an ok company to work for. Management needs help with organization. The employees are great in the dept that I worked in

good,"Humana was a great company to work for, however the work life balance was horrible. Not being able to take vacation and working mandatory overtime was tough."
good,"Nice place to work. Close to downtown, good people. Also they have flexible hours and nice starting pay. If you would like to work on the weekends saturday hours are available to you. Overtime is also a nice bonus if you would like to add it to your schedule."
good,This company tries very hard to exemplify good traits unfortunately they are sometimes blinded to the terrible behaviors of their upper leadership.
good,Work at home to optimize members healthcare through care management.  Assess and evaluate members for the appropriate level of care
good,"A typical day was talking to providers and clients on medical claim, met some really nice co-workers. Management never really engaged except to report or write up in my department. Made it very uncomfortable"
good,"Uncertain future with merger forthcoming, unstable and inconsistent workplace culture. Compensation can be lucrative if assigned to the appropriate campaign."

good,"The staff at this company was very supportive of each other. The caseloads were challenging but overall, it was enjoyable seeing the clients."

good,farely decent job. good boss and management. moderate work experience. co worker did not have much of social life but overall okay to work with
good,"Seeing everyone work towards a common goal, our Enterprise Goal, is exciting. Embracing agile work, but still not easy to progress, if you're not closely connected to an office."
good,"I love working at Humana, If it wasn't for me being lay off I think I would still be there.  Humana is located right downtown."
good,I learned a lot at this job as well again the customer service training was a brutal 4 months but when it was over you were ready for that phone center.
good,Hard to deal with management. this job require you to have tough skin. The pay is not enough. Good job for students and adults that need some experience.
good,"Fun, friendly work environment. Learned a lot about coding and icd-10. Management was great, no  micromanaging. Lots of worker cooperation from the co-workers."
good,"Humana has the potential to be an outstanding organization.  The position is satisfying and provides a nice sense of accomplishment.  The current management is weak and without clear direction.  While Humana says there are lots of advancement opportunities, the reality is that these opportunities are very limited. There is a current culture that anyone from the outside is an expert and more qualified than the seasoned employees.  With the pending Aetna buy-out job stability is questionable."
good,"responded to complaints by members, prepared data for peer review, conducted studies as part of NCQA accreditation, identified areas of patient care which were compliant to discipline standards or in need of attention, reviewed care against contract requirements.  Worked with lots of latitude from supervisor but expectation to seek assistance early when encountered"
good,I learned the most common prescribed generic medications and their uses. I faxed prescribers on misc. issues on received prescriptions. I learned how to read and interpret sig codes and directions of prescriptions. I learned about duplicate therapy drugs and their reactions.
good,"Good to have a new place to work everyday. Better to work from home. No ""office politics"". Hardest part was indecisive management and turnover. Co-workers were very helpful."
good,"Unless you work at home, the office can be very gloomy - and generally it could be only you in it. (Because everyone works at home)"
good,"Company has excellent benefits, long work hours and great people to work with, leadership is based on performance not leadership so poor front line leaders"
good,"I worked in the welcome calls department as a Limited term employee. In welcome calls we took health assessments with the new members that just signed up for a new plan with Humana. When I first started out it was okay but once I was there not even a good month I was already dreading the job. I hated being there! Now don't get me wrong its easy anybody can do the job I was great at it. But it wasn't challenging me at all, it was just so boring. You say and do the same thing over and over again all day, they expect you to have a certain number of survey completions everyday.. Its all about the numbers to them!! Its outbound and sometimes inbound if your lucky or in good with the managers. Members are rude not even expecting a health survey, doesn't trust you when you say you are Humana!  Management is alright they did work with me before on a certain situation I was having so I cant say they are that bad! But if they are in the busy season they really aren't that generous. They have a new manager of the department and she is really nice and walks around the whole floor making sure she speaks to everyone.. Love her!! Maybe she will make some changes around there! The pay was really good compared to my previous job so I was happy with that! There was no benefits since I was a LTE which is understandable I guess.. Job security was not good again I was limited term through Humana and I never really knew if I had a job or if I didn't. One week they would say our time was coming to an end and then the next week they would say never mind. That's another thing management was always going"
good,"Overall, benefits are good. Work life balance is fair. Co-workers were great! It is a very cyclical sales environment."
good,"i loved working with the company but they also moved to Louisville, KY so i did not transfer to that location. now with a degree on hand need to be in a location within the field of study."
good,Seemed like a good company but this review is irrelevant since I was there a number of years ago and things have changed a lot I'm sure.
good,It's a great position. I just want to expand and grow. It is a production based position and i'm trying to get out a production environment.
good,"enjoy working here - I loved the job and I enjoyed my co workers as well as management. I worked from home so I had my virtual office set up- I would set my appointments, set my my own seminars for sales or education and do the presentations. Also you do your own community branding and present yourself two the market. Working with the 65 and older community to me is enjoyable, so I looked forward to going to work each day."
good,"Our work day is pretty routine for the most part at Humana. We will work on a certain product that our managers have written on the board or a product that we were working on from the prior day or days. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of incoming calls from members enrolled in the Medicare part D plan, or Medicare replacement plan. Responsible for the processing of member refill request, ensuring accurate demographic information was obtained from member, also ensuring to advised member of any open balances as well as the copay for the current orders placed."
good,OVERALL: Better and management is needed. Management is not fair to employees. A corporation of this magnitude should run more efficiently and effective.
good,"Great place to work, people and management are great. Learned many aspects of the company and enjoyed everyday there. Would of loved to retire from Humana but life happens and opportunities persist."
good,"UHG is an amazing company to work for hands down, the training was amazing and there processes awesome."
good,"Being a multi-tasker, people pleaser, a team player.  Hardest part I would say was having members using foul language."
good,"A nice place to work, lots of opportunity, a different approach to healthcare benefits"
good,Good opportunity to work from home after a year.  Understanding/supportive managers.  Coworkers are awesome. Constant change makes it a new challenge every day!
good,This particular insurance company does not offer good medical benefits for it's employees. They also do not provide an accurate list of providers who accept the insurance benefits. They do offer other wellness incentives and the ability to work from home.
good,"Working as a customer service representative is wonderful. Humana's members are the greatest people to work for. The work environment for a vendor company for Humana isn't the worst place to be, but there is definite room for improvement. It can be biased at times, and some supervisors don't try hard for the employees. Most coworkers are great, though. THey make it eaier to be there day to day."
good,It was a learning exiperience in this position with this company.
good,"I was a work comp Marketing Rep for Humana which got into WC when several other markets were entering the Work Comp arena."
good,"The workplace was typically managed in a professional, efficient manner."
good,Great company to work for. Company that values there employees.
good,"With all the changes in the HealthCare space, Humana was an interesting place to work for the past two years.  Trying to compete with United for market share in WI, Humana was struggling at best to keep up with the competition."
good,"Being on the phone all day was not a problem, it was the lack of comprehensive training, systems constantly going down and unwillingness to budge on work schedule to allow for continued education. (Iqor is a part customer service that works in behalf of Humana)"
good,"Humana can be a good place to work, possibility to eventually move up."
good,Worked their to support the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.
good,"My co-workers were awesome, but the management was awful. nobody there appreciated your work."
good,Humana has been around for a long time so I am sure it is a good company.  However it was a bad fit for me.  The job was mindless and boring.  Would not ever try to work there again
good,"•	Analyze applications  needs on their groups "
good,"Great people to work with, I had a lot of fun working there. Working holidays, nights and weekends get old."
good,This company is a fun environment with a lot of detail to customer service.
good,"Good benefits, good work environment, a lot of opportunity for growth."
good,"Started my nursing career there many years ago, the hospital has now changed several times, and is now longer Humana, but I still got a variety of experience there ."
good,"rude coworkers, lead, nobody to talk to. humana is awesome but rightsource rx sucks!"
good,"I learned about Medicare, contracting and IPA's. We had many training sessions to assist us with our jobs."
good,"A typical day in this position is answer phone calls from Humana Agents answering any questions they have, finding solutions to their problems. "
good,"A typical day, handling incoming calls from member and providers in regards to their dental insurance, as well as claims payments processing. "
good,"1. Challenging Project."
good,"This a very good company to work for, flexible hours, requires a little more than average computer skills. Since I work from home I do not have interaction with other co-workers and that is the downside of the job."
good,"Daily review clinical data to assist the member with preauthorization to long term acute care hospital working directly with the Regional Medical director. Also, Skilled Nursing Facility continued stay with weekly reviews of clinical data to ensure proper level of care with each member."
good,"Good company, but after you make branch manager it is unlikely you will move any further.  Even thought this is a financial institution it is very difficult to obtain a position with a bank if you solely rely on this position as experience."
good,"Answer an average of 15-25 calls a day concerning billing and health care plan questions and concerns. During my stay at this job I learned the difference between the different plans and when enrollment season is. The co-workers were all from different backgrounds but all worked together effectively to achieve satisfactory ratings from callers. The hardest part was the first few months of learning and being tested on the different plans and being able to take the calls, record data, and solve their issues while dealing with disgruntle callers. The most enjoyable part of the job was during breaks when you could relieve stress by chatting with fellow co-workers."
good,I have opened new stores in charge of the staff hiring and training.  In my resume it will tell you how I work with other I like to work as a team and learn new skills to better myself. I really enjoy working with the staff like helping customers .. I am a very fast learner and like working hard ..The most enjoyable of the job is making a deference in helping others that's me it feels good to do..
good,Terrible Support from HR when issues arises. No matter what the case is about upper manger will win the case and you will be terminated without any prior notice.
good,My duties were clearly laid out.  I enjoyed the people that I worked with and felt that I was a valuable member of the company.
good,"Productive work environment, specialize in health insurance claims and some pharmaceutics. Learned medical terminology,prescription terminology and how to deal with customers in all situations."
good,"Managed care insurance company...management not very supportive, day time work hours with no weekends.  Heavy work loads"
good,"multiples funciones"
good,Incoming calls about health care insurance where I learned terminology and procedure in heath care industry. Not the most professional environment and a very quick turn over rate.
good,"The experience depends on the department. "
good,The job changed over the years and the value of the company went down
good,"My day starts at 7:00am, working with several clients within the organization. I write the dental policies and procedures used by claims processors to process the dental claims coming in."
good,I learned about fraud and its affects on healthcare while working at Humana.
good,Good work life balance would recommend others working there
good,"Call center, sales. Motivation to become successful at position."
good,"My day at work is spent sitting at a desk reading medical records. I have expanded my medical knowledge of coding while working as a medical coder. Also, while working as a medical coder, I have gained more insight to several chronic medical conditions. I enjoy having my peers and coworkers around to ask them questions while reviewing records. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to work from home three days a week."
good,Humana was a productive workplace that allowed me to make suffient enough money to take care of my family.
good,"A very good place to work if you are able to enter at your highest competency level. Starting at a lower position, it is extremely difficult to move to your most qualified position. The lower position puts you in a stigmatized status as that being your highest ability level. Moving upward can only be done at very small leaps and you have to be in each position for 2 years before moving again."
good,GREAT place to work if you can get in as some people find the process very difficult.
good,"Thanks to working with the Humana Medicare Project, I have learned a lot about Medicare and the healthcare system."
good,"Good Job flexible hours, Co workers good and management good "
good,"Due to the changing of the guard, Humana is moving forward with innovation few companies now enjoy. Humana is the only carrier that literally offers an entire spectrum of health and wellness products without having to utilize services of competitors such as AFLAC. My role as an Enrollment Advisor allows me to frequently interact with brokers, employer groups and employees. The most enjoyable part for me is counseling employer groups. I also train internal partners, brokers, outside - of - Humana Enrollers and sales staff on positioning and enrolling worksite products and benefits. The hardest part of the job is lack of management support."
good,Excellent place to work and balanced personal life.Best work environment.
good,Very unorganized business. Supervisors were never there you needed them. Management doesn't care about employees.
good,"Collaborated with multiple IT teams external to our department - enjoyed working with very smart, savvy resources daily on projects that have a positive impact on the Humana member and provider experience. My work had a direct, positive effect on improving the quality of the healthcare and support of our members"
good,Overall the job was great. They scheduling was great. Not to fond of the constant changes.
good,Was able to help medicare members both new and also retaining them
good,typical: nothing-i created the center
good,I have worked here for almost 10yrs and do not even make $40k/yr and I have a B.S. degree. Case rested!
good,Grade calls daily and coach agents for improvement. Opportunity to grow within company at a face pace. Learn new things weekly if there are change of campaigns. Co-worker share perspectives on aspects of quality to help solve resolutions. Fun to know that others exert knowledge from me to be able to help them build career profession and sucess.
good,productive workplace. co workers were fun to work with. managers were a little stand offish.
good,"Good company, really enjoyed working with customer to keep their retention."
good,"Good Benefits, Great Employees. Great Learning environment to provide Perfect Service !!"
good,long 10 hour shifts 5 days a week and sometimes Saturday's. Too much of Supervisor walking around the warehouse and watching your every move.
good,Typical 9 to 5 office job. Lots of potential in this organization.
good,"Get to work check emails for new updates or to do's for your work day, complete any unfinished projects that are time senistive. Check with team lead for any other scopes relative to your project etc."
good,Entered prescriptions daily. I learned to enjoy my job more and about the new prescriptions coming out. We were kept informed off all the new laws that were being reviewed or will be coming out. I really didnt talk to too many people there but the few that i did i enjoy being around. They made what can be a lonely job not seem so lonely. i think the most difficult part was reading the prescriptions.
good,I learned invaluable communication skills while building customer relationships over the phone.
good,"Loved the interaction with members and the ability to assist with questions, concerns and issues. Expectations of employer extremely high with lack of proper and effective training."
good,I loved it there because RNs are truly making a difference helping members take better care of their health. You would think a phone call does not make a difference but it does and some of these members look forward to the monthly calls. Some of the managers are wonderful. If you are lucky to have a good manager then you may be able tolerate this job. Some managers are favored more than others probably due to their attitiude and work performance. I hated it there because the amount of calls you have to make each month is not realistic besides all the changes that occur on a daily basis. It is very suffocating to have to meet unrealistic numbers but yet perform other requirements of the job. Care plans and goals are required on each member which are required by NCQA and not at all realistic either. Part-time is not available and one rarely works 40hrs a week if employed full-time. Work time lost has to be made up to meet numbers. This job could be so much better but the bottom line is what counts.
good,"Working for Humana Rightsource has taught me many things. I have been employed with this company for a year now and love the hours and my coworkers. Typically I work 9am-5:30pm Monday-Friday with weekends off which I enjoy a great deal. I work in a call center where Humana Insurance member's call in to refill prescription medications, pay premiums and other balances on their account, ask questions about the Humana Insurance, etc. I love working with others and assisting customers with any needs they may have."
good,"My first job as a therapist, was fun and a great place for learning"
good,I was hired on a pilot program and my job position was eliminated within 12-months of hire. My career hasn't been the same since.
good,Humana was a interesting experience i felt like i was really helping people but go figure they changed that too nearing my end of employment
good,"My time at Humana was breif, I learned a few key concepts of the insurance world, which helped me to be more successful at BCBS."
good,"A typical day at work is striving to attend to customers needs all while working by Humana's number one goal, Perfect Service."
good,"Good Job, learn new skills, good pay, No other benefits. Temporary job"
good,excellent learning experience about the health insurance how medicare work the pro and cons of it seeinf how all management isnt professional
good,"Great Company to Work for and looking forward to returning. Humana gave many job opportunities within the Company. Hurtful when they had to do lay offs. But that's the past, seeking to get back with a great Company."
good,"I was hired to work outside of any traditionally placed department for my specific skillset. The group I worked with was friendly, but I could tell early on that they were not prepared for what they hired me to do which created more work for me. Overall, the experience was good. Management was responsive and our goals were met."
good,Great company and very progressive. Often are too advanced and lack the basics. Many meetings and executive approvals to advance your work. Very bureaucratic approach to work.
good,"Great company, mediocre managers and supervisors, great benefits and compensation. Mandatory overtime and weekend work. Long, boring, classroom training required."
good,Humana overall is a good place to work.  They are very conscientious about the associates. The call center in which I worked in was very difficult to get acclimated mainly because during training one does not receive nearly enough hands on training needed to realistically keep up with all the demands of management.
good,"Was not employees there long enough to give a review. It seemed like a great opportunity, but the workload was outrageous. There are multiple processes that you have to go through to ensure the member/customer has accurate information and is satisfied with their call experience."
good,Great trainers and training programs that sets you up for success within the workplace. Great culture with many avenues to get involved in the culture
good,A typical work day at Humana Military is super long and stressful. There are a lot of things you have to know while working for the government and for the military. There are a lot of rules that you have to follow and make sure that you're always on top of everything there.
good,"The company is always growing (where your workload triples) or shrinking (when you’re constantly waiting to see if you survived the next round of layoffs). It is 100% work from home which is nice, but you shouldn’t expect to be away from your computer outside of lunch and a few breaks. There are productivity requirements that only matter if you don’t meet them. You’re never rewarded for exceeding them."
good,"Over-worked, big demands, quantity over quality.  Started as an outstanding job became an overworked, underpay, unreachable demands.  Lack of communication between higher level and regular employees.  Case load was over 450 case to contact every 2 months.  A load of different assessments to be made. Lack of support from other departments.  Never was a supervisor available to resolve issues or to support employees."
good,"Humana was a great work environment as far as call centers go. If help was needed it was readily available, extremely fast paced during the peak medicare season."
good,I enjoyed working in the environment and learning a new trade and their management staff was very supportive and understanding to personal needs. Even though it began to become stressful they were able to accommodate that for me through their EAP program for employment support and counseling.
good,Good company overall. Hardest part of job: Reporting structure and job roles/work processes are changing constantly. Management not replacing/hiring enough staff resources.
good,Good place for those who want to work at home or in the office. The jobs roles are not as clear cut as they seem on the descriptions.  It’s a “who you know” kind of work environment.
good,Would have stayed as they value their employees. Very conservative and super-careful business model. Remuneration is not in-keeping with the industry standards.
good,"As a Clinical Innovations Specialist you will contribute to the success of Humana’s business strategy by collecting broad based information and gathering resources and data in order to arm the team with the tools necessary to enhance consumer engagement, choice, and trust."
good,"Humana is good company to work for, the opportunity to work from home has been very wonderful. I am looking for something part time at this time and my current position does not allow that."
good,"Answer high volume of calls."
good,"There is a lot of promise of advancement and reward, but in my experience there is a lot of choas, lack of sleep, and being over worked. Fortunately, the work environment itself isn't toxic, it's jsut the amount of work to be done is soul crushing. I'm exhausted and drained."
good,I didn't stay with Humana long enough to accurately review the company.  I was only there for a period of about 4 months.  The experience was very brief.
good,Very fast paced. I learned about telephonic/remote health care management. Management was fair but firm. Workplace culture was average. Adjusting to daily workflow changes was the hardest part of the job. Coworkers were most enjoyable part of the job.
good,I feel like mgmt pushed downsizing and I was unfairly let go. I loved the atmosphere and my co-workers.  The benefits and the incentives were awesome.
good,Humana was not my favorite job. We had a lot of mandatory overtime and worked pleanty of long hours. Scheduling off time was often difficult as well..
good,"Worked at home. Learned a lot of computer techniques. Required to take a number of courses on Customer service techniques, ethics, computer safety and privacy regulations. Very team oriented and diverse culture. Maintaining constantly changing quotas. Working as a team with great managers."
good,"Humana is a great company, but one bad apple in management can make a world of a difference in the working atmosphere of a such a huge company, one finger can cover the  sun, and one  person with authority  can cover all the good a company can be."
good,"Well, during the interview process I questioned about the prospect of cold calling or outbound dialing to which the person interviewing me stated ""for underperformers there would be outbound dialing and cold calling""."
good,difficult if not impossible to take time off. you had to give a 90 day notice or either just call in sick which is not something I was comfortable doing.
good,"Its a good environment, not a lot of security, always laying people off."
good,"Programming environment is not great.  Access to users was cut off when Humana bought CarePlus, which makes it difficult to manage user expectations and build relationships.  Other areas of the company are great to work with. "
good,its very stressful and cut throat work environment the people are amazing and its hard because the managers care and want to help but the actual company prevents them from doing the right thing for the employee rather then for the company
good,Great CEO. There are pockets of high performers who strive to bring out the best in others while growing the business. Company has been trying to evolve quickly in a highly volatile industry.
good,Lived through a massive downsizing.  They have a policy of only keeping contractors for 1 year if they don't have perm positions.  Wages are in line with cost of living but not national standards.
good,Humana offers no career growth and makes people work on ancient technologies. If you are passionate about your career please stay out of this place. Humana doesn't offer any internal raises or promotions.
good,"Typical day involves sitting at your  desk trying to meet your goal"
good,"I started in claims processing and had good numbers and got along with most people. I went for a higher job in the Triage department, I was the first person in Triage, then we hired four more, then I was tapped to be lead. Management was very helpful and they reward hard work with opportunity. However they do keep track of people but as long as you keep inside the lines - you're fine."
good,policy changes was to rapid between Humana and Medicare .When i was there as an employee human had to do a lot to keep there contract with medicare  and they did not care that the employees were properly informed on changes
good,"good hours overtime available. room for advancement, supervisors and training was excellent. also had a great benefits package. it was easy to travel to"
good,"Worked with great talents who were my fellow associates. Management shackled by politics and fear of being shown up by new talent, so blocked growth and development of associates."
good,"I can say it’s a good company to work for but with my 2 1/2 years of being with the company, two mangers were fired, 4 team leads were fired.  We don’t have a manger at this time, they had to bring another manger from another site until the position is filled. I have seen numerous agents leave for better opportunities."
good,Teams in department are understaffed so many days work extra hours. Not compensated fairly to other departments within company. Team spends 3 hours per day trying to manage inventory because there are so many reports. Love working with the team but is very difficult to manage all tasks and projects assigned.
good,"Very challenging and rewarding environment with many different paths to advance/change careers.  However, senior leadership was too far removed from day to day challenges and many thought that knew more than they really did.  Needed to trust the subject matter experts more.."
good,"I feel the day was OK on average. Looking to grow and allow myself better career advancements, My overall goal is to become a better person and grown with my new employer."
good,"Through the many years I have been working there, it has gotten worse and more cutthroat each year by layoffs, forced retirement, and employee jobs being replaced by contracting companies."
good,"Daily pre-certification for home health, hospice, and infusion therapy.   Hired for in-patient reviews due to prior experience, however, never assigned nor transitioned to in-patient review."
good,Great years working at Humana. But with layoffs occurring every month the environment is stressful.Focus only on numbers. I will say you do get a nice severance package.
good,This place of employment is definitely less stressful than retail but it has its own separate set of stressors. It is difficult to have suggestions put into place by management. The managers definitely listen to the employees but seem to run into red tape when they move something up the chain of command.
good,Good work environment that allowed you to do your daily job responsibilities to the best of your ability. I worked individually but also communicated daily with my manager on various projects.
good,Leadership isn’t always great but overall company is a great place to work. Good benefits and flexible work environment. Company does hire from within which is nice.
good,"I enjoyed my job very much, Pleasant atmosphere not put under stress to do the job. Supervision was easy to work with. Enjoyed working the split shift which made it nice for more days off."
good,"Humana was a great place to work, but work-life balance has deteriorated over the past few years.  Management lacks communication with employees, and it affects stress levels, especially working in healthcare field"
good,"In response to consumer trends and the ACA, like other health insurers, Humana is seeking to evolve into a more customer-centric company. Successes and lots of bumps in the journey."
good,Building personal relationships with your associates is the greatest part about my job. Helping their professional development and building new doors to help them succeed into a different role. Down side of the role is that is not consistent and you can certainly feel as though what you are doing is not good enough.
good,"multi changes taking place related to job, forms and paper work, PTO. worked for home and you had to clock in or out even for  bathroom breaks, Expected to get all your work done for the  day even if you had multi meetings such as TEAM meetings , town hall, committees. I've  had a  couple  of good coaches that I 've worked for too in the ten years that I was there. Towards the end of my job I struggle to find balance between work and family, Overall the job was a good one and for most part I  enjoyed it."
good,Career advancement is possible but compensation is laughable. Nice friendly environment. A lot of micro managing. Petty management will look for any excuse to terminate employment.
good,"I worked for Humana for almost 4 years, and applied for many positions, and only got 2 interviews.  Management did not help with advancement.  Benefits are good"
good,Employer benefits are great. Easy to build up paid time off hours and great overtime opportunities. Flexible schedule and tuition reimbursement is a plus
good,"Fast pace sells environment. Accountable for Pairing, Selling ,advising clients on available products suitable for their needs, such as healthcare, dental, vision, supplemental coverages, preventive care, meals on wheels etc. Enrolling clients into health plans, making monthly payments."
good,"Very fast paced, sometimes stressful environment, never a dull moment. Lots of room to move into other departments if willing to advance.  Very structured on the call center side, not for everyone, but I enjoyed my time there very much."
good,The company was generous with the compensation and the job was a fair job.  I would work there again if the opportunity came up.  The management was good.
good,"Too many changes in a short period of time, My teal manager is good, I do work from home is hard to be connected to the PC for the entire day, if you move away more than 5 min the pc will shutdown. I have a good team and management, but salary is not competitive. and my work hours."
good,"Humana is a great place to work for depending on the department. We are really diverse, and there are values to live by. There are plenty of incentives working here."
good,"To protective of the data.  Extremely difficult and restrictive, way too  much red tape to get any software as well as access to key areas surrounding analysis outside of ""normal"" duties."
good,Working from home - answer phone calls to provide Humana customer's with efficient help with their questions regarding their benefits.  I learned how to manage my time wisely and received great experience on the programs that Humana kept all their data.  The hardest part of the job was not being in an office surrounded by co-workers.  The part I enjoyed the most was not have to put on work clothes and the amount of gas and time that I saved.
good,Assisted and educated physicians on the requirements required to be contracted with a government agency. The atmosphere was enjoyable with emphasis on team work.
good,"Humana was a great company to work for. Work at home options, significant training and support when needed. Must be a motivated self starter and have the ability to work independently. Benefits and compensation was fantastic. Only downfall was being laid off after being employed for less than a year."
good,"Check in with supervisor, log-on to system to assist insurance members.Learned about customer service via phone call, ticketing system and to escalate to experts"
good,"There are some benefits, but many things that need to change. There are many opportunities for growth and expansion, but the recruitment process doesn't make growth easy."
good,"Pretty solid company, has its pros and cons, well organized, quiet environment, very clean office building. Everyday is different. Company is heavily involved in the local communities and support a variety of culture functions."
good,Humana is a large company with a lot of work at home employees. I placed outbound calls to member which I enjoyed. I was required to meet a certain number of calls each day as well as maintain talk time. I was laid off twice with this company.
good,"A solid 3-star rating.  Humana is not for the light-hearted.  The pace is extremely high, as well as demands to deliver, which can press work/life balance.  That said, Humana can also be a place of high reward for those that stick with it."
good,My review of Humana is not a positive one.  The management team do not offer assistance. The training provided was not one that was conducive to successful obtainment of productivity goals.  Feedback was only of the negative consequences for not obtaining goals.  Positive reinforcement was non existent.
good,"I enjoyed the work at Humana, but peak season was a nightmare. Out of my class of 32, only 3 are still employed there. I got sick with an extended illness and my doctor requested I take three weeks off. I was let go because of this. If your sick, even with a doctors note, you still receive an occurrence."
good,Flexible hours. Inclusive environment. Work from home is an option for many positions. Previous management was open and made employees feel valued but my department was phased out in order to cut costs by outsourcing to India
good,"I genuinely like helping people. Working with the elderly population teaches patience, communication skills, and problem solving methods. The hardest part of my job is when i am rarely not able to meet the customer needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is the many members lives I touched over the 8 years I have worked here. Providing members with the health plans they need are of great importance, I educate them so they can enjoy their healthcare experience."
good,Great job to get somewhere you really want.  It really depends who is your manager and what is your job function at Humana. But great place to work.
good,Mi día a día es asesorar a los clientes con ofertas y promociones y atenderles en toda las dudas que tengan .
good,"The promise of career advancement seemed to fizzle out rather quickly.  Less flexibility in hours made things more difficult.  With the current mentality of most people who are purchasing insurance, the job can be emotionally taxing, either from people who will blame you for their problems regardless of how involved you actually were, to situations arising where there is no way for you to help someone in need.  As the company began to show less interest in our well being as employees it became more difficult to separate the emotional troubles of the clientele.  It may just be because I had had the job before this turn and someone entering new may find it easier to deal with, but I new it could be much better, but management seemed to not care anymore."
good,It was a bit repetitive but was a great learning experience for me considering i had no experience. They gave us excellent training. The department i worked at were nice enough to help us whenever we needed any help.  I loved working there and if given the chance i would do it again.
good,"There is some room for advancement if you are willing to put in a lot of hours and flexibility. I have great, great coworkers"
good,"Working for this company was okay. It was a productive environment, i mastered problem resolution there. Management is not very ethical. Little integrity of responsibility for their lack of positive decision making skills. I would never work for this company again."
good,"Numbers are made to seem more valuable than the employees making the numbers. High stress environment, but the members you speak with make everyday worth your while. Most enjoyable part of this job is the compensation, and the satisfaction you get from helping those you reach out to on a daily basis."
good,"Great job if you do not require any training as you will not receive any. "
good,inbounds calls of irrated and/or disrespectful customers.Management attemps to improve the workplace with potlucks and other similar activities. Glass ceiling environment.
good,"Working on the Business requirements with SME. "
good,"Decent place to work outside of peak season.If you enjoy to work mandatory overtime 20 hours a week 4 months a year,you might be able to advance."
good,Working for Humana Inc. was a very rewarding experience. The top management team worked hard and expected the same work ethic from the subordinates
good,I would review correspondence from medical providers and determine whether a claim could be adjusted or if the processing of the claim is maintained. We could bounce questions off of each other to make sure we are all following the same processes. I was able to get up as I needed for a break whenever I wanted as they were not scheduled as long as I only took 15 minutes in the morning and again in the afternoon. Sometimes it was hard to maintain the hourly rate of completed correspondence if there were complex issues to resolve.
good,"Everyone at the company make an effort to help employees succeed.  Good training, quality, and management."
good,"My position as health educator was a rewarding job, helping people work through many health problems, ie. smoking cessation, weight loss, exercise programs etc.  The managed care arena was not very well received at the time."
good,": Completed routine and moderated complex data analysis on projects and wellness/engagement. Entered data into spreadsheets, compile data and also cross checking, reviewing and analyzing data. Entered processing and closing aborted cases using Microsoft office and company system. Data entry. Coordinated and planned meetings. Communicate with members."
good,"typical day is answering 80 to 100 calls per day from agents/brokers, providers and members. I learned to multi-task and navigate more systems while on a call. The hardest part was to document four templates per call. The most enjoyable was to have members say to me that I was able to achieve their expectations after several calls made previously."
good,a great place to work. great hours sdkvmcksdvksdmmvksdvkskvsd
good,"Subsidiary of Humana, Inc. who provide exceptional service and value for the TRICARE program and beneficiaries."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in , reading emails to see what changes has occured, handling calls for military memebers and their families, making them feel more comfortable and safe that they are getting the best quality of care for all that they have done... I can say that I have one of the best supervisors there is.. She is very understanding and she will work with you if you dont understand something, she does not micro manage which makes things alot more comfortable for me .. My co workers are very supportive and respectable people as well... The best part of my job is using the knowledge that I have to help someone"
good,Good company but no oportunity for advancement. Strong culture and values with great benefits.
good,"A typical day at work would be facing the computer ensuring patient, doctor, and medication safety in the failed claims department. I learned to use different programs in the failed claims system such as, prior authorizations, insurance clearance, medication amount sufficiency, and so on, to ensure that patients get the medication needed in a timely manner. Management team was pretty good for the most part, at least speaking for my team. Co-workers were nice and friendly, team based and helpful. Hardest part of the job would be the constant changes that were required to get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the potlucks that we had as a team or as a whole company.  "
good,I sorted insurance claims that came in. I was also trained to work in the mail room and filming room. My co-workers were easy to get along with. Management was pretty laid back and easy to work for. I really enjoyed the hands on work.
good,"Initially, as I stated in the resume section, my job consisted of reviewing Pre-autorization request for services being requested by Humana members. I would contact the requesting provider to clarify the information and to request clinical information on the member that will allow me to make a determination. I would then compare that information (the member's medical history, signs and symptoms, photographs, ect) to their Humana contract, and the state or federal criteria and guidelines depending on the type of insurance. I would determine if the service was a covered benefit, and if it was, I would then determine if the member qualified for the service. If the member qualified, I would approve the request at my level and make notifications. If I could not approve, then the requested was forwarded, using Humana's standards, to a medical director for review. Once a determination was made by the medical director, notifications were made and a denial letter was written, reviewed, and mailed as necessary."
good,It's nice to work at home but the company in still structuring it's self in this area and it's hard to determine what is going to be different day to day. It makes it stressful. Otherwise it's a good job and I work with great people.
good,Very large patient population we were salaried employees who were required to work on many Holidays because of Market demands.
good,"Calling on seniors to review Medicare options. Selling Medicare Supplements, Life Insurance, other insurance products. The hardest part of the job was selling the other insurance products."
good,"A typical day at work starts with filing reports regarding coaching other agents to ensure that they perform their jobs effectively. As the processes often change, one of the requirements for my job is the ability to learn. Management is a little shaky. The coworkers at the job are a little on edge and eager to meet standards and goals, so there is definitely a sense of togetherness amongst the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to hear a customer's issue has been resolved. The worst part of the job is the fact that some issues that are detrimental to the consumer cannot always be resolved in a shorter time frame."
good,They have amazing benefits but totally do not focus on customer service which was upsetting. You can’t be personable with the patients and you’re calls are all scripted basically
good,"Humana has striving for more work/life balance and is constantly looking for employees to better themselves at work and outside. However, at the end of the day their #1 is their pockets."
good,"In- and out-bound calling of prospects for health, dental, and vision insurance, primarily with Medicare relared products. Monday-Friday most of the year, every day during Medicare AEP. More successful agents will earn greater opportunities for commisions."
good,"The day to day work was fine. Work life balance is great. They truly value family and giving back to the community. However, leadership was hit or miss."
good,"I enjoyed working from home which allowed for work and personal life balance.  My co-workers were great and was blessed to be under the supervision of great managers who cared about your well being and advancement.  Unfortunately, the opportunities for advancement as a health coach are limited,"
good,"Se trabaja a un ritmo acelerado, dispuesto a horas extras para cumplir con las necesidades de la empresa. El trabajo en equipo no es mucho, puede ser difícil encontrar un balance entre tiempo laboral y personal por las largas horas que permaneces en el lugar de trabajo."
good,"I worked at Humana for over 26 years.  Met a lot of people and learned a lot of things.  The pay was good.  Outsourcing of IT personnel is a huge problem, affecting the overall quality of work and creating communication issues.  "
good,"It’s a stressful environment, which most call centers are, other than that pay is good, they offer mandatory overtime even on Saturday some days. Go off of metrics"
good,Job was not the greatest but it helped me get by. Benefits were not too great. We did have the weekends off which was great however the schedule was always changing.
good,Some of the Supervisors over me was pretty nice overall and the place where the interview was clean and neat. The presentation was just as I expected right to the point.
good,"In my experience, who you know at Humana is key to your success and happiness.  Networking is important - doors and opportunities will open for you if you have the right connections."
good,There is abundance of work and not enough hours in a day to complete the work. Everyone has a high caseloads. There are daily changes in the department. Not enough Hands-On training before being assigned cases. At first glance great pay but after working the organization should be paying more for the position. The organization has good managers. 50k
good,It’s not easy to move up on your own merits. There’s a game being played that no one knows the rules to. You get to help customers daily and that is a plus.
good,Very self directed care manager role. Nice clients and good company to work for. Intense paperwork after seeing clients.  Hard to go from nursing role to a non medical care manager role
good,"I have been with Humana almost 9 years now and I have seen both, the good and the bad of the Company. As a motivated employee, the work has never been an issue. One thing that stands out is leadership. Depending on your leadership, you'll will either be motivated or unmotivated. Thanks to my previous roles, I am aware of what this company could be and the benefits of being under great leadership. "
good,it was ok. the pay was lackluster. the management was young and inexperienced I wish they did better training. The employee benefits are awful so keep that in the back of your head.
good,"Everyday is a learning experience at Humana. Working in an inbound call center can be extremely stressful, busy, and micro-managed. Humana does believe in Inspiring health and cultivating uniqueness. As far as management, not very personable/involved with the representatives but they make sure numbers are good. The most enjoyable part is when the members give the representatives a compliment and they are satisfied"
good,Då mycket egenansvar läggs på den pers.assen så är det bra för både brukaren och personalen.
good,This company has a great culture overall. Some departments are better than others. I learned a lot of different skillsets that will contribute to my overall career path.
good,Most enjoyable work from home
good,"Humana is in a very complicated business: healthcare insurance. As such, it is a difficult place to work. It is fast paced environment often with long days and weekends."
good,"Humana is a good company to work for as it offers a variety of benefits to all of their employees.  Offers a lot of work at home positions; however, promotions are less likely to happen when you work from home."
good,Good company enjoyed my job! I learned a lot working there that I will take with me in my new job opportunities. I really don't have anything more to say.
good,"It all depends on what department you're in and your manager."
good,"Too many changes are made within certain departments. You may apply for one position then be thrown into several others that you preferred not to be in. In the past, it was much better, but over the last year jobs have been eliminated and the options to move around internally have been minimized. Benefits are great as well as the option to work at home."
good,My training was very thorough and professional. The transition into my position was then seamless. My position is a limited term through the enrollment and new member process.
good,Overall a good place to work. They offer a lot of opportunities to become involved in the culture of the organization if you are interested. Good benefits.
good,"Is a great place to learn all about Medicare, however, the commission compensation is not good.  They change the policies on commission and other compensation, continually throughout the year."
good,"Very patient focused team that work well together. Learned a lot about CM, UM, some contracting. Helped them expand Value-based Care and their coding/MRA program. Helped with engagement and use of PAR labs. Expanded Palliative Care capabilities. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help from one to many members at a time with our work. The most difficult was the size of the enterprise with proper engagement between our local responsibilities and those expectations of the enterprise as a whole."
good,Telesales distributions stacked for a few. and total control by each frontline leader (FL)some managers do fair distribution and others may give all calls ex. 3 people out of 20 all calls and all others what outbound calls. Loyalty and adherence to company policy not rewarded. .  The the People First company theme??????
good,Laid off very unexpectedly.  Left a steady job to come here 3 months ago.   Very upset.   Why hire all these new employees to only lay them off in 3 months?
good,"Humana is a good place to work. You have the opportunity to work from home two weeks after starting.  Humana should chose their managers wisely, some managers are causing nurses to runaway from Humana."
good,"Humana is a great place to work, the company stresses work life balance but it does not matriculate to the managers of teams, therefore, the actual application of the work life balance fails at the management level. The supervisors do not have management training, and in many cases were unqualified for their roles. In essence the teams were better without supervisors. Humana also has poor problem solving skills. The work process changes monthly so you never really grasp a process and by the time you do they realized the processs has an error. If they did testing on new processes they would learn from the beginning what needs to be changed and whats faulty."
good,"Overall a good work culture. Great PTO benefits and relaxed coworkers for the most part. People are generally treated well. However, similar to other large insurance companies, the technology can be a bit dated. If you are really looking to innovate, you might be frustrated by the slow pace of technological progress here."
good,"At times you can be overworked but it typically balances out in the end.  The pay is good when you come from another company but if you stay within the company, increases are slow."
good,I have learned a lot over my course of working and still working for the company. it has truly been a humbling experience for me. It has helped me progress in making healthier decisions.
good,The department I worked in saw a need for their employees to step away from their desks. They offered different opportunities for the employees to exercise or walk/stretch outside of their normal break times. It allowed the team to come back fresh which allowed great production.
good,"Typical day is fast paced. Breaks and lunches balanced the time to recharge. Friendly workers, some of the best I have had the pleasure of working with. We got the work done, while having fun too."
good,"Ofrecen muchos beneficios, como planes medicos, vision etc. Ofrecen oportunidades de crecimiento dentro de la empresa. ambiente divertido y facil de adaptarse."
good,"Humana is a great company to work for aside from the stress levels of dealing with high volume calls back to back. The intensity of the calls can be a bit overwhelming having to deal with upset customers who have issues with their coverage plan. Their frustration is not with the employee, but the company itself. As a result, employees receive all the backlash and verbal abuse. The employee is at risk for higher stress levels if he/she does not know how to leave all work issues at the door and come with a fresh start on the next business day."
good,Humana overall was a good company!  I was in a stressful position that required a lot of overtime and if you were good it appeared it was hard to advance or promote out.
good,A typical day consists of being at a cubical for 8 to 12 hours a day. That is the hardest part of the job. Lots of required overtime. 7 days a week 12 hours a day during enrollment period.
good,"I enjoyed working at Humana, the atmosphere is great and it really is like a second family.  I have made some great friends that I will most likely have for life now and couldn't be happier with the experience I have gotten from there."
good,The inbound call center is very fast paced and busy with many phone metrics that need to be met daily. There wasn't as many team meetings or interactions in this department.
good,"Good company, however, no job security and minimal opportunities for advancement. Benefits are good and PTO allocation is generous. Ability to work from home is a plus."
good,"this job has flexibility hours."
good,"The most typical day at work is when the patients come in mad cause they have to stand in line and wait to be called up to the window so they get very inpatient."
good,I have been extremely fortunate to have been placed on two teams that are outstanding and supportive. I have also been blessed with two outstanding Coaches and Clinical Operations Managers. I work from home
good,"Very little interaction with other colleagues, repetitive work, little positive reinforcement,  little time spent on growth and learning/development due to much focus on meeting quotes"
good,"I learned a lot about software testing and corporate culture. They do have a heavy emphasis on employee wellbeing. the benefits could have used some work, however."
good,"visiting clients giving information about their healthcare.  reviewing medication and assessing patients,  attending to patient and family needs.  assuring patients safety.  reporting patient concerns"
good,"This is an ok place to work.They show little regard for pregnant employees. Don't apply for temporary positions. Worked as a temporary employee and they knew I was pregnant when I was hired. However, I was not allowed to take time off for prenatal appointments. I ended up quitting due to this."
good,In the telesales department you must pass the state board for insurers test. There are many other tests for you to pass. Once all tests are passed you must be good at converting incoming calls to a lead or you will not be kept on as an employee.
good,It's a nice place to work. I've learned many things from different depts I've worked in. Flexible work schedules. Co-workers are nice. Management has been helpful.
good,It's a large company with lots of room for movement but Humana's future in Louisville is unknown.  Some area have room for advancement but the future is very uncertain in the area.
good,"Daily Learning"
good,I enjoyed the medical field immensely. I LOVED the patients. I was in school for nursing. But overtime I began resenting the medical field for what it had become. Many patients (Geriatric) would come in crying because the way managed health care changed. They were no longer allowed to see the doctors they had trusted for years and were forced to start over with new physicians. Got out of the field quickly after.
good,"Humana offers VERY competitive pay! And the amount of time-off they offer is also incredibly generous. However, at least as far as working in their Waterside location, or even in their Medicare dept there's a lot of bizarre behavior that gets praised and encouraged thus leading to a regressive feeling atmosphere."
good,"It was stressful at times but most jobs are like that. Management was average, and co-workers were very nice. Work is great, but it depends on which managers you get, if they don't like you it will be quite evident. But overall a very rewarding experience."
good,I enjoyed my time there. The training was thorough and extensive and gave the employees the opportunity to learn and grow within the organization. Help was always available.
good,"Great people, healthy culture, workload seemingly never stops."
good,"When I began my employment as a temp to hire, we were a small behavioral company called Corphealth located off Summit St. in Ft.Worth.  Then we grew, Humana bought our company, moved us to a newly built facility in Las Colinas in Irving. "
good,"On a daily basis you badge into the call center proceed to login to your phone, during the first 15 minutes after logging in you have system start up to pull all need systems up that you will need for the day. After your 15 minutes is over you proceed to auto-in the phone and start answering calls, this begins your day until you reach your break or lunch. The remainder of your day you answer phone calls, assisting customers where need in a quick manner. At the end of the day once time has been reached for you to clock out you must be done with all calls."
good,Learned how to give a great member experience...Good company
good,"This is a production environment.  Overall, it's a good place of employment."
good,Good place to work. leadership support. team environment and support present.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new processes, and tackling new assignments."
good,I really enjoyed working for Humana because I was doing what I love best and that's helping other individuals with issues they had.
good,My job consists of processing data for Humana medicare insurance customers.  It is busy and detail oriented position in fast paced environment.  We work as a team to achieve a high degree of customer service and provide the best product for our customers.
good,would take inbound and outbound calls for prescription drugs for medicare.
good,Co-worker are good along with above average supervisors. The production to error ratio is very little. 
good,Humana is a very good company to work for. They care about their employees and promote a work and life balance. The only con to working at Humana is their health insurance they provide for their employees is not the best.
good,"Very busy environment. Busy from start to finish. Learned that hard work does pay off. Management is very professional and they help you grow. Demands a lot of your time, lots of overtime needed continually. Working with a team of professionals to accomplish a goal and seeing you did your part is very rewarding."
good,In this job you watch alerts from people trying to access Humana network
good,"Easy work, but people will take advantage of you if you let them and have you do their work as well."
good,I got to work with the new candidates directly from the start of filling their application to their first day of hire.
good,"Answering high call volume calls for prior authorizations for Humana members. Learned how to authorize medications.The management is okay, but could be better.My co-workers were very welcoming and upbeat.Hardest part pf the job was taking phone calls back to back and getting the authorization done in a timely manner.I enjoyed the people at my job the most."
good,"Unfair work environment, Poor Management, do not treat all employees equal"
good,"Easy tasks, consistent cycle. Big pharmaceutical market, not fun work. Elderly customers complaining about western highly addictive drugs.  Must tolerate customers speaking disrespectfully."
good,The best part of the job was the ability to work from home.  Communication between employees and a team work culture was cultivated.  Great support from supervisor.
good,"Humana is a great company but they do not paint the full picture. Beware of companies who use the term of building the plan in the sky! That plane is going to crash everyone in management is going in different directions. A great career start for new grads but if you are established, you will get low balled and the insurance rates are high."
good,Humana is a good company to work for.  They have many work at home positions which allows greater flexibility and a good work-life balance.  The company is full of talented individual
good,Humana is a great company to work for but UM Coordinator 2 IS NOT a position you want! The call center is nonstop calls from upset members and providers! This department is a revolving door. People are hired and quitting constantly. Management will block PTO to make sure they have phone coverage. There is no room for growth and your micromanaged!
good,"The pros of working as a case coach is the ability to work from home and set the schedule as to when you will see your members.  My immediate supervisor was wonderful.  However, the upper level management had unrealistic workload expectations and talked in a condescending tone to staff"
good,"Appreciated opportunity to motivate older and disabled adults to manage their health as well as possible. Believe that the program began enrolling folks who didn't need the services, skewing results to show that program was not a money maker. This resulted in layoffs, that I believe wouldn't have happened if there had been more accurate criteria for the program. Productivity demands increased significantly from time of hire."
good,I just wanted more growth opportunities within Humana. I do not think the path it was leading was a direction I wanted to go. This is why I'm considering another career path.
good,I had done CM for years in the hospital and was interested in trying telephonic CM.  I realized that I am more of a people person face to face versus talking on the phone.
good,"I was employed by Humana for 4 years. I was un-expectantly laid-off along with over 1,000 others due to program shutdown. I received all benefits and severance package. I would work for Humana again."
good,"For the right person this is a great job, pay was far, benefits a little high but most are. Call volumn was high but was pressured to rush a call. Overall job was manageable."
good,coworker are helpful. to many coaches in the same year. WAH is very important. very pushing with a license in varios state. need maintain the performance.
good,"I would still be here if my manager didn't have an issue with my newborn being in the NICU for 5 days and needing more medical care. I loved the hours, staff, and would have no problem with the over time issue."
good,Pioneers in introducing preventive health care to Medicare beneficiaries.Spoke at seminars to educate employees/ upcoming retirees of their   health care options upon retirement
good,The company was great until they layoff my whole department after 18 years of service with them. Then 2 months after that spend millions to by Kindred
good,"Ok job to work for, benefits are good, could use better management, as well as job security.  Job culture is fair, I have seen a little promotions within, depending on what dept you are in hours can be over whelming."
good,"Working in the spending account area at Humana was very difficult. First you were working with members who always called upset because their HSA, FSA, or HRA accounts were temporarily suspended. This made them very difficult to work with. They called yelling, screaming, threatening and belittling you at just about every call. The nice thing about it was I had enough empathy to understand where they were coming from. I put myself in their shoes and understood their embarrassment when their card kept declining at the store or front desk. Having that ability I was able to de-escalate the calls from being transferred to supervisors. The benefits with Humana were amazing, and the pay was fair. It was just hard having to deal with so much negativity in one day all the time."
good,"Left because new PMO Director did not know anything about Project Managers.  Typical day was managing tasks on the Business side for projects and also working with IT Scrum Master.  "
good,"A typical day depends on the job assignment. For me, that meant keeping track of all projects aligned with the sales tool I was responsible for. Along with that, I needed to maintain records related to each individual project and when that project was slated for release."
good,"In my time at Humana, I enjoyed the environment.  Working with my colleagues.  The opportunity to be one of the 1st persons trained on the new Travel & Expense reporting program."
good,company makes employees work mandatory overtime and some times informed at the end of the week which means working weekends and a late notice. They do not like employees being of work.
good,My immediate supervisor made the work day go by quickly. She was very encouraging and was able to assist in the solving of problems when one of her staff was unable to handle a particular situation.
good,"The typical day was pretty good, the people were pretty pleasant the majority of the time. However, the people who were the go to contact for asking questions were very rude in the way they would look at you. I hated it,"
good,Policies change frequently with little time to adapt.  Unrealistic expectations of work load.  Frequent re-organization and re-teaming with layoff of about 2000 employees in six months time
good,It was fun to work there. Got to meet new people and made is good money. Learn a lot about how medicare works. I got to learn more about what kind of person I am.
good,I loved working here until they started doing lay offs a year ago. Every few months a large number of people were laid off via mass lay off meeting. No one ever knew who would go next.
good,"Successful company, great pay and benefits, strong HR team and policies, but experience will vary based on who you work for and what area of the organization.  Lots of changes, be ready to roll with the punches."
good,"I have no feedback to give regarding the company."
good,"Busy place, great people to work with on daily basis. Very Busy during the holidays. Great benefits, atmosphere, and a lot to complete on daily basis."
good,It’s was a good place to work to get your resume going and get into high positions other places if. You wanted to go and it’s a nice place to work it you want you want to move up in the in the company
good,"Overall the Humana Corporation has the right idea about advancing internally..."
good,I worked at Humana in the IT security dept for more than 10 years as an associate/contractor.  My co-workers were wonderful and I will miss them.  Working in IT at Humana is a stressful mess.  Each department is siloed into a very specific area it works in.  This leads to interdepartmental battles over who is responsible for what.  Projects can be derailed because someone in an unrelated area was not contacted.  It is a dysfunctional mess.  The benefits are nice though.
good,"Overall, I've had a very positive experience working here. Management in very helpful, supportive and willing to help employees reach their full potential whether it's internal or external opportunities to grow. My co-workers are always very positive and willing to teach, train and mentor people. I feel very comfortable asking for help or discussing a problem. The salary and benefits are decent but they are very strict with attendance and tardiness. Doesn't leave much room for flexibility."
good,"Humana has good culture, but it seems at times like there is no stability, constant change, etc.... The training and development in the Group Services area was shaky at best and was sorely missed during periods of change and uncertainty."
good,Humana is a great place to work if you can get in as a permanent employee. VSP is good while it last.... but can be difficult to get rehired.  Would work there again!
good,"Health insurance has uncertainty. They are doing the best they can to handle this situation, but generally speaking, communication is open and bosses are understanding."
good,"making outbound calls completing MDATS. I also, help create different projects for the different departments and up coming events. I also help train individuals on different accounts that we use."
good,"I I chose not to answer. No job security, relaxed environment, worked at home, great coach, horrible PTO policy. this ia all I want to say. upper levels are not honest"
good,May of Humana jobs are Work At Home (WAH). It is a low stress environment and enjoy the comfort of working from your own home office.
good,"Contact new and existing customers to discuss their needs, and to explain how these needs could be met by specific services, Seek out new clients and develop clientele by networking to find new customers and generate lists of prospective clients that sometimes get a little hard sometimes but he great team I had is what made it possible."
good,"Went from Quality of care to Quantity of members contacted on a daily basis, Expectations can be unreasonable. Very hard to move up in company."
good,"Working at Humana is rewarding, however I would like to return to active patient care. Work day requires total dedication to insure that metrics are met.  The most difficult part of the job is getting insured members to answer phone line that consist of an 800#.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to engage members into conversation that is in the best interest of their good health and maximize their ability to continue to have good quality of life."
good,"Benefits are great! The culture there is a lie and is there to save face, sure there are also a lot of people there who really live it but for the most part its not very inviting and people are rude and if you have a disability they dont even care. The managers are cold and vague and the department lead isnt completely approachable. The job security rhetoric they keep trying to assure us with is a lie too, especially with the merge of us and Aetna. They keep setting impossibly high expectations and pushing a lot of people out of a job that way. Don't take too many PTO days or have FMLA, STD because they're going to harass you about it, not directly but they start nit picking and micro managing you for using these things."
good,The company cares about developing its employees.  401k benefits are great.  Health insurance isnt the best.  Over all this company has been a great experience.
good,"Direct management is good. The executive team is out of touch though. "
good,"A typical day at work I would receive about 100 phone calls or more. I learned about the Humana Insurance, answer phone calls in a fast productive manner, and how call centers work."
good,"I was impressed with the overall culture at Humana, but it just wasn't my cup of tea to be on the phones all the time.  Of course, I knew that was the job when I was hired, but I underestimated just how much I would grow weary of it.  Still, the training, and continued coaching as our new-hire class hit the floor was very helpful, and I greatly appreciated it.  Everyone was very nice, and I did make quite a few friends during my time there.  I can't deny that my last day as a customer service specialist was one of my happiest days though.  In summary:  impressive company with many growth opportunities...but the job was draining."
good,"Long hours"
good,I took incoming calls from members and providers to provide information and resolve complaints.
good,got to different people everyday and loved working and being able to help others.
good,This is a great company to start your career in the healthcare industry. Humana has many avenue that allows you to develop your skills toward career mapping.
good,"This company was hit hard by system conversions, callers are left on hold excessively.  I have received constant complaints from healthcare providers because each call takes at least an hour from beginning to end.  Not sure why the ""business decision"" was made to outsource as much as possible.  The decision made could have made sense in theory, but it is not working out so well in practice."
good,Sitting all day on tha phone helping customer make tha right plans
good,"This company is a good company to work for but they just let people go for no reason, just let them go your performance can be 100% it doesn't matter you could be out the door quick. I was out the door in 13 months for an hour not being shown on my time so I was terminated,  never happen before no warning nothing just out door."
good,"Es un trabajo exigente, requiere de mucha disciplina, proactividad y dedicación. Sin embargo creo que hace falta incrementar la cantidad de personal para poder dar abasto con todas las actividades de la tienda."
good,"Look very careful were and what department , and it has a lot of perks for there employes. Is a very good company to work for I can recomend it but I wil like ro work in jeffersoville and  eed a morning shift bevause of .y  hilds school hours"
good,"There was a lot of overtime that had to be done per week when it was around peak and sometimes after peak season, I did not get a raise and was there at least  two years, for the amount of work needing to be done I believe the more pay is a must to keep employees."
good,This is an ideal company to start working. I have expent 10 years working inside the company and the benefits are aceptable. The fcilities ar huge and are culturly and diverse represented.
good,"The hardest part of the job was the constant sitting without many breaks. I have a disability and need to move frequently, so it become a matter of affecting my health. Otherwise, it was a good job with great pay."
good,"pros:"
good,"Going to work, I knew there was plenty of work to do everyday. Very fast pace to make sure orders are met everyday. It was a numbers game played all the time. I enjoyed the people I worked with. Hardest part of the job was knowing that the numbers game is purely profit and now much concern given for the care of those who need medications."
good,"excellent benefits, flexible schedule, work from home opportunity, opportunity for career advancement/great mentorship programs, excellent compensation"
good,"The pay was great for what it was, along with the benefits- and the culture was pleasant for what it was(for a specialist role- the culture feels a bit juvenile)."
good,"I was in an exempt position which is a bit more relaxed in the organization that I worked.  Humana is very into the health and  wellness of the employees and members.  Whether it's indoor activities or out door..  Every year we had a 3 month walking completion.  This was tracked and had a leaderboard to show where and what place you are in.  There was also ping pong tables, pool tables to be utilized on breaks.  They also have treadmills to hook up laptops so you can utilize if reviewing work or attending a meeting which is offsite. Onsite workout area and many other opportunities to help with health and wellness."
good,laid back and easy to do just allot of tasks for one position. it was a nice job to have wish the call volume was higher so i could have stayed there. the people there were nice
good,"Humana allowed for flexibility in working hours, and management was in tune with the work employees performed.   There was state of the art technology."
good,Went into homes to explain insurance options.  It was necessary to be very knowledgeable on the products.  The hours were different daily depending on appointments
good,"it was ok, pay was good. not to much to say about the company. It will for sure teach you a lot of patience. Very busy never any down time. Dont get awarded for hard work"
good,Humana is a very well rounded company. You are given opportunities to grow within the company as long as you are able to adjust to the changes because it will be lots of changes.
good,I would highly recommend employment with Humana. A Typical day consisted of interactions with members and interdisciplinary team collaborating to meet the needs of our members.
good,Working for Humana was a great experience and a wonderful opportunity! I learned so much about working together as a company and setting goals to achieve as a company. I loved that not only did they ensure consumer well being but also the well being of their employees.
good,I find it difficult to advance here.  Lack of ability to move up regardless of seniority and strengths.  Management doesn't always recognize accomplishments.
good,"my co- workers and my immediate supervisor made it a lot easier to go to work everyday, I had a great schedule but there was no room for advancement within this part of the humana company"
good,It was pretty easy for the pay that they gave. Processes would switch up almost everyday so sometimes it would get confusing.
good,Good pay. Good place to work. Great oppurtunity. Great people.
good,The only problem we had was with the managment. Other than that the company was great!!
good,"I really liked my position and thought I was doing a lot of good work.  I was let go in a RIF.  They tend to have several a year lately even though they tell us how good its been, then turn around and let people go all while having open positions and tell us to apply for those. I would have liked to continue in my position or a new department, but the number of RIFs is somewhat alarming."
good,Great Care Management team that are always willing to help. They often offer incentives and work to make sure that clients are within an area convenient to home.
good,"Very busy but worth the perks. Office culture is different between various departments. Management was pretty decent, very involved with the team. Pretty good work life balance."
good,It’s and okay job I just prefer full time and better pay I feel like they work you too hard with little pay. Overall the job is good with great benefits.
good,Working at Humana would have been an ideal career if there were better management accountability. You never knew who you were getting on a day to day basis. I really loved my job and then it just got kind of hectic there.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Humana.  But Humana has been eliminating positions (1,300) every 3-4 months and everyone is scared they will be laid off.  The uncertainty of job security has caused the culture at Humana to become toxic and everyone has decided to search for other employment to avoid being laid off.  Humana does care about its employees, pays employees fairly, and treats employees very well.  Until Humana reaches a more stable state of security, I cannot recommend Humana as an employer."
good,"Jag lärde mig mycket på endast några timmar, hur man matar/medicin via mag knappen, hjälpsamma arbetskollegor.      berättar gärna mer vid intervju/dialog via telefon."
good,"Working with Humana is great, however I feel like I am stuck at one position. My previous supervisor was excellent, but with her retiring my new supervisor seem to not recognize my talent and how useful I can be to the team."
good,"The company takes employee health and work/life balance seriously. There is a social media intranet, various health groups and activities throughout the year and the opportunity to earn points/gifts/cash for improving your health. Not to mention many associates work from home."
good,"Great benefits, competitive pay, and exceptional management. Company seems to care about your well being. Friendly co-workers and a laid back stress-free environment. People in charge know what they are doing and treat everyone fairly. Very flexible with time off requests. Facilities are clean and taken care of. Limited upward mobility without a degree. But that's the case for any position. My department will be moving to Ohio. Otherwise, I wouldn't dream of leaving this company."
good,Its a fun environment sometimes. The only thing that is a drag is the management and hiring process they hire people off of the street instead of employees that have been with them for a year and a half and overachieve and they keep them in the VSP instead of giving them a permanent position.
good,"Answer inbound calls, and answer any issues for the call Claims information,benefits, except billing,update any new information, and check  payments. How claims were paid, why they may have been denied. Find providers and provide the information to members. I had to go through many different programs to provide information to the members, or provider that were required. Most of all to make sure the clients were happy regardless of the outcomes."
good,A typical day goes for 8 hours. unless in the annual enrollment period. Great opportunities and challenges are everywhere. Management is friendly and co workers are supportive. Its good work if you can manage it. A good attitude and strong work ethic will take you far.
good,Company over all  approach for employee  is very good  and spending good amounts of  money for the  welfare program and other way company is encouraging  workers for better results but the system I worked for IE ( OE ) and E-Rx was not good. Personal opinion
good,"Cannot get promoted. Its a who you know basis of moving up the ladder, Education is not considered. If you are a great worker, count on staying in the same spot forever."
good,"Great team to work. Was a School for me. I learned a lot about patient care, procedures & nursing leadership."
good,"Jag jobbade vaken natt kan berätta om den."
good,A typical work day was having callers call in stating they were broken down on the side of the road.
good,Humana provides a professional and safe environment for its employees. The company shows no discrimination in their hiring process. The pay could be better though.
good,I have not had any issues with Humana.  I have been an associte for 11 years.  Benefits are good and loved the opportunity for agile workplace.  No micro management in my area
good,"Great place to start your career development, lot to learn. Decent benefit package. The hardest part of the job was provide accurate guidance while keeping high customer service standards."
good,Admission/in-home assessment of patients following immediate discharge from medical facility. Recording and documenting all patients' medical contacts as well as past and present medical history. Medications recorded to monitor patient compliance with MD orders. Weekly evaluation of each patient following initial admission to monitor for patient compliance and evaluate if patient is in need of further medical assistance.
good,"Wellness and wellbeing is a must, flexible schedule, they care about the employees and management support is great. I can only talk great things about this company."
good,"Management and team leads are very helpful. The reason most people don't stay is because the compensation isn't enough at $10.25/hr. (as of June 2019). There is opportunity for a monthly bonus, which sometimes makes up for it."
good,"Excellent training, great work atmosphere-I loved the hours. Competetive workplace environment with advancement opportunities"
good,Thrives on taking care if there clients and customers. The atmosphere was pleasant and very informative. Overall I would definitely work for there company again if the opportunity presented itself.
good,"I worked from home. Excellent work culture, stress work/life balance. I enjoyed the job and although I was laid off, I have no complaints about this job."
good,Give you the opportunity to work from home. Management are flexible with you work and are understanding. They offer an on site gym and have a café for employees.
good,Working for Humana was a great experience for me. My manager was very nice and understanding. The workplace was very relaxed. I also enjoyed the weekly pay of 14.00 an hour.
good,"Mgt lacks leadership skills, uses intimidation, discrimination and personal opinions to hold you back. ASU needs to be completely replaced with decent honest managers that do not use fear, discrimination and intimidation to control you. No HR Policy Letters available anywhere."
good,"The call center I was in was very unorganized.  They did not really do an official interview, they just needed someone right then and there which I found odd."
good,"check email to see if there are new members. see scheduled members. drive over 120miles per day and sometimes 4 hours per day to see 2 members, then drive home to document and check email again. can't reach members sometimes."
good,Great place to make money great benefits no work life balance. Also there is no room for job development. You are not allowed to move up unless you are on the inside.
good,Bad management and not understanding of illness of its employees or communication with the employees. Have very bad communication with hR between the team managers.
good,"Due to Medicare Guidelines, we (as Agents) we only allowed to review the plans available with potential clients if they called and set up an appointment for an Agent to go to their home. There were SEVERAL times that I was given an appointment in the morning and after driving 2+ hours, the potential client spoke VERY little English. Usually I was able to understand them enough to find out they asked for a Spanish speaking representative. This became a very common situation for me towards the end of my employment with this company. "
good,With management it's all about favorites.  The atmosphere can somewhat be like a high school.  Management can be very cold and shut you out and the HR hotline is no help at all either.
good,"The company is a decent one, it is management that is the issue. They don't care, which is sad because the place has the potential to be amazing. I probably would still be there had it not been for the horrible manager."
good,Ok place to work. Many changes in leadership over past 20 months. Communication to staff impaired and support of staff not informed of all changes. Great opportunities for learning.
good,"Humana started as a great place to be. Then the environment changed as management changed. It became very  hard to deal with the favoritism, and the lack of giving everyone the information needed to do there job correctly."
good,If you like to sit at a desk and answer calls all day this job is for you.Very demanding and leaves you with no time for a family life. Job comes first in all aspects. Loved being able to speak to numerous different people in all stages of life. Didn't like the fact our bonuses were based on what the customers felt.
good,"Not a bad place to start if you're unemployed, and a stickler for timeliness.  I learned more about medical coding and insurance than I ever wanted to.  Management was trite with a micro-managing approach that made me want to pull my own hair out.  The benefits were awesome, but their intolerance made me feel like kicking something.  They had me on a Flex schedule, yet fired me for timeliness, what a catch 22.  I really liked their community involvement, and the work itself wasn't too bad, but no matter how much you did, they wanted more.  They continually increase the workload without fairly increasing compensation.  I'm surprised I lasted 3 years there before I hated it so bad I started coming in later and later every day."
good,"The work was fast pace which was nice. There was something new to learned the environment was very peaceful, but they usually only work with contractors."
good,"A typical day at work was taking phone calls all day long.  As submitting things all day long to medical claims.  The other sided of insurances, instead of P&C, I learned health insurance.  Management team was very strong about getting a degree to advance.   I wanted to get my degree, but management would  not allow me to go to school full time and work 40.  It would have taken me 7 years to get an associates degree.  I always in job my co-workers, I am a team player and willing to do whatever it takes to satisfy my team."
good,"Worked at Humana as a Temp for less than six months. During the interview i was told it was for 1 year, the recruiter indicated it was for 6 months and the rest of the employees were told something else.  It was a great environment and good training.  The only problem I has was they use you for as long as they need you and then they let you go no matter how good you are.  The temp agency never advised me of my last day of work and when I arrived at the office nobody was there.  I called and emailed the manager and she never responded.  Therefore, I had to drive home, contact the agency during business hours and that's when they told me.  Nobody deserves to be treated this was. Totally unprofessional and inconsiderate."
good,"Leadership became non-transpqrent.  I have worked with one of the best as well as worst front-line leaders ever.  During Medicare AEP, agents were significantly overstaffed.  Lost opportunities to experienced agents, created a drain on knowledgeable talent."
good,"Company cultural overall is pretty good, but compensation is low especially for bigger cities and they don't negotiate salaries, it's very much ""what you see is what you get"" in your offer letter."
good,"Not enough training before being put into the job. Management played favorites. We did not get enough breaks for the hours we worked.  We got accused of hanging up on Customers, even if the phone dropped the call."
good,I didn't have a very positive experience with the company. I worked in the dental customer service call center in Alpharetta for a few months. Management was ridiculous and not professional at all.
good,The job was a learning experience. I did test and receive my State Health License. We took inbound calls requesting information about the Part D plans available for 2017. Enrolled the customers who needed the plan coverage.
good,"Wonderful benefits, however their salaries are not competitive whatsoever. Also many of the departments are very poorly managed, and often times the wrong person gets promoted (due to popularity or other negative factors). Seems you have to leave Humana and then come back and be hired by Humana again in order to get a fair raise. Also they expect your time to be their time, if you are salary and even some hourly positions, reguardless of circumstance. Aside from that, great benefits overall."
good,"worked 10 hr days, very fun cubicle environment. manager not very passionate about peers and subordinates. departments do not share information and make it difficult for customers"
good,Speak with agents about applications they may have submitted for a member. Spoke to 20-35 agents a day. The thing that I liked the most at this job was helping someone help another person even though at times I felt like no matter how much I tried to help a agent if they was frustrated nothing was good enough for them at the moment
good,"Was a great place to work, nice atmosphere, great group of people. Already put many details in other description prior to this regarding the same job"
good,"Good management, communication, organizational structure and processes."
good,"Not a high stress environment unless you fall behind in sales or need time off work. Since new management has been in place, there has been a lot of changes and the new information is a ""on the spot"" type of deal."
good,"I was contracted through Aerotek staffing to work for Humana. This was a new dept. for Humana, so things were still changing daily as far as how to do the job. I loved working there except for them allowing some of the people to slack off without consequences. Most of us were typing the daily goal of 28 orders per hour or way above, but the few who were still typing 18-20 orders an hour were never talked to even though they said they would have to replace us if we weren't typing at the speed necessary."
good,Too many systems to work through. Busy. Constant calls. Strict about time. Too many ppl. Unprofessional.  Work is confusing.  About 10 systems to log in to.
good,The place is great to work at just don't depend on being there because you may not last passs two years if their numbers are not up. They do many lay offs.
good,"Arbetsdagen styrs av personen man arbetar hos."
good,My manager was great but many people were not as lucky as me. The overall mission of humana was a great idea but the implementation was not. There were weeks at a a time that they required overtime and that took me away from my family on a regular basis. If you want the extra money and you are ok working over time always than this is the job for you
good,"They pick and choose according to who kiss up to them instead of the performance. I was personally asked by the lead if I talked to my peers bc she didn't see any engagement, I simply replied once I'm on the clock I'm here to work...Well sad to say I didn't last 2 days thereafter!"
good,It's one thing I disliked about Humana and that was diversity among different backgrounds. The managers who thought they were better than the next just because they had a little power.
good,I worked for this company for 7 years and only got three raises the within the time that I worked there it was a fun place to work and I loved the people that was the only issue was the pay
good,I really enjoyed working for Humana as a Contract School Health Room Center Contract Nurse. I learned so much great experience.  Cons over loaded lack of onsite supervisor availability to ask any questions pertaining to job role. Used the manual to learn my job as a school nurse stressed at times very busy fast paced.
good,"I would consider reemployment with Humana if the correct WAH position was available with a change in manager. Upper management lacked perspective in the professional nurses roles and responsibilities. "
good,"very exciting new day everyday, never a dull a  moment. Hate that they do not give you a heads up when you an LTE on when your contract will end. Loved the pay and OT"
good,"A typical day at work is keying pharmacy information in to the computer"
good,"Work diversity in a rapid time frame. The co-workers gave added value in helping inform clients. Questions by potential consumers did require more time than the allowed by project. Consumers are concerned by the health coverage dental, and surgery areas. Since we the promoters did not own a license there was not a selling proposition but creating the information so the agent could then utilize the work as a closure potential."
good,Very informative learning experience. No balance for family and work. Management needs more training within mirco-managing employees. We know we are there to work. Interesting experience working for a company that does not understand people have families to attend to besides working all the time.
good,Very upbeat atmosphere. Have several company events. Work hard for the company and they seem to appreciate employees. This is a new company and more staff is needed. We are growing and hiring additional staff.
good,A typical workday includes sitting at your cubicle and taking phone calls from customers in reference to their humana insurance plans.
good,"I enjoyed working with the military active duty and retirees. I helped them with their health care problems, claims,etc. I did briefings, updates on their healthcare. Expained the benefits and enrolled them in the system. The only hard part of the job was when as a new employee learning the system. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the military people themselves."
good,Humana most definitely provided a fantastic base for me in the healthcare industry and allowed me to branch out to other companies. I would have stayed if the compensation was good enough. The average is 3%. Its also definitely about who you know...not what you know.
good,"Humana was an ok gig, but had a huge layoff.  I can see why.  The program was too top heavy and the clients did not want to spend a whole 10 minutes talking to you about their compliance."
good,I loved working with my Supervisor. I loved to travel I just did not like having to work on site. Collaboration was great and Humana provides plenty of education
good,The management their was horrible. It was fast paced and you were graded upon how people felt about the company not so much the sales agent. It wasn’t very fair
good,"Pros; Great place to work, room for growth and advancement. Always creating new roles.  Offer competitive benefits. "
good,"not willing to submit any information as the currently leadership does not represent the company as a whole, therefore leaving a review on the company would not be fair at this time"
good,"I was a returning employee, my supervisor's were very supportive  and there when I needed them. Loved the OT until it was cut. I was terminated due to mistakes that I made. My department was the only one that had quarx, I made the mistakes. My exit interview was pleasant and professional. I would go back in a heartbeat."
good,"Could be better. I like the company but the management does not have leadership skills. They have potential to improve with training and development, potentially."
good,I was able to work with a terrific client base and wonderful fellow associates. Many of my clients were Medicare aged.  I was always happy to help these folks investigate and understand their health care options.
good,"Scheduled client visits daily, weekly and biweekly, per visit pay, no compensation for home computer hours worked. no mileage compensation, "
good,If you are going to work here I would suggest staying for a couple of years to get your feet wet and then go into the field. It is difficult to go to the field with this company because of politics.
good,"Worked with the Digital Experience department, almost all freelancer workers. Can work from home but they prefer on-site."
good,"They did try and accommodate your work/family life as much as possible and were very understanding when you had to be out ill. At first it was fun to work there because you would come to work on your birthday and your cubicle would be all decorated and there was food waiting for you. They would give us small gift cards and candy for Christmas, root beer floats on national rootbeer day and mothers day gifts etc. but the last 2 years there they gave us nothing but a Thanksgiving lunch downstairs and an hour to eat it. I would much rather work for a company that shows their appreciation for you a little more."
good,"I really love Humana, for the culture they created allowing to be yourself and respect others as well. "
good,Enjoyed my job working with military families.  Stayed busy most of the time and but supervisors need help with supervising.  I won't complain thuogh.
good,"Every day is different and unpredictable with the frail geriatric population."
good,It use to be a fun place to work.  Very few people  who I worked with are still. I'm told its like United Health Group now....where you are just a number.
good,Productive job meeting various patients and building a rapport with them.  The hardest part of the job was watching clients refuse the service which could have been beneficial to them.
good,"Humana is a solid company that effectively manages business opportunities and leverages its strength to so.  The nature of healthcare business requires flexibility and change. While the company's business model is smart and makes sense, management struggles to  keep pace which results in work / life imbalance and excessive stress."
good,"Demanding bad experience I never felt so pressure even through i work from home the person in charge make sure she gave me a hard time about everything."
good,"Humana gave little room for advancement and morale diminished greatly over time based on constant protocol changes, lack of financial growth, etc.  There was also diminished morale due to lack of available products in certain states, therefore even more difficult to sell."
good,It's okay. Advancement is difficult because managers don't really help. Average pay and can get boring quickly. You can tell who is just coasting along until they retire.
good,"Worked for Humana for a significant number of years. I  started as a data entry clerk, contracts,underwriting clerk,trainer and currently system support analyst."
good,"The agile work environment provided flexibility to align personal and work schedules.  The parts of my role that I enjoyed most were developing associates, collaborating with business partners, and problem solving."
good,"Sell mapd, supplemental plans , dental and vision. Enroll aging in prospects to Medicare plans. Plan to plan changes. Always surpassed their performance goals all 4 years. But no job security."
good,"Independent - WAH - prioritize my own work assignment."
good,"Start at 7am with travel and still working until 11pm on documentation'"
good,"Open Enrollment is very busy and with unlimited ot. Commission schedule is delayed by at least 3 mos from when the plan goes into effect. After enrollment period, lots of layoffs"
good,Very stressful job culture.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to be able to assist the members. Communication at Humana was poor at best. Messages get distorted.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you helped people."
good,Decent work culture.  Advancement will heavily favor those with long tenure with the company. Work life balance can vary from wonderful in some areas to life-shattering in other areas.
good,I worked for this company for nearly 10 years. Humana offers many opportunities for personal and professional growth. They even provide education reimbursement for associates. Many benefits!
good,"A typical day at work started with opening mail and separating all claims. Distribute all mail. Type letters to patients that explained what the benefits of their insurance was. Also typed letters that explained what amount their insurance paid and what amount the patient was responsible for."
good,"fast paced high volume calls, good working environment, good benefits"
good,"Inconsistent pace"
good,"There is no ""typical"" work day in this position. I have very little contact with Management and almost no contact with the Corporate office. I spend most days in the field meeting with prospective clients and/or conducting group presentations.  "
good,Day to Day was a very laid back atmosphere no managers harrassing you at least in my department we a great manager paranoid but easy going.
good,"Humana can be an excellent company to work for and provide opportunities for advancement. However, the interviewing process is not the best and can be frustrating."
good,"Good work environment with lots of break rooms. Onsite cafeteria was a bit on the expensive time. Allowed 30 extra minutes a week in break time for ""wellness."""
good,"No work life balance, poor management, great pay and excellent benefits. The culture of the company is great but don’t be mistaken it is a business that’s for profit."
good,"During the process of serving my department with their severance, the Director flat out lied to some of the employees just to make sure they were on the firing call.  Very unprofessional."
good,"Management in the Mid-South Region of Humana plays favorites, will find a way to terminate you if they feel threatened in any way, are not fair, do not follow Humana's vision, and are not good managers to work for."
good,"great work life balance just low pay. Overall a great job to work at, full time work from home which saves on gas and tolls. You get more work done in your home office."
good,Humana will work you HARD. The work is extremely challenging and all of your peers will be challenged as you were. It's extremely difficult to move around within Humana because you are being challenged by so many other people to prove yourself. I've had bad jobs before- and Humana gave me a GOOD job. It's just that it was extremely difficult.
good,I would say Humana is a good company overall. However there is very poor management that needs to be resolved. Also training is rushed and should be re-evaluated.
good,My typical day was sitting in front of a computer and working with images of insurance claims scanned into the system.  I learned quite a bit of insurance terminology.  Highly competitive environment.  Putting up with the lack of cooperation from management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being on my own to do the job.
good,"Muy regular, las personas deben pisotear a otras para lograr sus objetivos."
good,Great healthcare organization to work for with the exception of the call center expectations placed on the associates by upper management where quantity over quality is enforced.
good,"good environment to work in, always was able to excel at what I was doing in the position with information needed to assist customers, fast paced but you took your time to assist customers"
good,"●	Proactively educate members through their preferred methods of communication such as telephone, email, web chat and social media"
good,"call center, it was frustrating, stressful, it lest you scrambling for answers while you had the member on hold. You had to go through maybe 4 up to 10 different documentations to figure out the answer. You have minimum support for assistance. Management was pleasant in my eyes but for not so many. They did their best. The most joyable abt the job was the colleagues, Humana does think about your well being and culture."
good,Could be great if you get the right supervisor.  If not it could be bad if the super is playing favorites like hiring her cousin.  Loyalty without a conscience seems to be rewarded.
good,"PC upgrades including ram, power supplies and OS re-imaging and trouble shooting, DOD data wipe, software installation, PC deployment, inventory scans and data base entry and network node installation and network wiring."
good,Humana was a good place to work as long as you put them first. This includes your family and personal life.
good,"If you love a company with midwestern culture and values then you will like working there.  I prefer a a more west coast  work team style, personally. Humana was friendly enough - although there are a few too many mean girl cliques for my taste. "
good,salary and commission was great! but its a great company..they are really into health...your own your own with training..but the environment is relaxing...not stressful at all...people are friendly...food is for out of reach and closest place is very expensive
good,A typical day in this role consists of helping health insurance shoppers with insurance decisions by having a casual conversation about their needs and Busfor applicable plans.
good,Humana stated they have a work life culture however that's not the case. I was there for almost two years there was Mandatory three hour of overtime daily fresh out of training. You need to stick up to management if you want anything. The calls are back to back and long. It wasn't hard to process over 100 calls a day.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for the client- military and their families. It was a good feel knowing you were helping someone understand their heath benefits and point them in the appropriate direction. Unfortunately, management was not very encouraging and there was a lot of favoritism and blatant politics that made the job a bit uncomfortable."
good,"The work environment was great in the beginning, but as changes took place things became a little mores stressful as many jobs terminated due to funds."
good,"Worked in hospital setting, and gained experience in ortho, neuro, oncology, general surgery, ICU, CCU, pediatric ICU, neonatal ICU.  Work was divided up in the AM and re-divided at noon.  I enjoyed worked with a wide variety of patients and colleagues.  The workplace culture was to get the work done and leave."
good,Great Company. Poor management. Many things can change overnight. No job security. Pay is decent. i enjoyed my time there and met alot of great people.
good,Medicare Customer Care Specialist was very stressful work environment.  Went home almost everyday with a headache.  Even got shingles from so much stress at work. Everything you do is recorded and videoed.  Under a lot of pressure.
good,"nice company to work for, great pay and incentives. horrible benefits, movement throughout the company is determined based upon who you know, not the quality of your work."
good,Employees are required to meet a certain standard of metrics per week. A good company in general but have had 4 lay offs in the last year. Enjoyed being on the team and working with members to improve their health.
good,I have work with Humana from 2015 the workload was declining and now as of today the workload has been cut in half as long as well as our pay not happy about. Every since the merger did not go through between Aetna and Humana things have gone downhill need to find a way to support my family better
good,"call center metrics to meet. Production goals and metrics to be met daily. "
good,"Cold call and referral calling to set up in home appointments. "
good,Productive and fun place to work...Also gave o[opportunity to work at home which gave more flexibility to working family member who has other priority at home.
good,They pay a lot of attention to culture. Most of the chief executives have been there for less than 2 years. it's very different than what it used to be in both bad and good ways. Prepare for hard working days and long hours to meet strict deadlines.
good,I am being laid off as a result of my job being eliminated.  Humana places emphasis on maintaining a healthy life style.  It is a good company to work for as long as you don't get caught up in a layoff situation.
good,"If you're looking to be paid decent and have a set schedule then this is a good place to work. The catch is you better be able to dedicate your life to that schedule. Humana's attendance policy makes it impossible for parents to balance their life with work. So unless you have a really good baby sitter set up, be cautious applying here if you have kids."
good,"I have no review feedback other than it is a great company to work for. One con is the lack of job security due to constant company restructuring, Great place to build business skills."
good,"Worked as a Temp worker"
good,"The job was complicated and w/o the proper amount of training, made it diffucult to perform at the proper level. Getting help in a group chat was a disaster at times and not getting the help or answers needed in a timely manner upset the customers"
good,Advancements were good. Enjoyed the type of work. Learned a lot about health insurance that I was able to take with me in my career moves. Jobs were sent to other countries which was not a good look but Its happening everywhere.
good,"Job security is an issue that appears will plague the company for a couple of more years.However, Humana is a great place to work considering the size of the company."
good,"I enjoyed working with Humana as a case manager and then as a manager of case managers until I was laid off.  As a nurse our jobs are usually pretty secure however with humana it doesnt matter if you have a Masters degree in Nursing and hold a certification in case management, they will lay you off."
good,"Once in the company it seems hard to advance, it appears they already know who they want for what position before they even interview. "
good,Excellent benefits and a great learning experience. Very aggressive management at that time but provided opportunities for career advancement.
good,This is a good company to work for. Just being able to communicate with members to help them with prescriptions and just conversation overall.
good,"Coworkers were entertaining and fun to make it through the day."
good,"This is great location. It allows seniors to go to a place where they can participate in health education, nutrition, and fitness classes. It is a great atmosphere because you also work close with management, sales, and health educators."
good,"The job was fine. The dilemma that most employees and I alike felt that the skills that we were trained in deserved an increase in pay. Every time we were cross-trained the workload was heavier and the pay was the same. The bonus structure changed so many times in one year. As far as the rewarding side of working for them is the satisfaction of relieving stress and resolving issues for the member. I enjoyed my team and we were like family. Our team was the most popular in the building and everyone wanted to be a part of ""Team No Excuses"". Management was here and there. I learned a lot about insurance and medications and medical claims. Overall, the job was typical for a call center. You have have great customers who made your shift easier then there are the ones that you just want to yell at over the phone, but you can't. You have to keep it classy."
good,Employer has a high turn over rate. The company has a poor hiring system. Training was excellent while employer doesn't offer any guarantee any permanent position. Managers are team leads who may not be good team leaders.
good,"It is a fluid work environment. "
good,"I liked working remotely which gave me a good work/life balance."
good,The company was a nice place to work. The eventual outsourcing of departments was the reason for laying off employees in 2001.
good,"I have never worked a job that I didn't enjoy. Unfortunately, I chose to go back to college and finish my degree so I could obtain a better paying job that was not in a factory setting."
good,It is a contract usually if your are not a salesman or in Kentucky.
good,"Very unorganized, nothing get resolved, between management or coworkers.  Management has there so called star's and over looks the hard workers. Not enough associates to get the work flow done! I for sure would NOT recommend anyone to work at Humana."
good,It was a dog eat dog environment that was over staffed and poorly managed.
good,"Overall working for Humana was great. I met a lot of great co-workers, learned a great deal about the industry. Within 15 years with the company I grew to the level of Manager, which was beyond my expectations. However, when you reach a certain level within the service operational area it becomes not what you have accomplished but whom you know and watching your back for that bus that is silently roaring behind you. Peers become rude, leadership & direction become non-existence, and things that don’t get accomplished become a blame game and a massive forest fire that with a brainstorming session would only be a brush fire. Now don’t get me wrong some parts of service operations are wonderful with great leadership. I have been on both sides the commercial ops for 1 year & Medicare side of service ops for 14 years. In my humble opinion it comes down to the leadership. Leadership can break or make a company. Leadership within certain areas of the company only looks at Data and numbers but what are the numbers telling you about the people behind the numbers. I remember a leader telling me numbers are the closest things to God. I don't think God keeps ticky sheets of what a person did wrong or right. It is about learning and growing. Leadership views coaching as strike 1, 2 & 3 you’re out of there. Coaching is and should be how can I help you be successful!!!"
good,A typical day at work is very fast paced meeting deadlines and quotas. Working overtime in order to meet those deadlines. Reporting our productivity at the end of the day.
good,Learned a lot about prescription drugs. A typical day consits of helping patients obtain prior authorzations and tier exceptions for medications. A lot of opportunity for overtime.
good,"A great position for high energy, self-starters. This is commission sales position. You must be a licensed insurance agent. The company is a great company and will provide leads for the agents. However, you are required to generate your own sales, as well. There is no limit to the amount of money you are able to make! You run your own business!"
good,"This place was a fun place to work. However, they closed the dept down."
good,"Productive Fun place to work, new management was the best ever. The benefits could be better but a lot of little perks."
good,Typical day was working as a receptionist for busy doctors office. I learned a new computer system while working there. Management was easy to talk to. My co-workers were nice people to work with. We helped each other out when needed. The hardest part of my job was working alone sometimes. The most enjoyable part was working with the doctors.
good,"Managers cared about their workers and tried to often voice their worker's opinions to upper management. But as often in Corporate environments, a select few pull the company in the directed path - sometimes leaving other ideas on the wayside."
good,Great place to work.  Enjoyed it and was promoted frequently and had additional levels of responsibility and experience necessary.  Would be happy to work there again.
good,Had to deal with the US based clients which helped me to get more exposure to the other technologies. This eventually led me to get more evolve myself.
good,"Very associate focused, great benefits.  Team atmosphere.  Able to communicate well with management.  Company supports curent technology and provides updates to employees as needed."
good,Great place to work in a fast paced friendly professional atmosphere. The services provided to customers are top rate when it come to dealing with any financial issues one may have. Management goes above and beyond to provide support that maybe needed. The work life balance at this company is great even for those that are newly hired.
good,Enjoyed working with the clients. Out in the field mostly on your on. Lots of documentation. Requires computer set up and fax.  Field is becoming more regulated.
good,It’s overall great friendly place to work. Training was great and hours were very flexible. I would recommend this job to anyone who looking for a clean supportive environment
good,When I first started everything was great I had a helpful supervisor never turned down anyone then she left and I was traded to another team to a supervisor that didn’t know anything couldn’t even answer a simple question and always responded with an attitude after a while I was fed up with the hostility come from ms. Flowers if you get put on her team good luck
good,"Good place to work. Great benefits and the work is very reasonable for the pay. Would recommend this job to anyone. Would have stayed if I didn't move. "
good,Ambiente de trabajo relajado y compañeros simpáticos
good,"15 years of employment to a layoff. I don't agree with the business practice,  but I accept it. I would not reccomend this employer unless you are 100 % corporate America."
good,I love my job and the position I'm in at least when I first started working for HUMANA I loved what I was doing. Now my manager has forced me to do another job which I don't care for or like. I'm only here until I can relocate.
good,Humana strives to support members' and associates' whole health with strategic initiatives. The work demands are high in order to achieve this for members. Associates need to be mindful of not forgetting about their own work/life balance.
good,"Humana was a great experience. It was flexible, team oriented, and pay was matching for the job. It was a great work environment, and there were fun team building events."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Humana.  The people were easy to work with.  The management was fair.  I learned how important it was to be professional on phone calls, and how to maintain a calm demeanor even if the call was challenging."
good,"Great Company to work with.I enjoyed working with Humana by looking at the staff management who provided good attention to the employees, and they actually very attentive with their need."
good,"As a Business Analyst / Scrum master throughout my tenure I learnt different work culture, software, tools, which helped me move up the ladder carrying more knowledge and confidence. I handled challenging task and people which was really interesting and challenging though. Good team player, knowledge sharing individual."
good,Productive and Challenging workplace. Was easy to learn from and work with my team. Learned some valuable skills working at 2 different locations. Good Complany.
good,"Started at Humana and eventually transitioned home."
good,"Company is ""home grown"" and a lot of personal pride in community.  Significant contributions to community especially arts. Culture is primary determined within divisions and department. Working remotely is encouraged in many departments. Great company with a lot of opportunities."
good,The culture and the people that work here are what makes it great.  Flexible work life balance and a lot of departments allow their employees work from home days.
good,"meetings, reviews, individual hospital rounds, notes, reviews, emails, parents calls and teaching,biweekly rounds with regional medical director, night call,"
good,"I worked at Humana in 2001, the company moved from healthcare for groups to generating income through individual plans. Very labor intensive. Mandatory overtime is required.  Management was too loose. Always hiring novice employees who lack experience. The company wasn't very diverse and was very competitive to minorities"
good,"Nobody would design our overall health care system that included a Humana from scratch, it is the result of bad public policy.  It does employ tens of thousands of very caring people looking out for members."
good,"Good place to work with great benefits. My positions allows me to work from home 1 day a week and also work overtime from home. My current department does not micro manage but it can be stressful at times. Overall though, Humana offers great opportunities."
good,"Humana is a great place to work.  Even though they compete in an industry where cost is king, they have a culture of innovation and are attempting to be a disruptor in the industry."
good,"Bra arbets kollegor och trevlig miljö."
good,I was blessed to be give the opportunity to work for Humana.  I have no complains.  Truly I enjoyed working for Humana my supervisor was knowledgeable and willing to help.  You just has to stay focus and on top of your work load.
good,Worked on multiple projects and got a chance to wok on different technologies and have a great learning scope.Used to interact with developers and clients for requirements understanding.
good,"Working at Humana could be relaxing or stressful, depending on your job title.  Management and office politics are typically a problem in the real world and Humana is no exception.  As is the gossip factor and ""water cooler"" talk."
good,Una empresa con muchas opciones de trabajo en diversas partes del pais
good,"Humana holds wonderful opportunities for people who are wanting to be in the healthcare industry. I loved the culture of this company and how much they care about their employees. However, after 2 years in my sales position, I decided it was not my calling in life."
good,The job was very stressful. Had to deal with some very irate customers calling about their insurance that they had. Had to handle a very high call volume.
good,"It was a learning experience, and I learned alot in the department that I was in. From benefits to mental health coverage, to viewing medical claims. Thankful for the opportunity."
good,C3 management seemed to change quite often. Supervisors also changed frequently which made it difficult to at times to adjust to a new supervisor when  change was made. Site coordinators were many in the time i was there. some lasted a short time while other were there a bit longer. The ones that were nice and employee focused seem to leave more quickly then their non-friendly counterparts. If the executives were more concerned about employees they could have a much better company to work for.
good,"Busy days, high production, good teamwork, great manager. Tedious at times by nature of the work. Good feeling of providing perfect service for our clients."
good,"Humana was a great place to work. however, my pay rate started out on the low side and I feel my request for raise went unheard. Great benefits and atmosphere, no so great pay."
good,Calling PDP members on outbound calls to flip them to MAPD job policies is not how they described the job during the interview. Too many disclosures get in the way.
good,Humana it’s a good place to work if you have patience like to be sitting down most of the day. They are the most busy on a Monday  and Friday you will receive calls back to back
good,"You receive the proper training for the job. The job its self it not hard at all. If you ever do need help I like that there are people there to help you. Environment is good, fast pace and fun. Agents and management are great here."
good,"Overall Humana was a great company to work for. However, it was very cut throat. Due to the fact that when they hired employees they would hire 100 plus employees and within a year they would fire over half of those employees due to over hiring. There was no chance of advancement. They provided lost of extra training for different positions just that the job positions would not be made avaliable."
good,"It was my first job and I learned all of store routine, this company have a good values and you can work well and the store mates are nice. "
good,"I greatly enjoyed my job and I loved the work I did. Learning how to adjust to changes that were made daily and having to be mindful of how to apply the adjustments kept me mentally stimulated and driven. At the time the company was undergoing areas of transition, so my job status was up not secure according to how things were going, but I was able to be transferred to another department when my department had to. I obtained higher learning via the lateral move of my job position that enhanced my skill set. From data entry ""key what you see"" to claims adjusting helped broaden my work experience and knowledge of medical field in administrative support."
good,"learned a lot, enjoyed my job, will recommend the company. "
good,"The team lead we had she was very nice."
good,It is a typical call center experience. Interesting work but the company pays far too much attention to how many times you say I'm sorry. After four you should be allowed to move on!
good,Average benefits and work life balance. Constant leadership changes gone thru 6 leadership changes in 2 years. In the past 2-3 years seen way too much of knowledge drain which makes the job more challenging on day to day basis.
good,My immediate supervisor is awesome she is very knowledgeable and great to work for the culture here to me is not good.  I have learned alot regarding my job the information we receive daily has been helpful. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the hostile customers continuosly . I receive inbound calls to place orders and trouble shoot all issues  maximizing  all calls with a one stop resoulution
good,A lot of changes daily. You have to be ready for whatever the day may bring. Most days it can get stressful but you have to stay positive and do it for the members and their health.
good,"The training was awesome, made the work days go by smoothly and will minimum assistance needed you had freedom to work @ your own productive pace. the culture was soothing the louisville main st site made it easy to commute, and work out. it was nice and clean and the people are friendly"
good,"corporate but casual.  Culture is motivated around total wellbeing.  Working in the group health area, it was very competitive but made it fun!  The WI market in particular in most years had great sales success."
good,"Although Humana Hospital is no longer around the experience gained there gave me a taste of the medical field as a career.  I then went on to train to be a transcriptionist which I did for more than 20 years and gained skills that will assist me in many areas of the medical field.,"
good,Solid company to work for. good place to work if looking to avoid stress of retail pharmacy. can get pretty dull at times. chance to work from home was a positive
good,"Very awesome environment! The managers were very helpful, although, it was a fast paced job. My coworkers and I worked as a team. I recommend this job to anyone!"
good,"very competitive woking with 6 window screens at a time. woking with pharmacies, doing a lot research dealing with humana policies. answering cutomers questions, on medications. researching backorders. ordering meds accoeding to humana policies as well as ordering to customers insurance."
good,"I work from my own home office and make home visits to Member residences as indicated/instructed and per permission to do so, given by Members. PHI is always of an upmost priority, as is maintaining up-to-date record keeping via a highly secured charting system/process."
good,"Verified appointment of new physicians on staff and reappointment of all physicians already on staff"
good,"Work was mostly one on one with customers in their home. I learned to treat the elderly with respect and to be nice and patient with them. The hardest part of my job was getting to paid for my mileage when i travel long distance for a shift. "
good,"I enjoyed working here. Working with the clients  and coworkers was "
good,This was a fun and interesting job. I was challenged mentally and learned much more than I ever imagined I would. The company did an adequate job treating their employees well.
good,Good depending on what department your in. Pay is not really much. There is chances to move up. If you play the game. Be cautious of what department you go to because its not all its cracked up to be.
good,"Not enough advancement opportunities. Left to pursue other opportunities. a typical day at work, what you learned, management, workplace culture, hardest part of job"
good,Humana personnel easy to work with and exhibited care for members and clients. Personnel timely in responses to email and correspondence. Providing solutions to meet members needs.
good,"Absolutely love the flexibility of my work.  I enjoy meeting new people and designing health care plans after completing their assessments."
good,"There does not seem to be a great deal of stability or room for advancement.  There has been high turnover lately and this has affected morale.  On the upside, there are some very nice people there."
good,"This is a rapidly changing environment, job security is not stable. Some departments run great, others like the Stone Age. Benefits are great, work life balance dependent on your lead"
good,"Humana is a Medicare Advantage HMO, PPO and PFFS organization and a stand-alone prescription drug plan with a Medicare contract. Enrollment in any Humana plan depends on contract renewal."
good,"the office closed or I would probably still be there. It was a pleasant place to work, but as most jobs a little stressful. For the most part happy co workers"
good,"I want a Position with a company where I can move up in the organization and where I do not have to have the constant worry of layoffs within the organization. I have a great coach that I enjoy working for, and was part of an amazing team that worked very well together."
good,They have some amazing managers however they continually change your manager all the time and you never know when you will have a new manager.  They only hire LVN's for contractors will not hire as a fulltime employee.
good,Just desired more opportunity than just a sales specialist. It gets really stressful around the busy season. Even though every year is the same as the last.
good,"Jag älskar mitt jobb på humana. Men det är för jag jobbar med en sån fantastisk tjej."
good,"You put bottles in a bag. its easy I don't want to do this, I only worked there to save money to move to Washington. Why do I need to write a review..?"
good,"Was told in training this would be our last job.  Very untrue as thousands have been let go since that day.  I did improve my skills, education, and experiences so for that I am grateful."
good,a typical day at work would be to sign in and start working on my production for the day. i was able to learned different work types because i was a very efficient with my work. the most enjoyable part of the job would be all of the events and activities we had throughout the year.
good,"Excellent place to work, great patient to caregiver ratio, considerate growth potential, excellent working conditions, company provided learning tools. hardest part was losing patients after becoming acquainted with their care .."
good,The job was easy. they will tell you what you want to hear even if it isn't all truths. Loved the manager and the job. but advancement and acceptance in the company as anything but temp takes forever if it even happens. good job as a start or to gain experience then move on.
good,the job is great loved it really not big on sales but maybe another dept would have be great for me it was a temp position other than that it was a great
good,"Pays well, expects a lot in return.  All of my time at Humana was supporting Humana associates in the areas of Human Resources, benefits, payroll, and the technology systems that support them.  Worked as liaison between the HR business units and the IT group that supports them."
good,"I enjoyed working for Humana. They rewarded me for going above and beyond in my position."
good,it was a nice environment however lacked growth. They also did favoritism a lot. I   learned a lot in the insurance field with this company and also customer speaking skills
good,"Excellent Company to work for, terrible regional leadership!"
good,hard to move up within the company. Managers have favoritism. Great culture values. Benefits and perks are decent. Humana offer a corporate gym for a very moderate price.
good,"Humana is a decent corperation to work for, it just wasn't my cup of tea. It wasn't the type of customer service position I cared to get used to. During pique season per your department, there is plenty of opportunity for overtime hours. The environment can be very fun and inviting."
good,Wonderful leaders and company as a whole. Provides good benefits. You are able to manage your day with the trust of supervisors and managers. Great team leads.
good,"Overall, Humana is an upstanding company to work for. I have learned very much about health care coverage as well as Medicare. I enjoy my role as a customer service representative, and I have excelled there. As a result I am currently used as a supporting agent to the new hires. I have been serving in that capacity since November, 2017. I am also considered an Advanced Resolution Specialist where I assist Medicare Beneficiaries with complex issues.  "
good,"stressful environment with no balance. Expect more and don't take advise from front line associates. Benefits are okay, but you would expect better insurance from a provider"
good,I was happy to work for Humana for 10 years.  We in the print mail shop are overworked and underpaid.  Humana used their associates as test pigs for benefits.  I found Humana to be a good organization to work for.
good,"Some work days could be stressful due to system issues, lagging and just everyday system issues. Although, I believe Humana is a great company I would love to advance in other areas"
good,"Humana is a great insurance company to work for and to have,  they take pride in taking care of individuals associated with them. Great company to have for your family."
good,I enjoyed my many years at Humana and it was an amazing place to work. The only reason I left my career at Humana was to be a stay-at-home mom. That is the only reason I wanted to leave. Had an awesome and amazing manager.
good,"Great Culture. Fabulous People"
good,I originally started off doing UM reviews and was able to advance to a manger position. Along the way I have learned many new skills that are an important skill set for leading others.
good,I love the pay and management was great. I work for this company for 3 years and never have an increase in pay. Supervisor was great and hours. I wish more benefits were offer.
good,"Humana is a great company to work for.. It has a work balance , but it often becomes stressful at times due to certain tasks..  The managers are helpful and help as a team.."
good,"This could be a very good job if there wasn't constant changing.  The work, processes, manager and caseload.  You never get acclimated to the work because its constantly changing."
good,"Experience will vary wildly depending on your manager.  To get anything done requires buy-in from 4 different levels of management."
good,Worked with people I enjoyed.  The company had good managers.  I do miss working for them.  We had company outings and everyone usually came together as a team.
good,"Well you basically answer calls all day long, You are in a small cubical with other call reps. The pay was excellent but the staff was very difficult to deal with. There would be random fights that break out in the middle of work, people fighting"
good,"I've worked at Humana for 13 years. I've had an opportunity to learn and grow in every position I've held within the company. There are many opportunities for growth, however, very limited training provided in new roles."
good,Work at Humana was quick paced working environment.  I learned quick a bit about the health insurance business. Management was great.  Workplace place culture was enjoyable.
good,I mainly worked the ICU/CCU and Open Heart units.  A lot of the care was given on an emergency basis which kept the job exciting.  I worked with the mechanical heart program and the heart transplant program and learned a lot.  The hardest part of my job was when our best efforts failed when trying to save a life.
good,"Humana is good Environment to work under a peaceful management. Collegues are supportive for each and every doubts we get. jr. workers support is appreciable. Very good managemnt with understanding mentality where they explains how to do or complete the task, but never used to try to dominate or force to employee in under pressure."
good,"Large, multi-state organization.  I was able to move from Kansas to Colorado within the same organization.  For profit organization with specific attention to system-wide standards of operations."
good,"Humana is an excellent company to work for, but the drive was too much for me. Driving an hour both ways was simply too much for me to handle, and traffic was always bad."
good,Great company to work for. Leadership team was a pleasure to work for. Benefits were above industry standard (PTO and 401k matching). I would recommend this company.
good,Humana is a typical workplace. The hardest part of the job are the members. The most enjoyable part is the workplace culture. The members are the hardest part because they need to know their information verbatim.
good,"Humana is a good place to work, however, compensation structure is on the lower spectrum.  High quality executive leadership.  Change with operational leadership would benefit the organization."
good,All previous employees are willing to lend a helping hand. This was a bit of a stressful environment in my opinion . Supervisors were less eager to assist.
good,Normal work place. metric that are needed to be met. very customer oriented. room for growth and promotion to all employees. learned process of mail order pharmacy and regulations
good,It was a fun and helpful experience.  It taught me a lot of things about the industry.  It gave me a lot of hands on experience and taught me many new skills that I am able to take with me to an new career/position.
good,"A typical day at work, is when the line goes down. The work is backed up. This was frustrating because  we would have to behind to catch up to make goal. I learned how to be a leader, to speak in front of a group of people, how to resolve problems while working on the line."
good,Good overall during changing times. Multiple departures in the last year due to merger news. Leadership changes direction frequently. Information communication is a challenge.
good,"Best aspect of working at Humana was opportunity for different roles and jobs.  This provided a great way to develop professionally, learning new skills and increasing value to employer."
good,"Sales environment primarily telesales. "
good,The culture changes between departments.  The operations area is a good place to work but with limited upward mobility.  The innovation center had more opportunity for advancement and was designed to help generate ideas and facilitate conversation with low cube walls and natural places to congregate.
good,Humana is a mostly stable company to work for. It's listed in Fortune's 200 and is an industry leader and innovator in care managerment. Humana immerses it's employees in its corporate culture which includes providing Perfecct experiences to all our members and thriving together as an organization.
good,Humana is a good place to work.  I really like the fact that the Supervisor and your team encourages you and assist you with making sure that you succeed.
good,Humana has many opportunities for advancement. The company cares about the wellbeing of their employees and their families.  They offer tuition reimbursement and a mentoring program.
good,A typical day at work would consist of receiving inbound calls and assistance customers with orders and any benefits questions they might have. Supporting the customer service reputation of the company.

good,"Good company, nice benefits, secure place to work, as long as you do your job, Its hard to move up and the pay could be more. But the enviorment is good and the culture is wonderful."
good,A great job helpful upper management and an all around good atmosphere. an excellent starting point for getting into the health insurance field and growing my skills.
good,"The work culture here is decent but there are a lot of levels of bureaucracy you have to go through to get anything done. Everything is done in teams and sub-teams within teams. There is little interoperability between teams and, if you are stuck on some task, you generally have to figure it out on your own."
good,Lots of ways to move up in the company.Met a lot of people. Loved most of the time I was there.  Had the opportunity to learn on a daily basis and be able to climb the ladder a step at a time.Loved the flexibility and being able to work at home.

good,"Ok place to work, just not focused on keeping good employees, no value of EE's."
good,"Humana has an overall excellent reputation, and it is well-deserved.  They give you the opportunity to 'prove your worth';  after that, it is up to you..."

good,Learned various programs. Worked with a great team. Had supportive mgmt. Most enjoyed being able to assist the client.
good,"Fast pace environment that will constantly keep you on your toes. Enjoyed interacting with customers as well as co-workers on a daily basis. The hardest part about the job was being expected to decide between my family or a career. And the opportunity for advancement is available, however it's not on your time it's on your managements time."

good,"The Client is Humana company where I was working on a application which is used to Process bills for wrong claims that are sent to"
good,"Typical of large companies, there is lack of ownership in many areas and issues.  Overall, management was supportive of staff, and efforts were consistently made to improve work environments and encourage self development."
good,"This position required focus and self motivation to screen the required number of prescriptions per hour. While it was not a high stress job, the stress of hitting many different metrics on a daily basis was great. I enjoyed this job but was ready to try something new"

good,"Verified company's met eligibility"
good,"The work is challenging and very interesting.  By serving the military healthcare, it's also very rewarding."
good,Humana bought out the company I was employed with therefore I was not an employee of Humana long. There's really nothing I can say about this company.
good,Got along with my co-workers. Enjoyed what I did day to day. I had fun at this work place. The hardest part of the job was making sure you didnt make any errors with the product. I always double checked work.

good,"At Humana, I was delivering value and quality, providing guidance on their needs, and actively engaging with our members through every step of their road to wellness. As an associate I provided Perfect Service every day to our members, employers, providers and colleagues. As a Customer Care Specialist I responded directly to questions and provide guidance on transactions, inquires, or complaints from consumers. Educate customers, providers and employers about Humana’s products and services both. I receive, document and resolve customer inquiries by using established best practices so the member had perfect service and guidance."
good,"I contract doctors and Hospitals for Humana Insurance, bringing them into network with Humana and Medicare. "
good,They try to hire from within which is great because there is a lot of opportunity. However there is not enough training given to those that manager and they often burned out or their entire team suffers until the manager learns to manage.
good,learned to help soldiers and their families with all kinds of TRICARE issues
good,Newly created postition so it was new learnings everyday. Enjoyed the people I worked with we work hard but made the job enjoyable.

good,I learned how benefits worked for not only the external customer but for the internal customer as well.
good,"I had the opportunity to train in customer service working with health care.  I was able to take a couple of classes with HIPPA."
good,A typical day at Humana is very busy always on the phone taking calls from customers.co-workers are very helpful and easy to work with. I would say the hardest part of my job was is to make sure to try to make all of my customers happy and satisfied by the end of all my calls for the day.

good,"Ran sales appointments to enroll seniors in medicare products."
good,Good Pay.. Needs Work life balance. Needs more layers of management
good,"This job was extremely intense. documents  which were supposed to explain each procedure had many errors. Management was helpful, but did not seem to think the problems were worth bothering to correct. Lack of concern for personal illness . Were told most would be hired on  permanently, but actually only around 15% were. The salary was the best part of the job."
good,"Typical day at work is consistently fast past and a lot of multi-tasking involved. Everyday is a learning curve to lead to further career opportunities. Management continues to be supportive and encouraging to grow. Co-workers keeps the working environment fun and all great team players. There's no hard parts of my job, just great challenges to advance my skills and knowledge and that would be the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,It was my first customer service position and I enjoyed learning the customer service side of things

good,Humana is a fortune 500 company  with many positive and  challenging ideas for the workplace.
good,"As a sales representative, phone contact and home visitations with clients were done on a daily basis. Field visitations & audio/visual presentations to senior groups were also apart of our marketing duties. I learned an enormous amount with regard to health plans available to the senior population as regulated and approved by the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services. Hardest part of the job: seeking new health plan production continually. Most enjoyable part of the job: meeting and assisting the senior population. Identifying a need and matching a service to it, even if the need was of a non-health plan type."
good,"•	Involved in designing UML diagrams to represent the application work flow."

good,"A typical day at work would include answering calls for customers regarding billing, enrollment, pharmacy & medical claims & benefits, collections. The hardest part of the job was not always being able to satisfy every customers issues. The most enjoyable part would have been talking to different customers from different parts of the world."
good,I liked the products they had to offer for seniors. It's been a long time since I have worked with these guys.
good,"During my almost 15 years tenure at Humana, the most awesome part was all the opportunities employees had to learn from other team mates. Management encouraged it and employees learned from it."
good,"• BA having 8 years of exceptional experience in delivering cost effective, high performance technology solutions to meet challenging business demands. Extensive qualification in Information system methodology from conceptual design through document, implementation, user training quality review and enhancement."
good,Set weekly appointments from leads given by Humana during the heavy enrollment period 2 months per year. Learned how to relate and sell successfully to the senior market. Enjoyable co-workers but very competitive environment. Hardest part of the job was coming up with lead sources 10 months out of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the big commission checks after the 2 months Medicare enrollment period.
good,Hard working and caring culture where everyone is focused on doing the right thing.
good,It was a great place to work and I enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,"This is a great company, in that it provides a necessary service to all people."
good,"Learned a lot about insurance and customer service. From using a company's information, I was able to make a proposal for account representatives to show how our company could help them with their medical insurance needs."
good,Worked on the commercial side of Humana. They are a great company and have good benefits but as a case manager onsite the hours are very long and not conducive to family life.
good,Decent hours with great management that encouraged the best out of you. Learned alot about the pharmacial department. Coworkers were friendly and willing to help one another. Hardest part is having to work nights and weekends yet it was the coworkers and management that made it enjoyable.
good,"Customer service, answering phones, assists with issues and conserns."
good,Non-stop incoming calls and specific times for breaks and lunches which must be adhered to. Metrics must be met for productivity.
good,this is a huge 11PB san storage so every day is a different adventure.
good,An overall great job.Lots of growth opportunity and chances to earn responsiblity.
good,"very diverse environment in terms of employees, good compensation excellent benefits, acuired more education and gainful skills."
good,Humana is a great company to work for. I did not like the concept of micro management.
good,Great place to work. Very informative. There are a lot of different departments here that you can use your skills in.
good,Great place to work. There are lots of oppotunities to move ahead in the company
good,I enjoyed the job very much. It was a little stressful at times with being on the phones. The position I was in was a temp position so I was only there a few months.
good,Productive place to work. Several positions posted for people to apply for. Need to give all people opportunities based on time with the company and education.
good,"Fantastic company to work for. They promote health and wellness, so there's an onsite gym with fitness classes, onsite pharmacy, and in addition to regular breaks they give you an hour of 'wellness time' per week that you can use as an extra break (hopefully to be active!) They also have programs that reward you for losing weight or quitting cigarettes. The cafeteria is huge and offers everything from sushi to pizza, several food trucks are lined up around the outside commons area, and the location is surrounded by local restaurants. However, they do have high turnover and have been known for mass lay offs. If you're hired via a contract role (seasonal/temporary) the job will end when specified, but they will be more likely to hire you if you apply for another job in the future. You have 1wk/2wks of training and then they put you on the floor. Everything is performance based and you have to maintain your quota or you'll be let go. You must pay attention and take good notes during training!! They have team leads that are supposed to help you once you get on the floor, but they spend more time playing than working.. so don't expect much help! Either way, it looks wonderful on your resume.. everyone has heard of Humana."
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent at Humana.  The culture changed while I was there and no longer feel valued along with many of my colleagues which makes for a  great opportunity to share my experience, skills and positive energy with another company."
good,"Good company to work for, but you can be just seen as another worker. So busy throughout the year that you don’t get 1x1 time with your leader. So there can  be a disconnect there. Overall good work environment."
good,It was okay working here. Management is somewhat nice. Observes most holidays. Somewhat strict about working from home. Political in nature sometimes.
good,"I worked there 2 1/2 years. It was one of the best work experiences of my life. I loved the work from home opportunity. I had no thought of leaving this great company. My only complaint is, I never felt secure in my job due to the constant rumors of layoffs and the on-going re-organization. However, business is business. "
good,"Different to have my day planned out for me (breaks, lunch for position I’m in).  Hours are an adjustment too since always worked very early morning. I work from home, which I love.  I’m locked into current position for 18 months before I can apply/move within the company; however, will learn a variety of skills to help me when ready to branch off within the company. I work with a great group of ladies and gent who are very supportive of each other. Will soon be trained on various Tier levels."
good,Work is great but you have to focus on why you have the job. The atmosphere can be a bit tough at times. The hours are definitely flexible and good. If you’re one to enjoy customer service then it’s a job for you!
good,I enjoyed the time I was there it was a great experience it’s not a long term job though not much room for growth even with high performance and dedication
good,I enjoyed the experience educating the members. But it put a lot of stress on my car. I help a lot of members and educated them decreasing their hospitalizations.
good,Every thing you imagine a call center to be like..... good or bad. Trainers and supervisors are cool for the most part. Employees were okay to work with.
good,"The corporate culture at Humana has changed over the years,  Management at the highest levels has completely changed and it does not leave a sense of stability."
good,"it is a quite, but efficient work place, the people are nice and listen to any issue you have, they attempt to help when they can. they are understanding of a joy to work with."
good,"Managing current book of business, prospecting, selling Medicare, Life, Health, Indemnity policies.  Workplace culture was mostly relaxed.  Hardest part of job was pr0specting"
good,Humana is a great company with great benefits however once you hit Director role your growth is very limited unless you are located at the corporate office.
good,"I cam into work and logged into the computer and tok inbound calls."
good,The job is decent as long as you don’t mind constantly being on the phone. The team morale was great. There was always something to get involved in and the promote health and wellness a lot. Compensation was good for what your doing.
good,"worked from home, traveled when needed, not too stressful.  had to rely on self education and online learning instead of classroom training, would have preferred more in class hands on training"
good,"Humana is a very diverse workplace with opportunity for career development.  They have great benefits including a fitness center in some locations. Depending on the department, management may or may not encourage personal and career development."
good,"Restructuring, strategy and cultural change significantly impacted effectiveness of leadership and management. Hoping better days are ahead but it will take time."
good,could be a high stress environment but the people I worked with made it seem easier to deal with. Over the last few years of employment our tasks could be overwhelming and challenging but were achievable.
good,The company does a very good job at being flexible around family obligations(i.e. work-life balance).  The compensation is above average and very good depending on your job location.  The one downside is that there isn't much opportunity to move around the company IF you're not interested in a management career.
good,I experienced a lot of advancement at Humana. Humana is a great company just some terrible managers. I enjoyed my tenured there. I have been gone for a while but many people may have been affected by the changes in government legislation. Overall decent company
good,Humana gave me the opportunity to work my own hours and not do heavy work as a nurse.  I could work with as many or few patients I wanted too.  It was temporary but I would do it again if I found a link.
good,"Changes is constant, but the benefits are good especially if you have a family. Can be a fun place at may times, but other times it can be very stressful to meat goals. You have no control over calls."
good,"Learned  .NET, MVC with Entity Framework, C#"
good,Honestly loved working there. The layoff was the problem. Outside of that it was an amazing experience. It taught me responsibility and how to consistently multitask.
good,flexible schedule in the claims dept helps with day to day planning of activities outside of working hours....well being breaks provided to assist with moving around
good,"The company is good but my particular department is stressful and has a high turn over rate because of it. It has typically been used as a way to get your foot in the door at Humana, just to move to other, less stressful areas."
good,"This was a fast paced, matrix driven position. Some times more stressful than others. It was a telephonic case management position therefore it was a home-based position."
good,I enjoyed working with the people their and I also had a good supervisor but it was a very stressful job . I learned to not take the job   what the customer says personal
good,I came into work started separating the truck of drugs we got in for the day and separated them out from our dry drugs and our cold drugs. After we got done separating out the drugs we would put them away then replenished them to the pharmacy when there stocks of the drugs was low.
good,Some things are a little too black and white here. They're gray area's and this company doesn't adjust to that at all. Which truly puts a strain on the work/home life balance or lack thereof. But being a huge company I do understand that it is a lot harder to adjust for individual needs. But it can sometimes be interpreted to a reflection of how you would treat your customers and as a result lowering the number of new sign-ups you have at open enrollment.
good,You get you work done. no talking to one another. I guess thats good because they get all done there work done. I would have to say they could do better with there training long and boring and half the stuff you do in training doesn't stick or be used. If they could get better with caring about others life and not being so work based. I think people would like it more and not be so stress to where you have to hiring people all the time.
good,"Our team had support to get new associates machines imaged and setup for them.  We also were responsible for software/hardware installs.  We also took were in charge of monthly inventory.  The people that we supported were for the most part nurses and had varied levels of computer knowledge or experience.   "
good,"Management and training were great,. I enjoyed my time working for Humana, working remote was a benefit. Job culture was good, they supported diversity. Management and leadership were organized and provided great support."
good,"Humana Pharmacy is a fun place to work, the work hard to maintain Employee Engagement with quarterly outings.  They are also a very focused group a people to work with that work very hard to get the work done and correct and on time and that is the expectation from management."
good,"This a great company to work for, they do a lot for their employees. "
good,I worked for Humana for 10 years. I left in September of 2017 due to lots of layoffs as they were outsourcing alot of our positions. I do miss working for them. It was a great job with lots of perks
good,Great company to work for.  Workplace culture was excellent!  Nurses worked together. I was always to reach out to coworkers when I needed help.  Most enjoyable part was the staff that I worked with.
good,Overall the company really cares about there employees. Just need longer break times. Have great benefits offered. Also great leadership team. Willing to go the extra mile for there employees.
good,"Humana is a great place to work overall. I loved working there in the order entry department. However, I was forced to leave my toxic work environment when we had management changes. Since then this manager has moved around to several other departments and ruined them too."
good,"Working for Humana was pretty good. The calls were sometimes very stressful with Members cussing and yelling.  Some calls were pretty chill though.  This was not a bad job, but I didn't want to work in the Disenrollment (cancellations) department any longer due to the amount of angry callers, so I left. Hoping to find work in one of the easier, calmer departments."
good,Review patient requests for medical services. Assign CPT codes for authorized outpatient appointments and supplies. I learned new aspects of outpatient care management that I did not previously know. Workplace culture was friendly with employee events such as pot-lucks and Spurs Days to booster employee morale and competition.
good,Very competitive workplace in that it takes a bit of networking to move within the company.  Many positions do require a degree or someone you know.  Job security within the company is very hit and miss due to constant changes in healthcare.  If hired it is a great opportunity to grow and advance if you meet company standards and are great at networking.  Many associates work from home or out of state and some departments offer flexible schedules.
good,Humana does a great job of keeping a good work culture and morale amongst employees as well as lots of opportunities to expand your work scope with special projects
good,I enjoyed the my peers and meeting people from all over the U.S.. The care manager position is an excellent perk for members of Humana that need this type of help. Sometimes the members were knowledgeable of their health issues but the benefit of having conversation was therapeutic for the members. I did not enjoy the constant critiquing of my work. I feel that supervisors on all levels are put under stress of being given information but not allowed to tell the employees below them of the change no matter how significant or insignificant.
good,"I enjoyed working for Humana up until about a year ago when we received a New Manager.  She basically tore our team apart.  I think there are only 2 of us left on the original team.  to Upper management she looks like she is doing a great job, but the way she talks to you and makes you feel is just not worth it anymore."
good,"My only complaint was a portion of our Department's Management was questionable. Some were flexible, understanding and had a strong focal point of work-life balance. Other's were more cutthroat and unemphatic. Active Listening and being open minded was lacking. It began to feel more as a dictatorship rather than a top/down collaboration."
good,"I really like Humana as a company, I think their intentions are good, great benefits and good culture.  I think that it is impossible for them to monitor or assess their middle management because they do not really talk to the associates.  One of my managers had several accusations against them, but no one talked to anyone else on the team to see if it was true.  I had some great managers also, but this place has some really inept managers, but they will never know that."
good,Humana gave me great opportunities to work with them. I learned the Intake Specialist role. I overcall enjoyed the work but did not like the cold calls coming in or the language barrier with their party call centers from overseas. I would have liked to advanced to the inventory role and work outside of call center roles.
good,Humana is great about work life balance and compensation. The organization is largely disorganized however and inconsistence with any policies and procedures.
good,"Go into work, log on and assist customers over the phone in regards to their prescription refills.  Some things I learned, were the basic knowledge of medical coverage provided to customers."
good,A good job overall and enjoyed working with members on the phone and working with team. Loved my manager!! Could get stressful at times due to having to meet metrics.
good,"Wonderfully generous company. The culture was great. I was unfortunate to be part of workforce reduction but even then, they were generous in separation. Highly recommended."
good,prospecting and lead follow ups.
good,"Fast paced environment.  Friendly people. Great location."
good,"I enjoyed my start with Humana.  Great benefits and health incentives, and good pay.  My department switched from paper applications to a paperless call center.  As hard as I tried, I no longer enjoyed my position once we moved to a call center environment."
good,"Although there were some glaring issues with humana, I still enjoyed the work and atmosphere that was present on a day to day basis.Management  would remind us that we needed to reach are weekly goals, which unfortunately was conveyed negatively at times."
good,"not a lot of room to grow, and the salary wasn't great. the teams was nice just sucks the way they handle personal problems. they only offer short shifts nothing long and not fair for the miles."
good,"This is a good opportunity for a new graduate to build on their clinical skills, self confidence, and learn a new EHR. Staff seems friendly, helping, and well versus in their job. You determine the days that you would like to work and how many hours. Only compliant is in the beginning not enough time to travel between patient's due to traffic mostly. 10 miles in the state of DE can be a 30 minutes as there are no direct routes to the patient's home."
good,Assist Humana members with health care goals and needs. Daily telephonic contact with members. Assist with locating wellness needs and DME. Meet daily metrics and staffing qualifications.
good,"Solid, stable and well respected company.  Very competitive environment can lead to poor working relationships between functional areas."
good,It is nice to be able to work from home. Standards are ever changing. Hard to know what is expected month to month. Raises are non existent and not acceptable
good,Working with Humana DMS was my first HEALTH care job..the experience was great. the management staff was awesome. at the moment my mom was diagnosed with a chronic illness and was going thru major medical treatment. due to my mother health I had to leave to take care of her.
good,"Humana is a diverse company to work for.  Overall they are a great company, however it all depends on what you are looking for in a place of work.  The downfall is that they have a slow career development process, and you must be extremely well connected in order to move anywhere within the organization."
good,"I""ve been with Humana almost12 years. The concept of health and wellbeing is a good idea - I see the cost reasons behind it but not very well executed. Moving within the company has been a huge struggle. It's been my experience multiple times that the hiring mgrs know who they want, but have to follow the correct protocols."
good,The people that I've gotten to with with will be forever friends. The atmosphere is definitely am family oriented one. There is plenty of room for advancement if so desired. The Reach bonus
good,Humana is awesome the only thing I can say i don't like is that they are laying off. My supervisor is very understanding and genuinely cares about his associates.
good,Education was very big for this company and they did some very good things. Management was very competitive and not always in a good way.  Middle management didn't seem to always carry out what you heard from upper management which caused a lot of stress and hard feelings.
good,PTO benefit's are great but health insurance is not good (Vision and dental are good). Depending on the department you can have a lot of overtime. Not many opportunities for growth unless you know someone The starting salary is great compared to most companies.
good,"I love the company and love the mission. People can learn alot from Humana's at home Health Coach service, community educators, but the customer service is a disservice, and the reduction in force is a bad thinbg although maybe necessary. I willl always promote Humana and refer as they rank high in my book."
good,I hated this place. their lack of teamwork and communication was crazy. At times we were left alone being just hired on by ourselves without managers with no one to look for in case questions came up. Management was at times very rude as well.
good,Handled Inbound/Outbound calls from Medicare recipients. Processed enrollments. Scheduled appointments for in home enrollments. Suggestive selling of new and existing products. Assisted with training of new hires. Created assessments to evaluate knowledge of computer programs for new employees. Assisted management with presentations needed for upcoming meetings and projects. Created spreadsheets to monitor quotas of team members. Implemented incentive programs to increase productivity. Assisted with complex problems and issues that occurred on a daily basis. Maintained productivity logs for management. Provided assistance with evaluations and areas of improvement for each team member. Reported to management daily.
good,"Overall a great company however prone to layoffs they call ""reorganization "" and with the uncertain market for healthcare it can be extremely stressful. Good pay. Poor insurance (weird right)."
good,"impactful on my life and allowed me to blossom in several areas of the work force, Love dealing with experienced workers and most enjoyable, culture.."
good,"Good place to work everyone works as a team. the other staff members are very helpful, and the position was super flexible. I would love to work with them full time if given the opportunity."
good,"Loved working for the company when it was Employers Health, great family orientated company, cared about employees and great wages.  When Humana took over employees became a number instead of a person."
good,Leadership is very micro-management oriented which makes it difficult to work effectively.  There is a great deal of pressure to meet unrealistic deadlines with minimal resources or support.
good,Good Company to work for. Employee friendly. Work at home position involving telephonic management  of Humana  members. as an RN coach I managed a team of RN telephonic Nurse Care Managers.
good,"I worked from home. but also could go into the office to help with Interviews days which was good. learned a lot and enjoyed my time there. and I made many friends along the way while there! "
good,"it is a great job! enjoyed it very much . everyone gets along so well. i would deff work for them again and reccomend them to people."
good,"I worked as a sales agent, which taught me a lot about health insurance and sales. The management in the company were,for the most part, great individuals. They have a great system that allows them to work well together to assist the employees. Very Health oriented organization. They promote a healthy lifestyle among their employees and members. The hardest part about the job was obtaining my health insurance license and the most enjoyable would be the culture."
good,Typical work day is very productive. Environment is very quantity based vs quality. Very little work life balance. Little communication with management.
good,"The Naperville Humana location is a fun, positive place to work.  I enjoyed helping our members learn about heath and wellness topics that could positively affect their lives."
good,"Was hard to move up for employees that had to miss work for children. Even with proof of doctors notes. Added responsibilities was not compensated. I was training new people, who was making $3-$5 more an hour thank me."
good,"great on the job training,very hard working people. management willing to help at any time. no late hours and great work flow."
good,"Large company, great company atmosphere, team work, team building, development driven, time management, experience with healthcare, culture/diversity."
good,A very good Company to work for. They are very focused on making sure the employees understand the happenings within the organization. They encourage the employees to return to school and offer tuition reimbursement.
good,"Whether working for their call centers or their warehouses, Humana pays above average for entry-level positions. A great place to start working. They also give a generous amount of PTO for full time employees."
good,no hard part of the job. very simple and basic if you know what you were doing and i always knew what i was doing and if i didn't i'd find the answer!
good,Humana is a wonderful company.  Great philosophy with employee work / life balance.  Almost all associates can work from home for work life balance.  Humana is an advocate for volunteering and makes this available to associates.  I work in a regional office where some of the perks are not available or opportunities for advancement.
good,"I loved my job but its time for new opportunities. my job duties Completing prior authorizations over the phone with providers, providing accurate information to"
good,"Overall the company puts much effort to the health and well being of associates.  For someone looking to ""come up"" through the ranks of the company beware of salary offer caps and low ball offers. "
good,"Good company culture, good place to gain work experience. Leadership is willing to help and often promote within the company. A lot of learning opportunities and career development."
good,Company new to the California market.   Fast pace environment .Company has tremendous potential.  Currently making a footprint in both Northern and Southern California.
good,"Work environment is very friendly"
good,This company seemed to really care for their employees and while there was a large amount of mandatory overtime during my employment there; the company made sure that the agents felt appreciated for their sacrifice in assisting with the companies work load.
good,"Compensation, work/life balance, and work environment are all excellent. Training is very short and vague. Management is reasonable. I would consider working for this company again, but in a different department."
good,"I enjoyed working in the corporate office because I felt I could impact the health plans across the country.  Corporate leaders and executive health plan staff tended to be very intelligent  and strove to be innovative.  There was some tension between the corporate office and health plan staff, but no more than would be expected."
good,2nd Shift Call center atmosphere.  Billing & Benefit / Claims daily routine.  Nice helping members but it can become tedious.  Upward mobility is stagnant
good,"Structured work environment. "
good,"I loved working with Humana. Management was awesome, co-workers worked as a team, training was a little complicated, meetings were great."
good,"Offers Very flexible work schedule.Causal dress code, the ability to network and gain knowledge to improve you skills sets. I truly enjoyed working for Humana, but their HR dept is terrible and I didnt get much initial training. ."
good,Humana has great benefits but you have to know someone to stay there and move up in humana. They pay good but the training isn't what it should be. You learn more about humana than the job you're doing at humana.
good,"Most excitting career.  Enjoy helping people and made lasting friends."
good,"Typical day: log in to phone, take incoming calls, make outgoing calls when slow, data entry, contact other departments such as Pharmacy if client had questions regarding current medications or new medication, transfer clients to departments if they had questions I was unable to answer, transfer to Humana for questions with medication or medical plans, try to resolve any questions or issues the client had in a timely manner. "
good,Good place to work. Good life work balance. Most co-workers are nice. It's easy to work all day and not take breaks. Requires a lot of multi-tasking. Work does end at 5:00 most of the time.
good,"Humana is an excellent company! They treat and compensate their employees well. Due to the recent merger with Aetna, I have a feeling my position will be absorbed. Therefore, I am looking for new employment opportunities in hopes of locating a position that will be complimented by my skills."
good,For a large company it's not as easy to move around as I thought it would be (if I don't want to job-hop to roles I won't enjoy). I have had some amazing leaders and learned a lot - what I hoped from working for a large organization with a lot of resources.
good,"the best part of my day is the freedom and flexibility to use my own judgment to come and go as needed to acomplete my work tasks. I've not been big on some of the office politics that go into my day. All in all, good opportunity and good people. I've gained a great deal of knowledge in MS office primarily Excel as well as SQL and other data analytics applications."
good,"I just can't seem to get to where I want to be. Hard to move up unless you're well connected."
good,Good job to start out at with or without college experience.Helps pay for school . You feel like you have a good standing at work.
good,I enjoyed my position immensely however there were some management issues in my particular department. I miss working for the company.
good,Disorganized and inconsistent initiatives from the top down. Sense of insecurity due to relational/political environments among senior leaders (this speaks more to Concentra than Humana).
good,just needs over better management but other than that an overall great company to work for just real busy and never really any time you can take off even if you apply 6 months in advance.
good,"operated multiple computer programs at once"
good,"My Work-From-Home position allowed me the flexibility to reside in other areas - which was a very big plus.  Despite excelling in my role, it was very difficult to move within the Company to learn more skill sets - which became a source of frustration for me."
good,We learned many skills and techniques on selling to the customers and building rapport.
good,"The company as a whole is a great place to work for and they do strive very hard to make the employees happy, however the issue is among the employee to leader relationships. Based on my experience there is a lot of inter office relationships and if you are not in them, don't expect advancement, but if you are involved, you will surely be advanced and receive special treatment."
good,"Typical day could have you receiving 100 to 200 emails with an average of 2 hours of meetings.  Great experience with learning medical, dental, life and wellness products. Great co-workers.  Like any big company some managers are great others are not. Flexible hours. Good fitness and wellness benefits."
good,"Company is growing rapidly"
good,"After working for them at their facility I was  chosen to as one of the 'work from home' technicians, after 2 years of doing this I decided it was not for me, I needed to get back into being with people, whether it be at a site or retail, but I did not want to move back into their facility due to the distance."
good,Work was challenging shepherding men who are mentally challenged and have distillates but once I understood them and got the routine down it went swimmingly. New problems would still arise and handling them on a daily bases kept me on my toes and not comfortable. I enjoyed spending time with them most as we both would learn about each other it was a bonding experience having them depend on me. But that same reason made it difficult at times as well because of the location I had to calm down a scene and do multiple things at any moment. The combination made the experience as a whole that much more rewarding and I grew a great deal from it.
good,"Humana is a great company to work for but since receiving my Master's I'm looking for a change in career. A typical day at work is reviewing claims and making final analysis to determine whether we would allow or deny claims for a major insurance company. In working have a eye for detail, answer questions from co-workers, resolving difficult problems. The hardest part of my job is when the vendors we work with do not follow rules that company have implemented it makes what you're doing hard. My most enjoyably part of my job is helping others learn their job more efficiently."
good,Humana is a good company for those looking to climb the corporate latter and retire.
good,"I work from home, so my day consist of review of 100's of cases submitted to the company for reimbursement.  Auditing claims already processed to make sure it's processed correctly.  I've had multiple managers since i've become a WFH just since October 2013. My co-workers we usually don't have much interaction unless were doing a conference call. "
good,This is a stable company that has a great job culture set for there people. they have a lot of fun activities going on with there agents it kept them interested and made coming to work everyday worth it the people there are nice
good,Driving to different medical offices and retrieving records.
good,A typical day at work would best be described as trying to multitask the workload.  During the day you receive phone calls from associates and management requesting an issue to be researched.  Helping out the call center with issues they need help with.  Adjusting paychecks via refunds or retro deductions.  Pulling together reports for various reasons.  Making sure benefits are intact and being able to reach out to the appropriate department and resources to help solve individual issues and needs.
good,"This job allows me to help others, inside, and outside of the company."
good,It is a good job. I am learning a lot and the management is nice along with co-workers. The job is pretty simple once learning the job and getting the trainings. Helping the mbr's are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"The good part is:"
good,Many positions at Humana are eligible to become work-at-home (WAH).
good,Cares about its members overall health and well being. New project just not going as planned. We have leads until around lunch and after daily leads expire there is no more calls to be made this is the worst part of the job. I like to stay active while working. So this environment not as productive as my prior occupations. Most enjoyable part is helping the members and making their lives a little easier.
good,A lot of effort is being put into socializing new core values and creating a culture that is more inclusive and diverse.
good,Opportunity to learn and grow in various areas of the company.
good,"  Professional and organice company.  Each day goal need to increase in the percent of HEDIS metrics in terms of doctors clinical management and patient compliance."
good,"As a Humana Case Manager/Clinical Advisor most of the work is done telephonically. Working with Medicare Advantage Plan members was very challenging and rewarding. We called on high risk patients with multiple comorbid conditions, helping them to navigate the health care continuum and promote proper disease management.  I developed many close relationships with patients and family members through our interactions. My co-workers were a tremendous resource and most were very supportive of one another. We developed a strong and successful care support team. The immediate leadership was not very strong, however the supervisory team was well organized and goal directed.  The hardest part of the job was working with very medically complex senior citizens. The communication barriers, learning retention and general lack of technological savvy created challenges in even the most mundane conversations. "
good,"a typical day at humana began at your start time and through the end of your day processing dental claims a total of 225 plus claims a day depending on the area you were working. for example ortho claims required more time so less claims were processed in the day.  I learned to process dental claims, read x rays, request overpayments and other special projects when needed. Management was ok I say this because we had several that where new but not very knowledgeable and where sometimes learning with us.  The hardest part of the job was working with supervisors that didn't know the job and wouldn't humble themselves enough to work with the employees without causing friction and the department moral as very low.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships with my coworkers.    "
good,"Relaxed environment most of the time. Friendly Co-workers and new learning opportunity's everyday,"
good,Establish partnerships with brokers in the Austin market place to sell and market
good,Making sure the patients were receiving the best health care possible.
good,"Taking my first step into the healthcare industry was an interesting choice. The market that I work in was only two weeks in existence when I started. I had the opportunity to troubleshoot and solve many of the new issues that present in a new market. The job was new and exciting. The people I worked with were a family. It was a warm and welcoming environment. The hardest part of the job also became the most enjoyable part of the job. Due to the company's large size, it has become quite silo-ed. I worked very hard to knock down those barriers and build a network of contacts that can be reached out to in order to solve problems or answer questions."
good,"Great place to work but as a contract employee, not very stable with no advancement."
good,"A typical day for me would be to get to work early have my coffee get both my monitors up and ready to log in by 8 am.I learned how to work 2 montora as well as 3 or 4 systems up @ a time being productive as well as profient.The management was pretty cool, they were firm but gave you a little lead way as long as you were doing your job by the book. The co - workers there were very friendly, everyone got along as a big family would, The hardest part of my job would be if a customer called and they hadn't received their prescriptions on time they would be yelling @ you and sometimes I have to say my feelings would be hurt because it wouldn't be my fault and no matter how much you aplogize for the inconvience they still would not be satisified.My most enjoyable part of my job would have to be when I would go beyond and back to satisfy a customer and ackowledge for my accomplishment."
good,"Great place for growth and a learning environment. The representatives were extremely intelligent and driven. However, a lot of management took advantage of that and delligated more and more work to the reps then necessary."
good,"Depends on the department you're in you may have a flexible schedule, have the ability to work from home."
good,"I was a leader and was passed over for a promotion by a man. Other than that, I enjoyed many years at Humana. The leadership in Rightsource Specialty and Rightsource is terrible. The senior leaders only care about the bottom line. Most of those operations are in Phoenix or Tempe or Cincinnati and you can tell by those reviews!"
good,"Having worked in multiple departments here, I can say that I was given the opportunity to progress and build my skill set over time and I was trusted by my managers to make the right decision."
good,"Humana is a very quiet and relaxing place to work. I've learned a lot of new systems and different aspects of Utilization Management from a different prospective, everyone is friendly and willingly to help at anytime of the day."
good,I was able to talk one-on-one with clients with Humana and offer then some additional help. I was able to get to know a lot of the clients and give them a lot of information that they most lickly wouldn't have ever recieved. Working for Humana was a really great place to conect with people who really needed my help.
good,"Excellent Company to work for. Long hours during the open enrollment period, Very diverse, Good culture."
good,"Worked as a health coach for 5 years for Humana based at home.  Great flexibility with scheduling, fantastic support and review processes from supervisors, but very limited opportunity for promotion and career growth.  I loved the Health Savings Account option.  Not the best insurance, as their Point of Service plan had a very high deductible.  Overall a great work-at-home option in healthcare."
good,Humana is a good work place. Believe in employees wellness and wellbeing.  Provide quality care to patients. Enjoyed working with clients. Utilized motivational interviewing to promote change in behaviors.
good,"Overall good experience, except the training was hard to follow wish they had more one on one interaction, however they were short staffed at the time"
good,An overall good place to work with decent benefits and reasonable training upon hire. What you could expect from most corporate employers with a bit more family feel.
good,I would have liked to have worked longer. I would liked to have changed the communication between staff and managers. New hires/ones new to call centers in general should have more assistance. The nitpicking needs to stop.
good,"The computer wouldn't do what it was supposed to do. I talked to management and they just thought it was my incompetence. On the last day on the job, a manager was standing behind me and said, ""Why is your computer doing that?"" They should have asked that much earlier."
good,bra arbets kamrater bra chefer bra ledning trivs bra  finns inget svårt får hjälp om det är något
good,"Great to work from home and flexible at first, but it all depended upon your manager and the department you worked for. Great personal benefits including generous 401K matching."
good,"This is a very fast paced company to work for as Humana deals with mainly Medicare members. Things change all the time so be able to be adaptable to constant change because what you were told an hour ago can change an hour later. When I started I was in the call center and now work Medicare grievances. I like what I do, but things change so much with little to no explanation. Work/life balance? It's okay. Personally for me, I can work when I want as long as I get my hours in and ahead as much as I can. Not the same for calls. You work a set shift and answer inbound calls all day. Have a good head on your shoulders, be detailed oriented, and listen empathetically. Have tough skin as you're dealing with the older generation and be aware that they lived in a different era so please treat them with respect and sometimes formalities depending on which demographic area they are calling from. Overall, I have a love/hate relationship with my current position and it's hard to look for another job with all the flexibility I have."
good,"could have been better but i miss working there, i don't have much to say it was an easy system to use and the customers were kind of hostile and not all employees were pleasant but supervisors were the best."
good,It was okay could be better managment it was also very nice to help older ppl and get things going for better health and better assisting those that are confused on what coverage and information they need for doctors visits
good,My previous position was on a call center type of setting with goals and performance percentages to be reached monthly. It is a steady job that offers good benefits
good,"Humana is a great place to learn and advance.  It's a large company but each department makes you feel like your own group.  I loved the culture, diversity and location."
good,"Productive, but not a fun place to work. Limited opportunity for advancement, no matter how advanced your experience or education. discrimination is a regular practice."
good,"In my specific program, management was no good but Humana overall is a great company to work for. They have a lot of programs to engage their employees and keep them active."
good,Massive emphasis on group work and activities. Direct superiors and superiors within the same department were easy to access. Accessing managers in other departments proved difficult.
good,the culture is wellness is key to wealth.. a lot of events to have something to do at work more than work.. very good way to network.  The more people you know the more you can move up.
good,"It is a pretty easy job. It can get very busy at times, but for the most part, it is an okay place to work. There's plenty of room for advancement if you so desire."
good,Nice place to work. Pay isn't competitive enough. Internal promoting to control compensation. Each role/position can be very different and have different feedback
good,"Humana offered great opportunity with great products, community activities, and good working environment. Excellent company for anyone new to the health insurance industry."
good,Telephonic nursing and case manager for large healthcare insurance company .  Duties consisted managing a patient care caseload of 200-250 patients providing guidance and assistance in helping each one to better manage their own healthcare
good,"Over the years coworkers have become more like family.  They always pull together during the busy times and celebrate each other’s successes.  It’s a great culture, but like most places there is definitely room for improvement."
good,Humana is a decent company to work for. They value the wellbeing of their associates. They struggle with giving the leaders the resources and support they need.
good,Humana at C3 was a consistent and routine oriented employment. Compensation was not as strong which is why I left after 13 months. PTO was available and there are Healthcare and Dental benefits available.
good,Humana overall was a nice place to work. I worked from home and loved it. Problems were easily resolved and there was good morale at the job until there meger failed then the culture changed and our personal health care coordinator jobs were eliminated.
good,Humana is a great place to work but there is no movement or room for advancement. The sales team is given a lot of flexibility for a fantastic work/life balance.
good,The company does promote work life balance and the pay is fair compared to the workload. Benefits are reasonable as well. The only opportunity they have is to recognize the top performing employees and ensure they are moving up and out within the company.
good,One thing I can say about Humana is the management team ensures that the temp employee is able to find a permanent position. Lively environment and friendly co-workers.
good,Great place to work and nice culture. Overall everyone is nice. I learned all about the financial side of healthcare. I like the fast pace and meeting new people.
good,The company had a good philosophy. But when they started to try and sell the company it seemed like management became less approachable and moral went down.
good,Worked together and understanding very competitive hard working caring company. Great benefits if you get to get hired on. Great communication skills.
good,Not a place for me to advance. May work for others . The benefits are wonderful and the 401k structure. The management structure needs more work in order to be a better place.
good,"Day-shift employees were afforded far more opportunities and rewards for their hard work, whereas myself and my team who worked overnight got the short end of the proverbial stick. Management was scarcely involved in making important decisions, and were unavailable when support was needed. When promised a direct hire-on process at the start of the job, I was told two months later that they don't have open positions due to an overpopulated workforce. When told I would be traveling occasionally, they failed to mention that I would have to go outside the city every other week and not be compensated for the fuel required to make the distances. Good coworkers, supported one another and worked together to solve problems and finish jobs. Don't expect to get hired on directly; it seems like nobody in the IT field in Humana is looking to give up their seat unless they retire/die."
good,Humana is a decent place to work. I was blessed to have had a job there for 18 years. I haven't work there for the past 5 years. They have awesome people that work there.
good,Contract job was Ok but job security played a major factor for me. I was switched to multiple positions a any given moment. Training was good but you dont earn until you actually have to do it solo
good,"I felt even though I utilized the different opportunities for advancement, I felt i needed to know people as a local to obtain any good recognition which i felt was unfair. I did my best to reach out to people to find mentors and out of the 7 months and reaching out to 12 different people, I did not find ONE person who was willing to be a mentor."
good,"I valued working at home.  The hardest part of the job was periodic staff layoffs but I was valued and was offered an early retirement opportunity which I accepted.  Humana matched 401 K per policy which was very generous and not always seen in current jobs.  I enjoyed my patients and valued being able to educate to enable them to lead the healthiest and valued lives possible for each patient and enjoyed the contact with them.  The long hours expected to complete the caseload was the hardest part of the job.  Overall I found the job rewarding and as a dedicated RN, satisfying for the most part."
good,"I'm not aware of certain benefits offered at Humana because I was hired to work during open enrollment season which ran from June to early December.  However, I did form some friendships that continue."
good,"I loved working there, and the pay. However, I did not, at the time have the flexibility I have now, to obtain necessary services and child care. I have a special needs autistic son and was in the process of obtaining adequate child care and services."
good,"Great learning experienced  Did not like base salary.  It was touch to make ends meet in the first year of employment"
good,"I like the culture of the company because they are very focused on healthcare and improving the communities. Lots of groups to join and be a part of something. "
good,"I was fortunate enough to get a remote work-from-home position, which was extremely convenient, but the production standards were completely unrealistic, forcing much longer work weeks than were tolerable for me.  The salary was decent for the position, but the health plan was a high deductible plan with health savings account, which can be a problem if you have an chronic conditions, just making sure you are putting enough funds away in your account to cover regular medical expenses.  My immediate supervisor was helpful and somewhat sympathetic, but the upper-level management had unrealistic expectations of our production level and were not flexible in the least."
good,They want everything to done correctly and all errors to be eliminated.  I enjoyed the customers that I had the pleasure of speaking with as well as my co-workers.
good,The pay is good and is employees receive a lot of incentives by just participating in health events. Very nice principles and employees have a good life-work balance.
good,Humana has great employees and a good corporate culture; offers decent benefits and has some flexibility in work schedule; it makes for an good overall work experience
good,"Everyday you wake up and make your at your clients school before them; so, you help them adjust to school life. They days you find out your not working due to the child does not come. So, your out of day pay. You follow the student to every class if require redirection or coping skill then try to apply them. Hoping the fit does not require removal from class environment."
good,"A typical day was busy, we was on unlimited overtime, and the job got outsource and then it was downsize and got laid off, I have learned a lot in the different department, of various job duties. Management was the most difficult to deal with always, putting you down when you knew your production and QA was good. They was just trying to get rid of their less favor people. Was not fair to blacks. Dealing with attitude all the time from people, no team work, made everyone competitive. The most enjoyable part was working from home 3 days a week!"
good,Team environment and opportunities to work at home. Many career opportunities to move around the company.  Training is informal for certain roles and  learning is done by shadowing others.
good,I have learned that with continuing education through Humana that my service and customer relation skills are second to none. Training is a regular ongoing thing.
good,"One thing I can say about Humana, it is a consistent means to provide a decent life for yourself. The call center isn't where I would necessarily start, but if you must it is structured like other call centers."
good,"- I learned a lot about the Insurance side of the medical field."
good,"Engagement strong among the Front Line Leaders, upper management needs to get more involved and encourage engagement and be a more active part of it.  Get out of your offices and get to know the employees in person not only by the numbers and reports."
good,"This was an engaging position providing constructive service to Humana members. Management was overall mostly skilled, (though not perfect - the final supervisor for our ""team"" had absolutely no business being in a management position; some dissembling was involved all the way up to very high management regarding the elimination of our positions). For the majority of my time with the company I believe that they provided an engaging and supportive work environment, with corresponding good compensation and benefits."
good,"Matching Humana products to callers by completing suitability assessments for Medicare products and individual Dental and Vision products"
good,Good place to work! 
good,Been in customer service awhile just wanting to try something new...it's been over 8 years since I been with one company and at this point I'm ready for new beginnings
good,I am not a full-time Humana employee. I am a contractor. Contractors are not valued but from what I've seen Humana cares about their full time people and have a solid benefit package. The department I work in is pretty flexible but the manager is new so there are things the manager could do a little differently but is unaware of better management styles.
good,The job was fast paced and always working under constant change and challenges daily. I was able to move forward and maintain productivity along with providing quality support and services for my members and the company. I really missed working with people face to face.
good,"Many perks to this job including an on-campus gym (at Waterside location), cafe, coffee, and great places to eat nearby. Many people are able to work from home either part time or full time and Humana really tries to work with you to have a good work life balance."
good,"inbound calls requesting refills for prescription medication, pricing said medications & explaining why the cost of medication if the price has increased. Knowledge of Medicare Part B & D is required and being able to explain what it is. "
good,"I worked in the Humana Work At Home program 40 hours a work.  What I learned is that I am able to change and adapt especially with a corporation that is continually growing and changing in order to remain financially stable in a competitive market.  At times I felt pressure and stress, because there was always a push to meet metrics regardless of valid circumstances that might arise to prevent someone from meeting metrics.  The hardest part of the job was trying to meet daily metrics goals while at the same time trying to maintain work life balance.  The best part of the job was the opportunity to help members and that each day was different."
good,Great place to work. A lot of support in career development and growth. Scheduling is flexible. They will teach you as much as you want to learn. Can't go wrong there.
good,"no time for family, I like the company, but the role I am currently in is very stressful and I am having a hard time moving to another role, due to the layoffs."
good,I enjoyed my job and who I worked with. Management has very poor communication and follow through. I had to consistently try to advance my own self and my manager “forgot” to follow through.
good,"good pay and benefits. great team members who were supportive of each other. hours could be long and their were quotas to meet. overall, management was helpful. most enjoyable part of the job eas helping the Humana members. hardest part was meeting quotas and job changes over which there was no control."
good,"Contacted members every 2-3 months to provide support and guidance in the absence of their assigned care manager. Linked to external and internal resources, updated progress towards health goals, and resolved immediate concerns."
good,"You start work between 8-9 am.  If you have meetings, then you will have to come in earlier or stay late to prepare.  There are too many meetings and this is huge problem.  People cannot do their work in a regular day."
good,"Although I loved working here, this place is not fit for everyone. The managers are great, but sometimes they just do not see everything that goes on around them. I loved my personal manager, he was great, taught me a lot, but, everyone else just seemed to be oblivious."
good,"They are going hourly, so not sure how that is going to work. People on my team were great to work with., but a lot of people worked over to meet the requirements and now they are going hourly, so people will not be allowed overtime. It will be very interesting to see how this plays out."
good,You will not get your success handed to you in this position.  Be willing to put in 110% and you'll do great. Must find leads and ask for referrals.  Sometimes you will go into some pretty questionable neighborhoods and homes.
good,"Overall Humana is a very good company to work for. There was a lot of change at Humana which is typical of a large corporation. As a Market Manager we were paid very well but we earned every penny we made.The job was not even close to 9 -5. When I was hired it was my responsibility to build the Northern KY Team from scratch (8 - 10 Agents). I did so and had the highest retention of any of the Managers in the KY Market. I was responsible for 22 Counties. also had extra Manager duties working with our Group Medicare division making me responsible for another 5 Agents in addition to potentially having to work with our contracted Independent Agents better known as Delegated Agents. I worked from home the majority of the time but maintained an office in the Humana Center in Cincinnati, OH on Eden Park Dr.  "
good,A peaceful  and safe place to work . I have increased knowledge with team work ;  collaboration with other health providers to meet individual client needs. I learnt to cope with  occasional challenges with  home visits schedules due to multiple medical appointments.
good,They could treat their temps better. It would be nice if they would require their third party to pay out commissions and/or bonuses. They promise unlimited overtime but it's limited.
good,Great work environment and tools.  Abundant PTO.  Wonderful collaberative environment.  Adequate time to complete work.  Excellent management.  Great peers.
good,"It took a long time to get through the hiring process due to required back ground check, drug testing and finger prints. Then additional online training seminars. It took weeks before I was eligible to actually take a case load and see patients but understandable. Great place to work and a wonderful manager to work for. Just didn't work with my school schedule."
good,"Humana provided me with a great opportunity to work from home, which I love, but communication is not great from upper management. Personal Health Coaches work hard in their role along with helping to close gaps in other departments, but being laid off with little notice is not very professional."
good,"I have worked at Humana for 16 years. The first 15 years I was a clerk. I really enjoyed that position, because it was stress-free and fun. The position fazed out and I was thankful that they offered me the position of a Specialist."
good,I learned a lot about the MA insurance business over the years and have had the chance to make an positive impact on thousands of member's overall well being.  I am very thankful for the experience!
good,"Work within the office environment as supervisor over case managers"
good,Humana was a great place to work it was a great place to advance and provided opportunity to further education with all the benefits and advantages. After the merger with Aetna did not happen Humana has taken a turn for the worst. A lot of important roles have been eliminated and no where is safe. The contracts with doctors and outside vendors has downsized so the employment has suffered. The most enjoyable part of the job is working from home which allows you the flexibility to handle your job duties from your home.
good,It was a good company but their rules changes constantly and the job isn’t secured. All jobs are temp to perm position get your insurance license and learn all about their procedures and systems to get let go a few months. Management were good they work with you as much as possible.
good,"The head of the department I was in would rather hire a person who is a high producer and doesn't always output the best work, because they make them look good over someone who is consistent and accurate. So it's really just a numbers game."
good,"was good until went over seas , high call volumn alot of different systems to handle and many different departments. most customers were nice , most older ."
good,There is profession of maintaining health but no realistic ability to carry out personal health opportunities. Some employment is not secure.  A stressful work environment.
good,"Humana is a pretty good company to work for. Management is fair and compensation is decent. Unfortunately, it's hard to advance because of the lack of opportunity in my current market. Autonomy is extremely important to me and Humana provides."
good,"A typical day at work has its up and downs. It also depends on the assigned task. But overall, we are a family, we've learn to help each other and how to manage every scenario presented to us."
good,"Eftersom jag jobbade hemma hos endast en person under 4 års tid så blev det lite som ett ""andra hem"". Vi hade en bra personkemi och det rullade på fint, vilket var anledningen till att jag stannade så länge. Dock såg jag från början aldrig mig själv jobba som personlig assistent permanent, då jag vill ha ett kreativare yrke, vilket var anledning till att jag slutade. "
good,"Loved working there. Only thing is Limited Term program, no chance to get hired on as they are doing a huge layoff come 2018.very face paced a lot of members who need to get medical plans."
good,"Taken during period of un-employment."
good,Company that truly takes care of their employees. There is a gap in overall culture between the various locations and departments. Benefits were okay.
good,Humana has been a great company to work for and if the contract I work on was not ending I would not be looking to change employment.  I would recommend working for them.
good,"Its a good place to work. good culture, good management. They care about their customers and employees.  Good paid time off benefits and good health benefits."
good,Great pay and benefits working from home is very relaxing. My immediate supervisor was very understanding and I enjoyed working for him. Humana has so many massive lay offs a year there is no job security
good,Humana as whole is great company but our department can be better. Upper management only cares about numbers and demands that numbers are no matter what the cost.
good,"People don't leave companies, They leave managers.  The company is a great company to work for with a great deal of flexibility.  I would recommend this as a good place to work.  The issue could be the manager that you report to."
good,"Advancement difficult and no guaranteed employment.  Nice atmosphere, great benefits, believe in work/life balance.  Work changes daily; everyone needs to adjust."
good,"Certain departments within Humana are great. When I first began working there, I felt secure and thankful. The end result was a very stressful work environment."
good,Overall Humana is a great company to work for.  They promote advancement and have an abundance of training classes to improve education.  They promote health and genially care about employees well being.
good,A typical day you spend time on the phone with your members serving their needs and completing assessments to help identify any barriers to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. You are working alone at home but have the opportunity to reach to other coworkers if needed. Communication is via phone and email. You might complete some training or have meetings throughout the month. The hardest part of the job is not being able to meet a member needs. The most enjoyable part is helping members throughout the day.
good,Humana has a lot of perks but depending you where you're located will depend on if you enjoy working there. The culture as a whole is great though and they have great workout facility
good,"you will make a lot of money, but the culture is like any other call center,  stressful. Just do your work and dont be involved to much or as they say engaged."
good,Great work-life balance. Not overly stressful. Wonderful colleagues and learning opportunities Just wish there were more opportunities for advancement!
good,"Overall good place to work.  Disappointed in focus on growing market share and being competitive. Went through at least 1 supervisor/manager per year. Lack of dedicated focus. No autonomy, very hierarchical management."
good,"Overall Humana is a good place to work and expand your knowledge in the healthcare industry. With the organizational restructures in most departments, job security is low."
good,"If you start out in calls, the managers are very caring and want you to be the best you can be to move into a non-phones role. This involves a one-on-one with your supervisor almost monthly, which is very helpful to voice concerns and issues. Once out of a phones role, with the many changes happening in the company, it is pretty uncertain which department is going to be getting hurt and changed around the most. This means jobs lost and people displaced."
good,"Good core values. Work at home culture for work life balance. 8am-5 pm hours, occasional weekend on call and Holidays-volunteer. Fast paced and requires solid judgement skills and adaptability to the demands of the day."
good,"You will be busy the entire date with work but, it is at timed a very fun place to work. Love working with the people here. There has need a big shift in management which happens in any company & I was able to adjust very quickly. The only down side is there a little room for advancement when it comes to management because they tend to play favoritism."
good,I have learned and obtained a great amount of skills and knowledge during the 5 plus months while working here at Humana!! I enjoy the culture and the opportunities I have had.
good,"Assist members calling regarding billing issues, prescription issues, cancel policy, renew policy, max out of pocket questions. Answer questions as I document the call at the same time."
good,the objectives of Medicare/Humana changed daily. Humana was always changing the way they wanted things done. The work conditions were filthy. And the computer systems and phone systems were so old they went down for hours sometimes.
good,"Paid training was great - soon they began laying people off or letting them go completely, people who hadn't made the sales requirements and sometimes it was same day without notice.  The lack of opportunity or room for advancement I did not like at all.  Great benefits and pay if you're good at selling."
good,Fun workplace and the associates were fun to work with. The managers that I work with were great and knew the business. They had lots of company pot lucks and fun things for the staff.
good,It's put up or shut up. Humana has serious deadlines and wants you to meet them. I was there when the company was OHP. I was there for the service department rampdown.
good,This is a good company to work for. I have learned a lot of different skills from this place.  The company offered many different programs for their employees.
good,"Humana is a great company. Great leadership programs and opportunities to advance."
good,"I will be loosing my job in the near future due to many positions being outsourced overseas. "
good,"It was a great place to work: Professionally, personally and I loved working there. I loved helping the elderly to get the full use of their benefits with their medicare supplements."
good,"Great WAH opportunity and excellent benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work from home. A typical day at work is completing reports, productivity, meetings and working with members, telephonically. Team environment and I learned many skills that I can carry with me in the future."
good,"Very good company, always changing and evolving and improving.  Rapidly changing - employees must adapt quickly to change.  Information does not always trickle down smoothly."
good,I've only been here a few months. I was hired as a Limited Term Employee but would consider staying full time. The work is interesting and makes the days go by quick and so far when I've asked questions of management I feel like I've gotten good honest answers.
good,The benefits were good and the culture on many teams was equally good. It is all dependent on your leader. The flexibility is some roles was really good and the ability to Work at home was good
good,Very kind and competent people both in management as well as hourly employees. Relaxed work environment. Wish they were hiring for full time trainers.
good,"It was a great job in the beginning, but with the merger/sale of the company, the climate changed. This job taught me a lot of useful information that is invaluable."
good,"Overall, the company as a whole is good, management is the problem. I worked in a great location with great co-workers, leadership/hr is not fair !!!!"
good,Different departments within the organization are managed differently. Work life balance and culture vary depending on where you are within the organization as well.
good,"Great starter company"
good,"Overall, the company has a flexible work schedule and decent work-life balance.  However, with the impeding merger/acquisition, backfilling of positions is gone and work loads are increasing.  Nice benefits especially the 401k matching of 150%."
good,"Humana is a good company;  however, about to merge with Aetna.  Unpredictable job security.  Advancement is limited."
good,There is a great deal of self study with little direction. Must be motivated to learn on your own. You can work through an agency or as an Independent.
good,Very good place to work. Good support from management. Not much room for advancement in the position that I held. Salary was okay.
good,A fun workplace. Loved the training and  interaction with all the employees. Management kept  everyone motivated and upbeat.I really enjoyed working for them
good,Despite working 12 hour shifts on some days this place is always busy. It makes the work day go by faster. Co-workers provide a fun atmosphere and always have different incentives to help provide a great atmosphere.
good,The company is great pays on time works with me on Leads and training good product mix. they are being bought so my broker  Advocate health is going through a change
good,"Humana is a great company to work for. There is definitely room for advancement and plenty of opportunities to cross train and learn new tasks. "
good,"I learned many of my technical skills from Humana. I learned  how my job is not an island and how what I do affects a company. I also learned about successful networking and how the corporate culture is changing in some ways. All in all, I have enjoyed my time at Humana."
good,"This company pays an exceptionally good wage and has a company match in its retirement of 125% (unheard of in today's workplace)."
good,"Pros "
good,"Great work enviorment, learned a lot of information from my colleagues and a great entry level position. Culture was great but due to compensation, had to look for a better opportunity"
good,Learned a lot about health insurance.  The hardest part was learning the phone system.  Enjoy meeting and working with co-workers.
good,"Humana allows work at home which is awesome. Its a fortune 100 company and has a good stock price. They do encourage health and have employee health programs. The benefits are ok, maybe not what you may expect from a medical ins company. The coworkers are ok. The hardest part of the job sometime is disorganization among processes and leadership. The most enjoyable part is the coworkers."
good,Nice employee benefit packages and lots of room for advancement.
good,Medical Provider Review was a great place to work with the nurses one on one.
good,"Typical day at work will include back to back meetings with Stakeholders and IT team in-house. Being hear i have really strengthen my analytic skills in the healthcare domain as a Business Analyst."
good,Deal with members Billing and enrollment issues with their insurance policy. Provided members with medical and pharmaceutical benefits as well as their claims information and provided overrides as needed.
good,Company is excellent demonstration of customer service and a business that knows and anticipates the needs of its customers and client by doing business strategically oriented towards the needs of its customers.
good,Great place to work. Learned to move at a quick pace and still be accurate. Sitting all day was the hardest part.
good,"At Humana Health Insurance my overall responsibilities were administering the packaging and shipping of the health plans out to the contractors, delegators, and independent sales agents.  Also managing and administering the trinket inventory for special events and trade shows. Utilized Excel and Word for sending out Sales Appointment, and Inventories and Lotus Notes for e-mails to our MSS, MSA, ASC, Sales Agents, Sales Managers, and the Director.  Also managing the phones daily and forwarding leads to our agents and managed confidential beneficiary applications for their benefits."
good,"wasnt what i was looking for at the time, but i learned a lot of prescriptions/medications/ Medicare experience is a plus. Became familiar with call center."
good,Humana truly cares about their employees.  They are a very efficient business and truly a fun place to work.
good,A typical day at work involves answering inbound calls from Humana insurance members and providers from various medical offices. I have learned that giving our senior citizens with up to date and accurate information can create a more efficient society. The hardest part of my job is being responsible with other individuals personal and medical information. It is our job to provide honest and reliable service and it can become challenging when the call volume is very high. The most enjoyable part of my job is being surrounded by my co-workers that keep me laughing and my supervisor that creates a fun environment in a field that can be stressful at times.
good,Educating active duty and retired military personnel about their medical benefits was the best part of the day.  Researching claims  was a rewarding challenge.
good,"Training in both urgent care and critical care. Facility was helpful in keeping certifications up to date."
good,"Enjoyed working at Humana, always competitive and always challenging."
good,High turnover but a great place to work.  Working with provider offices was enjoyable.
good,"My position as an Enrollment Advisor allowed me to educate employer group members on the benefits of worksite supplemental products such as critical illness/cancer, accident and wellness initiatives. The most enjoyable part of my role was being able to meet my clients and broker partners face to face and interact on typically positive notes. I love educating team members, brokers and clients on health and wellness"
good,"Humana was an excellent place to work. I had been there for 20 years and saw many changes made to the culture and work ethic. Working as a supervisor in a call center allowed me to have a role that would change in a moment. I loved that. The most enjoyable part of my role was working with an associate who was struggling. By allowing them extra training, and peer to peer assistance it was ver rewarding. The hardest part of my job was reprimanding, and terminating an associate. Even after 15yrs in management, it became harder for me to do this."
good,"The company overall is working for the greater good. It is a distance for me, and I would love to find a pharmaceutical company I could work from home for or closer to my home."
good,Very diverse and cutting edge professionals; great development programs and a good mission and principle statement
good,"the ability to work with senior citizens, hospitals, and doctors hands on is awesome"
good,"A typical day was spent processing and reprocessing medical claims, follow-ups with doctors, facilities and patients regarding service and claims. My co-workers were fun to be around and like family,"
good,"A typical day I Provide managerial oversight of Humana Cares Manager’s (nurses). "
good,Humana is a great place to work if a person does not need benefits.  The company does not provide the better of what it has to offer to its employees.  A person can learn about corporate america and what that means and there is educational help as well.
good,"what amazing experience working with with people in need "
good,"Humana truly strives to ensure live-long well-being among not only its customers, but also its employees."
good,"I enjoy my co-workers, overall it has been a good experience."
good,"Answer phones and help members with their accounts"
good,"I learned daily about the companies policies and work life in the different offices around the country.  "
good,Monday-Friday
good,Humana is a great place to work. Management wants to help you succeed. The best part about the job was having ownership of processes and projects.
good,"This position allowed me to learn to work with new computer systems. The members of my team generally cared for each other and helped each other. In a typical day I got to speak to patients, doctor offices and other employees to fill out requests for prior authorization for medications. The hardest part of this job was when I had to let someone know that their medication was denied. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help others."
good,"A typical day would start early am, high volume calls."
good,"Same as before: wonderful training, great associates, great teamwork"
good,I enjoyed setting my goals and making it. I worked well with the management team and co-workers. We learned from each other. We work as a team.
good,"Responsible for day to day functions of Case Management team. Great professional, knowledgeable nurses. Worked as a team to improve processes and implement new programs. Monitored productivity. Enjoyed interactions with the team and co-workers. Enjoyed work from home benefit."
good,"Sales and Management Professional with a consistently strong record achieving sales goals, develop new business partners, building strong customer relationships, effectively manage sales team, time and territories."
good,"i received inbound phoone calls from prospective medicare receiptents inquiring about enrolling in a prescription drug plan with Humana.I also reviewed their prescriptions to let them know if it was covered by a Humana plan and if so wich plan woul benifit them the most.While working at Humana I learned the value of team work,dedication and communication. My co-workers came from all walks of life.The haedest part of the job for me was when there wasnt a plan that met one of the clients' needs. When I could it was very rewarding"
good,"Good company overall, had a good time during the two years I worked there. Great benefits (compared with the market)."
good,I worked there for over 4 years and if you work hard and do your job you will be ok
good,"A typical day would be to go in to work and immediately begin working no matter what position you had. I learned how to open up and come out of my shell because I was a very shy person. I learned the ins and outs of the Customer Service department and I also learned management qualities and characteristics due to my experience as a Production Lead. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the constant changes, the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many people and the daily interaction."
good,"Answer emails, phone calls, enter applications for providers."
good,"I am a teamplayer and work hard at whatever job I have. Each morning assigned work and work through about 20 screens work is detailed, and accuracy."
good,"The company has great benefits, and lots of ways to continue your education. You do have a chance to move up in the company, however, sometimes it comes down to who you know and the right time versus, can you do the job. It is a bit of a old boys club. Due to healthcare reform, the job has change alot and has gotten more difficult for less money"
good,"Good place to work   pay and benefits are good   work at home optional"
good,"I have worked with highs and lows, meaning, sometimes with good manager, good project and sometimes exact opposite. It all depends who you get to work with. My current manager is very good and he promotes good working culture."
good,"Humana is a fast paced production environment with opportunity to branch out and develop skills for growth.  You will learn a lot about the corporate-fortune 500 lifestyle."
good,"When i was there the culture was shifting to more of a call center sales culture. They seemed to value the employees left, by the time I left the stress was too much in comparison to the pay and the bonuses, that were also being shrunk by hundreds of dollars of month."
good,"Lots of computer and email work..felt confined to desk, phone, emails, and computers. Great job for right person but not so much for people who don't learn by audio and visual"
good,"Flexible, the down side they lay off a lot. One of best companies i worked for, i learned a wealth of skills. I thought i was going to retire from here. You had the flexibility to work in office or remotely"
good,Work at home option. Excellent pay. Although you are fully remote you are closely monitored. Heavy emphasis on productivity. Health insurance offered to employees is terrible.
good,"We had flexibility when it came to scheduling, management was understanding, I loved the atmosphere and job culture Humana provided. Only issue I did have was lay off rate. During the time I worked for Humana I was laid off 3 times. I luckily was able to get hired on in other departments until the last lay off. So I dealt with a lot of issues with having job security. But overall great company. Hopefully I can get hired back to work for this company"
good,It was a good work place but I think it was a real stressful environment.  I think the training should be longer for all the work that you do there. But other than that it was good.
good,"business environment, room for growth, education, great place to gain experience in the healthcare arena. Have to watch attendance and be on time. Great benefits"
good,"My time at Humana was okay. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and learning new skills. If you do not have small children, then this is a good job for you. Life is never predictable so I feel some adjustments need to be made."
good,Not necessarily a ton of opportunities for upper level management advancement as many hires come from outside the company at this level.  That stagnates positions down through the director level.
good,"Overall positive company to work for with a good life/work balance.  This is a very culturally accepting company that strives to provide an open environment.  Also, strongly promotes healthy behavior."
good,I worked hard to create some new processes for efficiency  and worked myself out of a job. Instead  of being rewarded I was let go.. Being let go came as a shock.
good,"Humana places emphasis on employee engagement and strives to keep their attrition rates low.  Certain areas of the company experienced somewhat rapid growth and, as a result, offered decent advancement opportunities for employees."
good,"Got a good lesson for life to never get into work with implementation partners. Humana client is really cool but the implementation partners make employees work 24/7, They killed my personal life."
good,Great place to work excellent training program but when your out on the floor you hardly get the help that you are promised and everything that you were promised goes out the window.
good,nice place to work but too much computer work with the given time to complete all assessments and home visits staff was very nice and willing to train or accommodate schedules
good,Loved my job and the people.  Work life balance was an issue for me. Frequent additions to job expectations and frequent changes in strategy.  I regret leaving.
good,The best part of working here is the option to work in different areas and also working from home with having a flex schedule to balance life and work.
good,"Was in multiple roles during my 13 years here, worked my way up, however was pigeonholed after completing my MBA, which was my reason for leaving.  Made many lifelong friends."
good,"I liked humana, it was comfortable and challenging. The environment was professional and fun. I also learned alot about health. If given the opportunity again to work there i would start immediately"
good,"Humana was really a great company and learning experience for me overall.  I learned so many different important values and professionalism with the company.  Very well structured with the opportunity to advance for those seeking to do so.  Mandatory overtime is required, especially during peak season, however, the paycheck is well worth the stress."
good,"Best part of job is the people you work with - developed life long friendships"
good,"Collaborative and knowledgeable. My specific lead was a great fit for me, unfortunately the company did not see the value in placing its contract employees in permanent roles, even though I was highly recommended by another director in a different department."
good,"I enjoyed when I worked for Humana. Needs more opportunity for advancement and better management. Other than that, the pay and benefits we're great. "
good,"Stable company. Not too many reorgs. Leadership stays forever, so no growth for others. Only major employer in Louisville, KY area. Flexible work schedule, ability to work from home."
good,"I enjoyed my time, especially the last three years I worked from home.  I would have stayed but decided to go back to school full time to pursue nursing. I met lots of great people and learned many things while working here. There are opportunities for advancement, if you apply yourself and are eager to take on new responsibilities and learn new tasks."
good,"Good place to work, somewhat relaxed, they could do better on management. Managers used to gossip a lot mostly the female ones. "
good,"Good company to work for with a good selection of benefits, including a wellness center in some locations (discounted fee). Professionally there is room for advancement. Management cares about employees."
good,"Overall a good company to work for however, depending on the department there can be an ""Us vs Them"" dysfunctional internal culture.  Some very divisive managers and directors."
good,"The workplace culture really emphasizes work-life balance, as well as encouraging associates to be healthy and engage in health behaviors such as exercise or eating healthy.  However, they consistently pay below market value for associates' skills and expertise."
good,"Handling the recalls can be testy, but management does what they can to show you that you are appreciated. Supervisors do try to help you with your work/life balance."
good,Great company to work for I spent most of my adult life with the company I had great topportunity to work for and with some amazing people. I also was able to attain both my associates and bachelors degree with the company.
good,Quota with calls and patient engagement was a lot of pressure.  Visits made to urban areas in winter is difficult.  Company paid tuition is good. Difficult to reach patient telephonically at times our of state.
good,I have worked at Humana for 17 years. It’s been a great experience. Humana cares about healt and well being. They try very hard to promote health and well being. I’m ready for the next steps in my career. And am looking both inside and outside the company.
good,"Good place to work, except, the pay is not the best.But I did enjoy what I did and interacting with a hard working bunch of people.  I would recommend Humana."
good,I believe the benefits are why people stay. The insurance is top of the line. Management and opportunity for growth could improve. I left for this reason.
good,"Humana loads up on employees each year for AEP.  Inbound insurance agents that do really well may get to stay during the off season, however if you are put on the outbound campaign there is no way you are staying because your performance is still based on inbound performance even when on outbound campaign.  Usually after AEP season you apply for unemployment, however Humana did try to refuse my employment, though it was over turned since I was being held to Inbound standards even though on outbound.  Over all it was a good experience, worked a lot of overtime.  Already had my insurance license when employed however a lot of people without licenses were paid by Humana to get their licenses for the first time."
good,a typical day was often long and without many breaks. training is not provided when assignment are given (of course dependent on the area)- but is the norm.
good,Overall very pleasant place to work. It was somewhat fast paced but i was able to settle right in after a few weeks of on the job training. The work culture was pleasant.
good,"Great company depending on the area you work and who's your boss. Training all the time, you have great opportunity to advance. I liked how they asked ""what do you feel you should be paid and why"""
good,"OK, but ever changing strategies. I can't think of any cons since my leaving had nothing to do with a negative experience. I learned a lot about healthcare during my time with the company."
good,Humana was a good company with nice benefits but management lacked... more concerned with micro managing than teaching.  In different areas depending on the supervisor.
good,"Opportunity for advancement and great benefits.  Stressful environment however and not great job security, but that was during a rough time of Humana.  It's a great place to work overall"
good,Overall a very good company to work for but as the sales culture in Medicare changes grassroots marketing is key to ones success as a field agent. Leads are provided at this company as a result you need to flexible in your ability to run these leads. The only real downside is that you ae captive to just one company but there benefits in there plans are very competitive.
good,"Overall culture was very well balanced.  However, it would help to have more coaches to help with certain areas of training and hands on work. I would advice to relocate employees who have worked in the annual enrollment instead of letting them go."
good,"Humana was a good job.  They are high volume and expect you to meet your quota.  The quotas, or matrix as it was called, continued to grow.  It seemed that they were more interested at the number of contacts than the quality of service given to their members.  The pay was great.  I got caught up in the big layoff they did in early 2018 or I would still be working there."
good,"Great experience just not enough money, friendly staff some calls get frustrating others are pleasant. Working there o don’t even remember getting a raise at all"
good,"Humana in general is a good place to work.  There are many development opportunities and growth is encouraged.  Due to the company structure and the line of business there is constant change, often times your work processes can change by the day, which can be frustrating.  There are many virtual or work from home positions within the company.  The company in general is very accepting of those from a variety of cultures and prides themselves on being open and accepting, and encourages all employees feel the same as well.  The pay is good for the field that I worked in and raises happened on an annual basis.  There is a high level of technology used for work, which can be difficult for those not used to it, and as always there are technical difficulties that impact work on a regular basis."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. Over time was mandatory during ramp up season when the new members were starting their online pharmacy orders.
good,"Humana is one of the most technological sound companies I have ever worked for. They were constantly trying to make the rating system for small group underwriting better. They designed there own rating system and the always planned for future growth, making the process quicker, and more efficient."
good,"Company was cognizant of work from home isolation and allowed nurses to meet monthly for a paid diner to foster comradery and connection, The performance management for productivity numbers often superseded health plan member idiosyncrasies and adult decisions not to take follow-up calls. Staff had no control over that metric and stress was ongoing."
good,It was an okay job just too much drama and different things going on but is manageable with making sure you just go to do your job with completion and go home.
good,"Humana is overall a good company to work for. They are a big company, so you don't get the family type atmosphere, but they do have some perks. They give a good amount of PTO per paycheck and offer tuition reimbursement."
good,"Enjoyable job with Company support , easy day and challenging Medicare rules and guidelines, HIPPA certification and licensing is handled by the Company"
good,"Company has evolved several times in its 50+ years of business starting as a nursing home company, pivoting to a hospital organization, then insurance company and now health and well-being company.  Very much focused on the integrated care delivery model."
good,Great company to  work for no complaints on the benefits or the hours. Great work enviroment no complaints on the employees we all help each other out
good,Making phone calls and doing small case management with Humana health insurance members.  I learned how to manage my time to ensure daily production in a rather high stress culture.  The hardest part of my job was to make daily production of 10 successful contacts a day. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with fellow employees and Humana members.
good,"i enjoyed my time at Humana, met alot of nice people, and had a very nice work desk that was only mine, i didn't have to share it with anyone, location and parking wasn't the greatest, tough dealing with having to park and ride a bus/shuttle everyday.  learning alot about the healthcare field was very interesting."
good,The people were very nice.  I was thankful the company arranged for my training and licensing.  Technical issues with phone systems prevented me from achieving sales and appointment quotas. It was a limited term position.
good,I really liked the idea that you had the opportunity to work from home. Also they pay you for living a healthy lifestyle and give you the opportunity for extra breaks to workout. They had a designated day called workout Wednesdays.
good,"Great company to work for! "
good,"Humana Military is a great place to work with great benefits, great pay, good work environment. Management definitely needs major improvement.  All else is fantastic!"
good,"I enjoyed my tenure with Humana and did not expect it to end before I was ready.  Overall, my experience was great as I was given the opportunities needed to move up to other roles. I focused on my goal to become a manager which came to fruition.I worked diligently to help achieve the company's goal by focusing on Humana's values and vision. I kept my skills updated by taking different courses as needed for each role I served. I enjoyed the associates that I worked  with on a daily basis. In the end, at this point in my career, I realized that no matter how smart or hard a person works, how dedicated or loyal an associate is or how well an associate has performed, if a restructuring of the organization occurs, this will impact an associate in one way or another, and in this case, my role was impacted as well as my team's. I've always maintained a very positive attitude and have good memories of my career with Humana. I'm looking forward to continuing my career whether in the healthcare environment or another industry and I'm excited to move forward and get started.  ."
good,"Your experiences can vary depending on your coach."
good,Talking to different People is what makes the Job Fun. Being able to trouble shoot and find a Problem then dealing with it within a reasonable time frame makes the day go by.
good,"Humana was very relaxed; however, everyone got the job done.  I learned many systems and processes.  Management was not the greatest.  Some were either very lax or not supportive or flexible.  The workplace culture was excellent from an executive level.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with management.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the learning experience."
good,"I enjoyed my work with Humana, the management, sales team and customers.  I was given empowerment to find ways to streamline processes and improve as an employee.  They focused on healthy lifestyle and offered many benefits for following this lifestyle."
good,"Very much about work-life balance and promoting health for employees.  However, not very open to new ideas or processes.  Very much about the way we have always done it."
good,Took calls mostly from Medicare members regarding their medications on file.  Do Refills and answering question. Micro-managing was undermining for the employees.
good,"A great time learning about corporate America, but it has to be the right fit for you as an individual. Employees are treated well, but constant fears of acquisition."
good,"be prepared to work long hard hours; great learning environment, management is open to new ideas, workplace culture  - there is a wide variety of people and cultures in Humana"
good,"Quality Department not wonderful. did not even have a proper work area.  I was very ill at one time and management was not understanding, therefore, termination occurred. other than that all other departments and department managers were amazing. the people and co-workers well respected."
good,My reviews were great. I was at or above standard. I was happy talking with the members and being able to give them resources that would help with the problem stated.
good,"Great benefits and compensation"
good,It was a good place to work. The benefits are great but can be stressful at times due to the fast pace. Management is good for the most part depending where you are. Advancement is there but can be difficult.
good,"Good company  to work for. It is customer service and working to be customer oriented .  Takes agent ideals into consideration, has room for movement."
good,"Every office is different, this speaks to only the office I worked in. Overall the company is a good company to work for. I do enjoy the work at home options. Humana was rated as the top 10 Work at Home Company's to work for."
good,"Management isn't the most solid but that happens. They compensate you pretty fairly between salary and commission and provide insurance and a full benefit package. Location could be better but it's a nice, well maintained facility."
good,"Fun place except for timings and management kept changing constantly so unable to get a stable leader/manager."
good,Changed leaders and departments several times.  Challenging work and environment.  Compensation is better than most companies in the area.  Offices and other resources are good.
good,As a case manager the job was rewarding and quite enjoyable. Unfortunately I educated myself out of my position with no management positions available when I obtained my Masters degree.
good,"Humana pays WAY better than anyone in the area and I think that's what attracts a lot of people here. The time off is wonderful and depending on which department you work in, it's not hard to take off. Most of my coaches have been ok and if you feel you are being treated unfairly, there's a hotline you can call and discuss. The only downfall to Humana Is no job security. All over the country, everyone says Humana is known for lay offs and this has been true for me."
good,Hard work if your good at sales then you can have a long career in tele-sales. Management is great in regards to making sure you have what you need to make it thru some hard days keep you motivated.
good,"CEO is as transparent as he can probably be, but the corporation is so large it can be hard to get to know and understand all the moving parts.  Management/leadership varies from department to department."
good,It is a great company. Lots of room to expand if you are located in or near a big city. There are many changes taking place at the moment within the company.
good,"Telephonic Mbr management at a work at home environment. Worked 40 hours per week. Had set matrix to meet each day, which include daily call attempts, required contacts, and amount of time on phone"
good,Humana is a top Healthcare provider that is always changing and adapting.  It provides ample opportunity to grow and learn in the Healthcare space.  Humana values its employees and promotes a positive work environment.
good,It is an amazing place to work with a lot of benefits.You are able to get your pharm tech schooling through them for free and you just have to pay for the test at the end.
good,This is the best place I have worked in my career. The people around me really care about each other and it is like family. Plenty of opportunity to learn different parts of the business
good,"It not a seure job, it pays good, but very stressfull with little training. Its is very micro managed with a strict schedule.Talking in the phone is stressfull with complaining customers allday and supervisors will not take a supervisor call"
good,I like the opportunity they have to work strictly from home. I would like to make more money. The management team is not bad and the other departments
good,"Humana is a good place to work, great pay and benefits. However, the work can be stressful; there are very high metric demands. There is job satisfaction because you are able to help the elderly and disabled with receiving needed services and health information.  Humana does offer great training, and on the job support while you are in the position.  The hardest part of job is just keeping up with and meeting the high metrics demands, at times can be very stressful.  I learned new information and skills almost everyday.  Working at home was great, you save money on expenses such as gas, lunch, etc; and you don't have to go out in the cold;  but the negative is I missed having daily interaction with co-workers in an office setting."
good,Fast pace changes daily. Rarely do you see the same isssue over and over. Allows the freedom to dig into issues and follow them through start to finish.
good,This job requires you to have excellent computer skills and typing skills as well as being able to multitask. You also had to be available with no interruptions for phone calls on your shift you could not have flexibility.
good,Lots of change happening and uncertainty. My specific role had a lot of flexibility but was not feeling like I was growing/developing. The offices work very differently - so my advice is to research your office and the people you work with.
good,Good company to work for. They are going through a lot of cost cutting at the moment which is tough but overall good place to work. I would recommend Humana to others.
good,"Humana is what you make it! I enjoyed my time there but management was not the best. HSA is the best thing going, learn about it and you will get more money just for healthier choices!"
good,A typical day is fast-paced with meetings and meeting the needs of members.  Each day needs to be organized.  Change is frequent.  Workplace can be stressful.
good,Great company to work for. A typical day involves striving to improve the overall performance of the business. Humana is a very agile company and is already ready to pivot when necessary.
good,"Great place to work several benefits including great pay , great commission structure , great working facilities . Work place culture was pretty up-beat , staff was very helpful when seeking answers to insurance related questions and procedures."
good,Es una empresa muy buena y que permite aprender mucho en el sector salud.
good,benefits were good and pay was great but got laid off because they projected way more people electing their insurance and were way wrong. they had to lay off 1300 employees to save 91 million dollars. I got to work there for 4 months
good,Humana provided much advancement with a stable and competitive environment.  The associates are the greatest group to work with and management is supportive.
good,"Humana is a great company to work for.  Opportunity to learn a great deal and to build lasting relationships."
good,Very typical 9-5 work environment. They offer employees great learning opportunities for on the job training skills. I am very grateful for the company to offer such an open learning environment. Great tuition reimbursement program as well.
good,"I love assisting members, felt very appreciated and valued. Great work culture, very supportive team. Great benefits , excellent management , and opportunities for advancement."
good,I was able to set my own appointments and schedule around personal appointments I needed.  Management worked well with things that came up and allowed for some flexibility.
good,"A typical day is extremely high paced, little management guidance, an unreasonably ambiguious segment strategy and overall poor associate culture. This is the fallout from Aetna transaction."
good,Its a good place to work. As long as you do your job and meet metric goals then you have nothing to worry about. The only reason I'm still on here looking is to make sure I don't pass up a better opportunity.
good,I think it is very annoying that you require people to write a review.   I have given my opinion about the company above with the start ratings.  That should be enough.
good,Great company but mass hiring and mass layoffs. Fast paced but very collaborative in terms of trainings and teamwork. Ability to take trainings and work individually at home
good,"Its a great company to work for. Areas seem to have cliques and it seems at time you need to be in those groups to advance. If you're content with you roles then you should have no problems, but if you're trying to advance, at times it can be a struggle to move up or around."
good,"Humana is a well being company that encourages its associates to maintain a good work/life balance. Associates are also urged to keep healthy through the company's Go 365 program. We are nicely rewarded as we maintain a healthy lifestyle. And, working at home is also encouraged when applicable. I feel fortunate to have spent the years leading up to my retirement at this Fortune 100 company."
good,"This opportunity has provided many chances to learn and dive deep into various types of insurance such as COB, Subrogation and MSP. In addition to coding in PL/SQL and SAS you always have plenty to work on and accomplish."
good,"I want to work using my skills and knowledge- working Smart. Not working 60+ hours a week, often doing redundant tasks. I seek to exceed desired goals by a significant amount. I have received more than 50 Awards & Commendations for exceeding Sales and Marketing goals. I am a Midwestern Plowhorse-   I do what is necessary to ""get the job done"". Always in a satisfactory manner for all people involved."
good,Enjoyed working at the center very much.  Interacted with a very diverse group of people every day.  The atmosphere was great.  Established great friendships with coworkers.  Benefits were very good.  Was glad to be able to utilize ability to be a good listener and to show empathy and compassion to seniors going through the challenges of growing older.
good,"Answering phones all day"
good,"Company themselves is a great organization. Lots of well being programs and tools to help you, Some of the departments work like an old boys club, you know someone you will advance. Not based on your performance"
good,"DMS sales is a highly stressful position.  Humana as a company would be great but it is almost impossible to promote from DMS.  If you like a call center environment, this may be a good fit for you."
good,"A typical day would be to set up my computer and work on adjusting mistakes, additions and extra duties onto each and every claim.  this was a timed job.  Each claim was timed to make sure we weren't taking too much time on each claim.  the claims were also reviewed to make sure there were not any mistakes.  Kind of a double check.  Once by me and another by a higher department.  The claims were for dental claims.  I would review the claim, make sure each claim had the pertinent information that it needed before it was  paid out."
good,Humana is a health focused employer.  They are interested in the well-being of both their clients and employees.  There are lots of opportunities to learn and expand your knowledge of the company's products.
good,I enjoyed what I did as far as helping the customer.We moved around throughout the day.Working around different people.Management didn't share with how your performance was.
good,"Fast paced, work from home, interaction with leadership strictly virtual, difficult to get to know co-workers, can be isolating at times if unprepared for working from home."
good,I didn't work there too long. It was a cool and fun environment to work in. Loved the AC throughout the building. Interesting co-workers to say the least. Kind of a dead end job if you're not looking to move up in the company. Good for students
good,This job was a contract job.  Employees are professional and friendly.  Very good with communicating important information to employees. Training is very good. Very community oriented and philanthropic place to work.
good,Loved working independently.  Made my own schedule.  Loved my patients. Good guidance when needed.  I did have a lot of support with the company.  I would do this type of work again.
good,Humana offers great incentives for the employee well being. They offer discounts with their Great Deals. They encourage the employees to engage with Coaching programs and offers bucks. They have a 360 program that allows employees to earn bucks to purchase gift cards for routine services and daily activity.
good,I enjoyed working from home and my supervisor was a great leader. I looked forward to the yearly team meeting. The tuition reimbursement benefit was a great help.
good,As a care manager I can work my own schedule which is nice. At this time I am per diem. I enjoy meeting all the new people. Humana has pretty good service for care managers and direct lines with no waiting.
good,Good place to work overall. Good Benefits but no work life balance its horrible. Promotion is easy once you do your work. The bad thing is it can sometimes feel abusive
good,"Can be very generous to their employees, received incoming calls from interested seniors regarding medicare insurance coverage, options, information on supplements, looking back, was good experience. I did enjoy it, challenging part was the sales aspect, but still great experience and I again re-obtained my health license..."
good,This company has plenty of opportunity to grow from within.  For the most part they provide pretty good benefits as well.
good,"Its an ok place to work, nothing too crazy but nothing to write home about. You must be a self starter who is flexible and willing to learn fast on the go."
good,"Humana is a good company to work for.  The management, as with most corporations, could use improvement.  Pay and benefits are on par with industry standards."
good,I was responsible for identifying and posting over payments from both insurance companies and patients. I also answered inbound phone calls from providers questioning status of payment on claims.
good,this company is very good to work for. A lot of bonuses included and very good pay. They are great for promoting within and your very likely to move up in that company. Some managers are very bad so just hope you get one of the good ones.
good,"Good place to work -  good people that genuinely care about our members, many opportunities internally for career growth"
good,"The job is excellent and the advancement is possible but there are many ""hoops"" to jump through when working.  The expectations change often and working alone at home can be very unfulfilling when in nursing because there are no patients to assess, be with, and touch. All assessments, nursing management and nursing education is done telephonically so there is a certain distance that doesn't really work with my strengths and my personality traits that make me good at my job. However they were very supportive for my FMLA and ST disability for emergency health crisis and very conducive for getting my MSN. Set hours and no on-call."
good,"Learned about healthcare, the computer systems and programs involved with healthcare and team building.  I learned the importance of well-being."
good,"Fun, easygoing environment. Great pay even starting out and opportunities to move up from the inside. Hard to get on there-- multiple interviews that are tough"
good,"Okay job, not a career job for me. Good pay and great benefits and perks.The location is 30 minutes away from job so so morning traffic was not to great."
good,This company offers you room to grow ! I have worked here for3 years and have seen the good bad and ugly. From long hours to no overtime. This is awesome if you love desk work. Engagements important to this company however its limited.
good,"As a team lead in the finance department I am responsible for running reports, distributing work, analyzing data, and researching in order to provide assistance programs to Humana members who can’t afford their high copays.  Management and my fellow co-workers are like a big family working together to deliver the perfect experience to our members.  The best part of my job is being able to provide financial help to members who can’t afford life or death medications. On the down side, the worst part is sometimes not being able to help members due to lack of funding."
good,Could worked on management skills. Hardest part of the job was the turn over every few months. The Company took very good care of the employees as far as company events.
good,"Humana has grown my analytical capabilities far beyond what they were before I was employed there. "
good,"During Medicare open enrollment, many companies hire limited term employees just for the season.  I've worked for a few of them and Humana was by far the best one of the bunch. They treated you like a person not a number."
good,"The pay was ok but workers or associates were not really appreciated. It is still a good experience because I am learning every day and I am also very patient with the customers /clients and older clients 65 or older because some of them are very rude and fussy. But I keep my cool. Other thing is that there is sometimes a lot of overtimes that are mandatory .Personally I believe should be whoever wants to do it stays but it was mandatory.The hardest part of the job was to deal with client patiently. My coworkers were nice and enjoyable. Management were also nice but were making sure that we do our job to the best of our knowledge."
good,"I adore my coworkers and my direct supervisor. The future, which includes the merger and Humana's future (and certain jobs) can be frightening. The leadership of Humana does try to be transparent."
good,Good company. Good employment opportunity. Good people and good work environment. Salaries are low however.Good start for new graduates. Good location.
good,This should not be a mandatory section to complete. This is my current employer and they are fine. Work day varies by departments
good,"HR Analyst"
good,a typical day for me as team lead was helping and answering questions for my team most of the day i learn how to become a leader of a team which was very easy cause i woked with wonderful careing team mates the hardest part of my job alot of multitaking with questions sometimes the team all had questions at the same time the most enjoyable part was just working with great people
good,The sales and administrative teams worked together to provide an atmosphere where older adults can go to have a good time.  The sales staff is always there to assist with any questions the members may have.
good,The hospital was an excellent place to learn the skills i needed to further my career in the hospital setting; Unfortunately the hospital closed due to major cutbacks and unable to continue with healthcare industry in South Florida.
good,Management was good. Work was interesting. Lot of opportunities to explore. Overall the company is good and recommendable.
good,"hard to give a fair assessment of such a massive company. I can only speak to my experiences. good pay, great benefits aside from (ironically) awful health coverage."
good,"Not much room for movement unless you are a RN or LPN. We had a few negative events take place in the work place and several employees reached out to the corporate office begging for help for a year and a half. Harassment was becoming a huge issue and nothing was ever done until there were company wide cuts. Good insurance and if you don't mind being a CM with no upward movement, and if you luck out with good supervision this is a great company to work for."
good,"I am working in Syntel private limited at Humana Client location."
good,"Listen to calls and provide feedback in areas of improvement, conduct report trends for supervisors, train and update policy"
good,High pace call center that specializes in making their seniors feel appreciated. They have a supportive team you work with directly that can help you through difficult calls. They also are very punctual about lunch and breaks.
good,"A great company to work for!  There are a lot of perks, but it really just depends on the dept you work in.  I love the dept I'm in, but the only problem is there isn't a lot of room for advancement."
good,"Because I am a Work at Home associate my electronic interactions with my co-workers and leadership was essential. "
good,Worked started at 6:00 am and ended at 2:30 we could do overtime if needed. I improve in my computer and customer service skills while working at Humana. the co-worker are very helpful
good,Humana is a good company to work for but need a straight lined process in training and policies across the board. All Managers should have a degree in management and not be promoted from within.
good,"Working in a call center is very challenging, but working for a Medicare Supplement Service company is extremely challenging. "
good,"A typical day begins with reviewing my calendar for meetings and listening to voice mails that have come in over night.  I then proceed to answer priority e-mails. After those initial task, I then ""plan my work and work my plan.""  This simply means I prioritize my tasks and begin to work on them in the order of that priority."
good,"Work at home. Managed  60 cases that included Face-to- Face meetings, telephone encounters,progress notes and administrative reports."
good,But things are changing and not for the good. I would rather not go in to further detail but it seems that with this you have. A typical day was spent being berated by my direct leader because they were stressed. The most enjoyable part were my co workers we banded together and formed a team within a team.
good,"There has been a incredible amount of steady work and the tools to accomplish the work in a very pleasant work environment. My co-workers were experienced, courteous and professional people. We were all keenly interested in our work and getting a superior product out to our clients and the company's beneficiaries."
good,Strong corporate culture with opportunities for advancement within a few states or regional areas. Gaining more focus on consumers.
good,On a typical work day I answered between 20-60 calls per day assisting agents with their needs on assisting Humana's customers for Medicare/Medicaid healthcare plans.
good,Nothing negative to say. Good place to work. Team- members were very helpful. Needed a day off or time off it was never a hassle with advanced notice. Negative part is that we are losing our jobs.
good,"Humana is a good place to work, but often times you get stuck in the  position you started in with little chance for growth. But the company is growing.  On a daily basis I make outbound calls to member to discuss their benefits and Health and Wellness resource."
good,Take member calls. I learned several computer programs while employed with Humana. Management was always available to staff. Co-workers always helpful. Hardest part of job was trying to get members to understand that there are regulations as to why we could not retro activate their insurance. Best part of my job was working with such a diverse group of co-workers.
good,"The culture is so busy and reliant on OT that there never seems to be time to stop and improve. It's just always more steam, more steam."
good,This was a productive place to work. Salary is very competitive and the hours are flexible. The company also offers great benefits.
good,"I held a few different positions while at Humana. I started as a claims investigator. I called insured's updating accident information, full time student information, and other insurance information. I would then update the information and release the claim to be paid or to go to the next department for processing. After that, I became a claims processor. I would review the edits to check if the claim was okay to process or if it needed to be checked for accuracy. My final position was working in the recovery area. I would attempt to collect overpayments from insured's or providers. I would be responsible for showing them how it was over paid, so they would understand it."
good,"I've enjoyed my time with Humana. The company has made tremendous strides in diversity. They also continue to try to open themselves up to the world of mobile technology, though we seem to falter on occasion.  My typical working days often involved several meetings, some face-to-face, but more often than not, over the telephone in conference style calls.  I'm lucky enough that I can work at home full time and find that Humana as an organization supports me pretty well.  The thing I've enjoyed most about Humana was the ability to collaborate with others and become part or lead multifaceted teams throughout the organization.  It's a true 'thrive together' spirit."
good,"Humana is a good company to work for. If you have the right manager, and remain dedicated, you will enjoy a stable career. During my time with the company I had no complaints about the management. My particular job was not challenging but it was enough to keep me busy."
good,I work from home and its all data entry. Typing as many rxs as I can.  I have lots of overtime during peak. The management for this company is great.  They try their best to help you get the hours you  want and information to help you with your job duties.  I would say the hardest thing about my job is that the better you get the more they want. My job went from typing 34 rx per hour to wanting 52 rx per hour. Then in house rules on overtime and lunch and break rules keep changing.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that its all on me how I perform. I m self motivated. The health care benefit cost are very high but cover a lot of service.
good,"Humana has been an excellent company to work for.  Training is always done to stay ahead of the many insurance changes.  Dealing with member questions on a daily basis, trying to help them understand their medical benefits or spending account has allowed me to understand the importance of training, research and understanding since my information directly affects their lives.  Hardest part of the job was receiving upset member phone calls which had nothing to do with my performance.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the same reason, turning around their attitude and providing them with options."
good,"A typical day is answer calls from members about insurance benefits, medical claim questions and premiums."
good,"Work on rotation basis on application support."
good,Great company to work for. Push for work/life balance. Encourage associates to volunteer in the community.
good,"Good place to work."
good,"I liked the job as far as the company. I didn't like the people that I worked with, it was as if they didn't want you to advance in the field. They treated you as if you were beneath them and they were better than you."
good,Awesome loved the people but no time for life at work from sun up to sun down for months
good,Management had high turnover.  The staff was talented and hard-working.
good,"I started my employment with CORPHEALTH, in Ft. Worth and was very satisfied with the work environment, opportunity to learn computer skills and the philosophy of the company. As the company was renamed LifeSynch and moved to Arlington it continued to have the same priority of the member in mind as well as the morale of the employees."
good,"Working from home was a great experience. This company helped me learn my way through insurance the correct way. However, it was on my own. Not a lot of help or support through management. The hardest thing was being available to clients 24-7, making it not possible to differ from your home life. I truly enjoy working with people and setting my own schedule. Making people feel more secure about their healthcare is an amazing feeling."
good,I was able to be more diverse in learning item entry skills as well as member services
good,"Prior Quality Analyst for the team. Inform members of lower cost alternative medications to save them money. Fax and follow-up with doctor offices’ responses. Side projects such as Spirit Committee, charity events, co-creating MYB Process and Procedures."
good,"Already did this one."
good,"Ran reports, distributed work to employees, adjusted Medicare claims, Subject Matter Expert and lead  Answered questions and concerns of employees"
good,"I liked my job, just wish we had more support  from management at times. The co-workers were fun to be around and we helped one another. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help a customer due to policies or just not reasonable.I just loved being around people for the most part with passion."
good,"Being headquartered in Louisville, KY, Humana has a large presence across the entire city.  I work at the corporate tower, but Humana alone has offices in 8 building in just the downtown area alone.  The corporate tower has a gym, so I start my morning off by going to the gym everyday.  It's not the biggest or nicest gym, but very convenient and promotes well-being, which is what Humana values.  I work in a department of 40 associates and have a nice, big cubicle to work in.  My co-workers are friendly and are usually available or have open-door policies.  The hardest part of my day-to-day work is keeping up with all my ongoing projects.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the exposure to senior leadership and learning more about human resource practices on a daily basis."
good,My department dress code is business casual for exempt employees.  Management is always encouraging learning new skills to further our advancement.  We are allowed to use all available resources including the Internet to locating information about tasks which require more than what is available in the local documentation.
good,"Humana  was a good place to work I inquire over 16 years of experience working in the Health Care environment where I was able to utilize my organizational, analtyical, customer service, and problem solving skills."
good,"A typical workday was enjoyable because of my co-workers and because we were able to be independent and not micro-managed. We worked from a queue with the members we needed to do our research for and call and organize them with their Nurses. This was based on either the date the task was sent or the importance of the condition the patient had. I have always considered myself to be very organized but, working at Humana provided different learning tools on how to work even more productively and efficiently than I had before. That is what I took mostly from my time with Humana."
good,"•	Directly managed 25 employees at the Tampa Direct Marketing Service call and sales center"
good,Quality company.  Good people.  Leadership is focused and advancement opportunities are available if you deserve it.
good,very busy but fun place to work. poor benefit but the company caters to health and well being.
good,Only a temporary position and I would really have liked to received full time with Humana.
good,Humana is an awesome place to work and build a career. the most enjoyable part of the job was help the customers
good,"A typical day at Humana is dealing with pharmacy claims issues is researching the issue and have the issue fixed. Some cost information changes for members and it has to be updated. I learned alot about being a team player, paying close attention to detail, knowing how to research, how to be more reliable and dependable for my co-workers if they are in need. I get along great with my co-workers and always helping them out if they need the help for work related issues. The hardest part about the job is working long hours, being in all-day meetings, having to be on call if any issues arise, and learning new things on the spot. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to work from home and still being able to get my daily tasks finished."
good,"The typical began with retrieving the admit card from over-night. Then off to pick up charts for the insurance companies, assemble charts from the over night admits."
good,"Good company to work for, Humana is focused on wellness of their associates."
good,"This company based in Louisville, KY offers an excellent orientation, and training program for it's employees. When you return to you local market, you completely know the products you are selling. A base salary of $25k is offered plus a fair commision structure. First year income for me was $70k and went up from there. Mandatory work hours are required with a manager watching your every move."
good,"This work place is unusually respectful of each other, most people are generally happy and take great pride in their work."
good,"micro managed call ctr to meet stats /learned lots about ins claims, denials, hippa, medicare, prior auts with class II narcotics / mngt under pressure / co wrks awsome / hardest part of the job ? / most enjoyable part, communicating with folks all across u.s.a. & abroad"
good,Good benefits and good training provided for the job. Only left because I found a better position.
good,"- Receive inbound calls, authorized prescribed drugs for PDP"
good,"A decent place to work, although they do lay off workers when peak season ends."
good,reviewing prescriptions all day
good,An exciting dynamic company in a fast changing industry. Everyday is a challenge with a very supportive culture.
good,Typical work day was making appt for patients. Learned how to work the Rx refill line. Management was great. Open door policy. My co-worker taught me a lot. Hardest part of my job was sometimes working 12 hr work days. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know the patients. Putting a name with a face.
good,"A typical day at work was very productive. Supervisor and Co-workers were always ready to strive for our daily goals. We always had something new to learn so you had to learn quickly and do your best at the new task. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers that call in because someone has told them the wrong information, and that can be very hard trying to satisfy the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is when each co-worker has meet our monthly goals we would always be eligible for a bonus or gift card."
good,"My typical day at work started at 7:00am. I would log into the system, enter new rxs, check all information entered for accuracy while maintaining production and quality standards. The hardest thing about my job was sitting at my desk for 10 to 12 hours a day, depending on how much Overtime was needed. My Supervisor was great. She was always available for me whenever I needed her. I was on a great team and my co-workers were always available. We helped each other out to ensure the team succeeds together. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was the team building activities. We would have food days and competitions. We were also rewarded for going above and beyond the scope of what was required of us."
good,"Demanding hours, but good benefits and rewards for hard work"
good,"A typical day at Humana includes diversified tasks. Open Enrollment Presentation of products, appointment with HR Manager to educate on the available tools on the web and determine if employer group is interested in adding any other lines of business. Answering phone calls to help customers with answers or provide solutions. Inputing documentaion for each call or issue the member or company called about. I took ownership of any phone call and servicing my employer groups, I provided education and excellent customer service . Humana provided a warm, professional invironment with all co-workers working together for the good of employers, employees and associates. Renewal information delivered positively to employer groups and proposing an upsell is the hardest part of the position. The most fun of the position is building relationships with customers and associates. Humana sponsored underwriting days for brokers and social events for brokers and customers. The most satisfying part for me was providing excellent customer service by solving a problem for a member or employer who was frustrated with healthcare and/or dental issues. Regardless of the outcome, the member or employer appreciated and was satisfied with my effort and determiation to follow through to resolution. What I learned is my true passion is in providing world class customer service!"
good,Discuss claims with providers to assistant in financial obligations being paid by provider.
good,The company has good core values. Benefits are competitive.
good,"The best place to learn about HMO,S. The staff are well trained and educated on all aspects of thier position."
good,Great company environment and many possible opportunities to grow in the company. They are very focused on the employees well being as well try to encourage employees growth.
good,I have enjoyed the overall work experience working for Humana.  The work environment and culture stand out.  The company thinks health is very important and stresses it to their employees.
good,The people and the job was great.  Timing was not on my side at the time.  I lost my mother while working there.  Decided to stop working to grieve and be able to travel to California to check on my father more often.
good,"I work 5 days a week 8-5. I’m connected via cell phone 24/7. I follow, closely, on a daily basis, my inventory of submissions  my team develops solutions to administer unique provider contracts to pay claims and print directories."
good,"the industry as a whole is unstable. Humana was forced to reduce the size of their WAH staff by 30% due to changing environment in the industry.  I got laid off as a result,"
good,"Humana had just purchased the company when I applied. Lengthy interview process and background check. Benefits and pay were excellent for the job description. Office management had some challenges resolving client complaints in a timely manner. Overall, experience was good. I continue to work with the company and refer clients to their new sales staff. Services rendered have been great. I would work for this company again if opportunity presented itself."
good,"A typical day at Humana - I sign into my computer and check emails for new communications and prioritize what I need to work on for the day. I take advantage of any learning/training  opportunities available. My peers and I will voice any concerns or issues that need to be addressed and ask for management assistant if necessary. The hardest part of the day is keeping up with the number of emails that come in on a daily basis, but there is a process in place to address them accordingly. And the most enjoyable part of my job is being able to share my ideas with my peers and respect their opinions."
good,"Humana offered an enriched culture environment to support all of the employees' needs.  I felt comfortable and welcome while working at this company.  There was a lot of support provided from leadership, colleagues, and other who worked there.  I would have to say that Humana adapts quickly to surround environment."
good,"It was productive, learned experience, and had nice after work activities like the fitness center and yoga classes.  I learned and shared a lot through the company and my co-workers."
good,"Difficult to communicate only over the phone or computer. I have not yet started. Humana has sent all the equipment to my home with written instructions however, it is difficult to follow."
good,"Overall great place to work . Will miss my work family . Due to unforeseen layoffs. I am now pursuing another career, and an excited to see what the future holds. With 25 years experience I have a lot to offer potential employers."
good,I received my MBA and have not had any luck of getting a promotion or a raise to equal my credentials.  The time off is flexible and love my co-workers but my cost of living of not being met.
good,"Good place to work.  Concerned about their employees and how work and life co-exist.  Good benefits, PTO, Volunteer time off, annual company bonus.  Work at home options.  Hardest part of the job is redundancy you do the exact same thing everyday."
good,"The company in its core is very good, good pay, good benefits but whenever there is an issue in the job, upper management are not willing to make changes to correct them, instead they pressure their employees to work with these issues."
good,"Good place for young people to work and try to move up. Starting pay is ok, health benefits were not that good due to how expensive they were, PTO was above average."
good,I’ve been at Humana for almost 4 years now. It’s a great company with good benefits but it’s really hard to get out of your department once you get locked in.
good,"Good company if you need to work but not a company to stay forever. Good benefits, vacations,401k but poor management on supervisors and bosses. No part time opportunities but overtime is available sometimes."
good,"A typical day at work begins with coffee and light conversation, review of emails, begin ""to do"" list, attend meetings, complete, reports, projects."
good,4 STARS - It was okay quick paced enviroment and competitive - insurance sales  -busiest time of year was open enrollment season good pay and commission
good,All in all the job is a good job and they are very pro family but things change on a day to day basis. My particular job the career advancement is lacking.
good,"Great PTO and benefits.  "
good,Humana actually cares to put you through a real training to help you succeed right off. Some of the management shouldn’t be managers because they lack relatability or as they like to say if you are on the phones Empathy toward their employees. I think most healthcare companies have the same issue with terrible health insurance options. But you have job security.
good,I did enjoy working with Humana. They took great care of me for the most part. I do believe its too corporate.  That being said this company is family friendly.
good,The company is ok to work for. You really have to be flexible and not afraid of change. If you can do this then you can be successful at Humana. Its all up to you
good,"There is a high call volume."
good,"Pay was exceptional for the work performed. I liked my colleagues and helping military beneficiaries but management was overly reactionary. For example, everything was an emergency and felt as though the sky were falling. It was very stressful."
good,Good on-boarding experience. They equip remote employees with the necessary tools to get the job done. Good communication with remote employees to keep them engaged.
good,"Overall, my experience working for Humana was above average. The salary and benefits were great. Management was fair and supportive most of the time. "
good,"I love my position at Humana and wish I could honestly stay with them. It's hard when life happens sometimes to where you cannot be the employee you want to be and know you can be. They offer fantastic benefits for the employees, you get 23-25 days off a year, 2 floating holidays plus paid holidays off, etc. Management is awesome and works with you."
good,"A typical day starts with calls regarding issues pertaining to EMR or Medical Record Software. Placing tickets, and Troubleshooting tickets in a queue."
good,Working for Humana was a fun experience. The culture within the team on the call center floor was very family oriented. There was a mix of events to keep everyone engaged as well as working which made the day go by much faster
good,Humana is an excellent company to work for. Call center is run efficiently and management is supportive. Not many advancement opportunities in San Antonio location. Schedule your sick days and doctor visits 6 months in advance.
good,Overall the experience working at Humana was good. The job experience acquired while here was worthwhile. Often times during peak enrollment periods mandatory over time was made. Though when the peak was over voluntary time off was often given and work hours quickly decreased.
good,I learned alot working for Humana. I received great training. Always remember to be on time. Keep in mind that all customers are not the same.  Keep a great work ethic and a positive attitude.
good,"Management not good, the work atmosphere was good. The employees were good to work with we had a good team. We had various people with good work ethics and a positive attitude."
good,Great place to work. Hourly is great as well as the extra commissions and bonuses recieved. Work environment is fun and comfortable. Management can have their days but over all fun and helpful.
good,"As a sales person you are expected to generate your own ""unsupported"" business, which is typical but the goals they set for you at different times of the year are sometimes over-whelming. you are also required to set up events and activities to do in the community all with very little interaction from your superiors. It can be great for those who work well independently however it can also be difficult to remain compliant with all the rules and regulations involved with medicare."
good,"The training for AEP was intense.  Humana provided all the tools necessary for employees to pass the AHIP exam.  The hours were intense, but we were well compensated."
good,"The company has undergone significant change in model, a good thing, to stay competitive, and be ahead of the curve. Pace of change can happen too often, and too fast, and recently the company has not allowed one change to marinate, with adoption, before immediately moving into the next change. This has proven to be problematic."
good,Humana presented me with a chance to learn a new business segment while still using my accounting background.  I started as a Credit Supervisor and moved into the Billing & Enrollment Supervisor role while also keeping the credit and collections area.
good,The team leads had poor communication i loved my job i loved what i do but didn’t like how team leaders Handel situation i feel like i deserve a permanent job there for all the hard work i put in but it’s is what it is
good,"Humana is a great company to work for. New management tends to make, or break a company. Unfortunately broke it for me. Humana has the best employees with great personalities. Humana Is great, but their managers could be better."
good,"The managers are a bit incompetent but in their defense, there are constant structural changes taking place within the organization. There is little room for growth when you are working from home and have little face time with managers/leaders"
good,"Most jobs have production values that seem to continually increase.  The supervisor you are assigned to can make working for Humana great or very difficult.  The culture is known for promoting diversity in jobs for women, all ethnic backgrounds, and the LGBTQ community.  "
good,"ok place to work, co workers were nice, management was helpful and the benefits were good as well. Worked there for a lengthy period of time and for the most part enjoyed it"
good,"Humana has a lot of opportunity within to learn new things and advance your skills. The benefits are great and include a generous PTO, learning opportunities (online classes, webinars, etc)."
good,"My role at Humana supported the mail-order pharmacy with escalated customer issues.  There were a lot of problems with the pharmacy, such as orders not received and/or incorrect.  I dealt with customers who were very unhappy with the pharmacy and a customer service agent escalated the call to one of my subject matter experts.  I assisted the customers with the member of the escalation team could not resolve the issue.  It was a difficult and stressful job."
good,"I learned about insurance companies and how they function.  I was able to get experience in various areas which included utilization management, case management, and insurance denials."
good,"Enjoyed the diverse people I worked with and felt comfortable with the leadership of the company. I had the opportunity to move up in the company and was provided the training skills to do so.  I started out as an OTC clerk, moved into shipping and took advantage of the pharmacy technician training program the company offered."
good,"Generally Good leadership "
good,"I enjoyed my time while employed at Humana, they assist employees with tuition reimbursement as well as flex shifts and WAH opportunities.  There where opportunities to work in different departments as well."
good,The company Humana was a great place to work. All members of management were very professional and helpful. The initial training for this job was very detailed and educational to learn. In this position I learned new ways of communicating with patients and nurses when scheduling appointments for the patients. The best part of this job was being able to help patients with their healthcare needs.
good,"I think that the team leaders really didn't understand their role that they were managing other on. For example, you never done the work but you're trying to give advice on certain aspects that they are clueless too."
good,Humana strives to continue to improve work life balance and benefits for associates.  Just rolling out Annual Bonuses for all associates at all levels.
good,"I enjoyed a very collaborative team, as well as leaders who supported my role advancement. Work/life balance diminshed as work to staff ratio imbalanced."
good,"I was in the Quality Review Department for 8+ years. I reviewed Medicare charts for compliance with NCQA guidelines and policy guidelines. I collated reviews and provided monthly , by team and total review information to upper management."
good,"Working for Humana, I am able to work online and over the phone supporting members in health improvement.  I also had the privilege to help members in person during annual corporate health screenings.  "
good,"Company values drive how business operates.  Exceptional benefits including generous PTO, paid volunteer time, 401 K match, culture of engagement and improvement."
good,Humana is a great opportunity for most folks who are interested in healthcare. Unforutnately there are some areas that are fizzling out due to economic demands and unforeseen forecasting which is leading to workforce reduction.
good,"Overall, my experience with employment at Humana was successful. The training program was extensive and structured for all to progress and become educated in Medicare health insurance. Performance with incentives was also a plus."
good,"Excellente service a la clientèle "
good,"first of all I was able to perform my job independently "
good,Humana provides several benefits like onsite gym and cafeteria. Humana has team outings and community contribution opportunities.  There is a lot of training!
good,"Discounts on health and wellbeing products. Incentives for improving your health. Generous family paid leave and personal time off. Health, dental, life, 401k. Emloyee assistance program which extends to helping employees friends and family."
good,"If you can remain a top producer for the company, it is a great place to invest your career in. Constantly changing environment. Pays for all continuing education for licensed agents. Overall great place for a telesales agent"
good,Very professional conducive environment to grow and learn. I learned quite a bit about the medical insurance industry.  Very good communication between manager and myself.
good,Relaxed atmosphere. Great teamwork. After hours activities offered. Help always available if fall behind on work.   Do pre and post reviews of charts.
good,It is what you make of it.  If you put the time in to build your market then you will succeed.  Watch out for management that does not listen to the agents
good,"I love my managers, and over all the company is a great place to work, but they don't compensate like they should. There seems to be a big disconnect between sales agents and upper management."
good,"Rated one of the Best Companies in America.  If you work in Louisville you get many perks that the people in other cities do not receive.  But if you want to relocate, it's the best"
good,Humana provided and opportunity for me to work with diverse and interesting people. Humana afforded me the opportunity to work from home. There was no such thing as a typical day working for Humana. I experienced something different each day while working with the many Humana members. Management was helpful and made me feel supported even though I worked independently from home. The members were the best part of the job. The worst part of the job was the lack of job security. Humana had five layoffs in four years.
good,Enjoyed being a care manager but the company I worked for did not properly explain or give proper instructions to perform job properly. I would suggest working directly with Humana or with a different company that gives better instructions on how to perform the tasks needed to be accomplished.
good,"Humana was a good company to work for however the hourly wage could have been better. Overall, I would work for Humana again if the salary was according to my education and skills."
good,Really enjoy working for Humana! Nice benefits.The company really seems to care about their employees and health initiatives. Many opportunities for advancement.
good,"Really liked the fact that I was able to work from home, I worked in the exceptions department. Had a decent schedule worked 6am to 2:30pm. There was a lot of flexibility if needed."
good,Great company to work. I've been with the company for the last 18 years.
good,Great job for virtual employment opportunity. Virtual positions were available in various career fields. It's best to check the careers section of the webpage for more details.
good,"Company culture was fine.  "
good,Took a minimal of 50 calls a day. I learned a lot about the health field during my time with Humana. Management was great! Very flexible work schedule.. The hardest thing about the job is you really can't help everybody and that is sad to me .. Most enjoyable is when you have a satisfy member!
good,I enjoyed the freedom of the job and visiting with the clients.  manager was not prepared for a new employee with little sales experience in that industry.
good,"Humana is a great place to work. They are very focused on employee/customer Wellness. They walk the walk. Work environment is very collaborative, and provides many opportunities to expand outside your comfort zone, and learn new things to expand self and career."
good,At first leads were provided.. Then them stopped. My sales manager lived too far away.  Really enjoyed meeting clients and sharing with them. I experienced a deep satisfaction when a client signed up for Heath Care Insurance through Humana. The company provided Health Insurance at an affordable premium while also providing them with solid coverage. I sensed a sincere inward feeling that I was an answer to their problem.
good,Working from home was excellent opportunity.  During my time at Humana saw a lot of different roles changes and expectations changed with each job.  I was looking forward to this being my last job before retirement. I was truly disappointed to lose my job as a PHC.
good,"Great place to work and nice people there also. We were not given enough time for lunch or breaks,  However, I got used to the schedule very quickly and I had a pretty cool team to work with,"
good,The last Manager I had when I was there was horrible but I loved working there. I really enjoyed doing the Enrollment and even the claims over the phone wasn’t bad. I just didn’t have the proper Manager.
good,"The typical day as a coordinator included working with a large variety of visitors, from courteous to upset or angry.  Assisting the sales agents, triaging visitors, answering phones and facilitating events and activities.  Training new associates on all job duties."
good,"I really quite liked working at C3 for Humana, if given the opportunity I would go back. The work was interesting enough to keep me invested in what I was doing, and the general workplace culture was very aligned with my own personal values. My managers were excellent at motivating their teams and acknowledging when a team member went above and beyond. The hardest part was probably getting used to a high volume of calls during peak Medicare enrollment times."
good,Great co-workers with a common purpose to succeed.  Company is very large and there was some red tape to cut through in order to acquire IT support to get projects through quickly.  IT department was good to work with but just a lot of moving pieces.
good,"Was a great position 4 years ago, company RIF and movement to data and numbers is decreasing patient quality care. Not sure where the HAH positions are moving to."
good,I learned a lot from working at Humana and it was a great experience. Met a lot of great people there and really liked educating prospects about Medicare Insurance and Supplemental Plans.
good,"Humana is  an excellent company to work for.  They believe in work/life balance for associates as well as our consumers.  They involve their associates in evolving changes to workplace and job duties.  I have been with Humana for 6 years however, it is time for less travel."
good,Nice place to work. Manageable work load. Coworkers & Manager are good to work with. There were many positions that were cut and/or laid off & many that were offered an early retirement package in 2017.
good,"I was able to work from home and gain a lot of new knowledge in healthcare"
good,"Humana, Inc. is a leader in wellness, insurance and benefits. They have a diverse workforce, and encourage diversity in all areas. I worked with the pharmacy, but also had assignments with corporate initiatives. The benefits are generous, and the work demanding. If you want to feel like you make a difference in the lives of those you serve, Humana is the way to go."
good,Great place to work... Alway on the edge of being sold... Great place to start in the industry... Advance all you want... Many career directions one could go
good,"I have enjoyed learning the work at home atmosphere with Humana at Home. Great benefits. Have an amazing experience with my direct supervisor, helpful."
good,I have loved working with Humana. My job has been very rewarding and I have learned a lot in this position. It saddens me that Humana will no longer have the HAH position.
good,Humana offers a great benefits package; Management is transparent in keeping employees up to date with business decisions; Work at home opportunities.
good,"This company is constantly changing. Driven by metrics, everything is measured, analyzed, and rated. It was helpful in someways to know exactly what is expected of you, but it was stressful when there were changes that you had to adjust to quickly in order to stay on top of the metric expectations."
good,"This was a contract job where I knew the exact end date. I was given adequate training and learned some new skills. I worked independently with others doing the same job, but really had no issues or problems."
good,"Human offered telephonic care management to Medicare members. Which gave me an opportunity to teach, guide and assist member in achieving health care goals. I thoroughly enjoyed the personal 1:1 experience with helping the members through difficult times. Working as a team we were able to reach out and assist many members to achieve health goals."
good,Everyone works hard and is capable. Fast pace. Lots of starts and stops. Need solid direction. Merger threw a curveball but back to business as usual.
good,"Friendly and fun place to work. Easy going work environment.  Encourage a diverse workforce and provide a workplace free from discrimination, harassment or any other form of abuse.  Treat employees fairly and honestly, including with respect to wages, working hours and benefits."
good,"Good place to work. Can be fast paced and stressful at times, some tools to use to do job should be updated.More rooms for advancement with in job field"
good,"A typical day - Make room rservation, equiptment, help get meetings set-up, Helping leaders with anything they needed.  I was always availble for what ever they needed"
good,Atypical work day as a care manager/PHC at Humana entailed calling members to discuss health behavior and encourage healthy management of their conditions. I love talking to older adults. There was a lot of motivational and change talk. The work place culture was awesome. Team work was encouraged. the hardest part of the job was leaving.  Humana was forced to make some tough decision and my positions was eliminated. This was by far the best job I have every had.  The work like balance was awesome!
good,Very relaxed environment. As an onboarding specialist initially there was no set procedure due to this being a startup department. A few hiccups but a nice work environment.
good,"always  had something to keep you busy at work never a down side  always throwing events for there employs lunch,breakfast they would help and train you on any thing you needed"
good,I have been able to maintain a work life balance for many years. There is always someone willing to help you grow your talent. Alot of opportunities to learn new skills. Leaders have been supportive.
good,Benefits are good. Enough time off. Encouraged to volunteer. They offered different  ways to be educate.Hardest part was having to ask time off two weeks in advance.
good,Enjoyed working with the clients and helping them to resolve any and al issues relating to their claims.  I also worked with the provider's and helped to ensure and resolve any payment issues they had with patients claims.
good,I grew as a social worker through educational training on chronic conditions and motivational interviewing. I was able to work at home and not feel stress from commuting to an office on a daily basis.
good,You will either Love it or Hate it. Depends what department and the leadership over it. People are friendly and training is excellent under the right trainer. Overall its a good atmosphere to work in and can be a fun environment.
good,"Workplace culture is different depending on the dept. Most departments you are not micro managed and the day really depends on you. As long as goals and deadlines are met it can be a pretty laid back and relaxing environment. Can be stressful at times, but the company offers wellness time. The dept. I am in now is business casual, but most areas you can wear jeans. The hardest part of the company is advancement ( some areas it is about who you are friends with and not your skills or contributions). The most enjoyable part is not being micro managed and having flex start and end time at your discretion."
good,Great for someone who doesn't mind sitting all day.  Had the opportunity to work with very outgoing and helpful managers and frontline leaders.  Metrics and quality determine whether you keep or lose your job.
good,The volatile Individual Health Insurance environment made the last few years stressful with constant layoffs.  Great opportunities when things were good.
good,"Great company, bad management, its about who you know and not about what you know. Some of the management team can be intimidating at times. There needs to be a local HR team."
good,This is a very diverse plae to work with room for advacement. If your looking for a place you can be yourself and have fun whuile working and like a good challenge this is a place for you.
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Humana. They are a high energy, past paced environment. The constant here is change. Even amidst the changes the management tries to be as supportive as possible."
good,"If you follow rules and regulations and are willing to work hard, you can advance and do well in this company. It's not a bad company to work for. I enjoyed it."
good,"Loved working at Humana. Manager was awesome, people were fun to work with on  my team. I was able to make a lot of money while working at Humana. They don't tell you whether you are going to come on Full Time or not. They let me go the day of and walked me out. They brought me back two months later full time but had to let my other job go. Back to back phone calls."
good,"Es una compañía con una larga trayectoria en Colombia, que busca impactar los hogares Colombianos."
good,Humana has been my home for almost 2 decades.  It has served me well and as with any company there have been good and bad.  I would encourage individuals seeking employment to research who their leader is and who the upper management they are reporting up through is.  This will tell you if the culture fits you.
good,"Was a great place to work for until I got sick.  Their attendance policy is cut, dried, and to the point.  It doesn't matter if you are sick or not.  There is no room for leniency."
good,Work expectations can be overwhelming if not autonomous.  Must very organized and well versed in this position.  Enjoyed working with members to reach their health care goals.
good,I was working with very closely. I felt good and enjoyed with  my work. My self and my seniors always called for playing and make enjoyable moment. I enjoyed in Humana
good,I've fully enjoyed working for this company but the job security and opportunity to advance within is low. If I can find something internally I would stay. Many jobs with the ability to work from home.
good,I greatly enjoyed working summers at Humana. The pay was fair and  I had the opportunity to learn about multiple departments that make up the company. The only complaint that I have is that after graduation I was not sought out by the company for employment opportunities even with my experience as an intern. Even after applying for several positions within the company I was never given a call back for a interview.
good,Humana is a great company to work for. I have had a great opportunity to learn and grow while being present in my family's life. The culture to THRIVE is apparent throughout the business model.
good,"Work life Balance "
good,"I worked at the corporate tower in a niche position. I had incredible support from management and I worked with an amazing team."
good,Humana is not a bad company. There are a lot of politics played into it. Internal advancement is really hard and trying to outshine other associates for the job is hard. HR does not tell you what you can do to be  better nor does management.
good,"A day at starts around 8 ends around 5:30 easy and straight it to. Management is laid back but like to see production. Since being at humana I've learned so much about the corporate work field and how it runs! I've also learned a lot about myself while I was there. "
good,"Saludar con Buenos dias, coordinarme para las presentaciones, despues de hablar con mi gerente y mis companeros. En actitud positive y siempre mirando que se trabaja en equipo. Le agradesco a la compania que me hizo de  una Carrera profesional como representante de ventas y aprendi   a hablar el ingles y como manejar una computadora, y ademas ser persistente hasta lograr las metas. Lo mas dificil para mi es haber conseguido una cita para una presentacion y cuando llego la persona no esta, Y  tener entonces que buscar otra cita que me tomara  mas tiempo en el dia. Y lo que mas me gusto fue el  profesionalismo con el cual se trabaja, la organizacion y  el apoyo y el respaldo de la compania, ademas de  las actividades de ventas, el café, el companerismo y  los entrenamientos."
good,"Humana has great benefits and compensation.  There is also the security of working for a large corporation.  If your position is eliminated, there's a good chance you can find something somewhere else within the company if you choose."
good,"I currently manage a roster of 92 medically fragile patients.  This population is about 10% of the medical population that uses 90% of healthcare dollars. I work with the patient, their family/caregivers, Providers, Therapist, nurses in their homes and in the facilities, DME companies, Social Workers, BH providers, and Social Services.  I assist the member to reach their health goals, keep them in the community, maximize their insurance benefits, navigate the health care system to meet their needs, educate them on their current health status and how to manage and improve their health.  I help them with their current health conditions, mental health, resources, finances, improving their function, and any social concerns."
good,"Good company to work for. Typical day is usually 8 hours of data entry. Workplace culture was good, welcoming environment. Enjoyed flexibility of time to come into work."
good,"Rounded at several Skilled Nursing Facilities to review patients for appropriateness of stay, quality of care and discharge planning needs.  Traveled to facilities and rounded with Physician to meet patients and family members, review their medical charts and complete assessments into the Humana Health system.  Enjoyed working with the staff and the Physician.  Hardest part of the job was covering other team members resulting in a very large census."
good,"A Company where we can share our thoughts and company where we can work freely without any pressures."
good,This place was fun to work at until they started merging with Aetna. My first manager was amazing but my second was not. Inclusive and clicky.
good,"Worked for them for less than a year, that was enough to feel pretty comfortable with them, very nice people - southern style - I will recommend this company for anyone seeking peace of mind in a work place."
good,Working at Humana was a learning experience.  The staff was wonderful and we found that education was the key to success.  We tried to make sure that all contracts that were written could be paid first pass.  Working with the hospitals to educate and help with claims disputes.
good,Humana treats their employees very well and acknowledges that work life balance is important.  However thier health insurance benefits for employees are not as good as one might expect working for a health insurer.
good,Great company to work for when in school and trying to get a education and work you way up. They have a lot of great benefits that are beneficial and the people are amazing
good,"Super flexible, work at home, flexible hours, great leadership. My specific team is great. We all work well together, assistance is available when needed, and we support one another."
good,The company has a lot of flexibility when it comes to work/life balance and there are many opportunities for advancement. You will constantly learn new things and processes.
good,"flexible, dependable, nice coworkers and management always room for growth and advancement. central location and room for advancement. they cater to their employers."
good,Humana is a great place to work. The company makes sure the representatives are provided plenty of job training and updated benefit information as soon as the information is available keep the representatives informed. I worked in the customer service call center.

good,"Infusion LDP was a huge let-down"
good,"Great place to work. Unfortunately, I was a temporary emplyee and number 2 in productivity. On a saturday mornig, I received a call telling me that I am no longer working in this position, which will be filled by a Spanish speaker whereas the position deos not require a Spanish-speaker. Since I had no say as a temporary emplyee, I had to accept whatever position they had available though unrelated to my field of study."
good,No standardization among job titles or skill.  some analyst move mountains while other can't even open excel.  some can't even connect to the internet without help
good,"Work is done at individual desk with pc and two monitors to better access the many programs used to correct member applications. Draw daily work from an ""error tank"" and follow procedures set up to correct application errors so it may be submitted for the proper coverage the member is seeking. There are different variations and combinations of healthcare insurance available for qualifying individuals to help met their medical and financial needs. Work atmosphere although serious, was friendly and somewhat family like. Management as well as fellow co-workers were helpful throughout the daily process. The hardest part of the job besides sitting at a desk for 8 to 10 hours daily was informing an applicant that they didn't qualify for requested insurance. The best part obviously was correcting application issues so that member's insurance would be effective on the requested date."
good,"I was recruited from Bank of America, and asked to come hire a new staff of ~850 associates; from data entry to pharmacy technicians and pharmacist with my knowledge of this particular job type."

good,"Working for Humana was both a learning and growth opportunity."
good,"Under en månad var mina arbetsuppgifter att ta hand om två individer under 18 år från kväll till morgon. Jag såg till att de fick medicin, lagade mat och hjälpte dem med deras hygien. Vid behov städade jag och ansvarade för inköp av mat och dylikt. När det vara dags för sjukhusbesök ordnade jag med transport och jag var med vid besöket."
good,You do not get raises. It is  nearly impossible to make bonus.There  is no more to tell. I would not recommend this company to anyone.
good,This company had the ups an downs of most fortune 100 company's. The main downfall was that management was not in touch with the sales force.
good,"Humana has excellent benefits, especially 401K. Not always room for advancement as people tend to stay on long time.  Very supportive management and far."
good,Nice place to work. You have the ability to move up very fast if you are willing to work for it. People are very friendly. They push you to live a more healthy life style.
good,"The company offers a flexible schedule and potential to work at home two days a week or as a permanent work at home position. My co-workers are fantastic to work with which makes going to work everyday much more enjoyable. I love that the company has a set policy of  accepting all diverse cultures, races, and backgrounds."
good,"I really enjoyed working there, co workers were wonderful, my teammates were wonderful as well. I love the fact that we got unlimited overtime during AEP, so all that extra money was going straight to the bank. I love the fact that there was free food and what not"
good,"This was my first office job and I enjoyed it very much. I had the opportunity to learn to work around different groups of people, and different types of customers. I did both data entry and customer service. We usually had weekly meetings about policy updates or production changes. My co-workers came from all different back grounds and were always willing to help each other. The thing I enjoyed the most about my job were the customers."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Humana. My department was amazing, and my co-workers were easy to get along with. The benefits package offered is amazing. I felt I was fairly compensated for my work."
good,"Your co-workers will become your life long friends. Humana has a knack for hiring associates that blend well together. There is no age discrimination and they do not hesitate to hire ""senior workers""."
good,"Humana is a great place to work. The atmosphere is welcoming and the people are great to work with. I start my mornings by reviewing the previous day's inventory and creating reports for the upcoming work day. This Report gives the Specialist an overview of what's out there and used as a guide to help prioritize what needs to be completed first. I have learned how to become a leader, even though I am already self-motivated. Honestly, I really can not say there is a hard part about the job because it doesn't feel like a job at job most of the time. I enjoy being a part of the success, making sure Providers are loaded into he systems where members can select them for their needs."
good,"As an insurance company dealing with new products related to the ACA there is a lot of change and flexibility needed on the part of employees. It was a great place to see how the insurance part of health care worked for a large company. "
good,"Fast changing work processes with growing business structure and stragety.  The typical day is packed with projects for new business structures and reporting, changing management and expectations."
good,Nice company to work for.Low on compensation but takes good care of employees.
good,"•	Applied prudent approach in planning and marketing products and services to Medicare eligible."
good,"It would be wise for them to find better programs to work with on the ""off season"". Many days after enrollment period ended, would only receive one or two calls a day. Could have continued uptraining such as getting Life license, or work more with dental and vision for the elderly. If not, provide volunteer hours for employees to work with the elderly at care centers, nursing homes, etc. to expose us to the people we worked with every day."
good,"Worked for Company 25 years good company work for, but layoff policy not stable."
good,"Quotas to meet but otherwise an excellent company and benefits."

good,"Enjoyed working with a great group of people."
good,"Highly motivating, co workers were nice and management was good."
good,"Took inbound and outbound customer service calls for customer's who would need to order they're pharmacy medications via the mail.  I had great quality, AHT (Average Handle Time), and was an all around all star player.  I had to relocate a great distance and currently am looking for similar work immediately.  Co workers at Humana were awesome, management was even better surprisingly.  The hardest part of the job was too obtain 95% or above quality, but too be honest, that was also the funnest part.  I worked there for over 2 years, so I obviously had no problem there."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the company offered a flexible work schedule.

good,"-Tested new features & processes to train Claims department"
good,"many requirements, RN with many responsibilities, my immediate supervisors were great and understand the demands of the job."
good,"Working in the department I worked in was very hectic, as we were researching and resolving problems with enrollee's paperwork and resubmitting it to CMS. We had a deadline to meet and so it was very fast-paced. We were constantly being taught new programs and different skills to help other departments with their workload. I learned alot about multi-tasking, and about being able to ""switch gears"" at a moment's notice."
good,"Worked this position while going to undergrad during the day and processing appeals and medicals and night at Humana. I learned that this isn't something to do longterm, but it was for the moment.  The hardest part of the job was the late night shift. The most enjoyable part was the paycheck."
good,You take a lot of calls and get a chance to help people. They paid for my health licenses. My supervisor was excellent and I met a lot of great people. During the busy season you get a chance to make a lot of money too
good,"With the changes and developments in healthcare over the past few years, the company is leading a charge to focus people's attention on well-being and preventative health/lifestyle changes. As such, the internal culture is changing to encourage more progressive work environment and innovation. This makes for challenges as middle management adapts to the new direction, but it offers lots of opportunities to learn and push in new directions. The company attracts high level talent from the local market and is bringing experienced leaders from outside of the state into the community.  "
good,Humana is a great place to work and they offer a lot of opportunities.
good,"Overall good place to work."
good,"worked as customer service rep, worked 9 hours a day. Had a nice manager. I got along well with co-workers."

good,I absolutely loved this job. The co-workers was amazing and even the customers were very sweet. If I didnt have to move I would still be there. We would have littile picnics sometimes and play games in the office and they would have lunch spreads regularly I mean it really was a good place
good,"My typical day at work starts by getting in 30 minutes early to check emails and crucial updates. Log into phone and begin taking calls to provide senior citizen's with options on Medicare Health Plans & Medicare Drug Plans. Setup Appointments to have agents come out and review plans with eligible Medicare individuals, agent will enroll them in a plan or I would complete enrollment over the phone if potential member isn't interested in an in home appointment. What I've learned is everything about Medicare, Humana Medicare health and drug plans I never knew plus other products offered by Humana I was licensed to sell. Our management team's worked a buddy system if our manager wasn't available we went to there buddy. My new co-worker's counted on me for guidance and help when they couldn't figure out call or phone enrollment on there own. When open enrollment is over the hardest part of the job is to reach goal on outbound calling days. I enjoy when I've been told by my customer that I did an exceptional job assisting them with there needs."
good,Good place to work if you are interested in the insurance field.
good,"Great company, poor leadership. Great way to get your foot in the door of medicare health insurance. Employees are great people. Some of the management and upper management are so numbers driven that they lose sight of people, and obstacles people face. However there are some managers that are quiet wonderful and have great management styles."
good,"Primarily served as a receptionist. Learned 10 line switchboard, computers and all other office equipment. Good experience, fun office and very nice coworkers. I enjoyed all the contact with our clients and agents. Amazing benefits."
good,"A supportive company with great values and goals for the future in healthcare. My co-workers were supportive, fun and educated. I felt listened to by my managers and peers."

good,"OP registration for day surgeries,labs, and x-ray. Moved to business office responsible for IP admissions,insurance, verification"
good,Working for a movie theater was definitely a fun experience. Aside from the benefit of free movies the people i worked with were amazing.
good,"A typical day at work would clocking in, reading all the mentor documents to find out what has changed so we don't give about the incorrect information. Start to deal will all the problem that come in for that day and solve them. I learned that I needed to pay more attention to my mothers health insurance and what she was paying for. My team at work is the best part of my job. We are like a family. We get the job completed and we still support each other, just like a small family"
good,The level of work is high but the benefits and growth opportunities make up for it. You also learn a lot since it is a company that has a wide range of programs and applications.
good,"I learned and developed the majority of my health insurance knowledge for claims and eligibility with this company. There is a lot of room for advancement and an excellent opportunity to keep you busy working under pressure, which is great because the time is just flying by while it is indeed a possibility for metrics and productivity to line up."
good,"Arranging schedule for patient care the night before, calling the patient to schedule making sure it is a time that works for pt and is productive for therapist. Next day review patient notes and schedule and see patients from 9-4. Documentation occurs in the home to achieve accurate info and to insure work /life balance."
good,"productive fun workplace, good management , good work environment, supportive team members, opportunities to progress and move forward, career buiding"
good,Overall wasn’t a bad experience. Definitely an entry level start to say the least. Pay increases were hard to achieve given the lock in of yearly reviews. Management are part time puppets for sure and have no real say in overall departmental shifts.
good,"Communication and respect is the key to a healthy, happy, and productive work environment. There are no problems at this point. Having respect for yourself is key to having respect for others. Always communicating with your patient and their families will help provide a resolution for any issue that could  make itself present."
good,Good teamwork. I love the working environment. Management is well organized. A typical day at work would be a given task and its achievement at the end of the day. I learned good teamwork is essential to get an overall great result.
good,"Humana is a good company to work for. There are lots of opportunities available but they are not broadcasted and took almost two years to learn of some of the options.  I was able to Work From Home and hone in on my time management skills, however it is lonely if you are a people person and love to be around people as this position was phone conversations most of the day.   I enjoyed meeting with my coworkers weekly, and more about diversity as our team included people from all over the United States."
good,Great job for experience and learning pharmacy procedures as they relate to members. Good to enhance any existing medical background. Good opportunities for advancement.
good,Humana is a solid company and they really go the extra mile with their culture. Humana is a very well respected organization and that has been earned over decades of being a good corporate citizen.
good,"I had a good experience with Humana.  I am looking to get back into more hands on care versus telephonic.  The metrics were doable, but you do have to give 100% to meet them!"
good,"I learned a lot after the training the Instructor's were very helpful, you will have to come with the understanding how Insurance works to learn their products."
good,"Great Manager, Great Company. I have had a great experience with my Manager and Co workers. Love educating people with Medicare and offering great benefits."
good,"Im ok with my position at Humana. Good pay, decent benefits, and decent work life balance. Better than Metlife, Brighthouse Financial, or McKesson. So far so good."
good,"Management focus is on productivity targets, meeting goals, and customer service. Has great programs in the organization that promote wellness and work/life balance."
good,"Be nice to those around you , be energetic be polite this place is very confusing  at first but then u get the hang of it evryone is really nice and polite"
good,"The experience was very challenging, but I have gained a lot of knowledge' and I have learned a lot and it has opened a wide array for me in the corporate world."
good,"Good money and flex schedule. Worked as a data Analyst in Creditable Coverage.  Management depends on your manager, some are great and some bot so great."
good,Everyone was helpful. If I had a question there was always someone there to help. Management was always available to answer questions. Outgoing environment.
good,A great experience while it lasted. Hoping to continue employment here. The compensation was awesome and the work and home life compatible is to dream for.
good,Great place to work. Friendly coworkers and supervisors. Great pay and incentives. Great bonuses and willing to work with employees as far as schedules and time off.
good,Worked with some of the best professionals in the industry. I was referred by a friend of mine and connected with one of the regional managers who took the time to help me learn the business and be successfully not only while I was there but even beyond that at my future jobs.
good,I enjoyed working at Humana. I like the fact that there was a salary along with commission. I enjoyed helping seniors with the health services. I sold Medicare advantage plans as well as Medicare supplement plans. With the Supplement plans I also sold prescriptions drug coverage. I sold dental and vision coverage as well.
good,Not a bad place to work. I was in my position for 2 years and wanted to move on but got stuck in my position. The expectation was set for advancement and it did not happen.
good,Humana genuinely cares about its associates and put resources into programs and benefits to improve associate satisfaction.  There are opportunities for advancement for those who work hard and have ambition.
good,The typical day at work is not typical.  There is always a new challenge.  There is a constant push to improve processes to simplify based on new technology.
good,"lots of layered management - lots of work to do, you can get engaged with the folks in the markets - from a provider network standpoint lots of great financial analytics.  very sound and robust medicare contracting strategy - from value based contracting to bundled payments"
good,Very productive work place. Typical day at work would be trying to pay your medical claims. You are tasked with meeting your quota every day. I learned how to pay long term home health claims. i enjoyed the system we use to adjudicate the claims.
good,A driven organization focused on results to meet stock price.Emphasis on individual key performance indicators and measurable metrics on activity and results. Client driven organization equipped to meet expectations for large employers specifically in specialty product markets.
good,Only thing bad is all the yearly layoffs that occur.  Great schedule and vacation time. Also personal days are given and one hour of wellness time per week.
good,"This was a great company to work for. Management was good, not great. Some favoritism Overall good company to work for. Processes are not always easy, a lot of changes is short time."
good,"Great benefits and great culture.  highly recommended for those who want a challenge.  there are a lot of tough departments, but the work they do is rewarding."
good,In word and deed Humana focuses on customer experience.  Top executives understand that consumers have choice and lead the enterprise in focus on delivering positive experiences.
good,Overall a great company to work for with lots of opportunities for advancement. Occasional bonuses and great work/home balance. Can be hectic and busy during certain times of the year but make up for it at other times.
good,Most of my interaction with managers was supportive. Being self-directed and getting help from the team keeps challenges to a minimum. Fast paced. Rules change frequently and not interpreted the same by each manager. PTO is flexible depending on the manager and team coverage. Benefits and initiatives to keep employees healthy a great bonus to coming to work everyday.
good,Management wanted us to succeed and assisted us with that goal. Many training classes to keep us up to date on any changes.  Insurance as well as processes can change sometime daily.
good,"Typical day is writing and implementing code to transfer data from one place to another. "
good,Humana is a good place to work if you are looking for a sit down job and good benefits. You will learn a lot once you get into training. Management is good.
good,"I would say the job was excellent overall, although I did feel like they would try to  pressure us into accepting more than one role at the company and that would be the key to success when it came to working queues since it's easy to artificially inflate numbers if you don't log much hours into doing a specific task. unfortunately for me I preferred to stay in only doctor call and eventually keeping up with the queue rate became a much more difficult task."
good,"Humana is a growing company.  However, they need to take some of the money they make and invest in updated computer systems.  There are toooo many of them to be effective in the time frame they want you to handle a call."
good,"For the most part I enjoyed working for Humana. The worst part about the payroll department was working with 3 other women who were extremely negative and complained about everything. Instead of being efficient in their work they did alot of redundant work in a very manual way. Anytime you tried to show them a new way or a faster way of organizing their data to get through it faster, they would get really upset and say, ""this is how we've always done it"". After a year of dealing with the negativity and resistance to change, you just say enough it enough. Other than that, I liked working for the company itself. They are diverse, inclusive and have a great culture and are very collaborative."
good,most days are spent on the phone with members educating them on there dx and how to improve health. Weekly meetings. Often have changes with style of charting.
good,"Even though it is a call center and some of the basic issues are there (dealing with metrics, following scripts, micromanagement, etc), as call centers go, this is the best I have ever seen. The pay is great for the position (due to being a government contractor) and the environment is professional. Dress code is jeans and a nice shirt. Call centers are not for everyone, but if call center work is your thing, you can't beat this place. Management is pretty good. Getting time off is tough since we all have to pull from one spot. If too many people already have that day off, too bad."
good,"i had a wonderful experience working at Humana. I learned a lot about the Medicare Industry and the benefits of having a Medicare plan. It also helped me to understand how the benefits work for my 75 year old mother,"
good,"Room for advancement are your biggest motivators as the opportunities are plenty."
good,"Humana mailroom is a overall good place to work. Get paid fairly well for the work you do. They provide benefits, good health insurance. Discounts to employees."
good,A typical day at work is very busy.  Call volume is high. Not a mandatory time limit on calls. Multiple systems being used while multi-tasking.  Beneficiaries are difficult at times.
good,Im willing to go back in October to work it was pretty much simple of what they asked you to do. Wasn't much complications just got to pay attention to certain things.
good,"Humana was always looking for a way to be ahead of all other carriers.  They are very innovative when it comes to being at the top. "
good,"Pleasure working with them, but there were ups and downs. Web site needs to be updated for members, to provide more accurate information. That would help to reduce so many problems members have with their plans."
good,I enjoyed working for Humana. They have flex hours which made it easier to balance work and home life. Every day is a chance to learn something new and to keep up with the constant changes in medical coding.
good,"The main role I played was customer service talking to people who where hostile was something something you had to do, and you had to remain professional. I loved being able to resolve issues people where having and felt like I was making a positive impact; while giving them top notch quality customer service."
good,"You spend your day answering phones to schedule appointments at the various military bases for active duty, their families, and veterans.  Errors in scheduling are not allowed.  Very stressful working enviroment."
good,I loved the culture of Humana. I was able to learn a lot about the different programs offered for seniors and individuals with disability. I worked the post hospitalization program and worked in the field with other collaboratives as a team to ensure each person successfully discharged from hospital and had all services in place.
good,"Great people, pay was above average, but it can be taxing. overall great experience. i enjoyed the people i worked with but the sales portion of the job got to be more than i wanted to put up with."
good,I work with a great team and I love what I do. I am able to change lives and be there for patients and other staff. I love coming to work and being around the team I have
good,"Since the position with the military is a work from home, my organization skills are very important along with the ability to work independently. The disease management postilion is telephonic, utilizing  computer applications and  nursing judgement, providing clinical advise to enhance the quality of life and health of all our clients. Our team worked together, a very supportive group. Management was available, providing encouragement and leadership. I enjoyed working with the military, those who served our country, giving to all, asking for nothing in return. It is difficult, however, it is time for me to build my career and  venture back in the direct care setting of nursing."
good,Some things they could change but overall the job is good and the people are wonderful. Very comfortable work place. Need more money for everything we do.
good,My typical work day for Humana was answering inbound calls from members for enrollment of there mail order pharmacy. If they were already enrolled in the mail order pharmacy I would also take the members prescriptions to refill there orders.
good,"Good place to work. Focused on the well being of our members and the associates. Very diverse opportunities including IT, data analysis, Project Management, direct patient care, and research."
good,"Innovative health care company that evolves with market needs. Team work encouraged and rewarded, as well as individual efforts. Career development encouraged and nurtured."
good,"Great place to work , had no problems in working there , great atmosphere . Leadership cared for employees . Morale of team was important to managers , teamwork"
good,It’s a great place to work - until you start to feel as if you don’t have much of a personal life. I only say that because the work & life balance could use A LOT of improvement for employees. Work hours/shifts aren’t the best.
good,Great place to work and good experience in working within a very large company.  A typical day is 75% in meetings and 25% out of meetings.  Everyone was very nice to work with and professional.
good,"Quality manager, able to work from home, great benefits, job security is poor. Humana tends to change there programs frequently making job security poor. They try to hire within but jobs are not always available."
good,"I really don't have anything to say about this job role. It was a short term contract. Everything went well as far as I am concerned."
good,"I told by my supervision I would be able to work at home like most of the rest of the people in mu dept, however, the Director over rode that decision, and stated it was n office only."
good,"Humana offered a variety of work environments. As an ""agile work"" employer, you could work anytime, anyplace, anywhere. This flexibility was not only good for employees, it was also beneficial for Humana, by saving significant money on leasing and real estate costs."
good,Buena experiencia y un buen trabajo me gustaba hablar con los miembros y hacer la cita para  la enfermera
good,Humana was a nice job. I loved the job itself the hours that I worked and lived the benefits of the job! It was also very convenient for me for my cummute. And if I could go back I would.

good,Humana was a great company to work for because of the work life balance. Humana cares about the health of the associates with discounted gym membership
good,"great experience to have! Coworkers are amazing with beautiful spirits! An hour lunch, 30 mins with pay time isn't so bad!  A typical day at work is a decent day."
good,Att respektera varje människa avs  hur den ser ut.
good,Was able to participate in several special projects.  Worked alongside counselors as well as Sales and Marketing personnel.  Culture was one of doing the most for the client.
good,"If you are good at sales this is the place for you!  This job has good benefits, nice PTO, but is very competitive.  You have the opportunity to increase your salary due to OT during the enrollment periods."
good,"*Daily processing of group enrollments, assisted employees with obtaining missing information for enrollment forms, assisted with status changes, assisted agents with admin support"
good,Humana was a decent place to work from home. Humana has great benefits and the healthcare incentives were great! They truly care about your growth with the company.
good,"Benefits for Humana are awful, however pay is great for Technicians. Depending on department, you can be micromanaged. That being said, if you don't like the department you are in, your FLL will help find another department to better suit you."
good,I enjoyed my 9 year tenure with Humana.  Good work environment and wonderful co-workers. I only left because I needed to spend more time at home and there were no part time positions available.
good,Great place for career development. Welcoming professional environment with emphasis on inclusion of all associates. Many different roles for cross training opportunities.
good,"Humana is a great company to work for. My only reason for leaving is due to excessive long-term mandatory overtime hours. There are advancement opportunities, good benefits and a comfortable, casual environment."
good,"Was with company over 14 years till area was out sourced to another company. Was a good company to work for , but upper management decided that for tax write offs that job could be done by an outside vendor."
good,"While working for Humana, I had a great boss who respected the job I did.  Work moral was very high and employees had fun while working.  Employees wanted to do their best for the company."
good,"A great company to work for, however like any other company it has it's ups and downs.  I did enjoy the flexibility but did not like being moved to different departments without any control as to weather you wanted to go there or not."
good,"Humana got a conducive working environment, very friendly and team spirit. my time spend here was very useful as it expose me to challenges that has help me grow in so many aspects which i am using in my daily work- life till date."
good,"Humana has some great benefits, as well as their Pros and Cons which is with any career these days, only left my past position due to illness in my family. I enjoyed working from home, some managers are better than others but all in all I enjoyed my roles at Humana."
good,Enjoyed working with the people at Humana and enjoyed the fact that I could work at home. Had an awesome Supervisor. Logged into computer each morning and your time was tracked and your production. Enjoyed our monthly meeting outside of work.
good,"No workplace is perfect but Humana was considered a good workplace. The managers are really good, there's always something to learn. The benefits were also good."
good,"Contact members over the phone and answer e-mail. "
good,"Great entry level job and you can work your way up.  If you have SQL  skills I think that's a definite advantage.  Management just depends, you could have micro managers or managers who let you do your own thing."
good,"Great and fun place to work, positive and healthy work environment. Was made to feel very comfortable from day one walking in the doors, management and supervision were very laid back"
good,"Humana was a great place to work,"

good,"Working Humana, not only did they train us on all the necessary tools we needed to provide great customer service, Humana management cares about your well being"
good,"I actually worked for Rightsource which is a subsidiary of Humana, which didn't enjoy all of the perks of Himana employees. There were always fun activities going on. And the business was always top priority. The shifts were varied and most were happy with their shifts. Very supportive environment,  managers were helpful and supportive, and encouraged progressing in the company."
good,Humana has some very talented employees and willing to help you when needed. Training is available and benefits are outstanding. The processes used in IT are some of the best I've seen.

good,"Grateful for the experience.  I learned how to care for medicare patients with chronic conditions. I assisted in preventing hospitalizations, disease prevention, compliance and promoting healthy lives."
good,"During my years working for this company, I found the experience very informative and I enjoyed the working culture.  I started at the company not having any experience with case management.  I was given a very thorough training program and was able to grasp the job quickly and efficiently."
good,"Working at Humana started out very exciting. The company Humana at Home was growing, and it was good to be a part of this growing experience. About two years ago the company started undergoing some major changes that resulted in work force reduction and restructuring. This made it a very unstable work environment as one can imagine. So, as one impacted the experience has been both good and bad for me. But , as unfortunate and painful as workforce reduction is, on the overall I can't say I had a bad work experience while working for Humana."

good,Senior Bridge the Manhattan branch is okay! I love the staff but they don't always have cases and most of the cases is racist folks that makes its hard to complete the task that's given. The rate of pay is really bad and the hours isn't their to pay rent or keep the lights on. That's why i'm in school because home health aide position isn't my last stop in the work field.

good,"Humana is a great place to work.  One of the largest employers in town.  From time to time, it's always good to find an open position where one can learn and grow, actively contribute to a team, and feel like one is a part of something bigger."
good,"Humana is a great company over all, you do have to work a lot of overtime but managers are more than willing to create a good work life balance. just have to be willing to work hard"

good,No comment: I will say it was a great place to work... Lots of work... In some cases you were obligated to do mandatory overtime. The medical benefits were great.
good,"Productive Work environment as well as fun."
good,"During my years of working for Humana, I was happy thinking I would be transitioning into a Health coach for the company. When I realized that position would not be as expected, I began looking for other options, first within the company, then outside."
good,This is a Health organization that is working hard to make a difference in the health of a community.  Could be more cutting edge.  Could be more competitive.
good,"Great places to work.  Supervisor interacts with the teams by having competed for games with rewards and gifts. Outside the office activities, and family."
good,"A lot of early or late shifts. You will never work a regular 40 hour week, closer to 50 plus. Days are spent in a lot of meetings and catching up on work. Be prepared to do your job and everyone's too. Management will change quite a lot due to advancements."
good,Humana was OK to work for.  Would have stayed longer had contract not ended.  Great atmosphere and great people plus great discounts with different vendors.

good,I enjoyed my time with Humana. Time for change.  I worked with some great people.  The benefit package is awesome. I would like a company i can grow with.
good,"A typical day would include, perfect experience for our members, showing empathy, problem solving skills, phone skills and being able to communicate with team members. The hardest part of the job is not being able to rely on the systems used to do job completely and accurately."
good,You learn a lot about different parts of the health care system works. Work items are easy after training.
good,Loved working at Humana. Didn’t really enjoy the call center environment but the front line leaders do anything for their employees to make them more comfortable. If you don’t mind the sales goals and being on the phone all day then this job is for you.
good,"Humana is a great place to work. It possesses a very smart and progressive leadership, focused intently on innovation and staying ahead of the competition on new business models and best practices."
good,"Nice place to work, great benefits, good work-life balance with work at home potential.  Management could be better organized and not show favoritism."
good,The atmosphere was high stress at times but If you are willing to work hard it is noticed by the management team and advancement is easy if you continue to prove yourself. They also offer work from home positions which is a great plus.
good,"Humana is a great company to work for. They cater to their employees by promoting wellness and work/life balance. They offer volunteer time off in addition to normal paid time off. They also offer work from home opportunities. Management varies as far as micromanagement. It really depends on your manager and how they run their team. I was fortunate to have 2 managers that did not micromanage while one manager I had did. The work can be stressful like any other form of work but it is manageable. I am no longer employed only due to a recent restructure in the division HAH where I worked otherwise I would have remained with the company. Benefits are excellent, pay is competitive and the work schedule can be flexible."
good,"Worked at home so that was fabulous. They have 125% match on 401K, sub par medical insurance, excellent supervisor, but higher management was poor. There were multiple layoffs during my employment so never felt secure. Overall was a great place to work as did not have to go out on commute every morning."
good,"very open and friendly work environment, management were fair, the hardest part of the job was remembering all the names of the medication but I truly enjoyed talking to all the members."
good,"Humana is a very great, relaxing, spontaneous, fun, comfortable place to work at. They took care of you and everything that you had concerns about. They had very nice people working for them and friendly as well."
good,Assisting Military families (active and retired) with medical and dental coverage. Meeting with families with personalized one on one interaction or going to larger venues to give presentations on what this company offered and provided for the military family. Thoroughly enjoyed working here and serving the Military veteran and his family.
good,Humana pays for Healthcare License no matter of job status. the atmosphere and culture is very comforting. Follow employees are willing to assist the new comers.
good,This overall is a great place to work.  In hind sight I wish that I had known that by agreeing to a low rate when I was initially hired on I was limiting my earning potential with the company unless I got a major promotion.  I was more or less being laterally promoted so I had reached the point where I was being largely underpaid for the skills and experience that I had.  This was one of the driving factors for me leaving.
good,This was my first call center job. I liked the job doing inbound and outbound calls.They worked with my college schedule. I was able to go to school and make money at the same time.
good,"Humana promotes a culture of health and wellbeing.  The company and its employees are deeply committed to helping its members to live well.  It is a company of great operators and problem solvers.    As with any large organization, it is sometimes difficult to get things done due to the size and structure of the organization."
good,"One the best companies to work for. Educational and management opportunities available. Work life schedule in a busy season is almost zero, usually October to December."
good,"Professional environment. Could be stressful at times. Frequent changes and at the time I was employed there were lay offs. Overall, good learning experience."
good,"The workplace culture at Humana is very relaxed yet fast paced. Because of the dress code, you can't tell who is in management and who isn't. I personally think that the dress code makes the work place relaxed."
good,Builds you and urges you to strive for greater Levels. A lot of opportunities to grow and explore weaker parts of you to development them to perfection.
good,"Way too much micromanaging, not fair opportunities to advance, quite biased on who had  opportunities and who did not.  Great pay, great benefits!  Loved working from home."
good,"It was a real honor to be part of the Pilot program for Marketing Specialist in the Island, the hiring and training process was awesome. My supervisors and all the team work was excellent."
good,you do learn everything you need in medicare and all insurance that humana sells excellent training. They make sure you understand everything before you sell
good,I can not say what a full time employee does on a day-to-day basic. i worked as a temporary person. i have no clue about the benefits are any this that have to do with Humana.
good,Humana is an excellent company to work for but if you do not pay attention you can get caught up in the politics. As long as you stay aware you will be fine.
good,Changing environment with many variables. Planning can be shored up to allow for a more stable project focus. Goals at a higher level should be more constantly applied to ensure all stakeholders align with priority tasks and deliverables.
good,"Nice employees, metrics are very easy. Expectations were almost too low at times. Management and upper management had poor communication. Great benefits."
good,Humana was a 6 month term job that worked in the HMO dept connecting clients with their chosen Physician. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was apart of a team that was helping people get the care they needed.
good,"Humana was a great place to work. The environment can be very fast paced in the  call center, however the salary and benefits are excellent. Meeting Metrics is always a challenge, however once you become acclimated to the call flow and the types of questions you are asked, it becomes much easier to meet your monthly metrics."
good,"Humana is a nice company to work for and my personal manager was great. However, I was hired on Sept. 2017 then informed about 2 months later that I would no longer have my position after Jan 2, 2018 due to a company wide reduction in force. They let go the entire group of nurses that was hired with me in Sept. and we were not even off training before being told our positions were being eliminated. I understood the company had a difficult decision, but the way they handled it was very impersonal and not much info was provided.  I was told this information on a call with multiple employees at the same time which I felt was a rude way of telling someone they have lost their position and when I asked why so many nurses were hired to begin with only to be let go 2 months later, no one could provide an answer other than a scripted line from corporate. Very shady situation, however, Humana was nice enough to release those impacted after Thanksgiving, yet continue to receive pay through the new year allowing me time to find a new position hopefully. The company has good values, but when I worked as the RN Care Manager, I got the sense the focus was about meeting a quota of calls instead of truly serving the member's needs. The benefits and salary of the position was wonderful and very nice to work from home. You do work more than 40 hrs/week in order to meet minimum requirements, however, it sounds as though that is changing and they are working toward a focus on member assistance and quality vs. quantity. I would recommend Humana, however, always have a back-up job just in case they"
good,"*health vision and 401k benefits "
good,Humana is a professional workplace very organized and the company cares about their employees by ensuring their well-being is met financially as well as their health. The company has great discounts with Perkspot and points are obtained with Go 365 when you engage in healthy activities and complete preventive health screenings.
good,Its a professional environment. I learned that change is good. Management is there for you as long you communicate. Workplace culture is simple. Come to work and do your job. The hardest part of the job is just sometimes people don't communicate well. the most enjoyable part of the job it about working well with your team.
good,A very helpful company. It helps you learn more about CMS. The manager was very helpful in giving you the information needed. Also the people there are helpful as well if you have questions.
good,"Everyday work-life at Humana you can always expect something different to do and projects to come up, essentially a sense of entertainment within your daily tasks.  Communication is very key within this company and if sought out, there will be good outcome to success.  Working together to maintain and balance the initiative to complete projects and daily tasks would be one of the biggest thoughts to keep in mind when working within Humanas IT Infrastructure."
good,"Humana was a good company to work for however, the location it was at wasn't the best to work at. Many people lacking professional behavior and not focusing on the job and the customers."
good,"Great compensation but it is not as easy as it seems. There is a lot of stress related to meeting metrics and expectations. You don't ""just call people."""
good,Working at Humana was rewarding. My fellow employees and management were great to work with. The environment was fast paced and ever changing but that is what made it a great place to work at. Everyone works together as a team. My supervisor helped to develop my skills in training and being the subject matter expert on the team.
good,"There is a culture of teamwork, people holding one another up for their strenghts rather than tearing them down for their weaknesses.  Everyone wants everyone else to succeed without feeling threatened themselves."
good,"Humana presented its employees with a safe and comfortable work environment, Administration was eager to hear and respond to the needs of the employees. Employees were offered opportunities for upward mobility within the organization."
good,"Humana has a good balance of work and personal life.  However, the company is about making money and layoffs are often, which causes the work environment to be unstable."
good,I worked both field care management and telephonic care management. Both were fast paced with definite standards to meet daily and weekly. Management was both supportive and interested in helping you meet your goals.
good,Humana specializes in championing the customer. and also takes care of their employees well being by offering different incentives and also watching out for their well being
good,"Excellent - great place to work - Highly recommend to anyone, especially RN's."
good,"When I first started, Humana was a fantastic workplace. Towards the end of my job the tediousness of their desire to capture employee health metrics and metrics from our work at home jobs began to be a little too much. I worked in an office setting for two years before going to a work at home role for two years. There were way too many ridiculous things we had to do to log our time, no matter if we got our work done or not. After the government stopped the merger with Aetna, half of my department was laid off, myself included."
good,"I feel very comfortable in my position, but I would like to find something more challenging and fulfilling. I have found it difficult to move up within Humana, but the benefits are great, and the office environment is pleasant."
good,"I did enjoy the job and worked with some very talented people. I did not feel that we were given all of the information we needed to do our jobs from our managers, there was a disconnect in managers wanting us to succeed."
good,"It's been said that people don't leave good jobs, they leave bad managers. This was the case for me, my manager lacked maturity and leadership qualities. She loved creating conflict between our department and others, I'm not really sure why."
good,Research claims and calling providers for corrected claims and medical records. We have different tools that we use for researching and providing a rationale before calling the providers.
good,"Flexible company for outside sales.  Structured.  Management is caring.  Salary is extremely low.  Benefits are just OK."
good,Humana is a great company with unique company culture.  the company seems to be growing in some areas and downsizing other areas which is probably necessary to remain financially viable.
good,Working as a health care coordinator with Humana was absolutely rewarding and productive. I was able to make an impact on the lives of so many people.

good,I absolutely loved my job while working for Humana up until the very end. The majority of the management was very friendly and personable. I was able to develop my leadership skills and felt like they took my suggestions into consideration when it came to making daily processes better. The hardest part of the job was the amount of moving around from team to team without asking if it was ok.
good,I learned to learn again in there training classes. It  very detailed and quiz the mind to see how much was retained. Great learning experience would love to do it all over again.
good,"Good place to work and good people. Respectful and honest people. Technically savvy and IT-enabled."
good,Humana was a good employer. I came in at the start of the Medicare D plans so there was a lot of confusion across the board but they were great at showing the employees their appreciation.

good,"I packaged medicine in various ways whether it be in a box, envelope,or machine. I didn't have direct contact with the customer but I was able to help customers.The management team only interacted with the employees if their was a problem.They only pitched if we were in a bind.The workplace was very diversed and you learned  how to deal with different cultures and ethic backgrounds.What I enjoyed most about the job was being able to rotate to different positions throughout the day.I also enjoyed working 4(10 hour ) days."
good,The ability to work remotely has benefited the clinical teams in many ways.  Humana provides ongoing opportunities for learning and development and support to remote staff.
good,The job was one you worked from home which I found wasnt something I enjoyed. My co workers were amazing and we had a good relationship. I respected my manager and enjoyed her feedback on my performance. I felt a little upset by the message sent about the job the time of hire and the actual expectations of the position. The benefits I found to be wonderful but limited flexibility on unscheduled PTO. My client I worked with were amazing!! That I found was the best part of the job. I loved talking with them daily.

good,"Loved my job, just needed to work closer to where I live.  Great people, good workflow, very productive time during the day.  The hardest part was the hour plus drive to get to work."
good,"If you are looking for a company that constantly challenges you and you love sales then you will thrive here! Humana has been a blessing for me but as far as additional skills and transitioning into a greater path after you have mastered your current role, they have not advanced on that level."
good,"Good place to work, lot of benefits for employees. Many different types of jobs. Focused on attendance and productivity. Good training for positions. Gym, doctor, cafeteria on site."

good,I enjoy working for Humana very much.  A strong emphasis on work-life balance and associate development is prevalent throughout the organization.  The company's evolution to a more agile work environment has been wonderful to be a part of.
good,"Really good place to work, training was provided, advancement opportunities were very good, good pay, good time off package, excellent atmosphere, would go back."

good,Coaches and coworkers are awesome to work with. I have learned how to use motivational interviewing to assist the members. The hardest part of the job is meeting your metrics. The move enjoyable part of the job is working from home.
good,"Management usually works with you. New changes in Humana and restructuring has been challenging. When you go above and beyond in your role, you are recognized and have opportunities to take on more responsibilities."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping with members and getting their problems solved. The hardest part of the job is the abuse you get from angry members.
good,"I worked remotely from home, I loved my job and clientele that I worked with. My clients made my job a passion. There was a lot of changes within the organization, but overall I enjoyed my position and mostly my clients."
good,I was brought in during their open enrollment period. We did not have a frontline leader in the beginning. When we finally got one she really care about helping us find a permanent position within the company. She had one on one mock interviews with us as well as critiqued our resume. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the systems but eventually caught on. The most enjoyable part was meeting a lot of great people
good,The culture is focused on well being and making the lives of our members better.  The managers and employess truly 'walk the walk' regarding their services and commitment to seniors in their Medicare plans

I was offered everything you would expect from a corporate company; great pay, PTO and benefits. Their benefits are mediocre for being an insurance company. It was great that they ensured I became a licensed agent and took care of teaching me the ins and out of my job. Only complaint really is how stressful the job can be at time especially during peak insurance times like annual enrollment periods. You are highly encouraged and expected to work overtime, although I cannot complain much since you are compensated for your time unless you are a salaried employee. I also am not a fan of the management they need to put more effort into their managers to be more helpful and encouraging instead of demanding."

I reviewed medical records for insurance purposes and got to travel to clinics around the state to do this. I also travelled out of state regularly for training and conferences. The travel was enjoyable to me. It breaks the monotony for sure, but at times travel could be the most difficult aspect of the job with flight layovers, airport security, long drives, etc. My co-workers were very dedicated and great at their jobs. Humana had definitely embraced a talent mindset and had matched very dynamic people with the positions they were in. Management was above-par. There was no managerial turnover and it was refreshing to see a team led in a positive direction with consistent expectations and common goals."

good,"A typical day at work would be coming to the office and having a cubical that only I used. I would come in from 9 am to 5 pm. I would take incoming calls, and talk directly with members regarding their medication, failed claims, and reorders etc. I learned a lot about insurance, general mail order procedures, and how/what to communicate to members to make them feel like, whatever company I am representing, we care, and are always willing to help. The management was a little prone to micro managing. They would listen into calls while i was talking and tell me what to say while I was trying to listen to the member. Also they were a unavailable more then a handful of times. However, my co workers were always ready and available to help. The hardest part of the job I would have to say was learning how to communicate properly with members. Knowing how to be to the point without giving information that, as a pharmacy technician, I would be unable to give. The most enjoyable part of the job was the location (close to home) and the feeling of being able to help people."

good,Humana was an fun place to work. The managment was awesome and caring. I would recommend Humana to anyone that is interested in doing customer service.
good,"The leadership is competent and the supervisors are supportive of the Case Managers. The LTC plan truly commits to providing quality care to its enrollees. I feel that I am appreciated on this team. Sure, there are frustrating days or aspects of the job, but it's the nature of the beast and we can work through it. However, the corporate offices have recently instituted a very harsh mileage reimbursement policy. In addition the health coverage is poor."
good,"This company's culture and mission is aligned for success.  An employee will have the opportunity to grow with the guidance of senior leadership.  Depending on the role, the day to day responsibilities and activities will vary based on need and skillset required.

An employee will be able to leverage many different ideas to identify a strong strategy in order to accomplish any project or task successfully."
good,"In a typical day at work i had to deal with callers of varying backgrounds. Some callers are extremely pleasant while others may be disgruntled, which should be expected in any work environment. Managers and fellow co-workers are quite helpful and for the most part the work environment is like an extended family. Managers try to motivate employees as much as possible through awards for outstanding performance, attendance, work ethics etc. The hardest part of the job is knowing that not all customers will be pleased at the end of a call, but knowing that I had given it my best aids in comforting me as I love to hear reviews of happy customers."

The work place culture is great, they try to keep you moving and having fun.  The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on through your calls when a lot of callers are either angry, crying, or talking about how they can't afford to eat because of how low their Social Security check is and they have to spend hundreds of dollars on their health care."
good,"I was a contract employee and worked from home had a total of 4 patients."
good,"great environment to work. professional, helpful environment. tools and training are available if needed. also managers assist in any obstacles you may come across."

good,Low stress job with great leaders. Loved working from home and felt close to colleagues even though never met them. Great benefits. Very flexible schedule in my position.
good,"Management is very flat in structure, the team leader is more a facilitator than a supervisor. We all had our projects to work on, and assisted each other. We gave updates once a week to the manager as a team. Open doors policy has a new meaning here. I could instant message anybody in the company no matter the position or department."
good,"Great company with lots of potential to enhance your skills and talents."
good,Humana is a great place to work because of the culture that was created. The people whom I worked with made the job much better. The management was very understanding. The hardest part of the job was the tedious work but the most enjoyable part was being able to see your complete work.
good,"Pros"
good,"I had an awesome 15 year career at Humana.  I learned so much.  I got my foot in the door as a customer service representative for medical claims. I moved into grievance and appeals as a specialist and then a front line leader.  From there I moved into process development, training.  Unfortunately due to a reduction in workforce, I lost my job.  I wold recommend Humana as a place to work as the benefits are excellent and focus on employee development and advancement is high if interested in moving forward in your career."
good,"Humana Insurance Company is a competitive place of employment, providing employees with benefits that start on the first day of employment, medical, dental, vision and 401K with company matching.  Humana urges employees to be healthy by giving them money back in their paycheck if they meet the requirements given in their healthy employee program."
good,"Overall Humana is a great place to work.  There are some departments which are less so.  If you are a Clinician, this is the place you want to be.  Some areas are competitive with each other rather than cooperative."
good,"Humana is a good company to work for.  The biggest negative that I would have to say is that for an insurance company, the benefits could have improved immensely.  I didn't use the insurance through Humana because it wasn't great."
good,I worked full-time for Humana for just over 3 years. I loved my job but wanted to work part-time instead of full-time and there were no part-time positions available. I loved my team and my manager and still keep in touch with them.

good,"Great place too work.  Salary is good, although I work per diem, I get 401K 100% matchup. Time and a half for mother's day.  If you do not like your assignment, if the dynamics is not there.  Coordinators will change this. Great!"

We also had a M-F work week, PTO, paid holidays and regular events outside of the workplace."

Discussed wins & losses. I always learned much when these meetings were transparent. I loved my co-workers, they became family to me. I was challenged by the effects of health care reform and the Affordable Care Act had on Humana as a company. The massive regulatory changes due to ACA directly influenced Humana's bottom line so that ""trickle-down-effect"" lowered morale & brought a sense of fear into the ranks. I was happiest when I landed a BIG case, where I was able to save my client significant money & helped him to better provide more modern, age-appropriate health care for his aging employees and retirees."

My manager definitely knows how to maximize my skill set and create an environment where i enjoy what i do while showing that i am an asset to the company.

I'm happy to report that our management is very supportive and fair, they are they to guide us and help us achieve our goals. Workplace culture is great, the environment is peaceful at times, and teams are their to lend a hand. The hardest part of my role is to be able to get to everyone and solve every issue, sometimes the members don't want hear bad news, but its our duty to provide help as honest as possible.

I would start out making calls, for the better part of the mourning, either cold calling, or followup and then in the afternoon, I would go out to close business.  The evening I would make notes, and do follow up that to prospect that I couldn't reach earlier in the day."
good,As in any Major Corporation there are continuous changes. As soon as you get use to a procedure or method they decide to try something else. The only problem I see is sometimes when enough time isn't allowed for change is that there seems to be a lot of confusion and aggravation among employees. Other than that there is a good workplace culture and Management does seem to be there for you to help as allowed.
good,I really enjoyed my job at Humana at Home. I had the perfect manager for me to be at my best. The department I worked in was always undergoing changes and this is the 3rd downsizing in less than 2 years so job security is not very high in this role.

It can be monotonous to do the same thing repetitively. Coworkers are all very friendly, and leaders are very understanding. They also care about you as a person, not just as an employee. The attendance policy is very strict, and they set high expectations in order to provide perfect service to their members. There are also a lot of incentives to be healthy and to set a better example for your community."

Networking with co-workers from various departments throughout the Organization was always enlightening."
good,"When I went to work for Humana, I wasn't sure I would like it. Working for such a big company seemed like it would be intimidating, and I didn't want to feel like just another employee. The management and upper management at Humana never made me feel like just another cubicle employee. I felt like I was part of a team, and that my success truly was up to me."

good,Honest company to work for. My co-workers are great. Normally I come in help a few people with their calls. Sometimes handle the escalated calls. Then I get on the computer and get the reports done and mainly just check on our agents and stand by in case they need help. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure our agents are well informed to go above and beyond our companys expectations.
good,management and personnel well trained. all willing to help
good,Humana is a good company to work for. I would stay with the company if I didn't need to relocate to the Cincinnati area.
good,"When I worked there, business was always booming. Every day was busy, busy, busy which I enjoyed. I learned a lot about health insurance and about business in general. We had a good team. Benefits were great but raises were poor. I went home after my son was born because I didn't want to put him in daycare."
good,The adminstration was really nice and caring. I hated when Humana was purchased by Presbyterian Hospital even though I made more money.

good,Working for Humana felt like home and management always made me feel as part of a family. I assisted members as a bilingual crossed train with their insurance needs. I learned all the trades to the job as best possible and after working from home for 8 months I became a call center supervisor and was able to pass on my knowledge to my team as a whole and individually. Everyday came with it's challenges mainly members complaints however the member needs always came first and their needs were met on a day by day basis. I loved helping people and ensuring their happiness overall.
good,"great review"

good,It was a good fun place to work. Good managers and coworker. The company overall does provide assistance to assure success in the work place. I would recommend Humana overall.
good,"Humana is a very funa nd lively place to work. Around peak season it can be very difficult to find a permanent position as things tend to get very competitive. In turn, they do have a large variety of positions posted that they are looking to fill. Food options are available in some of the buildings which is great. People are warm and nice in passing. The work setting is overall very relaxed. My management was very open and friendly"
good,"I referred several friends and family members to work at Humana as a personal health coach. However, after the failure of the merger between Humana and Aetna the position was slowly downsized until it was completely eliminated this year. The job was great when we were able to work on health education and goal setting with members. I was able to help countless people quit smoking, gain access to their providers and resolve insurance questions for the members. However it became stressful with more and more pressure to have high volumes of calls, with less time and less health coaching opportunities. The hardest part of the job was feeling like the quality of the calls did not matter any more compared to the quantity. The company was great to work for though as a whole, it was just the slow elimination of the position and scramble to try to resolve the issues. My manager was amazing and the benefits were great. I would work for Humana in the future if they would bring back the personal health coach role and allow quality time to help members create positive lifestyle changes."
good,Great place to work. Very flexible hours. Decent compensation. The entire sales team were friendly people. Great support for new comers from staff. Learned a lot about Medicare including parts A-D.
good,I had an awesome experience as a limited term for Humana. Advancement is very competetive. Many employees applying and interviewing for the same positions. Discouraged me.
good,"working at humana was nice, chill job for just taking phone calls if you want to grow in the company then you will you just need to push for it. you can deferentially go far if you want it"
good,This company allowed me to provider referrals and health education to the special needs population. The contact was via phone. Great interdisciplinary communication with case managers.
good,Typical day would start with phone calls from clients with questions that needed answered.  I would try to answer or get the answer for member.  Some times it would be that they needed assistance with different things and would have to solve the issue.  I learned how to manage the members needs as needed.  Management was great to assist if needed.  The hardest part of this job was the constant changes that were being made that you had to learn and change in you thinking.  I really liked working with the members and seeing that their needs were met as soon as possible and the appreciation of the members once it was all met.
good,"Call center environment, fast paced but staying connected through group chat made the work day much easier. What I learned was how to handle irate customers in a calm and confident manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a connection with the customer and being able to address their needs and offer various helpful services."

It starts out by answering emails, checking my To-do list to prioritize items and start with my daily duties that include: budget management, interacting with our advertising agency and in-house creative developer to review the art work in process, presenting it internally and making sure they're approved by our Compliance department before launching.  Our Corporate headquarters are a great help whenever needed, as some of the things we work on are similar; talking with them on a weekly basis is the norm.  Sometimes approval or system procedures can take up more time than necessary, but it's all part of the process.  The people in the company are always willing to help and in my department we always have a small break during the day to relieve stress and keep on with work.  Meetings with high level executives are also productive as they let your participate and value your opinion.  "
good,counseling preparing prescriptions and dealing with practitioners
good,"I don’t think any job is a perfect 5. There are things at every job that will challenge your thinking, and some that may make you feel not secure at times. This is corporate America and it’s about business and outcomes. If you’d like to get away from the physical part of nursing , insurance nursing is super challenging and can be rewarding.   I have been in different departments and have enjoyed both positions as a registered nurse. No job is perfect, however I have good leaders and mentors and I take advantage of the benefits , including wellness , that Humana offers. I have not worked for a company that cares more about wellness and rewards you . But you have to work for the rewards (it’s not hard)"
good,I loved working here! I was able to do what I love every day (pharmacy) and sit in my own space. I worked mail order call center so as long as you know your stuff its pretty easy work!

Cared for vent patients, pre and post op, wound care IV therapy, blood draws. Carried charge responsibilities of staff. Practitioners were interested in teaching be it through observation or assisting them  with procedures. Able to assess and determine needs and care of patients outside of the school atmosphere, also had nursing students throughout the year. Created and followed patient care plans."

Depending on you supervisor, depends on the style of management. I loved my supervisor.  My co-workers were fun to be around and made the days go quickly. Hardest part of the job is working long hours. When I started we would work twelve hour days."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking with wonderful people. I learned alot about Medicare Part D and what it has to offer. The management is horrible and unprofessional. My co-workers were great and I really enjoyed them. The hardest part of the job was calming down the irate and mixed emotion customers.I really enjoyed working to discover the ""Humanitarism"" idea to represent all of what Humana had to offer."

good,"Company is currently being purchased by Aetna - so there are a lot of questions about how the foundation (the culture) is going to change. A typical day at work involves reconciling $13M in IT Projects with steering committee documentation. I've learned to be flexible and innovative. The management team is fair, balanced and dedicated. My co-workers are my greatest asset. The most difficult part of the job is balancing the differing interpretations of IT Project reporting standards among project managers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with managers to get different perspectives on how we can create new, or more efficient business practices in the tracking and management of a budget of this size."
good,"warm & cold calling "

good,job description included driving wherever needed. reporting daily documentation with patients. data entry and paper documentation. patients varied in cities in Virginia.
good,"This was by far my favorite job which is why I kept it for so long. I loved my coworkers and the company! The company was involved in the community and did several different things to stay involved. They allow you to take 8 hours off of work a year to volunteer at the place of your choice. You can either go with you coworkers or by yourself. It was a fast paced work environment since I took inbound calls for Subrogation and then Special Investigations, however it was worth it. There were only two things I really didn't like and that was not being able to advance and the benefits. The health benefits weren't the greatest but at least I had them. All and all I would recommend this job to anyone who enjoys taking inbound calls and working hard to get the job done because it doesnt just stop when that call ends."
good,"Humana truly cares about their employees and is very supportive, having well trained management in place for support for their care managers. The Care Manager position is awesome!

good,"I worked as a Contract R.N, and had a specific territory to see patients that were chronically ill, or had been discharged home from the hospital.  I was able to set my own hours, and to work within a certain territory.  Good support from the Manager that I did the contract work for."
good,Jag är en glad  ambitiös utåtriktad och fixiebike.
good,As a medical coder I was to audit provider records for medicare patient insured by Humana to make sure the records were coded to the highest level of specificity. The more complex the diagnosis the more money Humana got.
good,"All in all , Humana was a great place to work. During open enrollment it is the busiest because everyone is trying to get enrolled before its to late. You do have members who call in with attitudes but I realized it's mainly because their elderly and just want to make sure they get their prescriptions on time, not taking for granted, making sure they have the funds to take care of their premiums and copay (if they have any) . You just have to keep your cool because it's not their fault majority of the time. Sometimes its other co-workers that don't get the job fully resolved the first time, their MD who don't send in the prescription on time and if they do, it sometimes written wrong, and other times the members because they feel as though we should be taking care of it before they even have the time to call. Also, it could be the automotive system because it's not clear ( we all know how the automotive system can get on our nerves). "
good,Work place culture is diverse. Lot of opportunity for growth and experience. Development cultivation is encouraged. Very good environment to group and work in.
good,This place takes care of their employees. Even though Humana has the state of the art facility it was about the employee and leaders over you that made it an exceptional place to work at.
good,"Sharp group of professionals on a PHM mission. It's a large company so there are challenges that will, of course, arise from that but it's full of good people doing good work."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was visiting the members."

good,"great environment, during open enrollment is stressful but after that is bad unless you get moved to a lower tier because of lack of sales and hard to get out of it but great bosses and leadership "
good,"Wonderful place to work if you're in love with the idea of customer service. Teams are great, sometimes the work took it's toll, but there managers and other staff were always there to help you bounce back!"
good,Humana was a great job love the company wish i could go back! I loved working with the managers and other employees. I would recommend this job to everyone its an amazing experience.

good,"If you can manage a fast-paced call center environment, with occasional lulls in the action, Humana has the opportunity to pay extremely well. That being said, it can be very stressful and competitive to stay for your spot if you're coming in as a temp/seasonal hire"

good,"I am paid per person, per month. I was hired through an agency, was not paid for training, which took 3 weeks and had no case load ready for me and had to start from zero.  The wouldn't give me more than five at first.  The other problem was that Humana doesn't have the client base here in Cincinnati to support a Care Manager.  I am the third or fourth Care Manager in this position in the last year."

I was always the first person to arrive at work and the last to leave for my shift. I caught on the the job extremely fast, which I was told was rare because of the complicated systems used for the job of insurance contract loading for providers. I was advancing nicely, getting chosen to take on new tasks other were not. I really enjoyed the job as a whole. The research, the data entry, the finishing of each task, it always left me feeling very accomplished at the end of the day. Unfortunately, my life took a drastic change, and I was forced to move and leave my job at this company. I had never done that before in my life with a job, and it was not easy.

I was very dedicated to my role and a top performer for the organization.  Humana is noted for their RIFs and had been warned early on that they do that and left before that occurred."
good,"This is my first year working for Humana. the experience is great, even though the position was only contract/ temporary. I'm still grateful for the opportunity that was given to me."
good,Humana was a hard-working environment but it was worth the work the customers were awesome and the team leads did their best to keep us motivated I learned many skills and worked a lot of overtime during peak hours
good,A typical day would be resolving a problem for a customer account.  I learned that you may need to listen and try to anticipate what the customer  may need.  Best part of the job is the satisfaction you get knowing they are happy at the end of your call with the service you provided.  The hardest part of the job is not always having an answer to every question but trying to resolve it.
good,Humana was a delightful company to work for with a focus on wellness. The compensation was a little low but the culture created a stress-free environment.
good,I really don't have a lot to say the LI Net Department part D temp plan was awesome however posting out to grievance and appeals with a new manager and new lead A lot change and the rate the Company was going at the time It was very overwhelming
good,"My job with Humana requires me to travel extensively, sometimes 2 hrs to arrive at my clients homes.  The interaction with my clients has been most rewarding.  The management I have had has been very supportive in my role as a Care Manager.  The hardest part of the job for me is the travel.    Once I am home I spend anywhere from 2-4 hours documenting on my clients.  My job is a 24/7 type of job with clients calling anytime day or night with questions."
good,This is a company that gives a lot and requires a lot.  Very good culture and the ability to help others improve their lives is the strongest motivation in the company.
good,it was a great opportunity with excellent benefits. everyone worked together to help each other as well as help the company succeed. I would love to return.
good,"During my time there, the turnover rate was ridiculous. many people coming and going on all levels. The staff was great but each department was isolated from the others and almost never encouraged to interact."
good,An early 4:00 am start being around all types of metal we are needed  to keep in mind of the temp. Going around stations to assist everyone by priority. Learning the trade of the different types of heats to wire it takes for different metals. A large press was part of the functioning of engineering were i would help hold various parts for the press to take action. At times i would load and unload deliveries truck that come in. Cleaning various degrees of metals through out the day.
good,"Ok company to work for, great co workers,easy training took about 4 weeks to learn everything job related. Nice environment to work in nice day to day activity."
good,this is a great company for compensation and benefits. unfortunately it just wasn't the job for me at this specific moment in m
good,"Great place to work and offered great employee benefits as well as group/clients plans.  Unfortunately, the department I worked in was eliminated."
good,"make inbound or outbound calls depending the project to generated new customers or upgrade existing customers. I learned a new interesting career . The management wasn't to much organized , co-workers really excellent , the hardest part it's the daily clueless if I will stay or not , because the hired me temp and don't have any answers yet , I enjoy the most take care old people over the phone and connect them to a route that provides the best results for them ."
good,"Humana has excellent benefits and compensation. As an employee you will receive great support from the very beginning. Humana reviews and rewards based on performance. If you plan to work there, plan to do your best."
good,I had fun meeting lots of different people this place was all about getting to know your peers.
good,It is a great place to work. Great benefits and time off for family is good. It just don't really have room for advancement to much.
good,"Sammanfattning är fantastiskt, bra firma ok lön o alltid bra arbetstider. Oftast inte natt, där jag var, men alltid chans till extra timmar."
good,"Unfortunately, management within Humana is often biased and clique oriented, lots or politics and favoritism. I loved working for Humana and was a proud employee but my experience with management was less than desirable."
good,We need health benefits.   I love the freedom to choose when I work.    All the staff are amazingly kind.      Very professional group of people at Humana!
good,"The job consisted of multiple duties, which included, review of medical records per guidelines to meet inpatient criteria, or refer to medical director if inpatient admission did not meet inpatient criteria, discharge planning, skill nursing facility, specialty hospital for rehab care. Workplace culture was all about going the extra mile to provide solutions to problems and to extend  customer service. Clinical teams were helpful in covering for each other and providing a helping hand with workload. The company cared about balancing work and family time. Hardest part of the job were clinical cases fell late in the day and not enough time to complete cases."
good,"I really loved working here I just took time off to spend time with my kids and be a great mother/wife. Great benefits, great hours and loved that I had my weekends off ."
good,"At first I loved working at Humana. But then upper management started getting greedy. They started firing ppl who weren’t the best but were good, just to get newer ppl to make them money. They have no heart because they fire ppl left to right with no reason. People have children to clothe and feed, pay rent, mortgages, car notes, insurance, etc.. But they don’t care or ever come to realize that."
good,"Humana has a lot of great opportunity , They give you a lot of hours. You can really grow in the company . its a very friendly workplace. and they have food trucks on fridAY"
good,"I love all Humana has to offer. Great Management , Diversity,  during your time thier you have the pleasure of meeting lots of new faces that can. Potential grow your career."
good,"Very busy, lots of deadlines and expectations and many changes on frequent basis. On the upside , they are supportive and really want you to be the best you can be"
good,Was a sales organization... as time went on quotas became tighter every year... they would freeze out an individual by giving them less qualified lead and calls then penalize them when the failed
good,Hours are good and stable and rarely work on weekends. Expectations for each job were clearly set and evaluations based on these. Could work from home in some departments.
good,"Fast paced organization but also collaborative environment"
good,It was nice while the position lasted. I enjoyed serving the clients and learning alongside of them. The benefits were great as well as the incentives to stay healthy. Great place to work and met a lot of nice people that I still associate with today.
good,Humana really cares for its employees. Humana provides tuition reimbursement and has a program that helps trhose employees thaT HAVE HAD A DISASTER. wOULD WORK FOR hUMANA AGAIN
good,"I enjoyed the environment Humana provided.  It was a challenge getting employee benefits updated and opportunity for career growth was slow. However, there was opportunity to take online and education reimbursement."
good,"My typical work day would begin by organizing my visits for that day. Each week I saw the same members (patients). I would review each chart and check to see if I needed to take any educational material with me to the visit. I would also check to see if I was working on a resource for that member, then I would call the resource for an update. Then if needed, I would call my member's that needed a reminder call that I was coming and I would leave for the day. My average visits for each day would be between 6-8. My patient load was approx. 40. Some of my members were biweekly, so I would only see them every other week. My wage was salary, and I almost never worked a 40 hour week. My pay was very good, but my average work hours were between 50-55 hours per week. Plus all the driving I did. We did get travel reimbursement at the government rate which was nice. I couldn't ask for a better supervisor, everyone on my team was great. I was actually hired by Humana, and an employee of Humana. I understand that many of the FCM's now are hired by a sub contracted company, and the benefits are not as nice. If not for moving away, I would still be there. The only downfall is there was no moving up. I tried to move up, and was overlooked several times. This was frustrating, and I really do not know the reason, I was an excellent employee with an excellent work history."
good,Fast pace work place. Steady work load. Mandatory Overtime. Would highly recommend to those looking for a change of career. Excellent management team as well as good training courses upon starting positions with the company.
good,"Humana is a very generous company who has been very good to me.  However, the last year has been very stressful due to pending lay offs.  Humana was fairly transparent during that time and most of us had an idea that we might be laid off soon.  They have been very generous in the separation process and have given us very good severance packages and resources.  "
good,"it is ok to work there I have nothing else to say regarding Humana at all. I work ech day from 6-230, and go home afterward. I leave work at work, when i walk in my home."
good,I did alot of training before going to work with Humana learning the claims and adjustments. I would take calls about peoples insurance and try and help them get the question answered.
good,The company is very much committed to employee engagement. There are opportunities if you are qualified. It does seem most jobs require a college degree.
good,Very clean working enviroment and very health conscious. The most enjoyable part of the job was my peers and the ability to be very productive with on daily basis.
good,"Humana is a great place to work for, They have wonderful staff and great facilitators to teach you what you need to know about your job. Humana is really wonderful"
good,"My overall review of Humana is good.  My typical day is developing data capture processes, analytics, providing insights with process improvements for both operations and IT.  Additionally, I develop and maintain dashboards which are used to look at historical data and trends for multiple lines of business and work streams which are used by all levels of leadership.  Personally, I love the challenge of the constantly changing processes and environment.  The most difficult part of the job isn't the job itself, it's the unknown of when we get pay increases or if we will.  The part enjoy the most is the all of the work I do directly impacts our members from all facets.  Our sales agents, customers, internal associates, and leadership."
good,"Leadership is not welcoming to change, afraid of backlash, and is lazy. The company itself is fantastic. Humanas values are ideal and the benefits are great."
good,"Typical Day-Preparing, submitting, reviewing, and approving entries, creating recons, and answering audit and close questions"
good,"very good culture of the company,nice place to work.very helpful and supportive team.nice work environment.nice place to work and very well designed project plan,"
good,"A typical day at Humana Insurnace company is really like learning somethng new every day.  Its also gives you the opportunity to meet the members face to face and watch the expressions of anger and sadness turn to excitement. Management at Humana are fair but can sometimes be right to the point which can make them standoffish but they are just trying to get the job done the best they can.   The hardest part of the job is not knowing what happens to the member once that call ends .   "
good,"At Humana I learned a lot about different medications, various insurance programs. Loved interacting with the members nationwide.  Good work ethics.  Great benefits."
good,"Un ambiente en general agradable, un trabajo muy movido y con muchas tareas diarias a desenvolver, lo que hace que la jornada pase más deprisa."
good,"On the phones talking to customers all day. Enrolling them in Medical benefits. Hardest part was making sure each customer was in correct medical insurance plan. "
good,overall a good job great location. renovated now. I would work there again
good,"Transport patients to and from radiology, and from admit and discharge."
good,"I was very excited when I got the chance to work for Humana. I left the position I was at with another company to move over. I had an awesome time working with other up-beat co-workers, and wonderful management. I worked in the Security Administration department, processing requests to add security for users. Even though we did the same thing daily, I was still happy about going into work every day."
good,The job was easy to the point of being mind numbing.  I was basically a drain on their economy for the most part because they refused to think outside the box on how to get the job done.
good,"Enjoyed talking to different people, helping out when & how I could."
good,"A typical workday included handling numerious correspondence mail from customers,working reports for superviosrs,attending meetings with upper management, and assisting the office area with any technical issues."
good,Learned how to sell medicare insurance to those in need. Training and updated information was always accessible. Loved working with the medicare patients and helping them with their needs.
good,"The Tucson office was managed by supervisors who worked and lived in the Phoenix area. No two day were ever the same. The sales manager in the office was very easy to get along with. Very busy environment working for 11 reps and 1 sales manager. Co-workers in the office were from other departments but I enjoyed working with them. Helping the seniors who came into the office was very enjoyable as insurance is difficult to understand. Hardest part of the job was hauling, pushing and pulling 200+ lbs. of boxes of sales materials across the street to either recycle them (because they were outdated) or storing them in the storage area in a basement in another building."
good,"I was proud to say I worked for Humana. In my experience there, I met so many different people and the organization does wonderful things for their employees and their members. They're always thinking up new ways to help local communities."
good,Work in a production setting processing medical claims meeting CMS guidelines and requirements of Medicare regulated claims and superior customer service
good,"Good Job.                                                                          "
good,"Humana just isn't enough pay within my checks for me and I'm just needing something with better hours. The hours that they have is just not working out for me anymore eventhough, I love my job at Humana and what I have to do everyday."
good,"Great place to work however the yearly layoffs picked at random make all feel nervous for what is to come yearly "
good,This job is something different the process was easy but they are very unprofessional and contracts their don’t last To long. If your looking for a quick job I will recommend.
good,Overall good company. Humana really invest a lot in training employees! Very diverse culture. Humana hires quality people. Very safe environment.  Great morale.
good,I really enjoyed my team and the environment. I was able to actually learn how to come out of my fear of selling via phone and just basically have a conversation with people.
good,"I can say working for one of the insruacne carrier, you understand how the provider charge for services and why member feel that they insurance should cover more"
good,"Humana is a good place that promotes"
good,Health Care Manager-I enjoyed my position very much.  I was able to work from home and I had a team and manager that I thought was very helpful.  I was in the best shape physically that I have ever been!  Great Wellness program.  The attempted merger with Aetna and the end of the Obama care mandate saw a lot of front-facing staff terminated.  It made me sad; I really enjoyed my time.
good,It's a relax environment slow pace rules are constantly changing. Turn over rate is high. There's a lot of favoritism. They always approve a Day off request.
good,"this is a good company to work for, however if you are one that would like to have a life out side of work this may not be the  job for you as it does require you to work a lot of hours and thus a lot of time away from family and friends."
good,"Very open and accepting to different backgrounds and cultures, ensuring that we’re cultivating endearing relationships with its employees and Medicare/Medicade members"
good,"I had to travel alot, Lakeland, Tampa and Pinellas County,"
good,"Good Place to work! although it was a contract, i did learn a lot form my team. It was my first job as a DBA and i would say my team was very helpful."
good,Working at Humana is a learning experience every day.  Encourage learning and career development.  Provides educational resources. Management promotes learning and goal achievement. Meeting daily Member outreach is the most difficult part of the job.  Maintaining team connectivity is fun and necessary to maintain team work and support.
good,This is a contract position that allows you to work from home providing case management to individuals with chronic health problems.  I enjoy the work. You will work from your home office and work in the community visiting members in their homes.
good,"Humana is a great company to work with for professionals who want to work part time or work from home. If you are self-motivated and enjoy making your own schedule, Humana allows for diverse workers to deliver Humana services to the Member's home."
good,"I was a limited term employee, However I was impressed by the amount of training they put into each job. Humana does its best to see everyone succeed."
good,humana was a wonderful experience. familt oriented enviornment. high call volume. i learned medical billing and coding. also medicare and medicaid. third party billing
good,Great place to work at but the workflow is horrible most of the time. But other than that I would say its the one of the best company I work for. Its a company I recommend for people who want to advance their career in the company and spend more time with their family.
good,"I learned a lot working for Humana has been ups and downs,Management shows favoritism and if you loose your position they will help you look for employment"
good,"Entailed reviewing invoices, entering in iProcurement to obtain a po number so invoice could be processed, entered check requests to pay for false alarm and alarm permit fees across the United States, any other items deemed by management."
good,"Call flow is fair, cool management. There's a lot of opportunity for growth. Humana is a overall a good company enjoyed my work time there would recommend any experienced customer service representative."
good,Love working from home. Great company overall. Difficult to advance. Humana is great to their employees. I feel like they really care and thrive on work life balance.
good,"Excellent health insurance, management is absent for support.  They expect you to reach certain sales goals although you receive transfers from customer service and they should have stayed in customer service."
good,"Humana was a great place to learn and become a good Health Agent.  They provide training that allows you to understand the products and benefits.  You must be good at self study as well; this is a big part of the Humana training platform.  Overall, it was a great experience."
good,"Working for Humana was a great learning experience I've gained so much knowledge about the health care system, We were also giving incentives and bonuses for handle calls well and mainly making sure our customers were happy at the end of each call"
good,"Assisting patient’s bathing, feeding, dressing, toileting, and transfer assistance"
good,"Worked there for nearly 6 years, don't have much negative things to say about my experience. The management changed over the past year which led to a drastic shift in the culture within the Call Center."
good,"We sit at our desk and work members cases, depending on the reason their medication is denying we than deicide how to proceed. Th hardest part of my job is not being able to approve medication for memebers who are in need and their life depends on it"
good,Co-workers were great.  Management was good. Learned all about health care plans processing. Processed small and large group documentation. Put proposals together based on health plan.
good,Humana is a great organization! A wonderful company to work for whether it is temporary or long term.You have the ability to move up and around within the organization. Wonderful opportunities to network.
good,"This job requires a lot of discipline and motivation. It requires getting involved with the community, be an educator, a good listener, provide solutions according to their health needs."
good,"Pay and Benefits are great! Corporate management is great and"
good,Worked from my home office and electronically submitted applications to Humana at days end. Typically I worked 12 hour days during the AEP/OEP option dates and provided customer care and service during the rest of the year.
good,"Great place to work. They seem like they really care for their employees. However, they do not really care about their limited term employees"
good,Great company but i found moving up and out into any management positions was not obtainable.
good,"Triage, pt., history, blood draw, rooming patients, specimen collection, chart prep.  How to speak Spanish. I was mostly taught by the patients.  The management is truly excellent.  My co-workers were enjoyable and a pleasure to work with.  When we had to send someone to the hospital and especially when we lost one. :-(  Not a good feeling.  I enjoyed working for Humana.  I was placed as a temp by All Med Personnel.  I enjoyed my co-works, the providers, management and especially looked forward to seeing our patients.  Working in a clinic setting is so rewarding.  You have a great opportunity of seeing the same people.  When my assignment ended, my patients gave me gifts of thanks and were truly sad to see my assignment come to an end.  I like wise was sad the assignment ended."
good,"Humana is a great company. A typical day of work is varied, from board meetings, to travel, to data entry, to strategic planning. "
good,"Good place to work, the company is up to date in technology. I have learned new software applications and learned about the industry."

good,"Good company to work for if you enjoy working with the Military population. The Managers are very supportive too.   "

good,"Great place to work! The office employees, nurses, and schedulers were friendly and nice to work with. Patients were sweet to work with on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the patients every day and seeing them smile."
good,"Having worked as a Broker, you have to be a self-starter to acquire your own leads and not depend on Humana to provide them for you. Money is good because the commission rates are determined by Medicare, not the insurance carrier. If you're a hustler and I mean, actively seeking new business you'll make a lot of money with the new business commissions and renewals."
good,"The place is amazing to work for. They will help you advance your career and have onsite programs to help you earn certifications to help with your career. "
good,Friendly place to work. Always able to make more money. Room for advancement. Only stress is chasing down behind clients in order to keep appointments with you.
good,"I have had my share of ups and downs at Humana, but overall I really enjoyed my time there.  "
good,Humana is undergoing significant reorganization due to industry headwinds in Medicare Advantage revenue shifts and new tax laws. Likely a $1billion hit in 2020. Company is hunkering down to try to weather the storm.
good,Humana was a great place to work all around. Associates were knowledgeable and friendly. Great place to learn with 0-5 years experience. Opportunity for advancement was somewhat limited but available.
good,Loved it there. Just a far drive from Fort Worth for me. So couldn't stay. Other than that the people were great. Company is good to their employees..
good,I absolutely love Humana. I made the biggest mistake of my life when I quit. I wish they would give persons another chance to work there. I am so sad I quit.
good,"Loved my time working at Humana. They treat their employees with such respect, and welcomes you with open arms.  They have an incredible record of giving job opportunities to those who might not elsewhere receive that opportunity. Every employee, at every level top to bottom, are willing and eager to help others."
good,Still needs more direction and communication regarding healthcare changes effecting the enterprise. More corporate events to provide employees a sense of direction and sense of “home”.
good,Is a really good place to work if you get under a good management team. I worked in several different departments while working there I was a VSP (Verbal Staffing Pool). Agent investigating unit was my most favorite department that I worked in
good,"A competitive environment where it may too focused and driven on numbers verses the consumer experience. Each employee should be given opportunity to make money, where at this particular job they stay focused on keeping the money with in certain individuals that are known for their production."
good,Great place to work if you are tired of the clinical setting and enjoy weekends and holidays off. There isn’t a lot of growth opportunities after receiving higher learning degrees.
good,Good place to work with lots of opportunities. Opportunity for advancement within the organization and they have plenty of flexibility with work life balance
good,"Comfortable envirmont, enjoyable co workers, challenging, loved phone contact with clients, convient location,at times very stressfull,"
good,"Humana is a great company to work for in that the culture initiatives, benefits, and overall atmosphere is second to none.  The most enjoyable part of my job is to collaborate with others to continuously improve our business outcomes."

good,Productive and fun place to work at. Received all the necessary tools to excel and produce as expected.Company provided unexpected free healthy lunches. Rewarded employees to free movies and many many other great perks.
good,"I work as Indep. Contractor very part-time around a full-time job so hard to always connect with the manager so most done by email. "
good,"HMHS was a great division to work for. The environment was peaceful, at your pace and not stressful. The people were inviting and friendly.Mgmt was pretty good as well."
good,"Too many changes due to management,  but overall you are well compensated. You get to have incentive depending on your tenure.  I had a great team coach who will boost your capability."
good,"busy answering phones and doing medicare enrollment"
good,Humana is a great place to work and offers opportunities to promote employee heath and wellness. Your time there is what you make it...become involved
good,The 16 years I worked there were some of the better years of my career. Good opportunity to utilize both my creative and my analytical skills. Would recommend this sector of Humana to anyone.
good,Humana has a great work environment for promoting a healthy lifestyle.  By offering a lot of workout programs and avenues to have a healthy lifestyle.
good,"My day start with a high volume of  incoming calls from members checking on benefits, copays, premiums, payment status, and denied claims. I learn ever day that the call is not personal."
good,Been there about a decade and love the corporate environment.  The hours are flexible and the group I was with was very family originated that allowed parents to keep their career and focus on family.
good,"Humana was a great company to work with.  Employees will gain lots of experience in the call center/ medical type setting. Benefits package, and Growth within the company is also a bonus."
good,"It was a good company to work for, and very flexible letting us work from home.  The management was very understanding and always available.  Good company to work for, I enjoyed working at Humana."
good,For inside sales it's one of the easiest sales roles I've ever had and it paid more than most similar roles. The earning potential is there if you're willing to work hard and make it through the busy season. If you get trained to cross sell then you can make very good money working 4 days a week there. The Sups are great but upper management seems to forget this is a sales department all the time and want all sorts of things that doesn't necessarily have to make sense. There's always changes and there's no consistency or security in what you're doing . If you're not good at what you do and adaptable then it could become miserable.
good,"While working with Humana Pharmacy, I enjoyed my time there even though I had to leave when my temp time was over because I was project based. Some customers where elderly which made them more frustrated at times; although, with patience and good listening skills I proceeded to assist with whatever they needed help with while having a positive attitude."
good,"I enjoy assisting wit medicare supplement plans. I am a self-starter and able to succeed with minimal supervision or direct managerial oversight. "
good,I worked from home for Humana as a RN.  I had anonymity but worked very closely with my coach.  We had a small team of people that we worked closely with via Skype.  My coach did micromanage but that was part of Humana's standard. I enjoyed talking to Humana members and educating them on their disease processes.
good,I had a great manager. I loved the work environment. Humana not only offer discount but also encourages employees to have a healther life style. Humana is a fast past environment but they also take to time to train their employees.
good,"This was by far one of the best places I have ever worked. They were always helping to make people better, pay was great, and peaceful/fun environment."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working from home.The monthly 1:1 with my supervisor was very helpful because it gave you insights of yours strengths.
good,"Humana is a great place to work. We were more like a family than just of team of coworkers. Our management team worked with us to ensure that we had what we needed to perform tasks at hand. Diversity was very important, which help us bond and understand one another. The hardest part about the job was not having the opportunity to work from home as a Pharmacy Technician. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming into a place that had a group of welcoming individuals."
good,"Excellent employment company, friendly behaviour of the companionWith a high level of communication between employees and bossess and a high professional level of the Supervisores"
good,Great place to work. Always learning something new and exciting. People are very friendly and family oriented. They believe in Family first. The Benefits are great also.
good,I felt that it was a great place to work.  There were a lot of job lay offs while I have been working here.  The metrics are always changing so the need for you to be able to adapt to changing work expectations is constant.
good,"Lots of phone work, which I was unbelievably good at. Loved the work, loved the people. Hardest part was quoting benefits I had tremendous moral objections to. No advancement if you are REALLY goo at what you do...they want to keep you doing that and training other people to be that way too...Still loved that job."
good,"my department did the medical necessity claims, I worked with several nurses and doctor's in my department. Created all of our spread sheets and helped workflow of the claims process."
good,I enjoyed working for humana as the wounded warrior case manager for the MTF at Randolph AFB. I would still be working there if they had not lost the contract to a cheaper bid
good,Overall a very good company to work for.  Primary issue was it was very competitive to achieve inbound call status.  Rules changed without notice so one never knew what the primary focus was going to be.
good,It is a great company to get in with on the ground floor. Plenty of room for growth. Cheerful atmosphere. Great Benefits! Healthcare is constant in its existence but ever changing as a whole. Get in and grow with us!
good,"Depending on the department, Humana can be a great company or a very difficult environment to be part of.  In this company, it is too large to ""stand out"" and is very unique with their way of thriving."
good,"Productive, innovative, freedom of providing solutions,fun, great team , friendly management, work life balance, flexible timelines,"
good,Humana is a great place to work when you aren't getting laid off. I was recently impacted but that does not negate that fact that it is a great company.
good,My specific experience was not as positive as I would have hoped.  Team members don't share job knowledge between each other which would make the entire team more productive.
good,Overall I loved my job and what I did because I always had satisfied customers and they always informed me that I was good at what I do so I enjoyed all of my customers
good,Humana is the first real office job I have had and I Love the company the only thing I don't like is not knowing what will happen since the merger is off but other than that the pay is great for CPHTs and off on weekends
good,"Training is always on point, work life balance is huge with Humana which was great. I was on the phone all day everyday. This environment though work life was great, was not for me. I'm used to moving around all day and helping customers."

good,"team is very flexible and result oriented "
good,"Love Humana and would never want to leave except for the little thing called downsizing the workforce.  I feel challenged every day and love the fact that my manager embraces change and is an advocate for new ideas.  Not too much silo-ing in Humana at Home and everyone works well together for the most part.  Still have some old school leaders who want what they want, but are kind hearted enough to gently get their way."
good,"you always had something to do at humana, they had a cafeteria which was nice, and a free gym for the employees, didnt have much time to learn who your team members were."

good,"Great place to work at, but if you're looking for a place to keep you awake and alert all the time this is not the job. Also if you're looking for a job that treats you like an adult this is not the job for you.. Management is poor and supervisors and SMEs dont do their jobs correctly."
good,"Receive and make calls with co-workers. Hardest part, contacting customers. Learned their is no perfect plan. Enjoy finding good plans."

good,"Humana had a different focus when I worked there in the late 1990's. Before, they were a premier group insurer and provider of managed care services in 38 states.   Now they have become the leader in administering govrnment healthcare programs, primarily for Medicare Advantage programs, among others.  This is a highly price competitive and highly regulated business.  It is to Humana's great credit to have flourished in this business sector"

good,The company overall was an excellent place to work for.
good,I have had a good experience with Humana but in recent months there is a coworker that is not performing up to par but my Manager is not addressing the issue leaving me with making sure the department is running efficiently.
good,day is not the sames everyday. I have a great team of mentors that will help if I have a question. I also get to build relationships not only with co-workers around the country but also Brokers in an assigned territory.
good,"I take inbound calls from member's whom have questions about their plan benefits. I would answer questions about medical and pharmaceutical claims. Advise member of the coverage for medical and pharmaceutical also. I am able to quote benefits to member's, advising copay/ coinsurance, deductible, premiums and what Humana will cover. I work in a great work place. Co- workers are great and hard working. That keeps me motivated."

Their champion of inclusiveness while maintaining a diverse workplace should be applauded."

good,Humana is a great company to work for. I'm very pleased working for such company that is one of the top 100 companies. The culture is very diverse and the leadership is great to work with.
good,Humana was a good company to work with. Staff was professional & always willing to help. Training was thorough & easy to understand. Several shifts were available.
good,"The assignment I had was an Independent Contractor job. I loved the work and enjoyed working with my Team Leads and coworkers. There was abundance of support and collaboration. However, the Timelines to meet certain goals were unrealistic and the workload was unrealistic to complete in a 40 hour work week, creating a stressful situation for me.I feel confident the learning curve would have improved given a little more time. I would have liked very much to continue and complete the duration of the assignment but just as the ""training fog was starting to lift"" I was asked to leave as I was not meeting the expectations, The work I was assigned to do was more administrative and not what I had been originally told. I made mistakes and learned from them. I guess the training process they were giving me was the most creative and effective way they knew how to prepare me for the job I was hired to do. Often times I felt that my Team Leads were under insurmountable stress and pressure, therefore, passing this emergent attitude down to their trainees. My team was extremely organized and I am forever grateful for the opportunity. I left the assignment with no hard feelings. I think Humana is technology advanced and make communication very efficient and effective for their employees in the work environment. I was quite impressed with the company overall. I wish I could have had the opportunity to transition to other departments.  I hope this review will be read and taken seriously. The aggressive timelines make it difficult to have a work, life, balance and the expectations should be changed"
good,"get work culture, mangers are understanding. Management always informed us of changes. Leader in innovations and teaching. great leadership and awesome co workers"
good,"Productive and fun place to work with professionals, all are enumerated in my resume.You can also obtain full disclosure and detailed report in my updated resume for your perusal."
good,Great company but management is awful! No respect for off Humana life and poor management. I would of stay but after giving my two weeks notice I was let go 3 days before it was up.
good,"I was able to take advantage of multiple promotional opportunities. Employee insurance plans were a bit pricey compared to what the consumer would pay, but I always had my claims covered. Humana provides a rich set of employee benefits, including a wellness program."
good,Working in a call center environment is challenging. You have to have strong empathy and need little supervision. Not a lot of people can keep up with the demands of the position which shows in our high turn over rate. You really have to mess up to get fired from this department.
good,"MRA and HCC is our primary focus and I have learned many facets of how Medicare and Medicaid are essential to the members of Humana.  I work with a wonderful group of people in 3 states, including Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.  It is not so much the hardest part of my job, but I am finding traveling weekly on the drop of a hat is having an impact on my children's lives.  The most enjoyable part of working for Humana is the goal of the company, their achievements, their participation in all aspects of their members, and truly consider their members the heart of their business."
good,"Recommend this company."
good,"One of the best companies I have work for in my life, glad I had the opportunity.  Great work environment excellent employer who care about there employees."

good,"Great Company, great benefits, great atmosphere, but not all areas worked well like payroll, HR/Recruiting and systems. They pay well and encourage advancement."
good,"Very face paced environment to work, constant change, very micromanaged, very openly relaxed workplace cultured. The hardest part of the job was adapting to the many varieties of change per week. The most enjoyable thing of the job was working closely with my peers."
good,I love everything about this job.  This job was very rewarding and relaxing. The management team was very helpful and trainings are always  available.
good,Training was good.  Insured that we understood our role and positions.  Team meetings and one on one coaching was always available upon request.  Working from home helped out if you are a single parent.
good,Progressed from operations to corporate positions.  Enjoyed my immediate managers and was given opportunities for growth and development in my career.
good,"A typical days work would include visiting Humana members and assisting with overall wellbeing to avoid unnecessary ER visits and hospitalizations. I learned how to make sure members had the means to obtain medications, PCP access and preventative care. The hardest part of the job is finding ways to motivate members that were non-compliant. The most enjoyable part of the job is when members met goals and health improved."
good,They have activities for employees well being . They allow you to have work hours to volunteer in the community. They come up with things to make work fun.
good,"The workplace culture is very competitive with teams competing for the top spot monthly. The hardest part is the long calls - providing excellent customer service while keeping an eye on the stats - AHT, ACW and hold time."
good,"Humana was a great place to be employed, very open, forward thinking, and flexible.  Instead of following industry trends, they set trends and strategically divested themselves to ensure long term sustainability for all stakeholders.  Was willing to make the effort to push paradigm shift from the top down, instead of from the middle."
good,"I have enjoyed over a decade of time at Humana, great people that work hard day in and day out to look out for their members. Great gym facilities and other programs that help build up its employees. Many have finished degrees with Humana's help and I have even finished my masters. Large company with a family like feel. The typical day is going to be full of structure but can shift quickly into taking care of a fire if any there is any chance of members being impacted."
good,Humana truly cares about their employees and their well being. They are always looking for better ways to improve the quality of customer service with the members as well as taking care of their employees. I highly recommend this company to work for.
good,"Good company, good benefits, ""the only constant is change"", can be stressful IF YOU LET IT, dedication is necessary to be successful in any role within this company."
good,"Really enjoyed my time working there. They offer a comprehensive health care package. They are very fair and gracious with employees , and they seem to genuinely care"
good,There is no typical day; employees are in charge of their own schedules.  Home visits and accurate documentation within a mandatory time span.  Humana has a wonderful long-term history.
good,What I learned any position requiring 8 weeks of training - should have been my queue right then and there. I learned more about military health care. You will be on be on the phone. Not an issue for me but adhere to the attendance policy
good,"Changes were daily within Humana but the support from management and the team was amazing.  Everyone I met were truly dedicated to providing the members with the information, support and guidance to help them stay healthy.  I will always be grateful for the experience."
good,"Certain regions have different dynamics. One region in particular is very clicky and under-handed, unfair liars. HR will always take their side. They have been under HR investigation multiple times and no repercussions. Upper management is unfriendly, rude, and use double standards. No career advancement for blacks in this region (Medicare-Mid-Atlantic). Other departments are total opposite and awesome!"
good,Never a dull moment in the office.  Lots of reports to do and always busy.  Great place to work  Lots of activities to keep you entertained throughout the day.
good,Nice work environment.  Predictable work schedules.  Solid management in place.  Sufficient learning opportunities.  Advancement potential.  Overall a nice place to work.
good,I don't want to write a review on a large corporation.  Some of my employers have a department that handles any type of publicity.  Please do not ask me to rate this company.
good,I have enjoyed my time working for Humana and highly recommend it as a collaborative environment.  Humana provides many incentives to encouraged personal health of all their employees.
good,Coworkers and management easy to work with and supportive. Open door policy with supervisor. Coworkers were team oriented and always willing to assist is needed. Conducted research and located viable to resources to assist members.
good,Great place to work. Very fast paced. My experience has been very good so far. Supportive management team. Wonderful cafeteria! Competitive benefits package.
good,"Collaborative, fast-paced, work environment based out of Louisville Kentucky that encouraged and promoted Inclusion and Diversity and allowed work from home."
good,"Training is adequate for the job.  Call center atmosphere with direct leader willing to do what it takes to make you better at your job while higher management is looking at bottom line and not individual performance.  Pretty typical in most jobs that are centered around sales and numbers.  Just don't expect long term, job security is always on the fritz.  Good luck."
good,"Humana has a very accepting, environmentally friendly culture.. All the managers I have worked with have been very supportive and trusting that I would not need direct supervision and be successful as a remote coder."
good,"Humana is a great place to work!  I just got laid off unfortunately.  IT was very challenging and every changing, but the orientation was really wonderful!"
good,Humana is a great place to work. The leadership team truly cares about it's people. The challenges with Humana is that unless you live in KY you may encounter a lack of career advancement.
good,The people were very friendly and management was excellent in assisting with any situation.  Loved working for this company. The only con was the medical insurance was not very good all plans offered had very high deductibles.
good,I absolutely loved working in this department. Everyone was great and I completely adored all of the managers. I left this department to move to a department that was located closer to my house.....I wish I would have stayed.
good,A great place to work and wish I still worked there. They always supply you with the equipment and supplies that you need with high quality and no restrictions. They train very well for every position.
good,"Humana cares about the safety and security of all employees.  The benefit package and wellness initiatives are unlike any other company, There is great room to advance or move around within the company."
good,"Humana is a very large company with many area of business.  It is difficult to summarize.   Communications are like many companies. "
good,Absolutely love my limited term positions that I have worked with Humana. Lots of hours and good pay along with incredible opportunities to be able to get a full time position with the company.
good,"This job was great but there was a lot of instability with job security, working from home has some perks but there needs to be some accountability and better transparency from leadership"
good,"Good company, pay, benefits"
good,"HUMANA"
good,Due to the wealth of product knowledge in the insurance industry it is an amazing opportunity to excel in further endeavors.  Gain as much product knowledge.
good,"Bra, trygg kundansvarig och ett lätt företag att arbeta för."
good,Humana was a great company and takes very good care of their employees. I was hired on as a temporary employee and had 5 weeks of training I felt very well prepared as I transitioned on to the floor doing real work.
good,"Enjoyed working collaboratively with staff to ensure coordinated health and wellness education.  Unfortunately, we were laid off due to cost effectiveness."
good,my day starts out by checking in the patient to make sure all patients insurance are eligibility for visit and making sure the patients paperwork is up to date
good,I feel that the hardwork I put in should be recognized and there should be a better system as far as the callers should not have to wait and add more to their frustration I feel there needs to be a way to make the service more convenient for the members they want a person not an automated system
good,"Flexible Hours and Over time if you want to work, always learning something new, I assisted IT with the implementation of the new paperless computerized system for our department, helped with Quality Assurance and Accreditation, I was promoted a few times to assume more responsibility, also put in charge of preparing and sending all of our old paper files to Iron Mountain for storage"
good,"Great benefits, room for advancement, and continuous learning. Opportunities to work remotely and flexibility in schedule. Great company to work for overall."
good,It was a learning experience  dealing with elderly individuals. Billing  customer service dealing  with  medical as  well as prescription question. helping  set up payment arrangements  helping and refer to different resources for individual with low income
good,Most positions are work at home. I learned a lot about HCC coding and Medicare. The employees and education and assistance they give you is wonderful more than you could ask for.
good,"I enjoyed working for Humana.  The diversity and management teams were helpful and great to work with.  With the programs and working with providers, customers, members you were helping people live better and assisting them with their issues on a day to day basis.  You always made some great connections and put a smile on not only their faces but your own."
good,"I love what I do at Humana, job reduction. Management treats you like the professional that you are. Flexible schedules."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"I had a great experience working with clients on the Humana Vitality wellness program. During on-site biometric screenings, I was successful in helping employees loose weight, maintain their Diabetes, along with additional advice concerning insurance premium savings with participation. When I was able to help point a client in the right direction towards a healthier lifestyle, I had an extreme amount of pride and self assurance."
good,"Excellent company. I love the atmosphere and the management. The company really cares about it's people. Also, the company has excellent benefits."
good,"This company is very concerned with employee health and happiness. It's a laid back environment which facilitates health, creative thinking and simplicity."
good,great pay . great people . great opportunity. i would retire with this company had i gotten the position i wanted .
good,I strive everyday to provide the best customer service and I have learned that even when on the phone with a member they can still tell wether I smile or not. My coworkers can depend and rely on me when looking for guidence and the most enjoyable part of every job is hearing or seeing a happy customer.
good,"good experience this hotel,i learn how to motivate the staff, how trainee the new staff. management is so good. my co-works also very community people."
good,"I ran a class room of my own and had study skills classes. I kept the kids organized and made sure all homework and class work was done on time. I also kept in touch via phone and email with teachers and parents. This was a very rewarding job helping kids succeed."
good,All the staff was very professional.Mangement  was very caring.
good,"Customer service support for insurance agents"
good,"It was nice to work here, because the economy they offers just Limited Term Contracts to new hires ( 6 months)."
good,"Humana is an excellent place to work. Good benefits, competitive pay and opportunities for advancement."
good,"Humana has been a great place to work.  The only thing troubling me about working there is the great deal of outsourcing they are doing at this time.  The workload I (and what is left of my team...) used to carry has shrunken and morphed greatly over the past several years.  The opportunities offered (career-wise) at Humana are varied.  They are either for just 'entry-level' work or 'high-level' opportunities."
good,Working for Humana was a tremendous opportunity.  The company was very forward-focused and valued its employees and their well-being. Telecommuting was challenging because not all information is shared via email. Much knowledge is gained by simply being in the company premises.
good,"My work day consists of answering inbound calls for Humana-Medicare members . the calls are usually making a payment , prescription drug coverage, and effective dates fro enrolling . I have extensively learned about medicare and how insurance work together to provide prescription drug coverage for medicare recipients . The management team is terrific , my direct supervisor is a very compassionate , person , ans directs her team in a positive manner. the co -workers i have directly around me are very knowledgeable when questions come up and are fun to be around. the  hardest part of the job is the  remembering and following the many rules and restrictions of Medicare . i enjoy helping the members with their prescriptions, and billing. "
good,I enjoy the interaction I had on a daily basis with the member and the freedom I had to help and assist with the issues the member may have had. I learned a lot of customer service and problem solving skills along with management skills.
good,A typical day at Humana will consist of 50-70 calls per day dealing with members that have questions concerning their COB from previous claims filed with Humana. As well as going over a members current benefits for their current of future health care plans. 
good,HPS is very progressive and team oriented with a win/win attitude.
good,Working with benefits and families to get what they needed. Liked working with co-workers for a common goal and get the work done....Teamwork!
good,"High quality and expectations. Company strives to do the best and expects it from the employees. If you work hard, you will be rewarded."
good,"Humana is a fun company , they live doing games and things for agents for their hard work . they also are really strict on interacting with members because they are the most important"
good,Humana is a great place that cares about work life balance.  They encourage engagement and growth within the company and very supportive in diversity.
good,"Overall, I give Humana an A.  I loved working from home and the management was mostly great.  I felt the work beyond what I could accomplish but my managers were never too strict on it."
good,"I loved this job. Its seasonal so I will definitely be re-applying next season. The training was extensive, the hours were great and my schedule left me time to handle other important personal business"
good,"Well Humana gave me a great opportunity, I made sure to use it as much as I could. They offered different trainings "
good,"I learned billing, benefits explanation, and enrollment of new members. I also learned how to do pharmaceutical claims and eventually medical claims, those calls were long but also taught alot."
good,Humana made the decision to restructure and eliminated the post acute Social work Department. This decision was not based on outcomes or productivitiy.
good,"Enjoyed workplace culture, the last Supervisor I had was very supportive and was a motivator, company encouraged a strong work/life balance providing several opportunities for wellness breaks during work hours"
good,"Happiness depends on which department you are in. Humana, and healthcare in general, is a constantly changing business, and if you are in a company like Humana with a lot of medicare enrollment, they are largely governed by CMS (government office of Medicare and Medicaid).  Great culture, great people, learned a lot."
good,"Great company but don't prepare for a routine. The industry is moving at a rapid pace and Humana, to its credit, works hard to stay ahead of the curve."
good,Excellent Company the patients are the most important for this Company! Proud to be part of Humana! Care Plus and Medicaid cover  the patient  needs all time
good,"A great place to work and grow. Lots or room to learn new thing and find your niche. Good benefits package, amazing culture, and lots of people to help mentor aspiring leaders."
good,"Being a leader in the consumer and commercial insurance industry, Humana is a large organization that takes great care of it's associates and contractors. I went from a contract copywriter to an associate digital content strategist over the course of two years, then stayed on for another three. My direct managers and fellows team members were excellent, as was my experience overall. We collaborated constantly and did everything we could to move our ideas forward, together. Digital plays a relatively small role in an industry that is still dominated by in-person and phone-based communication, but our work was generally respected and understood by the larger organization. That said, the pace of work is generally very slow and there were some people at the Director and C-level who tended to undermine our hard work, and the extreme level of legal and regulatory limitations often put a damper on our best efforts. Regardless, I would recommend Core Digital Solutions to anyone who works in digital content, UX & creative if they prefer a slower-paced environment with great pay and benefits."
good,"Humana has great benefits and programs for its associates. The culture will depend on your department and what you actual job function is. Like any call center job, those can be stressful due to the calls but I’ve not heard anything bad about the off the phone jobs. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Humana is a great place to work: the compensation is competitive, benefits are rich (PTO surpasses most other companies I know), the culture is typically good. At times, work/life balance can be out of whack."
good,"It was good working here, but their wasn't much integration among departments. The manager was great and flexible. Also they had good perks for being an employee."
good,Humana is becoming flexible with hours if you are in commercial sales--their are options to work from home. People who work there are great.  Benefits good.
good,Humana is a great place to work they offer a great work life experience with great benefits.humana is health pro company and offers wellness breaks as well as two additional breaks through out the day
good,This company really cares about peopleboth internal and external. Patients always come first! The care and handling of each patient was individually owned.
good,"Easy job, great benefits, work from home, loved it. I will refer anyone to work with this company. The only reason I left was due to health issues and being that I was new, I couldn’t take off the time needed to heal."
good,"A typical workday is a different everyday, fast-pacedYou learn to be patient if you are already, a patient person. Training classes should be longer a lot to learn to retain in a short window of time span."
good,Not much room for advancement. Pay was minimal but worth it in my opinion because the culture of the company was cool! It's an nice place to work. The people are great!
good,"Due to the nature of the business, health insurance is a field that constantly changes, and Humana has done very well in changing it's operation to fit the changing industry as well as becoming a market disruptor."
good,"My experience working  with Humana was wonderful.  My position was as a Medical Case Manager working remotely from home.  I was responsible for managing my own work time, training and scheduling."
good,Humana's mission to increase overall health of its clients by 20% by 2020 guides managers above all other issues. This then translates into a mature and realistic set of sales objectives. This process has been central in building goals and objectives that are challenging  and fair.
good,"Friendly atomosphere, I'd recommend anyone to work for this company. I worked there and loved going to work each day. I made lifelong connections working there and learned many skills."
good,I would have my management promoted or transferred and new management did not know what I could do and my value went down.  Humana was great overall as a large company.  The larger the company the easier for them to eliminate your job.  My department was outsourced overseas.
good,"A typical day at Humana is reviewing my calendar, making adjustments if needed, reviewing responding to emails.  I do have a weekly conference call with our team to discuss any issues.  I have my own case load that I manage from home.  I do travel to see my Members daily according to demographic location of my Members.  I complete charting daily, monthly, and annually in a timely manner.  Humana is Member focused on HeaIth and Wellness. I enjoy the independence of this position.  The hardest part of this job is the workforce reduction I am part of currently."
good,"I learned a lot about myself, and learned many things towards growing my career skills.  Make a mistake though, and you are dead to them. The company was bought out after I left so I can't speak to how the company is now."
good,"I really like and wish I could continue to work inc current Org. Company culture, policies, responsibilities all are super good and much enjoyable to spend years of life here."
good,"Being able to work at home, receive excellent benefits, good work/life balance. Core team is supportive, management is involved in day to day work tasks and very close monitoring of all contacts made."
good,Humana is the best company I have ever worked for.  Not only do they care about the members they provide but the employees they hire.  They care about the health and happiness for each employee.  There are so many benefits for working at Humana.  They are always encouraging you to grow yourself personally and professionally.
good,"I worked at Humana 10 years (from 2003 - 2014).  I started as a calls rep, where I remained for 3 years simply because I loved the interaction I had with the people I served. I enjoyed helping people.  Then I became a Team Lead, where I remained for about a year.  Then I was approached to become a Supervisor and I accepted.  I had some wonderful Managers that I work with and admired completely.  I retired in 2014 and moved to Texas."
good,"The management team is outstanding and key reason for my tenure. The Management Team is dedicated and stays focused on annual plans, but agile when industry disruptions surface.  I always feel well informed and they offer many resources for self-improvement.  They really care about their employees well-being."
good,"Humana has a great support system for employees, you don't have fear failing or .being talked down to."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working there, I was only there as a seasonal worker.The pay was great, I enjoyed that there were little community's within the company all kinds of opportunity to be involved with each other in the inside and  outside community. I loved the discounts on shopping and travel. i also enjoyed the inter company social media.   The hardest part of working there is that there is quite a bit of favoritism which I believe is really unfair for the professional development of everyone."
good,Humana has provided me with valuable knowledge and experience.  The people at Humana at all levels have been great to interact with whether it be casually in a passing by conversation or on a major project.  Great company I’ve ever had the pleasure of working for
good,"Handled incoming calls for customers, Medicare, claims for hospitals, Doctor's, Medical equipment. Assisted customer's with billing, claim issues. Handled 4 businesses with there group insurance claims exclusively."
good,Enjoyed the company just need benefits and more pay . The local hospital was pulling from the contract from medicare . I am probably going to lose members starting the new year and I cant be without a job or only have a limited amount of people to serve in this area.
good,"training was easy, management was knowledgeable, helpful and informable. Job was high volume but consistent. mature coworkers and management. kept everyone involved in activities."
good,Humana was an excellent place to work.  During my time I thoroughly enjoyed the culture and the performance metrics that were outlined for the position.
good,"Humana employee satisfaction varies greatly depending upon which department you work in. Personally, my leaders were fantastic and the department coworkers were friendly and always willing to help. The drawbacks were the workload during our busy season (which lasted 6 months) and not having enough associates to help stem the workflow. Collaboration is one of Humana's greatest strengths. The best part for me is being challenged in new areas, using my strengths and being given responsibility to oversee vendor relations and work."
good,Humana was a great place for me to work.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the challenges of the job. At Humana I was offered opportunities for advancement.  I would highly recommend working for Humana.
good,I liked working for Humana and wish they wouldn't have sold the portion of the business that I worked for (Allmond Ave). Would t his not have happened I would've hoped to retire there.
good,"Great Company to work for. Enjoyed the environment and company culture. Great management. The hardest part of my job was creating benefit packages.   We worked as a team, which made it very easy to get the job done."
good,Humana is a very caring company who truly cares about quality of care for their members. The Clinical leaders are amazing and the support you receive is excellent.
good,"Very caring company, good management, enjoyed visiting clients and helping them manage their care in their homes.Client were great. Being able to communicate with different members of the client's integrative health care team in the community was very effective."
good,"Human is a great place to work, concern for employers and customers go a long way. The job has taught me discipline and how to multitask with all of the  new changes that comes about."
good,"I really loved working for Humana. The position I had with them as a medical record specialist has helped me figure out the position I ultimately desire. This position was 90% work at home, the other 10% was driving to doctor's offices/physician practices, or company meetings (which you were compensated for the gas mileage any time you left home for work related events)."
good,Good Company to work for difficult to return to work after giving birth and suffering from postpartum depression.  Other then that  I absolutely loved my job.   Still one of the best jobs I ever had.
good,"Due to the nature of the insurance business, there were many times when things could get very busy. But above all, customer service was our number one focus."
good,"Humana at Home is a wonderful company to work for. The program offers the employee to choose their own caseload that they are comfortable with. However, this is a contract position with no benefits."
good,Aunque fue un trabajo por agencia y por un corto tiempo aprendí muchas cosas sobre lo que es un enfermero de quality sobre como trabajar con heidis body mas y aprendi a escudriñar los expedientes clinicos
good,THis company is a great stepping stone into the world of insurance. YOu will make a lot of money if you work hard. be careful to stay compliant. hence why i'm no longer there
good,"Humana at Home is a case manager work from home field position, I began with Humana in 2015 and left for school to complete my FNP. They pay weekly which is a positive and weekly mileage checks however in May we were no longer able to take our mileage out or in which cut the mileage reimbursement drastically.  Overall I enjoyed my members the work wasn't stressful, it's comparable to most jobs in healthcare, unrealistic goals which doesn't always coincide with what the member/patient needs."
good,Great company and people who try to work with each care giver as to the hours and locations of clients who need help.  Great people in the office and nice clients for me to work with.
good,"Working at Humana is not a difficult task. We all like to work hard but it's still a fun, tight-knit group to be a part of. If you're looking for a good work family, this is a great place to work. Management encourages you to take ownership in your area and always look for new ways to help the company succeed"
good,"Entering member's demographic data in the system which at times can be lengthy, and time consuming. Visiting members on either a weekly or monthly basis depending on member's status.  Having the ability to maintain a caseload of 40+ if assigned to HCB (home community base) or 80+ if assigned to SNF (skilled nursing facility). There was a family-like environment to work in which led everyone willing to assist one another when needed. Case plans can be a challenge at times when there's lack of communication."
good,"Had work life balance, caring manager and team. Managed a roster, called pts Monday - Friday via phone calls. Manager was excellent rusted our work ethic, work place culture is very friendly."
good,"Overall great company, fights for their employees and is very appreciative of hard workers. great pay and benefits, people are friendly and work as a team."
good,"Humana was ok. Only con i have is that It was temp only. Not temp to hire. I have a family and just being employed for 6 months, although i was grateful for the opportunity, It just wasn’t enough"
good,"It was a fun place.                 "
good,Fun place to work. Compensation is fair to the living expense in San Antonio.  Management and employees have a good attitude and always willing to help.
good,I enjoyed my time at Humana very much. One should take advantage of all of the Work/Life Wellness activities. I even organized a day out for our team to volunteer at Habitat for Humanity. Its a great place to work.
good,"Humana has a bold goal of improving the lives of our customers 20% by 2020 and we are making significant progress. I am surrounded by smart, talented individuals collaboratively working towards our opportunity of a lifetime. I believe in our leadership and the vision. Humana is a great place to work."
good,"The job pays well for a temporary assignment. Of course there are no benefits as a temp.  It is a tedious job opening mail, calling members to take a survey, or entering in paper surveys into the PC."
good,loved work for Humana. I learned so much that i still  use what i learn to this very day. They were always restructuring and laying off. they now have cut down so many department hat their staff now works from home. Sometimes they could be to customer friendly to the point you could lost your job over something a customer would say. all in all it was a great place to work and it paid very well.
good,I am more hands on and wanted to get more experience in a specialty such as ER. Company was great at promoting wellness and fitness but i dont think there was much oppurtunity offered for my growth
good,"ok , telephonic counseling. On the phone all day "
good,"Humana was a great place of employment.   I was with Humana for over 8 years and my current position ended due to reduction in force, however I am looking forward and excited to start a new career with new opportunities. "
good,"While processes could be improved at Humana, the company has a vision to do just that and is working diligently to make things work for the benefit of the consumer."
good,"I loved working for Humana. Unfortunately , they experienced 4 reductions in force in 2017 and I was hit on the third one. My immediate supervisor was great, upper management could have been more honest and up-front with us. It took me almost 3 years to get this job and it was taken away in less than 2. Humana is a good place to work, hopefully they get their business model straightened out."
good,"I worked for Humana for 16 years and I enjoyed every minute of it. They are like any company, they expect their employees to do their best. I was promoted several times and always did my best."
good,"I really enjoyed working with Humana and providing customer service to our members, but the advancement opportunities were few and far between. Being that I am a family man I need more advancement opportunities."
good,"This job was 13 years ago. It was for an Air Force Base, & after 6 months, Humana was not allowed to re-bid for the contract. I then worked for 2 other companies in the same position, before I quit."
good,"Team was well established and fun to work with. Contractors last for 1 year then ""pop"". Unstable business, always talk of a merger, job security threatened constantly."
good,Humana was a great job and I wish I could have made it a career. I love the people I worked for and the environment. I would call the doctors office and set up an appointment to come and scan the medical records and then I would report back to them. There were no hard part to this job.
good,Great place to work. Great work life balance. Was able to make a difference in people's lives everyday. Enjoyed meeting new people and helping them with their insurance needs. You became a part of people's families.
good,Humana has great benefits and a Health Vitality program for employees. Great benfits but they need to place more value on the promotion of Talent from their Direct Mareting Team.
good,The best part of job was working from home. I enjoyed helping Humana members achieve a healthy lifestyle and enhance member wellness. Humana also had great benefits including volunteer time off
good,Great training I received my license there  - awesome bonus - Manager cared about my growth. Fast paced. Great marketing campaigns so the opportunity was there at all time to succeed.
good,"Humana values it's employees and you will find that they are ever changing to benefit their employees.  Unfortunately, due to their ever changing ways to improve the company, they often find that certain programs, etc., do not work a you may lose your position within the company after a very short period."
good,The role was sometimes repetitive but never difficult. It was easy to navigate through all systems used. Management is receptive to feedback on how to make processes work better for the customer and the associate all the way up to EVPs. Make any intention to move up or across departments known early and try to be a top performer. Nothing will put your role at risk more than being late. This is more closely watched than even a dip in performance.
good,"love it there, flexible, close work relationship. evryone is so friendly. easy to get days off. Not really a place for advance ment, thats the only bad thing."
good,Human's benefits aren't good; however always availability for job advancement. For the most part managers were friendly and willing to help teach. I believe higger management should get more involved with learning who works for them and concerns if any.
good,Humana is a call center environment that is extremely micromanaged by reports that consist of time away from the phones as well as pin pointing every aspect of a call.  The culture is very structured and time managed.  The hardest part was the short 30 minute lunches.  The most enjoyable part was assisting people with their insurance applications.
good,I enjoy Humana in many different ways.  Humana provides me with a comfortable  compensation package and they also give me the opportunity to have a great job work/life balance. The most important aspect I enjoy about my job is helping individuals with there health needs and supporting them with a healthy lifestyle.
good,I enjoyed my time with Humana i was assigned their for a year and I loved every minute of it. The people were so family oriented and everyone treated each other like family. I learned so many health skills and how to apply them.They had a great management team and the work environment was laid back and professional with a mature group of individuals. The hardest part of the job was bonding with lovely people that were dying from different reasons. The most enjoyable part was all the teamwork that was displayed in that place will never be forgotten.
good,"Worked from home and it great. Has great benefits and as long as your coach is well balanced, the job will be, too. The pay is good for the work.and there is opportunity for advancement. Work/life balance is great."
good,"Humana has a good culture and a strategy towards wellness.  Some positions allow you to work from home, while others let you work at hoe for some of the time."
good,"Great company and great employees.  Very innovative company.  They value employees and understand work life balance."
good,It's a good company to work for. The pay is good and the focus on associate well-being provides for a balanced workplace.
good,"Great company to work for, it has it perks like free 3 year bus pass and other discounts that other people dont get discounts on."
good,"Excellent company to work for.  I was sad to have been let go. The training was very extensive and helpful.  Also, the existing employees were quick to help when needed."
good,"I was blessed to work for a company like Humana.  I was embraced into the culture and developed.  "
good,"a Place you can just go into have a smile on your face all day. i learned how to interact with other people how to deal with them when they are having bad day and good days, also my communicating skills got better. my co workers was outstanding and helpful. the hardest part about the job was leaving it. but the most enjoyable was helping members with their needs."
good,"Typical day is good day, work without constant Supervision"
good,"Typical day at Humana, busy. Very relax atmosphere and very enjoyable to work at a great company. Have Great perks and Humana really care about the members."
good,I enjoyed working for irst National Credit Card center until the last day. The call center closed in 2009 due to cut backs. The call center has such a family feel wish they were still around.
good,Yu have to wait a year to move out of your dept great place to work flex schedule very relaxed. Aetna is buying humana out 6/2016. Lot of perks vto. Pto etc
good,"HUMANA, INC Louisville Service Center: An excellent blend of ""family"" atmosphere with ""customer-focused"" service. The company promoted learning daily tasks yet career advancement was left to the individual to figure (out)."
good,I truly enjoyed working for Humana. Their health benefits are quite expensive but their other benefits were outstanding. I loved working from home and I also thought my boss was one of the best bosses I ever had. She knew when you needed a liittle slack. Humana is a company that truly puts family life first.
good,"I enjoyed Humana, the people were friendly and helpful. My coworkers were always supportive and willing to help you out in the event you had questions, as well as being a very encouraging bunch."
good,"Typical day is releasing multiple proposals. Receiving a few calls from sales and a lot of data input"
good,"Very fast paced, always learning new procedures to better achieve "
good,"Telephonic outreach to member's identified by Humana as viable candidates for care management.  I learned so much about the aging population and Medicare participants.  I looked forward to speaking with seniors with a compassionate tone and more importantly listening with an approachable ear, because seniors are preyed upon a lot and to slow down the speed of your speech as well as to make sure the tone of your of your voice, even when faced with an irate member, will create a trusting rapport.  A lot of seniors feel abandoned and are afraid to trust especially a phone call from a toll free line and my co-workers I developed friendships with all felt so much compassion for the members and that's why we enjoy it.  The hardest part of the job was being a temporary employee because we don't get to participate in Humana activities for employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making a difference in the lives of the seniors I touched.  All members I spoke with would thank me for calling and thank me for being so easy to talk to, that's what motivates me."
good,None at this time.  I like what I do ~ Helping people.  This position gives me the opportunity to provide the service I expect when I contact a business.
good,"it's a great pleace to work very casual and no managers ove r your neck all time, hardest part of the of the job is management . co workers are great an very friendly"
good,"I enjoyed working here. The pay is nice, the managers are very proactive and motivated. No full-time benefits or PTO."
good,This job has all the perks you want plus BONUSES! You can advance to many management levels within a short period of time.
good,"Great opportunities for new projects. Always great pay, and bennifits."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of speaking and greeting co-workers before starting work on the phones. Working in Medicare Risk Adjustment I learned how to work with the elderly population, as well as Humana members that were on disability and social security. I learned how to assist financially needy members with programs provided by Medicare and Medicaid, local programs in their state that would help them with meals, medical, and fitness programs. The hardest part of my job was denying members for financial help. Sometimes the members were over by a penny but, I had to adhere to Medicare and Medicaid guidelines. I enjoyed my co-workers, and helping members that were not very trusting of giving out their personal information over the phone due to so many scams that target seniors or the disadvantaged. It was a joy to earn their trust, and follow the member through any process 100%. I took pride in going out of my way to help a member, or getting them to the correct person that could help them if I was unable to."
good,Working with Humana was a great experience for me I learned so much medical terminology with them. The people I worked with were very supportive I felt like I was a part of a team/family. The hardest part about working there was understanding the system it takes time and practice.
good,"Assisted patients with questions regarding their medical bills, processed Financial Assistance Applications, processed attorney's and hospital request, as well as bankruptcy accounts and processed insurance correspondence. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is done. The part I enjoyed the most is all of it! I love helping people it gives me a great sense of satisfaction."
good,"Great start to the day by engaging team members in fun and games that had the medicare theme. I learned great thing about the medicare system,website and plans.Management had various aspects of leniency towards family emergencies, but still remained strict when needed. Co workers were very supportive and we learnt from each other.The hardest part of the job was when our members told us they had to choose between food and medication. When we could give them alternatives to finding other ways to get food on their tables and afford their medication."
good,working at Humana allowed me to express my caring personality.
good,answering the phone assisting member with there benefits question claims. I have learned a lot about the health systems
good,All wonderful things to say about this company. They really care about their associates.
good,love it  it was a great compant to work for i loved the people the friends etc 
good,"Great place to work because you are serving our Military community, and their families."
good,Working at Humana was good for me because i like dealing with people. And i am definetly a people person. I learned to have patience and understanding. I still posses these qualities today. My co-workers were very helpful. They were great team players. Their was really nothing hard about this job just a lot of information to be conveyed to the customer. I enjoyed every aspect about that job.
good,"I truly loved this job because he broke me into the profession I went to school to learn. I repaired ventilators for the respiratory department. It was hard heavy work but very enjoyable. The hospital was fun and in my home town Louisville, Ky."
good,"productive, fast pace place to work, good working environment, good benefits, good working conditions and training"
good,Humana is a great place to work that offers comparable benefits and offers life long well being for all associates.
good,A typical day is making outbound phone calls requesting clinical information to 30 facilities. I have learned how to prioritze my work by importance. I have a wxcellent relationship with management. The hardest part of my job is getting hospital case managers to send the appropriate documentation. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my coworkers and also being able to assist members.
good,Very busy place. Great Staff. Made sure the staff had all information needed to assist the patients.
good,"This was the best job I've ever had.. This company provides U with all the tools needed 2 suceed."

good,"There is good communication, teamwork and just a great working environment. They have very nice people , They are easy to talk to , you will not have no type of problems."
good,"I only interned here several years ago so I don't have a holistic view of the company, but everyone that I worked was great. Their Actuarial Intern program is among the best in the nation."
good,I have gotten really close with the people I work with! We all look out for each other and management is always actually talking to us and genuinely interested in how each and everyone is doing.
good,Able to submit availability and times slot are filled accordingly. Biggest downside was having to drive to different parts of the state. Some managers were extremly difficult to work with.
good,Outstanding company culture that promotes a healthy lifestyle of both their employees and members. Terrific work life balance. Great opportunities for advancement and growth.
good,"Great company, compensation for the work, benefits and organizational culture. Only gripe was lack of ability to cross train and seeming reluctance to leverage technology at every chance. It seemed as if departments worked in silos and advancement was based on who you knew and not what you know and brought to the table."
good,"My experience with Humana was very good.  I worked with an amazing management team and felt very valued as a team member. There was a community culture while I was there that encouraged growth, positivity and commitment to meeting the needs of our clients and providers."
good,They work hard to retain members and associates both.  Humana believes in creating a positive culture for all associates.with the eye toward accountability and partnerships.

good,"I enjoyed working at Humana, and overall, it's a great place to learn and grow. The benefits are great, and the health plan is wonderful, as to be expected. The incentives for living a healthy lifestyle is definitely a perk, and I miss the competitive, yet fully team-oriented, spirit that helped to drive myself and my co-workers to achieve our health-oriented goals,"
good,Good place to work but it can be stressful on your family due to the amount of long hours that you have to put in during peek season. Good commission structure too
good,"Working at humana, was fun and also very exciting. The hours were really great as well. The other employees ,  team members were friendly, understanding and their for you if you need them to be. Management really let you know that you are valued and needed."
good,"It was a great experience,  Very good company to work for , great benefit very comfortable work place.  Great benefits and great environment.  very good pay"
good,Not a bad job but the attendance and expectations for that can be brutal. It’s a call center so you’re on the phone all the time. Other expectations aren’t too crazy and the dress code after hired is pretty relaxed.
good,"Fair compensation. Helpful Managers; Great Benefits; Would love to work for this company again, without hesitation. Worked in the field part time and had home office for data input"
good,"Best company to work for. I was able to learn alot and met the most wonderful co-workers.  Great pay, benefits and able to work from home was the best."

The culture is remarkable and something that gives me vision and scope when observing other organization infrastructure."
good,Typical work day is usually conducted by your Team Leader. Everything and everyone will talk about what all needs to worked on that particular work day.
good,"A typical day at Humana was busy, from the time you clocked in at work you had to get started on your work and they monitored you on according to your production, it was sometimes stressful because of the applications you had to process and if you had one with issues it was more so stressful because you couldn't move forward until you processed it fully without mistakes.  The management team was easy to get along with, everyone was willing to assist you with whatever you had a problem with and co-workers were great to work with as well.  Everyone was friendly and easy to get along with.  The most enjoyable part of working there was working with everyone I trained with prior to working at the main Humana facility."
good,"Best Company to work! I had the chance to work for over 20 years, and "
good,"I love the diversity at Humana"
good,At Humana I am part of the compliance/audit team. I am one of the nurses that reviews documentation to make sure it is correct and in compliance. We also check all denials to make sure they are in compliance.
good,"Humana is a fantastic company if you're seeking a career...its not for the faint of heart as it's a challenging and ever changing environment but the culture and a dynamic inclusion & diversity mission supports the pace & the people.  Unparallel opportunity for advanced, for those that earn it - it's not handed out freely and it shouldn't be as people health and wellbeing are at stake everyday, all day."
good,Great company to work for. I came on unlicensed and successfully completed the licensing to become a sales rep in health insurance with the company. Great place to work. Off season is challenging simply because of outbound calling. I would recommend this job any day as a great company to work for. Humana give you the tools to grow comfortably. Great management and organization and communication. One of the best companies I ever did work for. Will definitely work for them in the future.
good,Absolutely love my job.  I love the team I work for and my Manager is an awesome individual.  I have like 5 % stress and love coming to work.  Work life balance is supported and you feel cared for.

good,"Humana is a great company with a great mission to helping others."

good,"This is a really great place to work. The benefits are amazing, and affordable. The leadership team cares about their associates. This place is a dream job,if this is your interests."
good,"I was hired on as an LTE for open enrollment. With open enrollment over, I have been applying out for permanent positions but they are not alot of positions open at the time. Humana is a great company to work for and they take care of their employees with benefits, discounts and fun activities for all employees to participate in."
good,I was blessed with working with some of the best in the business. We were all family and focused on doing the best for the customers and company for success.
good,My experience with Humana has been great. You are able to learn and add value. They believe in work life balance for the achievement of health and wellness.
good,"You have busy times of year and slow times. Above average holidays available so if you are willing to work 60+ hour weeks during the busy Annual Enrollment Period months, then you can thoroughly enjoy nice long vacations during the slow season without feeling an ounce of guilt. This is a job for someone who is self-motivated and knows how to manage their time but is also great for parents looking for a work-life balance and people who love to travel. "
good,"I loved my job at Humana. I wish that it wasn't a temporary position. The pay and benefits were great and I really liked the culture their. They offered neat extras, like encouraging health care and exercise."
good,"I was able to expand my horizons and advance my career while at Humana.  A lot of that I feel like was personally driven rather than management helping me.  Sometimes management would even get in the way of my advancement.  I realize that sometimes, you can't just do whatever you want, but I was told No on occasions just because I had done a few opportunities that month.  Seemed like I either had an unbalanced workload or was able to complete tasks quicker than normal employees, and I was hindered because of it."
good,Excellent people and very good place to work. Give the opportunity to increase  your knowledge in the medicare and health care to associates and patients.
good,"Had a great time working for this company, helpful monthly meetings, enough yearly activities to motivate employees and encourage team work and engagement."
good,"Due to the fact that there were different shifts, if you left something in your drawer during the day, when you returned to work the next day, don't expect to find it...why, because the person that worked during the evening hours would have taken it. Management was very helpful, if you needed assistance with anything, they were always there to help. "
good,"Excellent culture at Humana. Nails the intangibles of working somewhere and feeling good about the job outside of financial and career reasons. Great work environment. Not a lot of people in their early 20's work there, though (I was easily youngest in the 2 departments I worked in)"
good,I really enjoyed working at Humana because it was a professional environment with room to grow and advance. The best part was speaking with the members and hearing their story. The people were a diverse bunch and it taught many of us how to get along and accept others as they are.
good,"Humana is a great company for those starting out in their field of study.  Being such a large company, there are opportunities for a person truly find their path. Humana management is also great at help develop and grow their employees and set the on a career path that interests them.  I would not be leaving if not for moving out of state."
good,Process Medicare and nervous mental claims. Had to make sure claims were process correctly to keep getting an audit. In DMR had to call pharmacies to get information to be able to process to see if the member was able to get reimburse what they were aligible for.
good,"Typical Field Work Day would be driving to 3-5 clients homes to conduct health interviews or updates."
good,I loved working at Humana and would highly recommend this company. I loved the culture and diversity that was driven at Humana. They really care about their employees.
good,"Great place to work with great leaders within the company. Corporate culture is fluid, progressive and smart.  Company has lots of work to do with less hands to do it with."
good,Awesome place to work I loved it here. I would highly recommend working at Humana to anyone. Good money for it being a call center for the most part..
good,"Excellent team building.  Pre-Service clinical claims reviews for DME, inpatient & outpatient services. The hardest part of the job was writing non-approval letters. Writing approval letters was the best."
good,"Fun working environment depending on the team and supervisor. Every team has different management skills. Some managers have been promoted for their advanced skills and knowledge of the systems and product, but they lack self maturity (20 yrs < ). High school mentalities. Otherwise, awesome entry level customer service job.  "
good,My days were spent answering the phone and trying to help members terminate insurance. I learned about how insurance works after you reach 65 years of age. The hardest part of the job was to  calm down and reassure members when they're upset. The best part was the lunchroom and gym.
good,"My department was the best, Front Line Leader and Manager was understanding, friendly and cared about not only you but also your family."
good,"each day presented its own challenges. You gained many successful relationships with members, educating them regarding illnesses, allowing them to stay out of the hospital.  We had monthly reviews with our coach, who provided great constructive criticism when it was needed.  Many valuable learning opportunities and guidance.  My most enjoyable aspect was the relationships and bonds I made with my members, as they would look forward to my monthly calls."
good,"For my department accountability was expected and required, although other departments were a little bit more loose in that aspect.  Great company overall and I would enjoy working there again."
good,"Humana is a good place to work, but unfortunately layoffs and elimination of positions happens all too frequently. Please consider very carefully leaving a steady secure position for an opportunity at Humana."
good,The culture was very empowering. They walk and live their values and instill that each leader holds themselves and the staff accountable for living the values.  The hardest part of the job is the constant change during the day to day task.  The most enjoyable was the collaboration among the leaders and the dedication to the staff to make the environment an enjoyable place to be.
good,Loved my boss and job. Training helped prepare me for the job I was hired to do. It was nice to work at home. I was able to spend more time with my family.
good,"Managers would put on different outdoor activities for associates to mix up the daily grind."
good,"Buen trato y buenas condiciones laborales."
good,Many work at home positions. The hardest part of the job is the OT sometimes it is on short notice. The benefits are great. Paid tuition. The company usual promotes within.

good,"It has been my pleasure working for Humana Pharmacy. Although the job was only seasonal, it taught me various things about retail to mail on prescriptions. The job was very laid back and easy to get enrollments with mostly elderly medicare members. I enjoyed working in the inbound department; which is also known as the Rx enrollment department."
good,The ability to have a stable profitable career with excellent work-life balance.  The company is dynamic and offers multiple avenues for growth and success.

The last year, I was worried about my job security and changing to new team and managers were a downfall. I was able to keep my position with Humana until they decided it wasn't lowering cost anymore and closed my department. I was the last 25% in my department."
good,"I have worked for Humana for over 9 years and have been very happy.  I worked from home most of the time and contacted member's to help them reach their health and emotional goals.  It gave me much satisfaction to see member's reach their goals.  "

good,"I've worked many levels at Humana. I began reviewing and paying claims, then moved to a lead position helping others.  My current role has been importing data into databases and doing reporting.  I build queries to help build reports that help us prioritize and follow inventory.  I have learned a lot about Medical Insurance, learned reporting and how to build queries. The hardest part of the job is denying claims for people who are obviously sick.  The best part are the people I work with."
good,"Hard work, fast paced, good workflow. Consistently busy, 10 hour days. Friendly environment, with the ability to be able to learn many different roles. Technologically advanced."
good,I have been with Humana for 3.5 years and I love the company. Our contract is ending at the end of the year. Otherwise I'd stay forever. They appreciate their employees and treat them well.
good,Humana was a very wonderful company to work for.  I was able to go from being a Customer Service rep to a Resolution specialist and finally the Resolution Dept Supervisor.

good,"Humana is a wonderful ever changing company.  Over the years it has moved from a Nursing home company to a hospital company to a HMO and eventually to a well ness total health company.  Recently the company was going to be acquired by Aetna and management set a course for that merger.  Earlier this year the merger was not approved and the to companies decided to go there own ways.  Now, Humana is looking for that new identity to grow in the future.  My department was very progressive and encouraged a strong work life balance and an agile workforce.  Humana has a bright future and I hope that it finds the right course for success."

good,"8am to 6 or 7pm - common but it helps knowing you are doing the right thing for our customers."
good,I was there 8 years my boss was the most amazing woman in the world. I asked for work and she showed me how to use all the systems. I helped her by taking tasks of her hands.
good,"This company is great at the little things that make an employee feel at home.  However, the big things still need some work.  There are a few instances of the ""right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing."" This has occurred as it is a large company and one coast may not keep in mind the factors occurring in certain markets.  Coworkers and direct management is quite good, but the senior leadership is out of touch with certain aspects of roles and responsibilities."
good,Humana is a great company that treats it's employees well. The benefits are great and available once you have completed training. The best part is the 401K.
good,It had plenty of great benefits. Supportive management.  Was relaxed about employees working around personal time requests. Lots of community events

Familiar with CMS reply codes and transmit statuses.  Participated in and volunteered for a variety of projects within the Medicare enrollment area."
good,Leadership is always available to help. Work environment is fun and keeps you entertained when the job becomes monotonous.  Weekly meetings to keep you informed of changes and daily emails to let you know how you are doing are very helpful.
good,"The typical day varied.  Several meetings regarding specific goals of the company, prior to traveling to sites.  Arrive at facilities to achieve these goals successfully."
good,Loosing strength in their reputation with new business competition. Recently acquired by Aetna. Future is insecure in the marketplace.
good,"good place to work, not great pay.... if you like an repetitive job where the advancement is very little, then go for it. pros, every one acts professional as long as you treat them in a professional manner. no Christmas party..no bonus, no overtime"
good,Working at Humana was a great experience. They helped me get licensed in various states and taught me various new things in the insurance industry.
good,In  some citys there is no branches but still they runing theire business from those citys and if we want to raise a problem there is no higher management available.
good,Was sad to go but will hopefully be returning soon. Manager was very considerate of personal life and was very helpful with work related obstacles.
good,"Humana is a wonderful company to work for. A typical day consists of working on faxes and emails to code and review for medical necessity. I have been very fortunate to receive additional training on coding while working for Humana. Being a work at home associate, I do not have much contact with my fellow co-workers. It is really hard to say what my hardest part of the day is, I enjoy my job. The only draw back for me is, the hours are not flexible, as it is a work from home position.  It is important to meet production goals, but they really value quality over quantity."

good,Humana focused on living a healthy life and focused on work/life balance.  Associates worked together to better the company and selves.
good,Great place to work and good people to work for. My staff is excellent. The most enjoyable part of my job is serving those that protect us.
good,Humana was one of the best companies I ever worked for.  I got along very well with my collogues.  Since I handled COBRA a typical day would consist of taking calls from Humana employees who were inquiring about purchasing insurance once they were terminated from Humana.  The most difficult part of my job would be the majority of people I came in contact with were very upset at the fact they no longer worked to Humana or upset about the premium amounts.  One of the benefits I valued most was being able to work flex time as well as working from home.
good,"In the morning you work with your schedules and agendas. Submit reports automatically and go at 9 /1/2 to a 10 minutes break. At 1pm lunch. Still working until 3 or 4pm for another 5-10 minutes break and keep working until 6:30pm."
good,"I loved working for Humana One, it is a great company. Unfortunately Healthcare reform eliminated my career as a major medical underwriter. I was able to work on Medicare Supplement cases and totally enjoyed interviewing the applicants, I also transitioned into working on qualifying Life Event applications, verifying eligibility. I had great co-workers and interacted regularly via inner office communication as I worked from home for 12 years."
good,Humana is very big on well being that that provided each team with a foot cycle that you use at your desk and it was a stress reliever for me. So I would come in to work and had time to get me some breakfast and open up all of my systems that it is used daily. Management did everything by the book so no one  could be considered as having any favorites. My co workers were awesome. The hardest part of the job is when you got that member on the phone that you could not assist but wanted too. The most enjoyable part of the time is when everyone is getting along and on the same page.
good,"8AM to 5pm schedule, weekends off, PTO and learning opportunities available. Great benefits and great leadership. Management in my department do take in consideration our ideas and always want us to achieve our goals and accomplish new ones on a yearly basis"

good,Humana en Puerto Rico en su mayoria ayuda a personas mayures ofreciendo un sin numero de beneficios como gimnacion y delivery de su pedido de medicamentos. El pasado trabajo que hise en humana era de servicio al cliente por la via de agente telefonico
good,One of the best employment opportunities that assisted with my transition from Active Duty Military Service into the Civilian Sector. If I could choose to work for the company again in the near future I'd prefer to try their Inter-Office opportunity instead of the Work from home feature.
good,Humana by far is the best company I have ever worked for and I wish to in the future reapply they treat all of their employees as family there is always something fun going on that makes you feel as if you are not just in a call center some of the management could use training on how to speak to their employees professional but the company amazing
good,"Because working in the virtual work world, Humana tried very hard to make it rewarding by team work and good support throughout the day.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the patients."

However, together we turned the team around and we became the most productive team winning the ""Best in Service"" 6 months in a row. ""GO TEAM"""

good,Review often based on the particular management you are under.  I happened to have an excellent manager so I had autonomy and flexibility with my schedule.
good,"Good environment. My only problem with Humana is that conversion from contractor to Associate is never a guarantee. Management is very supportive, training is excellent with many resources."
good,"Each day started by preparing 15 minutes prior to making one available to begin taking calls from both active duty soldiers or bases. Much of the experienced gained was the process it takes for active duty soldiers as well as retired soldiers must go through in order to get the healthcare that their family needs. Very diverse workplace and always sustained positive relationships with each co-worker. The most difficult part of this job was when a member lost their family member, terminally ill patients, and get feedback that an active duty soldier was killed at war. The most enjoyable part of this position was helping each client and succeeding at what one is doing, making a person's day."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Humana because it was a welcoming and really positive environment. Everyone was team oriented and helpful. I would absolutely recommend this job to others. I would still be there had my temporary agency contract not expired. The management was very knowledgeable and always motivating, and willing to help you get to the next level. Tremendous support and motivation from fellow employees."

good,"They were always ready to help and assist as your Aunt would or best friend. They truly care about their employees. Though my lay off seems cut throat, it definitely was not. Had I had an AA or any college credits they would have worked with me finishing school and paying for it. But, unfortunately I fell short in that area where so many did not and desrved to be credited and rewarded for efforts I never began. I was fairly compensated and taken care of above and beyond my wildest expectations."
good,Management was not good. You had a typical work day that was busy..Management went into several changes. But the paid was excellent and the benefits.Workplace and co worker were great.
good,Humana was a very fast paced work environment management understood the demands and worked with us to make sure we can progress in our jobs.  Overtime is a must in this position which I enjoy making money but also like the time when you can relax and enjoy the money that you made.  There were always deadlines that had to be met which some task could be met but the effort was tempted.
good,I enjoyed co worker.  Humana environment was excellent.  Welcome manage was excellent and very professional.  She never made employee feel indifferent or out of place. She was very fair and open

good,Received inbound calls from patients with questions regarding their prescriptions. This was my first time as a Pharmacy technician at a call center and I learned how to be proactive towards the patients on the Phone. Hardest part of the job is getting to know the system. I enjoyed learning new ways on how to communicate with the patients via the phone.
good,"I worked in Visition and Dental Departments...it was a great opportunity learning about all these different medical terms. Great Experiences. Medical Plan Ded was very high but all other benefits including premiums were low.

good,"*Great 401K benefits"
good,"My only complaint was my daily commute. Through hours of examination, I have come to the conclusion that traffic is of the devil 🙄. The miles it took to get to work everyday were harsh. Thank God I had a nissan 🙌🏽. I was given the opportunity to work in the office because of chance (right place, right time, in the presence of the right people). As a certified  home health aide (during the time), I greatly appreciated the opportunity. I loved all of my colleagues. I loved most of my patients 🤗, I loved the company overall... I simply needed a change 🤷🏽‍♀️"
good,"A typical day at work was always a challenge, yet enjoyable with one knowing exactly what was expected out of you. I learned the importance of collaboration and making sure that I was consistently detailed oriented along with being compliant in all that I did on behalf of the organization. The culture of the company was relaxed yet, professional and management made sure that employees were well informed about their projects, assignments. The encourage and met with each employee to make sure they were doing well with their jobs as well as promoted and showed how they could be promoted within. There was never a time I felt that my job was difficult, but rather enjoyable to work with the majority of my team as well as other departments."
good,"the leadership is wonderful , everyone works as a team and they care about their employees. The benefits are nice however you can be outsourced at any moment so its not a place for longevity."

good,I enjoyed working for Humana because I was able to work from home. the pay and benefits were good. I hate that the department downsized and many employees lost their jobs.
good,The pay is great the people are incredible and the company promotes health and well-being. The vision is aligned to proving the Perfect Experience to our consumers. This year we are working differently to improve our net promoters.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job at Humana is the opporunity to use my unique skills, abilities and my passion to help improve the lives of the customers we serve."
good,"Great place to work if you can keep up with inventory. Peak season can be exhausting, but its worth it during regular season. Management does what they can to insure your success."

good,A typical day was a busy one while working. Also included education and policy review/introduction. Wonderful co-worker relations. Management worked along side you to help with difficult situations.

good,Humana is an ideal employer with a professional culture that bonafide cares about its employees. Great options for work hours and working from home as an option. Typically promotes from within allowing for future advancement. Decent pay and benefits.
good,great place to work have to be self driven and motivated. hardest part of the job is learning all the system you need in order to help the customers..
good,Humana was a great employer with competitive pay and benefits. Lots of opportunity to grow and learn. Unfortunately my department was discontinued as it did not meet KPI expectations.
good,It was a rewarding career to help others and work form home. I was able to manage my career and my personal life together. The other co-workers were always supportive.
good,"I am looking for other opportunities because the company is in the 2nd round of layoffs and potential layoffs in the future."
good,"Humana is a great place to work. There is a large opportunity to work from home. They offer a great benefits package and PTO. If it were not for a lot of layoffs and a lack of job security I would recommend it to everyone I know,"
good,"I currently work at home as a Telephonic RN Care Manager.  I work 40-45 hours a week, no holidays, no weekends.  This is a great job bc of my work environment and guidance from my Coach."
good,"My job was outsourced overseas.I wanted to retire from Humana and thought I would if I had the opportunity I would go back in a heartbeat! I had good pay and benefits and team engagement, it was like family I worked there 10 years and met lots of friends. We had a gym onsite which was great to unwind when open enrollment started, we worked hard and a lot of hours."
good,"the managers and leaders are amazing, they make it feel like a big family. but that doesn't change the fact that it's a sales job in a call center ( i am sick of  the phones)"
good,"Humana is presently in the process of eliminating positions that they have determined are unneeded.  My job falls into that category.  This is distressing as I love both my job and this company.  I am actively seeking another position within the company and hope to remain with them.  At the risk of inducing more competition for jobs I am trying to fill, I don't believe there is a better company to work for."

good,I enjoyed my time working at Humana the managers and supervisors were experienced and patient. The overall culture was welcoming I really enjoyed that they had a cafeteria with professional chefs on the first floor because there were no food restaurants close to the Humana offices!

I do think they need to be more mindful of the pressure they put on associates when it comes to metrics and productivity because stressing people out to meet certain numbers doesn't help them provide quality service. However, I do enjoy my job and my team members. They invest in the employees and you can earn incentives for preventative screenings and living a healthy lifestyle.

Humana provided me with great pay, great managers, clean facility and they where great when things popped up in my life where I would have to miss work.

I do this by knowing my product and familiarizing myself with our programs so the research goes quicker. There are managers, team leaders, and supervisors or each department. They are available to us through instant messaging, email, and in person depending on our needs. The most difficult part of my job is remembering to be patient and not rush.

good,"Typical work day, this was a far from typical job, I started out as a medical assistant in training moved to medical records then to the receptionist spot. I loved greeting the patients as they came in for appointments and even seeing them outside the clinic at grocery stores, church or at the mall. Management was great, yes they had a lot to take care of but it never stopped them from taking with us or the doctors. My fellow co-workers sorry have to say it ""the best"" we became like family we would go to lunch together and if one of us couldn't get away we always made sure to bring them lunch back. the hardest part of the job was when one of the patients past away and we had to pull their records from the chart room and write ""deceased"" on it, each patient at the clinic wasn't just another person to see the doctor but they became part of our family."

good,"Continuing from above summary:   Management seems surprised when changes in forms or requirements are implemented without input from the employees who will be using or doing the changes.   The employees have to learn or be trained on the changes and  when it does not work as planned employees have to learn the procedure changes again once management makes changes again.   A lot of time could be saved by tasking he people that will be utilizing these changes and letting them give input prior to implementation."
good,"I've been working at Humana as a contractor for ten years. I have a lot of respect for the leadership as they focus on the needs of their customers.

good,401k matched 150% of the first 6 percent is one of my top favorite reasons working here. Set shifts but u can bounce between them.

They can be disorganized and make spur of the moment decisions which u have to scramble to get things done

My sales team worked together very well and everybody was easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job was trying to come up with leads to sell other types of policies.  The most enjoyable part was visiting with fellow sales associates at meetings.
good,Great company with plenty of room for development and growth. Excellent trainers push you to succeed and excell. Trainers make sure you are prepared and we'll equipped for the job tasks.
good,Very busy with cash posting and phone calls. Learned alot thru my 20 years of service. Management was good! Good place to work! Getting the provider information to apply the refund. Liked my fellow employees.
good,This was an ideal job. Training is slow and steady. First call center job and it was a breeze. Opportunity to listen to others call and trial runs. Once on your own it's a breeze. Always give you proper memos and resources to find the answer. IM chats to co workers and supervisiors for immediate help on the phone. Managers gueinly care about your well being. They live and die by their tiers. Wish Humana would bring New Member Specialist to Houston

Diversity in the staff employed.The department celebrates its employees and provides feedback on our impact in the communities we serve. loved the fact we are helping people with needs and education for a better quality of life."
good,There was little that I didn't like at Humana.  I unfortunately ended up having a traumatic head injury which ended my employment at Humana as my LTD was up.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Humana. I've found that at most places if you need help from a coworker, you can only find people that are knowledgeable OR willing to help, very rarely both. At Humana though, it seemed that every single employee from top to bottom was both helpful and willing to help! The company treats its employees well and because of that, the employees treat each other well, and that's just good business."

good,"At Humana you provide general information about health insurance products, value and rates to prospective customers over  the telephone ,Use the appropriate interpersonal style and communication methods to gain acceptance of a product, service or idea  from prospects, Humana encourages others to learn, keep closely attuned to the needs of  customers and use this insight for the benefit of the client .I learned to assess clients needs and then build a comprehensive solution. use sales and relationship building skills as well as product expertise to guide the consumer in making an informed decision ,the quality assurance and compliance of humana was wonderfull they went out of the was to provide the best up to date  Product Knowledge education CMS regulations,theymake sure agents are provided with great training . in the Miramar florida location .Hardest part was relocation out of state no call center in houston Tx . The florida Humana DMS was like family and help was always on hand ."
good,"I loved Humana Direct Marketing Sales in Tampa.  The Management was outstanding.  Although you are pushed to do your very best, you are given the tools to do so.  You are on the phones all day talking to Seniors.  I love talking to people and sealing people the correct product based on the customer needs by doing a needs analysis.  You are graded on your calls from start to finish.  How polite you are, if you asked the correct questions, if you sold them what they wanted, if you where ethical.  The good and bad thing about this job is you can be easily fired because of one phone call because you did something on a phone call that Medicare considers to be unethical. No warnings just promoted to customer. You are able to make tons of money because you have a salary, overtime, and commission, with excellent benefits."

good,"At the start of my day, I receive a batch of claims to process, I investigate history and call providers if needed.  This position has really let me flex the analytical side of myself.  Although I work from home, and human contact is minimal (quarterly meetings, etc) I get along great with my superiors and fellow coworkers.  The most difficult part of my job would be the more complex claims with repeat appeal requests, which oddly enough once resolved is the most rewarding aspect."
good,"A very productive day is like this. Received all provider requested documents and complete the credentialing and re credenting process. I learned about the credentialing process, I like the team work action plan with excellent interpersonal communication. The hardest part of my job, Is the provider follow up to complete their missing documents or information. The most enjoyable part of my job the investigation of fraud or malpractice that our provider are in compliance with company policies and also be approved by a credentials committee who individually evaluated each provider file."

good,"As a RN who has worked at large Health Care insurance companies, I feel Humana really does care about their members. I worked as a RN Care manager for North Florida Medicaid and Disease management. This was the first time I worked as a Care manager and I couldn't of had a better experience. My manager and leadership were actively engaged and could jump in and help if I got behind. I worked with the most compassionate and caring nurses who really advocated for their members. I think the only negative was the caseload, for me it wasn't very manageable especially as a new employee, however my management team listened and tried to shift some of my assignment to more experienced case managers. I left because I felt I needed more education on Case Management to become better for this fragile population. I hope one day after achieving additional education I can return to Humana. This company and especially management and leadership really cares about each person and they help us advocate for our members. Keep up the good work Humana!!"

good,"When I came to Humana, I was mostly skilled in providing social services and case management skills - providing direct services to patients, clients, and those living independently in the community.

The culture was nice and there was a different set of backgrounds, so there was the ability to understand that not everybody goes through the same issues as everybody else. There was a caring ability from every employee and everyone treated everyone the same, rather that was a co-worker or handling an employee's issue. The hardest part of the job was not having the best answer all of the time and having to file the steps if someone is to get fired, which you dealt with the manager and not the employee directly. But that is part of the job however. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly environment and the positive attitudes."

I just the positive people make my day and it's always those people that is calling everyday."
good,"Loved working thereSome of these may seem obvious. Enough money, amenable colleagues, and a boss you don’t hate working for are prerequisites for bearable work. The others, however, are trickier. Employees care about organization and management—not just that a company is well-organized, but also the “the image of management and the company in the employee’s mind.” This has to align with competence and personal feelings, which will of course be different for individuals across industries and across age groups.  “It is also an evaluation of the communication in the organization and of management’s efficiency, effectiveness, and concern for employee welfare.”"

We are consultants for those on Medicare. We may or may not be the best choice for the consumer. NEVER are we pushed to make the sale NEVER.  If our product fits the prospect's needs the plans will sell themselves. It is not one size fits all. But when you learn how to properly identify the prospects needs  you will see your sales increase.  Management is fantastic, not perfect, who is????  But they do care. As far as attendance. There are rules. You can only miss so much before they have to let you go. Show me a job where they let you call in all the time...... They could be better with their training for the limited term employees, but this is a new program and they are learning, each year improving.  As far as the product, ALL my family members who are on Medicare are on Humana and no complaints. Again, perfection, NO, but Humana does care and is always working to be better.

good,"Resume contains pertinent information."
good,"I worked as an Insurance Agent selling Humana's medicare products and management and all support staff are fantastic. In my first year as a sales person I earned close to 6 figures and in my second year was well into 6 figures. This is fantastic in the insurance field as it usually takes some time to build your book of business. Humana knows how to treat their agents and the training is top notch. I had not worked in the field prior to Humana, however after I left many companies were scrambling to bring me on board. Working in the medicare products field does limit your ability to prospect a bit as medicare recipients can only sign up for products during a short annual enrollment period (only 2-3 months long). So when you work in these products you earn most of your income in about 3 months. So what you do is work, work, work during that time then you can relax a bit for most of the rest of the year. Cold calling is not allowed so we were trained on how to host seminars and speak publicly. A very impressive company that allowed agents to work from home. My problem was that I couldn't go off duty and it was my problem, not the company, they promote a good work/life balance."
