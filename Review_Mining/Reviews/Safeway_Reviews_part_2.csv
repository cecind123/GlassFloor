It feels really good to be able to go visit and have customers recognize and make good conversation you.
good,"I ended my time here working night crew. I learned how to work as a team and use time wisely. There is always an issue with department managers. I was also the only woman on night crew. Coworkers were ok, not very easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was the verbal harassment from my night crew manager. The most enjoyable part was the freedom and able to be on my own to complete the job on my own."

good,"A typical day has its rush hours and down time hours so to say. The management was for the most part on top of things, well from my end just being cashier I saw it that way, but beings they are management they are busy with their own things as well. Working there I learned that I really enjoy a close nit work or ""family"" place. It was nice to always have very friendly and open coworkers that did all they could for one another. I'd say the most enjoyable part of that job were the people I worked with. Of course you have your up and down moments with customers giving you a difficult time but it made it all just not seem to be a bother as much when you're working with such a great group of people. The hardest part of the job, were the really long down times. Theres only so much cleaning you can do at your register before theres no more to clean. So I guess it was just a bummer at those times when my only position there was running a register because if there were not any customers, your just kind of there once all your down time duties are complete. I always found other things to do or help with in those times."

good,"It can be a great learning experience in customer service, work ethics and working as a team to meet a common goal. Day always start with some type of customer service because there is always a need in the grocery business. Clock in start the day either answering a question for those waiting or began checking early morning commuters. Making sure bags are stocked and carts are. Hardest part of the job was trying to single handedly check out customers without disturbing the one helping hand working in back unless he was urgently needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with customers who had become friends over the years assessing their needs and concern."
good,The work day is pretty simple and easy. It is fun being able to interact with customers and providing excellent customer service.
good,I enjoyed the challenge of creating quality products that customers came back for..i learned a lot about baking that I use and will continue to use..

good,"I worked in three different Safeway delis in three different towns. All were fast paced with great products, great people and great customers."
good,No day was the same as the one before. Safeway was a very professional and up beat company. I learned thats customers are always first and to never stop working. there is always something to bve done.
good,It was a lot of fun being around great employees and loyal customers throughout the week.
good,geat team players understading and have great customer service.
good,I learned so much from my leadership at Safeway. It was a company that places the ultimate importance on Customer Satisfaction; something i agree with 100%!
good,Loved the customers but they were always changing management so It was sometimes hard to understand what was expected from different managers each week. Our store was always training new managers so we never had a true manager at our store. The people I worked with were great and I loved my custmers as well.
good,"There are a lot of oppurtunities for growth, and you meet a lot of friendly people"
good,"This was my first job and I am happy to call it so. This taught me many things about how to be a great employee. Great responsibilities and great results. This was my first experience with a promotion, a reward for a job well done."
good,i liked the social skills and customer service skilss i learned
good,"A typical day is weighing and wrapping meat. The things that I learned was all the different codes for the wrapping machine, opening and closing the meat and seafood depts. Everyone was great to work and learn from. The hardest part ofthe job was the constant lifting of heavy meat trays. The best part was the skills thaty I learned."

good,"Taking care of weekly ads, working with a fun team. Always learning new things."
good,"great benefits, great management team, friendly coworkers"

good,"My co-workers were very friendly and would always be willing to help me when I needed it. They always had me on my toes, which I liked."
good,I started working for Safeway right out of technician school. I learned so many things there such as how many days a Medrol Dose Pak lasts. I enjoyed working there with all the same people because we got to know each others way of working and what they were best at. The customers were great. We would exchange recipes and patterns for making stuffed animals. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with so many insurance issues. But that is part of the job.
good,Great company
good,"A typical day at work would be a fun place to work,what i learned was how to ship&receive,management was nice,co-workers was nice,the hardest part was helping the customers and the enjoyable part was working with the co-workers."
good,I learned so much working for this company and enjoyed every minute of it.
good,"I would have to say that working at a grocery store is much more easy than a restaurant, you don't have alot of stress, and its a calmer atmosphere."
good,"yeah it was ok as far as a corperate setting goes, just don't plan on having alot of free time or free will"
good,very hard work
good,"I was responsible for maintaining the proofing schedule for the Corporate Advertising Department , upkeep and maintenance of the photography database for the creative team as well as negotiated printing schedule with large printing companies. I learned how to use all office equipment, database programs, how the advertising world worked as far as scheduling and creative aspects. The hardest part of the job was that the proofs occasionally came in as late as 11pm and I was required to be available. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenging environment."
good,This gave me a lot of exerience with customer service. I enjoyed the physical work.
good,"I worked in the Bakery department as a bakery clerk. I dealt directly with customers on a day to day basis, while working in a fast paced production environment. I decorated cakes, made dough/baked bread, learned a variety of charts such as production/ordering and basic food safety. I would also make sure all aspects of the bakery were clean and all safety requirements were maintained. The job was detail orientated and I was very organized with my work area. I was awarded three customer service awards."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was building the rapport with the customers. I loved talking to them and asking them about their day and making a friendly conversation with them while processing their orders. I also liked asking them the questions such as would you like car service - although not for all customers (even those who had light bags). I also liked telling them the benefits of signing up for an Air-miles card or for a Safeway club card. I truly believed it was beneficial or else I wouldn't have recommended it. I also liked fund-raising for certain charities such as Muscular Dystrophy because I really feel for those people who can't move their muscles and can't walk! I would personally never like to be in a position where I couldn't walk! So I enthusiastically raised a lot of money and once I was in the top three for raising the most money for that charity!
good,"i liked it because we always kept busy. the employees were great, and had great benifits"
good,was my first job after i was done wit school had a great time with my fellow employees loved helping the customers there.
good,I work on my own time and the company sends me the projects to do during the week and they really help to make Safeway a better store.
good,I got to meet a lot of new people every single day when I was a courtesy clerk and then I got promoted within the store at the Starbucks and I learned how to do everything super quick so I was really efficient in doing everything that was assigned to me.
good,Working at Safeway had been always interesting but I tried my best every time and I didn't not receive help or the hours I was promised so overall it was not great.
good,I really enjoy working inside Safeway because one day I will be making coffee at Starbucks and the next day They will request my help bagging grocery and escorting customers to their car and loading bags in the car for them.
good,I felt disposable in the position I had but it was a great learning experience for me and also work experience. I learned how to work with others. I learned how to utilize my time to get the job done.
good,"A typical day as a fuel clerk is mostly cashiering, and a little sweeping and mopping.  I was alone most of the night, so it was kind of peaceful work."
good,A typical day of work was excellent a lot of nice people didn’t learn to much but they had friendly staff and co-workers the staff were excellent there was no real hard work I enjoyed every minute of it the most enjoyable part of my job was going to work every day and not sitting at home doing nothing
good,At times it get stressful but the hardest part of the job is lifting them heavy chicken boxes and stacking them but I get through the day with a smile
good,"I would come in, meet up with the members of my crew, discuss a plan to follow for the night. Once that was clear, we would begin to pull the merchandise that was delivered to our store out onto the floor and begin to break it down and sort it by aisle. Once the load was broken down we would then take it to each respective aisle, and begin to spot product in front of where it went to making throwing it quickly as easy as possible. Once we were done throwing the load, i would begin ordering product that we need for the following day."
good,Relaxed and nice place to work. Nice managers and very clean and organized. Sometimes the work was too easy but otherwise was fine. Small crew which I liked and beautiful area that the store was located at. Set schedule which I really loved and always accommodated any days off I needed.
good,"Wanted more hours but they have to give them to the senior guy whenever he chooses to work.  Since he used to call in sick I was getting more hours, then when he is back I am getting 1 shift a week."
good,"I started work at 2:30 am sometimes bad weather with snow and ice on the roads. I was done by 6:00 before the store was open. I would sometimes open the service deli and work remaining hours with them. I have stocked shelves, load the liquor cooler. Cut deli meats and mix salads. Set up the cooler and sometimes close the service deli for the evening."
good,A typical day inside of work at a Safeway is filled with drama. There's no better way to put it. I have learned how to manage my employees and seek out there differences in how they work and retain information to manage them fairly within reason. Trying to keep my employees happy as well as the customers can be a challenge at times but I feel like it just takes time. The hardest part of my job would have to be not becoming to invested in the whatever situation is when it doesn't feel the same back... But at the end of the day I enjoy most of my co workers and a lot of the regulars that come in daily! It makes it a little easier to make it through the day.
good,Co-workers were great. I was able to learn new skills. Did training at another larger store. Flexible hours. The store I worked at was very small I wished I could have been in a larger store.
good,"I really enjoyed the job and the environment. I had hoped to continue my employment for many years. But a manager of a different department was promoted to the front end without being properly trained and did not appreciate the methods I had been taught. Overall, the company is great if their management is trained well."
good,Over all I had an amazing time working for Safeway. The management could have used a bit of work but the atmosphere was amazing and the people I worked with were fantastic.
good,Safeway is a very safe place to work at. My co-workers were all very welcoming and nice. Working at Safeway teaches you to have a lot of patience and teaches you customer service.
good,"great place to work with..friendly and courteous co workers. "
good,"all of the employees work really hard because we are always under staffed but its a very good opportunity and very fun to work with people your age , we are very good at taking care of our customers"
good,"I appreciated working for Safeway they have always taken care of me my mother who was a single mother got a job there at fifteen and works there still. It provides a family environment as everyone gets close at Safeway. Safeway made Serving employees enjoyable as it provided first class customer service in return it seems customers respected us for that. I learned to always look for something that needs to be done because if you have nothing to do you didn't do your job right, as there is always something to do.The hardest part of the job was bagging groceries, not that it was hard at all but customers preference can be different each time. I really enjoyed working for a manager who treated us like family. The most enjoyable was getting to know customers and customers getting to know you."
good,It a nice place to work for. But all i can say is without time invested you will not move up to fast. Management is a hit or miss but its union will have your back on that.
good,Meat cutting is a fun job. Learning all aspects of cutting all kinds of meat. It is a fast pace environment which I liked. Working with the public is fun and getting them exactly what they. working with others made the job fun.
good,It was fun  and hard work.  Also made alot of Good friends. I did not mind doing the early morning shift and getting home earlier.  the hardst part is pulling the carts apart when frozen during winter.
good,Customer service is a challenge. Working at Safeway taught me  enormous amounts of job skills. I am able to work under alot of stress.
good,Even a bad day is a good day.  Cutting fruits and veggies non stop is pretty interesting as well as preparing platters. Management was awesome we worked as a team. opening the cut room was a learning experience I learned all the different types of sanitation products used for fruits and veggies. This job was easy if I could do it again I would.
good,"I enjoyed working at safeway because it gave me great customer service skills, and i learned new things. i had great co workers and the managers were nice and helpful."
good,I really enjoy working at safeway. I am surrounded by great people and love working with all the customers. The management is very flexible with peraonal life and try there best to get you your requested time off.
good,Large chain grocery store with a lot of potential. Very customer oriented and family friendly. Almost impossible to get into a full time position.
good,I learned a lot about relating to people and helping people with problems they may have.  I l appreciate the education I got there.
good,"Busy, Stressful, Learned how to handle stressful situations, Management wasn't the best but I've dealt with it and moved forward, My co-workers"
good,"The two most memorable things about working at vons were the friends i'd made and the things i'd learned during my employment. I was a courtesy clerk which meant that i would bag groceries, assist in location of items when asked and on occasion I would take items back that people decided not to buy (called ""go-backs""). "
good,"typical days are most of some kinda of party aspect or maybe i just knew to many co workers outside of the work place."
good,While working at a grocery store we are always busy and sometimes there are not always enough cashiers on the floor. Working under 8 hrs your only able to receive two 15mins break and there have been times that i would clock back in 5 mins early to help my co-worker or would even stay an extra 30mins after my shift to help out.  I honestly can say there hasnt been any hard experience at my job so far. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with so many diferent people.
good,This is a good place to start off if you want to increace your skills and learning in the customer service field and to branch out to other areas
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway, easy commute to and from home. I liked how majority of the employees made you feel comfortable and like I wasn't the new girl. I learned effective cleaning skills, how to work quickly and effectively, also how to complete multiple different tasks in a time limited manor. What I believed to be the hardest part of working at Safeway was not really understanding the schedule changes or how if the schedule did change there was no warning or letting me know.. I really enjoyed all the faces I saw and how much I helped out customers who really needed the assistance and knowing I was actually making a difference to their day."
good,"Job duties were respected and appreciated, Learning about sales and working with merchandise. Being able to learn and product good customer service along with working heavy equipment."
good,"I was the doughnut fryer so I would arrive at 2am. It was interesting work, one day I would make cookies all day and the next I would bake bread and pies. Every day was different. I loved my co-workers, they were very friendly, they were the best part about the job. The hardest part of my job was the schedule, coming in at 2-6 am one day, 10-2pm the next then 2-10am was hard to establish a regular routine."
good,"working night stocker was the first and foremost important thing to do in the food business to get fulltime status, so that's what I did and learned a lot in that time. great place to work for if your looking for long-term this is where its at"
good,"As an all purpose clerk I work several departments: Floral, Produce, Customer Service, File Maintenance, and Checker. The work experience changes depending on the people you work with and the store."
good,The people I worked with were great! Would love to work for the company!
good,"It was very inter active and personable. There was always something to do. I always had to maintain the workplace meaning, keeping the"
good,"always enjoyed going to work at safeway.learned how to be very patient with angry customers when there is a big line.my manager in the deli was not very nice,but i had to deal with it,cause i wanted to keep my job.loved my co-workers,we had lots of fun together.there was no hard part of the job.loved working at safeway,wish i still had my job there"
good,"You wear uniforms so you don't have to wear your own clothing. Start off making sure the trash was empty and hog modules where empty also, if not tell the supervisor that they haven't been emptied yet, Give breaks to the people on my schedule that are on the line at certain times, run the machine while they are on their breaks, keep lots of liquid in your body due to the extreme heat, make sure everyone on my line is doing ok with bathroom breaks and hydration. At end of my shift make sure the trash is empty and if not take it out and that the hog modules have been weighted and emptied before the following shift comes in, do a quick walk threw and analyse the work area to make sure it is safe and clean for the following crew. I turn in my weight log and my break log and clock out."
good,Worked grave yard shift and stocked shelves at a very fast pace. Long hours and hard work.
good,The manager that interviewed me was really nice except they did not want to start me at higher pay even though I have more than 7 years experience in management and cashier and that's not okay even though they give raises in  a couple of months afterwards I still need to take care of my family  just because it's a grocery store doesn't mean that they can do that since everybody wants to work there.
good,"I had worked in ai a sfeway company which is big market including different things, it was a nice place, good area, and there are several team helping each other to provide the best service."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Safeway, but their expectations of me were overwhelming. When they were short on help they expected me to try and pitch in and help out as much as I can and at the same time still keep up my current department responsibilities up as best as I possibly can. It became counter productive when it started to affect my health in the process"
good,"This can be one of the best and one of the worst places to work depending on what dept you're in.  I don't recommend Deli. That was a joke. Customer Service Booth and Floral are amazing though. "
good,I really liked working at vons becasue the employees where great to be around and so where the customers it was really upset when th store closed It was like losing a family
good,"Hours are very inconsistent, but other than that the job and coworkers are great. Diverse group. Would defiantly work there again but only for better pay and better hours."
good,Management did not really focus on team work. Kind of divided atmosphere. The store has a high turn out rate. I did not see managers focused on a high retention rate.
good,"Safeway is a very good and fun relaxed place to work, it is also serious and stressful but it was a good place to work friendly employees and the management know how to do their job, their cashiers need to work a little fast and be kinder towards the customers but overall I liked working for that company."
good,Working in the pharmacy at Safeway taught me many new things about medicine and insurance couples. The management was not the greatest and we were often understaffed.
good,In this job I was able to be crossed trained in many different departments. I was able to have advancement opportunities and as long as the hours were available if you wanted them you could have them. It was a great first job to be able to learn responsibility and the value of good work ethic.
good,Safeway is a great job with great pay and benefits. I dedicated over eleven years working for this company. I never woke up for work hating my job. Safeway has tought me every skill iv ever acquired since i started work there at sixteen years of age.
good,"Great Company, flexible schedule, Safeway is an amazing company, they have allowed me to grow as a person and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a new job, but i don't see it as a permanent job."
good,I learned to manage money and redeem lottery vouchers. I took financial records and managed self-checkout the hardest part of my job was management was very poor.
good,Working here was good for a beginner and showed you how to have good team work and good communication skills. It also teaches you how to work with customers. Some of the hardest part I think is loading peoples shopping bags. The management here works good with times you want or can work at.
good,I was full time but it took a while as full time was hard to get.
good,"Clock in,Check schule then check all departments then restock candy or isles start given breaks then jump on cash register then open doors for delervy drivers then report to customers services desk to do numbers or money orders,sell tobaco products do returns or exchanges then enter the cash office and count and report all money in vaults,etc"
good,I honestly have nothing to say except to get better management in some areas of the store and take care of your employees before it’s already to late.
good,"I went to work and did my job...that's it"
good,I worked part time in the bakery whilst at college and then I was offered a full time job there when I left college. The job was great and I learned how to mix with a variety of people.
good,I would restocked the vegetables and fruits. I also helped a little bit at bakery section with cupcakes and cookies. I decorated cupcakes and cookies. I would put them in trays and sometimes  in containers.
good,"Pleasent work environment most of the time, can get along with just about everyone. Evryone trains and learns from eachother so their are minimal miscommunications."
good,"I enjoy working in the deli, there is always something to do helping customers, cooking, cleaning and stocking. dept manager is always working with you"
good,"Safeway is a good company to work for, if you like past faced work environment. I enjoyed making customers laugh and smile throughout the days working"
good,"Safeway is a good company to work for if you want to work.  It is not a company that will sit well with those that want an easy job where they stand around doing nothing.  Work ethic and a good attitude are rewarded, lack of effort and poor service skills are frowned upon.  It was a wonderful place to work and I am glad for the experience of being there."
good,"Safeway pharmacy at my location was a great place to work but changes in management were an unpleasant experience."
good,"Working as a barista was fun and exciting. Having to push sales on new product gave me more interaction with customers throughout the store. I learned many new skills, from making drinks to handling customers who were highly upset that their drink was made incorrectly. Management seems to care more about their days off then giving days off to those who asked for it. If you would ask for a day off then you would find that your schedule for the next week was cut to short and you lost hours. I enjoyed working their only because of the constant change in people and the safeway employees and manager staff."
good,The workplace would be more workable if management is better.  Not he best place to work if you're in the pharmacy. The pharmacist can get over stress and take it out on their coworkers.
good,"Loved working for Safeway, Started from top to bottum got alot of experience.  Loved the people and surroundings, Will not except me back. I have seven years experience from Safeway."
good,I didn't really enjoy Safeway but I got the job done and that's all that really matters . But I just didn't like they way they treated me personally. But overall Safeway was a good job to have
good,"It was your typical deli job"
good,"early shifts available, good training be the supervisor to help me know the job abd duties that I would be doing, Cross training was given to help learn more about the store and produce a good team building between the departments"
good,I love this safeway and they have a great enviorment the store always clean and friendly and the managment is very good....My work days always went by fast and smooth
good,I found working at Safeway a very fun and interesting environment. The people I worked with were greta and so was management
good,"I enjoyed meeting the public and solving their concerns about day to day purchased and dilemas about products at Safeway.  Moverover, I enjoyed the Team work environment established at Safeway and the team I worked with."
good,"A typical day at work is total labor, cooking, cleaning, sales, helping customers, breaking down loads, sales, and pricing. I have learned pricing, how to order, how to train individuals. Most of my co-workers are pleasant, and friendly. The hardest part of the job is breaking down the loads. I love helping the customers find the products they need and being friendly to them."
good,"Fortunately, the culture of rudeness turned out to be just an affiliation of my bullying relatives. Still, she made the workplace a havoc by taking too long to admit to the manager what she had been doing which lead to the manager not being too serious about preventing the bullying by her or an unusual customer who grasps cashiers' hands without letting go that one must struggle to wrench her hand away. Hence, he was frowned upon, but later settled down which was good to have since we are all working together for the benefit of the work team and business. Aside from this, Safeway can be a good place to start building skills: tactical e.g.register or stocking; multitasking; customer/people skills."
good,The managers went above and beyond and made coming into work every day enjoyable. They have lots of opportunities to advance within the company.
good,I enjoyed working at Safeway. I got along with my co workers.  The management was good.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,I enjoyed working at this business. I had a good supporting cast and the job was fulfilling.  My co-workers were supportive and so was management. I enjoyed my job and I couldn't think of a negative experience.
good,I was pregnant the time that I worked there and the customers and boss was very nice. it was a pleasant place to work. I would of enjoyed going back after having my son .
good,"working at safeway was fun, however they do not hire full time if i could i would apply again in a minute. great management"
good,"I appreciate the way the store is run, everything was usually pretty clean and most of the cashiers were friendly. All I can say about my experience working at Safeway was that I learned a lot about how to and how not to manage a grocery store deli."
good,The Safeway family has severed me well as a patron. Safeway again did me a service by giving seasonal employment. While employed I was giving the opportunity to shine as an individual on exceptional team. Skills that I learned from previous employment were put to use. The experience at Vons was one of the greatest times in my career. I look forward to re-establishing that relationship
good,"If you planning to get easy job and get retired easily you should go and get hire at safe way ,with lots of discounts and other stuff,union and benefits,"
good,Good pay and scheduling.  Very nice management. I enjoy working here very much.    The managers were very nice to me and I get a raise every six months.   I got a big raise after 5 years working for them.
good,"A typical day at work is checking out the customers items while giving wonderful customer service, Providing answers to customers questions on prices, products we may or may not carry. Also by providing the customer with club card rewards and the ben fits of using the club card while shopping at the store for example club card price, gas reward program that a customer will earn while spending a dollar at Safeway which defers from if you shop at Walmart where they have no such program in place. At Safeway we built team effort to insure the customer and the employees experience is one to rave about the mangers consist of many key people which include the store manger, the second manger who has rain but less responsibility as the manger and then behind them would be the the front end mangers and all the department mangers. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what will happen In the day. In my opinion the most enjoyable part the job is the customers. Your Co Workers are a wonderful  group of workers who are there to help and make the customers feel welcomed."
good,"Safeway was the first really big corporation I worked for.  It was a good experience and taught me a lot about work life.  The pay was low, but it was a good experience because I learned what I liked and learned what I didn't like in the workforce."
good,"Completed task/assigmnments in a timely manner"
good,I enjoyed my Co-workers and meeting new people. It is a fun job for a student in high school looking to make a few extra dollars for the weekend.
good,"I was a fill in for most positions, I could work from the front desk to the Starbucks. I mostly worked the floral department. I loved the jobs"
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Safeway is a great company to work for, they offer advancement and extra work hours when needed. The compensation and benefits are not that great for new employees. The management was excellent when I was employed there. They were fair and understanding when family situations arose."
good,"When I chose Safeway as an Employer, My first manager told me Son you can put this in your bank, Safeway will always be here!!!  Wish I had that in writing, because Most people thought it would always be a leader in the Grocery Industry.  I loved working for that company because they treated there Employees with such respect.  This company is where I achieved my work ethic.  I will always miss my friends and customers from those days."
good,I had trouble with the manager joe maguel.I said hi frankenstein on halloween and he fired me to another employee sergio.We always joke with each other. The union did not seem to help me fight for my job.They would not even transfer me to another store.I had perfect attendents.I reported him to the fbi in washington d.C.Thank you...
good,"what i like about safeway is . the are really friendly workers and very friendly to customers. what i learned about working with the department i was working at . i learned how to distress the groceries,  my boss thought me how to work like an assistant manager . like doing the assistant manager work for the deli department.. so many things that i didnt have any experiences that my experiences now its come from safeway . cause of my fast learner that they trust. is they did trust to hand me the assistant worker work .. i enjoy being working extra hours and helping out other department when they short of hand and especially the front cashiers. when it busy they always count on me to be there."
good,"Great company with lots to offer. Communication is not bad, but it is not good. It is very difficult to implement change or get buy-in because of the already strong and stablished culture."
good,"Safeway is a good company to work for, they just don't like to change your job duties. The manager I did have, would steal my knives, and lie about such."
good,"Being a cashier is not an easy job, because people's can be hard to deal with at times. That is why you have to be people friendly."
good,This is a great company to work for. There is a lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,You are there to serve and be the best at it. If your having an off day do not let anyone see it.
good,"yes, i love to being work w teams/ other people and i was countesy clerk doing pretty good job , return foods back and stock some foods,etc.."
good,We start doing scanning costumer's groceries after greetings and bag them in very friendly manner. We offer carry out service if they want some help and finally thank them by their last name. Mostly Safeway costumers are very friendly which we talk a lot during our cashing process. We inspire them for donation for different events too.
good,"I Would Get There Sign & Go To The Gas Station. Get My Drawer With All My Money Count It Make Sure I Have All Of It. The Rest Of The Day Would Be Standing A Cash Register Giving Customers There Gas. When It Was Time To Close I Would Throw the Trashes & Cleaning Up The Gas Station. Put Away Lottery Ticket, Drop My Cash, & Set The Alarm For The Building When I Left. I Learned That I Am A Very Good People Person. My Management Wasnt Bad I Like Him. My Co-Workers Were Really Fun & Helpful. The Hardest Part Of My Job Was When The Computers Stop Working For The gas Pumps. The Thing I Enjoyed The Most Was My Co-Workers & The People I Got To Meet Well Working There."
good,"Safeway was over-all a pretty good company to work for. They saw potential in me and helped me to advance within the company. I appreciate that greatly. Unfortunately, the Union causes them to be forced to cap pay amounts. This makes it impossible to ever earn more than union wage, and becomes very frustrating."
good,"Customer service orders, heavy stocking, using forklift/ cherry-picker for each pallet to extradite items to location of stocking, display merchandise in accordance with company standards, proper presentation of merchandise (facing), sanitation service, other responsibilities consist of price change, inventory control"
good,my coworker were team players and it was a nice environment.
good,This place was a great starter for me as I got to meet a lot of people. Everyone was friendly and kind. If I needed help there was always someone to help me.
good,If you work hard and show up on time the sky is the limitless! If you have children be prepared to sacrifice time since it is retail. Always keep an open ear and accept new ideas and change as it happens frequently. Every Meat Manager is different so just do it their way because it works for them and they are ultimitely responsible.
good,Customer relations Solving problems for customers making sure the customer is always satisfied assisting the checkers with Till balances and Assisting
good,I would recommend this company but for me personally I did not have a good experience I started in the bakery but moved to  Courtesy Clark and that's when I had a bad experience the manager was rude and called me into the office almost everyday

good,It was a very fast paced place to work. It was always busy. That was most likely because it was right off a freeway. It was a small town full of nice regulars .
good,"Wonderful Management team"
good,"Being the lead staff member for the Deli Department,  is an enjoyable experience.  I enjoy working in giving the best service to each and every customer I Tacoma in contact with.  I also understand the importance of setting the right professional example for my co workers to model."
good,"Some responsibilities were to greet customers when entering and leaving the establishment, handle cash, credit or check transactions, issue change receipts, refunds, redeem stamps and coupons. Customer service was my favorite part of the job."
good,nothing bad about the job only negative is having to deal with unruly costumers management is understanding and the jobs are normally intuitive and your fellow employees are normally very nice
good,Safe way was my first experience being a cashier. It made me improve my communication skills and made me a very patient person while dealing with hard customers. I easily was influenced by how we were all a part of a team and my colleagues and I did our best to keep the customers satisfied and happy. Thanks to our great manager
good,Loved working there! Learned and experienced a lot and how to act in certain situations. Taught me a lot about people and how they act. Would of continued working there if the store didnt shut down! Love the environment i was in very friendly!

good,"It has been a really good expirience of starting working in the industry which I am not familiar at all, at the moment I became very knoledgable and confident at the products we are offering. It is one of the busiest location across country, with summer sales aroind 150 000$ in a week of liqour."
good,Fun place to work. Very flexible with hours. Management is very understanding of family or personal issues. Easy to advance in the workplace. Lots of training
good,The work is not hard but some come workers can be lazy which effects the overall team goals. The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and teft from some customers. There is favoritism at the job and it can get to you at times but you just have to keep working hard and hope that gets you far.
good,"Safeway had very good management. their pay is poor, and most department jobs were demeaning. it is only a good place to work as a manager in their different departments, and a job for high school students learning about the work force."
good,"I highly enjoyed my job there. The work was orderly and the management. I did inventory paperwork, stocked and restocked shelves, and was in the process of being trained for the bakery manager position."
good,not a very good place to work for the whole year to be honest. horrible management and terrible hours a; though the employees their are really amazing  people to work with
good,Stocking store helping customers find what there looking for n the store. Busy always work to be done. Great teams members and management team. Love stocking
good,"it's alright. not heaven on earth, but plenty of opportunities to move around, wouldn't say there's tons of room to advance. but they pair fairly so it suffices."
good,"A real good place to work in when I was there but it was short lived for all the wrong reasons and the idiotic behaviour of some ""coworkers"".The People were reeally nice to work with (except for the asst. managers)"
good,"Everyday feels like a constant battle between finishing all my tasks and finishing on time. I'm not allowed overtime, but the amount of work I'm giving is impossible for me to complete in an 8 hour shift, including cleaning and helping customers. Sometimes I end up staying an hour or two later just to finish what I had been doing that day. Which results in leaving behind other products."
good,The only thing I didn't appreciate was I worked 8 days straight with one day off then another 8 days. And I did a 5 person job. I wasn't able to explore out of the departments. Management had favorites.
good,A great place to shop & a even better place to work. Made allot of friends. Some I still see today. I quickly became a favorite. Management & employees.
good,I would have to have help people take out the trash and also I had to learn how to clean up a lot and help guess with the stuff they need help I liked that I go to talk to guess and also show things to them to help sells
good,Really enjoyed the job and the people who worked there. Only problem was their wasn't much more room to advance and i couldn't see it being a career for me.
good,its a great and friendly place . its been a too tough for pharmacy technician as its always busy and contineous work. my all co workers were very good
good,"A typical day at work is to make sure all the customers are happy, make sure the tills are clean, clean everything, make sure everyone takes their breaks"
good,"This job first exposed me to the concept of customer service and it left a lasting impression. While the core parts of the job, stocking/wrapping were tedious, the emphasis the company placed on the customer gave it purpose. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers, making recommendations and at times even offering samples."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of restocking shelves, completing nightly duties such as vendor ends, end caps, restocking coolers, etc. I learned a lot about how stores run. Amazing night management. Workplace can be stressful during rush hours. Once duties are done, very laid back."
good,"Working for Safeway is very simple. Your job is very specific so it is easy to do. Now, if others ask for you to branch out and do something out of the ordinary it's not hard to do. You will have plenty of time and energy to do your job and help others if needed. Even o busy days the job is pretty smooth sailing and can be done rapidly and effectively."
good,"Its a worldwide grocery store, I ran a register to scan product every day, In this job provided friendly, courteous service"
good,"a typical day at Safeway for me involves assisting costumers find items on the shelves (i memorized where everything is) carrying groceries out to their cars, cleaning bad messes in the store and in the parking-lot, dealing with the occasional thief or drunkard. we had alot of older customers i would walk them out to their cars and help them find there keys. on days when there is alot of backstock or a large orders i would help work the stock to the shelf and then organize the backstock."
good,"Come in at 1am prepare donuts to be fried, get muffins,danishes ect for breakfast case each morning by 5 than get few items out like cookies, bread ect each day fresh."
good,"Great place to work really enjoyed helping the Customers also enjoyed meeting a positive team of workers. "
good,"a typical day at safeways was woring 10 hours aday learnt how to use a scanner loading and unloading lorrys,,,it was easy work"
good,"A typical day is clocking in , setting up cash register, reviewing sales ads and immediately cashiering. There is a break every 2 hours providing there are enough employees to handle customers. After break, cashier 2 more hours and go to lunch. After lunch work 2 more hours and take the last break and finish the day. The interaction with the customers and courtesy clerks make the day enjoyable. Managers keep everybody on their toes and give over rides and problem solve when necessary."

good,"working for safeway could become routine but was always fun, different customers plus heaps of regular customers"
good,"Safeway did well by me, but I was tired of shift work.  It was time to move on."
good,"I started as a meat clerk and ended up the assistant store manager of my very own Safeway.  I worked 10-12 hours a day, managing 150 people, 6 different departments. Doing payroll, hiring and firing training and reprimanding."
good,"Great work place, good team we are all about the numbers, and what we can do to be better. what I like best is my clerks they are fun and friendly. Everyday is a new task."
good,object was to get as many people in and out as fast as you can daily without getting yelled at. Busy work made one's day fast. great place to meet people and talk one on one for consultations.
good,"Safeway Ewa Beach is a brand new store with very organized and friendly, but strict management. Although management is strict, they are also flexible. I think this is how most grocery store managements should be though in order to smoothly operate a store."
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway. wonderful co-workers such a good team player environment. wonderful picnics and company gatherings.
good,"It is part of a uniiion, but not the kind of place you wll move up quickly. takes time before you start seeing any real benefit packages, and schedules are constantly changing. Overall though it is a pretty good company to work for, but would not make it a career."
good,"opening up to new people nd places ringing customers, helping  with directions and keying in accurate information for customers."
good,We basically work together as a team that's how works was accurate and done on time we learned from each other with proper bagging keeping the store clean and displays.

good,a typical day at work is very enjoyable don't like how far I travel each day I have great co workers understanding mangement
good,"Friendly, structured, available training at no cost to the employees. Very customer oriented."
good,i enjoyed my 3 years at safeway but it was time to do something new.
good,A typical day at the Cash Register is a very fast pace job.  I learned to enjoy each and every customer as an individual person. The hardest part of this job was to remember all the codes. and the most enjoyable part of the job was a satisfied customer.  Management was very well organized. and helped out when we needed it.
good,"I would work graveyard shifts, and stock merchandise for customers."
good,i learned how to stock.And my co-workers were great.Hardest part of the job was when we were short staffed.
good,Start at 1:30 create work load for the day.assign forklift assignments  to shipping and rec.drivers.One of the things i learned is how to better communcate with customers.Good management team.Loyal and hard working co.workers.Telling my self its time to go home and leaving.I stay around alot of times just to help out.On time delivery.This means our customers are happy and we did the job correctly with no delays.
good,"A typical day at work for me is work non-stop except for the breaks they give me. Everyone is friendly and polite to the customers and coworkers alike. I've learned to keep a temper under water at work, I've learned cleaning things are very fun, and that being on time (no matter how random a schedule is) is very important in Safeway. Management in Safeway is still very mysterious to me. The store manager seems happy but you could never tell. The job is unpredictable. The coworkers are friendly, sometimes more so than my own friends. Hahaha! The hardest part of the job is when you accidentally miss a sweep because you were so busy that hour, or when customers argue about a price of product and demand to see a manager, or when your own teammates give you trouble. But I enjoy seeing customers smile when I know I gave them a good day, they always smile back when I smile."
good,"Safeway is a good company to work for, but the long hours made it difficult to have a personal life.  People were generally easy to get along with. Must have a strong desire to work with the public."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is having customers saying how well of a good job your doing.
good,"I have worked here for a little over two years and I do love my job. A typical day is checking e-mail, filling out the daily paperwork to ensure my kiosk is running and abiding by all Starbucks standards, and making drinks and associating with my wonderful customers. I have a great team of 3 co-workers who are on top of it and team players. I absolutely love the connection and bond I have made with my customers and my 'regulars' that make my day worth working. Even on those some what stressful days helping customers and talking with them makes my job worth it all at the end of the day. I have worked at about 5 different locations and the store I have been at now for a year is just about my favorite. Working at the Del Mar store I am apart of is a very tight-nit family community store and I enjoy being apart of that."
good,"Every day is greeted with a friendly hello from fellow staff and regular customers. Management is understanding and easy to get along with. Overall, a very enjoyable experience"
good,"There were a lot of things to do, and everyone including management worked hard to get them done. I saw a lot of customers and most of the time they were regulars in the store so we were able to call them by name. "
good,I learned a lot while working at Safeway. I was given the chance to run the store on occasion and work in other departments.  
good,"Very good job security, advancement could get a little political."
good,"I made all baked products, and displayed for the consumers to purchase"
good,"Work with Safeway for my summer 2012 class break. It was fun and productive on the field. Great co-workers and bosses who really are big on safety and your well-being. I've learned a lot about working around sandblasting equipment and proper way of washing a pot. Their really was not a hard part of the job, but if I had to pick, it would be looking out for hazards that may ruin someones day. Most of all, keeping up with my co-worker's during lunch time would be the most thing I enjoyed of all."
good,Big Box grocery store with union which I believe restricts associates
good,friendly staff and management team. great customers. goodpay and benifits
good,"Safeway is a great place to excel and become a manager, as long as you have the right attitude and motivation you can go far. Safeway has taught me time management, customer service, sales, merchandising and definitely multi-tasking."
good,"I loved Interacting With Customers,And Providing Excellent Customer Service"
good,"I loved to go to work eack day because there would be almost always new challenges. I learned that if you put your mind to the task at hand you could accomplish anything. I had a very good rapport with most lines of managment. The hardest thing about my job was to see some one fail, But the best thing was to see so many succeed."
good,Love the whole team. Excellent manager and knows what he doing.
good,A typical day at work.well there is isnt that is why I enoy working in so many different departments.I love the changllend of learning new things and meeting new pepole.I love helping pepole the hardest thing i have even had to endure was not being able to work everday.Im a very pepole person and dont mind starting a coversation.The most joyable thing at my job is that there is always somthing new you have to learn.
good,I enjoyed all of my co-workers I wanted to be the worker I could be and I believe I did just that. I liked everyone there it was laid back and they had alot to offer me such as school wise. really good and kind hearted people to work with.
good,"I was happy working at Safeway , loved the customers and atmosphere in Safeway. Relaxing environment and management was great. You always have the odd issue with how management does things but it was not serious."
good,I have enjoyed my time  working in this retail company. I am just ready to move forward and make more money. I have topped out at journey man and life has more demands than the pay I currently receive.  I also would like to offer more of my skills to a company for which my current position does not require.
good,The managers and coworkers are what make you want to show up to work everyday. They treat you like family and they care about your family at home. The company of Albertsons itself though they work you and you get paid nothing for your time.
good,I loved working at the starbucks inside safeway it was one ok f my favorite jobs. I miss it most the time. Had great communication and great bosses to guid and train you
good,Love my jod love the people  good  place to work  They are very open and very flexible with schedules and your school with your children For standing if you had a can of the doctors and we're running late
good,I learned a lot about different departments. Had some great co-workers. Wanted to stay but with stores closing there was not guaranteed job security. The customers were great and it was say to build relationships with them. Especially enjoyed being a cashier over other departments
good,working in livermore store is strssful but any other location fun and help ful no one bother you if you work any other location but livermore sorry have bad experience in my life after 22 years working in pharmacy most of the night i cry after work till i get home
good,"I learned alot in my year at Safeway. Starting at courtesy clerk and working my way up to Nightstock/Cashier at the age of 19 was a great achievement in my life. I learned to challenge myself to do better everyday and keep working hard, because it will always pay off."
good,Management was horrible they did whatver they wanted this is not a job for you if you are in school senority rules . so they dont really care for their emplyees
good,Met some great people and furthered my skills and knowledge in a warehouse environment. Management was very helpful in increasing my skill set and helped with other opportunities moving up
good,i arrived at work at 5 am shoveled the frozen ice into the seafood case then set up all the fresh seafood stocked freezers and shelves assisted customers

good,"Would rather not say I love the people I work with we are very good friends and look forward to seeing them, I am not going to say anything bad about this company and I am still employed by this company"
good,Safeway was a great company to work for. The only downside was I did not get enough hours. However the management was great and the coworkers we very friendly.
good,"Days working at Safeway were very unpredictable. One minute your trying to find extra things to do because nobody's shopping. Than out of no where a storm of customers come flying threw and thats when it gets cracking. Zooming through customers to get them on there way was very exciting and it made the time go by a lot faster. I worked at a Safeway in Burns, Or a small little town where the only competition was small local grocery store."
good,"Good management, union so the pay was good. This was years ago so I do not know what it is like now. We were a very busy store and so the time went by fast."
good,"Loved working there, started off getting great hours and would get less week after week. It wasn't one of those this guy is bad let reduce hours so they quit, I had plenty of great complements from upper management. The problem was they over hired, instead of giving out more hours to current employees. Other than that Safeway was amazing."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is the schedule which there is no weekend work, and I learned about the work place is the people are enjoyable to work with."
good,"Good customers service,different positions, growth in the company.weekly pay best benefits. best hours to work. can relocate. Good people to work with."
good,"- Gets bust at certain hours of the day. "
good,"I was a temp at Safeway for 18 months. I hoped the position would become permanent however, there was a hold on new jobs there."
good,Overall working at Safeway is at a fast paste i did not have many challenges with customers. Although i dealt with different personalities and attitudes with customers i always put customers first and got the job done.
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway . Their food selection is top quality always pleasing to the shopper. I learned and was taught to administer World class service , quality food production, the best safety and sanitation guidelines. I would love to work for Safeway again . Its just a Great company."
good,Helping Customers and teamwork are an everyday thing. At Safeway I learnt how to be a better employee. And everyone carried their workload responsibly.
good,"The workers are tenured and the job culture is similar to a family.  A typical day at work can be best described as ""busy"". You learn alot about the different ways people communicate. There is so much going on in a day, if you proactively engage with the work, you will become a customer service beast. Management varied by the store manager's approach, my management staff was phenomenal with creating a great atmosphere that made you want to go to work. The hardest part of the job is to consistently work at a high level without burning out, you got to pace yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely the workers and growing with the store community."
good,"Safeway is a neighborhood store, everyone knows everyone. I loved the people i worked with and gained a lot of friendships there as well. They work really well with school hours as well."
good,Work wa always stress free once you got the hang of where things were located in the store. It was self taught but other team members could help out. Very organized. Quiet.
good,Very hard work but it paid very well and with great benefits. Some of the management need to learn how to manage better but some were also very well balanced.stressful but worth the pay
good,"I enjoyed working for Safeway, the associates became like family under the right management, it was very hard to leave."
good,Safeway is a great job that’s provides great opportunity. It is fast paced as well as a higher learning curve. Learn to work well with customers as well as coworkers. Great first job.
good,"There was never nothing to do. If you weren't doing something, then you weren't doing your job. I loved working with the public.  Angry or Nice, I was able to deal with them in a professional manner and never required to retrieve anyone above me. The work place was fun as long as you did what you were supposed to. The hardest part of the job was staying away from gossip of other employees and just minding my own business."
good,Ok place to work fun and fast paced never a dull moment this is a good place fot customer service and working around people also many diffrent things can do
good,"Was a good company to work for. Manager and coworkers were great to work with. Busy most of the time, but that made the time go by fast. Only left job as I was pregnant and it was too hard to stand for long periods of time."
good,Was only part time had no benefits and no stat pay for my position. Was working towards getting full time hours but is hard in a union environment. Great company
good,"My 2 years at Safeway has been fun. I've met a lot of great people and customers! Sometimes it is stressful. Safeway is a money hungry company so sometimes they try to cut your hours, or gove your department less hours to work with so that part becomes a little hard."
good,"Learned a lot"
good,"At Safeway, I learned how to communicate comfortably with the customers, approach customers and suggest products that we carried.  I enjoyed the busy atmosphere. There was always something that could be done, so there were no dull moments here.  The management was helpful and did a great job at caring her load of work duties and guiding her team of workers.  I loved the team that I worked with, and learned a lot working here. I gained confidence with the customer communication and pushed myself to learn as much as possible there. The hardest part of this job was the varied hours.  I worked all shifts because there were seniority above me who got first choice on their picks of the schedule, which usually left me the person in between.. I worked all of the shifts as needed but the schedule was never consistent.  Over time this became an issue for me. My health decreases tremendously and I suffered with insomnia and depression after leaving this job."
good,Most Safeways i've been to are pretty cool. Everyone one just wants to get things done and have a decent time doing it. When disputes happen it is due to miscommunication and is resolved quickly.
good,The workplace is totally different from my other jobs that I have attend. Safeway gives lots benefits to work around your schedule and never give a negative feedback at work and many more.
good,Hours are horrible. when i worked there the other employees were very kind and helpful management was outstanding. i just didn't agree with the scheduling.
good,"Contract Assignment.  Excellent company to work for.  The work was  challenging and rewarding.  I made a few unsuccessful attempts to secure a full time permanent position."
good,"I think as a collage student, this was a good place to work because they have very flexible hours and this place was very close to my house, and it helped me pay for my collage."
good,Very adaptable position. Easy going work atmosphere but you must be hard working. Deadlines are extremely important. Great training by management. Fun atmosphere
good,"very friendly staff members to work with"
good,"I enjoyed going into Safeway/Vons everyday typically because as soon as you walked into the doors you had a task to do but everyone still managed to make time to have a great relationship with our team. I learned how to adapt to working with different groups of people which helped me at Chase. I was taught the importance of verifying the points of interest when negotiating a negotiable item when I was a Cashier. The hardest part of my job was doing price changes. At the same time it was very enjoyable doing it with our team. The hours were hard if I had to choose. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the professionalism I learned as a teenager and the staff I worked with."
good,I am/was very introverted.  They had confidence in me. And gave me the opportunity to become a cashier from a courtesy clerk. Great management. Loved the people I worked with.
good,I worked there for 5 years in 2 different stores.  I was 18 and started as a bag boy and was promoted up really quick.  At the end of my 5 years i was the Frozen Manager in the Washougal store.  I had 5 different titles in my 5 years and I will never forget the time while i was at Safeway.
good,A typical day at work consisted of printing out prescriptions and filling them. Maintaining stock and organizing workplace and medicine cabinets. I took some phone calls and learned the computer system. The management was very friendly and extremely willing to teach. They were fun and very professional. The hardest part of the job was learning their computer system in the pharmacy. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping management get tasks completed and extending friendly customer service to others.
good,"Worked both as a crew member and independently"
good,"Vons ( Safeway) teaches great skill and advancement lessons. I worked in every possible area of the multiple stores I was employed at. Pay was very very low especially for my position of ""Customer Service/GM/ Bookeeper) where I trained new Bookeepers and traveled to close or far stores to do so (pay was not varied for this). As well a working in and helping in every aspect of the store in sync with the Manager and corporate. Wonderful company and so happy i started there, pay was a large disgrace however."
good,"The company is very good, and truly creates a safeway family. i did enjoy working here while in school, but the work is hard because I was in the Deli department and worked at least 9 hours a day, which got in the way of my school."
good,"Great opportunity to advance, ability to train and develop others, great compensation, and bonuses, a lot of hours, lots of new initiatives daily,"
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway, I was able to get back on my feet after a couple young dumb mistakes.  I would definitely work at Safeway again if I needed to."
good,"I was on my feet, moving, helping customers, keeping the store clean, stocking shelves, bagging groceries, and etc.  Although the pay was low, with no benefits, and the schedule was all over the place, it was a great experience overall."
good,"As a cake decorator, everyday is a little bit different. Hours vary everyday. First thing when you clock in (usually early morning), you have to take inventory of the refrigerated displays and table displays to see what needs to be filled for the day. Then, you get started right away by decorating cakes and pastries that need to be replaced in the displays. I learned all of the basic techniques to decorate many different cakes and pastries within a few days of starting. My co-workers were awesome and patient with me while I adjusted to a completely new working environment. Organizing and cleaning the work space provided was a must through out the day. The hardest part of the job was taking out the heavy trash at the end of the day. It's definitely a two person job. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably when a customer said they liked the finished product you made."
good,Safeway is a good job to have. I was promoted and given 2 raises one being a 6 dallar raise within 2 months of working with the company.
good,"I really enjoy working for Safeway, you start off above minimum wadge which is nice, the training is great and the job itself is vrey fun if you enjoy interacting with people! However they canot provide newer employees with enough hours (only 10-15 a week) so a lot of students cant afford to only have the one job!"
good,It is a great place to work. It can be very busy at times and other times very slow in the slow times there is a lot of cleaning and stocking to be done. I love the atmosphere and i love working with my co-workers as well as the customers that enter our store. There is always new things to learn on the job. when a till stops working to  wrongly entered price amounts.
good,I can honestly say is I enjoy walking into work knowing I can start my day in a good and end my day in a good and positive manner. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the sales that we get every week. Most enjoyable part of the day to see our customer come to my register with a smile after having to get their groceries and know that their going to get the best customers service ever. To see them leave with a smile makes my day.
good,"I would work Part-time at safeway. I would go to the front-end of the cashier, and help bag there needs,product,food, would ask if any of them needed help to there car with the bags. I would check the bottle return bins, if they were full, I would get an employee to help put them in the back and dump them in the big bins. I would face product and organize the shelves, fill the milk, mop the floor if needed, stocked eggs, stocked product if needed."

good,Safeway schedules are never the same for most employees. You won't know your schedule until they post it. Most stores everyone gets along. Some departments are harder than others. They celebrate a job well done with pizza but if you aren't scheduled for that day then you have to come in on your day off.

good,Safeway is great place to work as long as you have a good manager. You do a lot because when it is slow they all ask you to do other tasks to help out.  All days are good until you have a bad customer or a problem with a co  worker.  otherwise a great place.

good,My experience at Safeway was fairly great. I was trained fast and got along with all the workers i saw everyday. Everyone is super friendly and always willing to assist coworkers and customers. The management know what they are doing and are always around. I have nothing bad to say about Safeway. I really enjoyed my time there.
good,Fast paced environment. Have to be able to provide quality customer service in many different situations. Must deal with raw meat and poultry on a daily.

Sometimes I was treated rudely by a coworker because I just made a mistake and I had only been working there for a month... The women that hired me was great and over all the nicest person I worked with. I only worked there for almost 2 months and quit because I had to go back to school. I would be pushing 5-10 carts at a time in all black in 100 degree heat or more. I believe I should have been paid more by the hour then I was being.
good,Working at Safeway is typically busy every day. Weekends are the most craziest there at the store. I learned that you can't be impatient with the customers even though they may do any little thing to make you mad. You always have to keep a smile on your face. The hardest let about the job is even if your coworkers don't complete the task you still have to handle your business. The enjoyable part is that you gain a family. Most coworkers are always there for you and is there to push you to succeed.
good,If this is your first job it can be overwhelming but its easy to learn on the job. regular 8 hour shifts and will have to get use to being around hot appliances and sharp tools. Besides some unruly customers the job is pretty easy to get the hang of.
good,safeway isn't like any other grocery store. Working here requires a minimum of good people skills and the will to work with others. If you don't have any of those you can still work here but it won't be as fun
good,"I had great and amazing coworkers who were willing to help me and customers. I would definitely like to work there again, if not I will keep shopping there, can't beat prices."

good,"My typical day began early, routine, rarely changing environment until a seasonal change occurs which seems to create momentary confusion and disrupts the normal organization into temporary mayhem. I learned about the profits and losses incurred in the retail environment. Management can present themselves in different roles depending on the individual. My co-workers can range from those that come for an hourly paycheck and others who try to make a difference and feel their job is a career. The hardest part of the job was being in the environmental elements of winter and spring because of the lack of amenities available in a warehouse environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with the different vendors and customers of the store and the help and advise I was able to provide to my fellow associates."

Management is great, co-workers are friendly and awesome, the hardest part of my day is hearing heartfelt stories from customers.  I love my job, great place to work."
good,An average day was communicating with customers and providing goods for tender in standard transactions. Safeway required a tidy and friendly environment that could solve problems easy and quickly.
good,Hard work but worth it. Full time hours if you show yourself capable. There's nothing wrong with working fast food. I would do it again in a heartbeat.
good,"The Safeway where I worked was well managed. Managers were friendly and constructive in their comments about how to improve the store.

good,"Safeway/Vons is a good place to work at, the overall experience there was good, met awesome people and learned alot. Gained a great deal of customer service experience.

good,"My typical day consisted of getting my pick order from my headset, getting a pallet jack, a pallet and beginning the pick. When I finished that I would wrap it up, put a sticker on it and then deliver it to the "
good,"My first job was a courtesy clerk.  This mean I would ask any customers who looked like their were having troubles if they needed assistance.  This was one of my frist lessons in being respectful.  As a young man, it was important for me to learn how far a ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" can get you in the eyes of a more experienced individual.  Many of my co-workers were of the same age as myself, and this was one of my most enjoyable jobs, even though it was only part time.  We learned to work together to make sure all of our daily goals were met, in order to be prepared to relax after a long day or night's work."
good,"Work on cash till, stock shelves and beer cooler, sale items, ect."
good,I enjoyed working for Safeway. People are friendly. Full of willingness to help and educate co workers to learn and grow within the company.

good,"I learned how to make the food, that gets sold in the deli. I normally spend my day making food and assisting customers. My co-workers and managers work great as a team. There is a little bit of an organization problem but other than that it is an enjoyable job."
good,"Enjoyed going to work, everyone worked together as a team. Enjoyed working with members of the public. I learned to delegate, how to get the best out of my working day and how to work on my own as well as part of a team."
good,"A lot of customer service."
good,"Everything about the job is just right, no complaints really. Opportunity to advance was there when given a chance to. Compensation was a little bad. Benefits are great, management and employees were fun. Definitely a good company to work for."
good,"The average day for the past little while started at 4A.M. with ordering products to come in for the next day of work. Then I went and removed any expired product from the shelf and restocked them with new product. I then finished the day with another order."
good,"Looked forward to going to work at Safeway was always a good place to be."
good,My manager is awesome and will push you out of your comfort zone to achieve great things.
good,"My main job at the start of working a Safeway was  stacking shelves and rotating stock, sometimes going on the till when it was asked of me. Kids Own department was great fun, I loved putting out colourful stock and displaying it in a way that caught customers eyes and made them want to buy it. It was nice to see new styles come in and how quickly customers bought it, the hardest part of my job was the late nights when we did stock take during the early hours."
good,Most of the time it was easy to get through a day. The customers and the other employees made it so much better. Management was very good there and being able to help other people find what they were looking for made me feel good to help.
good,"Great location in Phoenix.  Easy commute (for Phoenix).  Nice facility, dining facility.  Strong management team.  "
good,"Safeway overall is a great place to work. The organization offeres a wealth of resources for job and personal development, tuition reimbursement programs, diversity leadership groups,  state of the art health facility at the Centerpoint Cafe Campus in Pleasanton which contains a full service gym that offers a array of class and high end workout equipment to a brand new full service upscale doctors clinic that offers the same services you could recieve at a primary care office. A typical day at Safeway consist of business attire dress, daily meetings, presentations and data analysis. What I've learned in my current role is time and project managament. Also, being comfertable with making recommendations to senior management to help improve process effeciencies. My co-workers are great to work with. I get along with everyone I come in contact with even those with difficult personalities. The hardest part of my job are the techonological skills that are needed to help comb through massive amounts of data and also sometimes there are short turn around times on projects that require a lot of analysis to  provide a recommendation. The most enjoyable part of my job is looking for ways to improve work processes for the department and  also looking for opportunities for the organization to increase sales and profits."
good,Fast paced grocery store.  Good benefits and people.  I really enjoyed working there just needed more hours than they could give me
good,"Was able to learn all areas of the store, meet great customers and good job advancement within the company"

good,Most of the management was very understanding and willing to help in anyway possible. Everything always went smoothly and work was always enjoyable.
good,typoical day is going in starting at your station making sure all is sterile. having fun with customers and helping them with what they need. Coworkers and management was awesome no complaints. there is no hardest part of job. enjoyable part was just meeting new customers and old customers.
good,"On a typical day at work at Safeway I would've either cut meat, assisted customers, restocking merchandise, cooking, make salads and sandwiches, and prepared food for the next day or all of that in one day. I learned so much working at safeway about food safety, customer service, cooking, proper cash handeling and working as part as a team. I had a great team of coworkers behind me, working with me and ready to help me out whenever i needed it, which I'd say was the best part of the job. The harder part of the job was difficult customers and sometimes even getting yelled at."
good,"Very busy on most days filling prescriptions, data entry, refilling vials, customer service, inventory count. The days went by fast and most of the time I was having friendly conversations with repeat customers, and getting to know the new customers. My co-workers were great to work with, and talk with. I still maintain a friendship with all of them. The hardest part of my day was having to explain to customers declined insurance or no call backs from doctors. The most enjoyable part was ensuring the customers walked away happy, understood their medications, and are sure to come back again."
good,"Typical day started with the morning shift. I loved this shift because it was the start of a brand new day, and I got to make it a little more special for our first customers of the day. I enjoyed prepping everything and making sure everything was just so. I learned how to connect with the customer and make them feel appreciated, which in turn would make them want to come back. I think one of my major strengths that our customers appreciated was my duty to keep things neat and tidy. There was a few issues with a few co-workers, but that would only be expected, especially with the age difference for the majority of us."
good,"busy, fun, outgoing place to work, management were easy to get along with, worked with a lot of cloths and retail. co-workers were easy to work with."
good,"getiing the supplys for the or week so customers could have what they wanted to drimk or snak on, liked working for this company the customers where the best part of the day."
good,Worked while was in college learned all phases of retail grocery store co workers were great.Hardest part was the hours were always different.
good,"Safeway is a wonderful job opportunities, with excellent pay and amazing people to service, and work with. This position allows you to explore various departments without leaving your current position. Not one day is the same but every day is exciting with the new people you get to meet each day and your favorite shopper who stop by just to say hi."
good,"Mainly focus on my daily tasks first, then thoughtout the day continue to make sure I accomplish the things on my work agenda. From working in customer service I've definantely learned to be more paitent with people and it has allowed me to be more aware of myself and in the process Ive become a more well rounded indavidual. Out of all the people Ive ever worked with I dont honestly think I can say Ive ever had a really serious fallingout with any one of them and of the ones Ive managed I was alwasy soflty satisfied. A job is neverfullfilling unless you choose something that you love and I definately love working with people which alwasy makes the day go by alot faster so my job is never hard at all."
good,"Perfect Co.to learn the in&of retail grocery versatile in training Diff.Depts very Productive,priorities a Cust Serv,CustSatisfaction Qualityof product.100%satisfaction guaranty"

good,"Safeway is a very nice place to work. Managers, coworkers and people are so nice, friendly and caring. The only reason I had to leave Safeway was because they don’t offer any full time position."
good,"Definitely loved working here, really felt like a family environment! Work would always have me smiling in one way or another. The management and staff of the whole store is almost unmatched with friendliness, great customer service, and a happy attitude. I will miss working here because safeway offers their employees 5-10% off of your purchase with you club card, they are recognized by the union, and they offer competitive pay  in conclusion, working for safeway was amazing"

good,"The store has very friendly managers, polite staff, and they continue to work together to provide a good work environment for coworkers and an excellent shopping experience for customers."
good,"Having spent 17 years with Safeway, I was able to see many different side of the business. Safeway has gone through many drastic changes since I have been an employee, but for the most part, I am glad to have been part of the evolution of the company."
good,I worked mid-day to closing shifts. I worked the lunch and dinner rushes and then closed the deli by myself or one other person most nights. Lots of work for very little reward. You got in trouble even after closing for wearing headphones. Store management for sexist and rude to female employees. My co-workers were great and we became friends outside of work. Overall enjoyed working for the company.
good,"I was only with Safeway for one year.  Not because of Safeway but because I was following a dream.  Safeway was a wonderful place to work. Nice people. Positive environment. Great facilities."
good,"Fun and hard working professional guys, knew what their job was and made sure it got done in s timely fashion , fun places and great sites of things to see in the most of working hard but smart"
good,I would help out with customers to their vehicles if they needed it. Clean up messes that need to be picked up and wiped down. Helping customers find the items that they need. It is a hard job because your working with a lot of customers. I’ve learned that helping out others would be good to be there for them.
good,Working for Safeway was a good experience for me calm and sometimes stressful but that happens in this type of business. There were a lot promotions available.

good,"Seniority observed. Training included.  Advancement.  And great Prescription and Dental plans.  Pension, ATO's (accumulated time off), paid vacations and sick day bank"
good,This job was okay.  Not my cup of tea.  I did not enjoy the slow paced position in the middle of the night.  The hours were okay but not much to do.  I stocked shelves and made the presentation good.  This was definately not enough hours for the travel I had to do to get there.
good,"Learned a lot about retail business, management and a lot of growing opportunities within the company it’s a fast paced all year round work experience"
good,"It's union, you get union benefits, and union breaks, working on a union is actually beneficial to most people. Most of the managers were willing to work with you."
good,Spent 15 years with Safeway and I enjoyed my time with them I moved on only because I was seeking specific needs which were unavailable in a retail grocery environment. Culture is great and my fellow colleagues and customers were the strong point of my career with them. Highly recommend them for someone looking to build a career.
good,start day by walking the store finding out the needs of the store and then act the make sure the problem was solved. Worked with employees on making sure the work environment was a fun and safe place to work.
good,fun nice to work there would really tell people about this job you get to meet a lot of people  and helping customers is really fun the hardest thing was the dumping the oil stocking was pretty easy  the work place culture is great some managers are great at least the ones i met

good,Working for Safeway was a learning experience due to it was my first job at 17 and taught me how to talk to people and communicate with others. Everyone is extremely attentive and outgoing.
good,Safeway Inc was an excellent company while I was there. My position was eliminated when the Albertsons investment group took over Safeway and moved its headquarters to Idaho. Not sure how it is now under new ownership.
good,"During my time at Safeway, I had made many friends and had many great opportunities. I was a shy individual and had grown over time. Starting off as a courtesy clerk was fast paced but relaxed. Talking to the customers most of the time was very fun and laid back. Being in the bakery though was mostly always fast paced but very easy. Although it is very repetitive, the coworkers keep the environment light and friendly."
good,"Honestly, I wish I had stayed there. There is a lot of room for advancement.  I was young and too immature to realize it.  My co-workers were nice.  I enjoyed helping the customers."
good,Safeway gave me the opportunity to advance and learn many jobs. I have held many job titles at Safeway but the main focus is always customer satisfaction.
good,Overall the work place was easy to learn but it was also a little difficult when it came to the busy days where you'll have double the work but yet no time to finish it.
good,"Come in say hello's count my Till, look at my schedule after i clocked in. Spoke to the Manager on Schedule and found out what was expected of me throughout my day! And did it joyfully>"
good,Safeway has superior customer service. Strong communication and professionalism to maintain an effective work environment for all employees. Flexible scheduling and competitive pay.
good,"I moved with a leave of absence and transfer to store near my new home and was not accepted with my transfer.  It has been months with no work available and being told they will not hire accept my transfer.  We are not hiring transfers.  I am being denied unemployment due to the fact I am still working, but was told that I quit.  According to the work phone and hr department, I am active on leave.  I was disqualified from unemployment and now on appeal.  I have been struggling to pay bills and put food on my family table or get gas to look for work."
good,"My story at Safeway started as a checker and within three months I worked my way to the closing manager of the entire store. I worked really hard, stayed longer hours than anyone else and went out of my way to make sure that the store was working at full capacity and it paid off. Management rewarded me with a promotion and I left on goods terms with no regrets."
good,Working here was very simple and easy. There are a lot of amiable people who work there and make the work environment less stressful and tense than other work settings. Everyone definitely works with a team mindset and always ensures to help a fellow co-worker if they need assistance.
good,Extremely high stress job with high expectations. Aimed at provided world class customer service while also providing a great shopping experience for customers.
good,"Working in the corporate office at Safeway was a daily delight. Enjoyed the people and atmosphere. "
good,"The job was nice in that the hours were consistent, but it was too far from home and that caused me to be late more often than  I should have been. Also, sometimes it could get really slow and that made work boring, I enjoy a more fast paced environment."
good,"Overall, I have gained the experience what customers truly want from a retail store. As a Clerk in Charge, I learned how to balance out conflicts between the employees, and how to provide better customer service by working here at Safeway."
good,It was a good job but i need to make more than ten dollars an hour to live. I was easy anyone could do it you just put stuff on shelves all night long. and take the expired stuff off.
good,"Safeway has an excellent culture of employees first and fair treatment. "
good,I loved working at Safeway I enjoyed talking with the customers and feeling like we were a team. I'd enjoy working there again I think my co-workers made it enjoyable too.

The downer is you can get relocated to another store without giving you much notice, next day your somewhere else. And that's why I left was transfered 4 times"
good,"Safeway was my first job, I was a bagger. I helped customers find specific products, helped load and unload groceries, clean the store and checkstands and clear up carts from the parking lot. My manager was really nice as was my supervisor. The hardest part of the job wasn't really hard it was just annoying and that was gathering carts in the rain. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid every week and meeting nice people."
good,If you are looking for a career job with benefits and advancement then Safeway is a great place to work. The hours are fixed but that makes for consistent bi-weekly pay and job security.

good,great company to work for. Friendly employees. Benefits are amazing. Relocated for my husbands job or would have stayed. Management very supportive . .
good,Almost everyone knows about Safeway as a company and knows that it has been bought out so if you do decide to work for Safeway make sure it is at a store that they do not plan on closing
good,Typical work day depended on what time your shift started so I'd come in I would give the employee that came to work early in the day there lunch break I would work the sandwich bar make sandwiches to order then I would go to help out where ever I was needed I really liked the job it was fun the people I worked with were so awesome and cool. What I learned was a lot I learned a so much about deli food and all food safety how to use a meat slicer  how the scale worked to weigh out deli meats and cheeses. the hardest part of the job was the closing at times the trash run would be kind of hard especially 5 dollar Fridays which I liked it would be heavy and only one closing it was heavy but I managed I also learned a little about different departments like the bakery the floral department I loved the people I worked with I loved the customers especially my regulars they always made me feel appreciated
good,Installing new scales and upgrading the stores major technology. I worked as a temp 4 days a week for 10 hour shifts. Changes many registers and also time clocks at each store

good,I enjoy working as part of the deli team. Our manager is great and really cares about her employees. It is a place where you constantly learn new skills and it is never boring. I enjoy working with all of my co-workers and the customers are usually patient and understanding  when we have a rush at lunch or dinner time.

good,"It was definitely an interesting experience while I was in high school."
good,"It is a back-breaking, manual labor job. It is not an easy place to work by any means. There are days with mandatory overtime. You can end up working 11 hour days and not know that that's going to be the case until an hour before you're scheduled to be off. That being said, you are compensated very well with the pay and benefits for your hard work. (Another bonus is the overtime. Any more than 40 hours is overtime. However, if you work only one day, but work 10 hours in that day, you get two hours of overtime pay.)"
good,Safeway is a well founded industry. Co-workers are respectful and welcoming. The level of activity is quite high there is never a dull moment. The tasks that were given to me were easy to perform and easy to learn.
good,worked as a bookkeeper/Deli Clerk/Cashier/Stalker An all around All purpose clerk! loved this job loved the days and loved all the regular customers. Working for safeway was always a good day.

good,"A typical work day at Safeway was always an interesting and productive one. Being employed there for a year taught me a whole lot. I was able to better my customer service skills, better my work ethic, and also learn whats it was like to be promoted for doing my job so well. Management there was good, but there's always room for improvement. The hardest part about working at Safeway was knowing how to put my emotions aside and still be off great service to a customer and the most enjoyable part about the job was the environment, even though everyday wasn't perfect I never really had a bad day."
good,"Safewaybwas a good place to work. Some of the managers get a ""better than thou"" attitude, but for the moat part, i loved it. I worked in every department of the store."
good,"Bagged groceries for customers, returned shopping carts from parking lot to store, provided outstanding customer service to shoppers, cleaned areas as necessary."
good,Co-workers are all friendly in the store. The management team is very helpful to co-workers and customers. The hardest part is the rush hour because the line overflows
good,Working as a Produce Gm (General Merchandiser) was a fun position to have. It allowed me to assist customers in selecting products that they can be satisfied with. Being able to see them leave with a smile on their face and polite thank you as they left was all I really needed. Some customers would enjoy my positive attitude so much that they would even stop to make conversation with me just so that they could have a few more moments of company. Surely during the busy times it would become a bit busy so work will be double. Though all and all in truth I would say Vons was a nice place to work.
good,"Fast past work environment.  Requires dedication and a great sense of urgency.  Fun, if you enjoy working with the public. As with any large retail company, you get to experience a variety of duties."
good,At safeway i learned great customer service skills and how to work with many different people . The hardest part of this job is not overworking yourself and working at a steady paste .
good,Good place to work with great benefits at the corporate level. Job requires to much travel. Expectations for Manager performance is unrealistic and unsupported.

good,Safeway is a well respected company and is fairly large.  They do know how to run operations well.  Satisfied overall. There was never a boring moment there especially with all the customers in and out of the store.  Some customers where there on a regular basis and would get to know them by their first name and gain a new friend.  All the employees there seemed to have a great attitude and would encourage each other to strive for the best of your ability.
good,"A typical day at Safeway would include our rush from 3pm to about 5pm. That would be when we are the most busy.  We need to move at a high pace while being able to multitask and communicate with the customer about their shopping experience.  As well as, bagging the guest groceries and handling the final transaction correctly.  Safeway is a learn as you go culture and if you are willing to learn and do more, Safeway is more than happy to cross-""train"" you. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to communicate with new people everyday and meet their needs."

good,"I am a front end manager at Safeway. so, when i'm at work i take care of complaints, answer phones, manage the employees, and stock. i don't have a hard time at my job. The enjoyable part about my job is dealing with different customers and having conversation with them about life. I love the customers that comes in the store."
good,"Greet customers,ring items, on register,bag items,keep area clean and reshop the items that customers didn't want. Show customer where items where located if they could not find them.The store was new so it had some things other stores didn't have like a sushi bar, a balcony you can go out and sit on,a fireplace in the room where you can look at your computer and Lange on the sofas if you like.The food Dept. Was extra large and flower Dept was Hugh the store it self was pretty Hugh"
good,I enjoyed working at safeway. I felt welcomed and my superiors continually supported my efforts to push further into the company. Overall if you have a solid work ethic you could build a solid career for yourself here.
good,"Had to pay 500$ for initiation fee, I left, everyone was nice, store manager was to cocky and was to big headed, held door open for him and never got a thank you, always said good morning never got a response"
good,"typical day was routine, everyone has their assigned tasks to complete."
good,I really like meeting new people but I would say the hardest part is memorizing all the produce codes (but still trying to memorize) and the rude customers but I kept smiling and tried to maintain calm as much as possible. My old Safeway job at deli clerk didn't send my deli clerk training money to my bank account. I love this cashier job right now though
good,"Having been out of the loop on retail work, I was a bit nervous getting back into it. However, the employees there made the job a very easy transition. The customers were fantastic. Although tiring as I wasn't used to standing all day, the job was enjoyable. "
good,Safeway was a fast past and productive work environment. i got the chance to learn in all different work areas within Safeway. This was a fun work place to work in with all different kinds of people.
good,"lifting and delivery items to customers homes,loading tots onto a hand truck to customers homes bring items into homes, unload items,I learned to build a relationship with customers ask question to make sure there happy with service.manage is OK there needs to be more of a communication with workers.Coworkers are a good bunch hard working like to have fun and does not complain. Driving seems to be the hardest part of my job driving in traffic and having people cut you off and you have to have patient and be safe in traffic.The most enjoyable part of my job is getting off of work and knowing that all customers are happy with my performance of the day."
good,"I really enjoy working at the Safeway Deli, I got to know a lot of wonderful people and my customers on a personal leave. My bosses were wonderful people too. Which made work really nice and easy days."
good,"We started at 5:00 am with prep for breakfast and prepping the food for the rest of the day."
good,"Loved this place. Hated the Union dues. "
good,Night Crew was a good position to start out in.  Learned a lot about product and product placement.  Start the shift by breaking down the grocery load on to designated aisles. Took the product out and stocked the shelves and faced them.
good,I enjoy working at Safeway Starbucks as a barista. I try to stay positive and listen to the customers first and suggest healthy menus.
good,"Productive and fun working environment but lacking in professionalism in some areas."
good,"Working with the company and the management I've had has taught me alot about how to successfully work as a team to accomplish company goals.  Management and colleagues were always there if help was needed, and doors were always open from managers with any issues/questions.  By far one of the best group of co-workers I have ever worked with that were reliable, helpful in many ways, and made it enjoyable to come to work everyday."
good,"A great work environment. It's easy to become close with the other people working in your department. They are very easy to work with when you need certain days off. A great place to work if you need a certain schedule for school or something they'll do their best to make sure you have the time off you need to go. It's a little bit tougher working in the Deli but it's worth it when you get to work with great people. I have worked at two different stores and had great experiences with the people in the deli. The customers are also a lot of fun to serve most of the time they are very pleasant to talk to. Maybe not a place you want to spend your entire life working for unless you can advance to more than just a regular clerk though. If you get enough surveys or reviews you can also win things, when I was working there at least."
good,"Safeway Store expansion was a primary goal of the company and I was hired as the first CFO Corporate Real Estate to implement controls, policies/procedures, accounting and financial reporting to facilitate the expansion program."
good,"My job was very labour- intensive and repetetive, but the pay was good so I stuck it out. My co-workers are friendly and encouraging. I learned the value of having a stick-to-it attitude. Honestly, the most enjoyable part of the job is me being done for the day/ night."
good,Very good for students and those that want effortless working. Very friendly and supportive team will definitely work their if given a chance
good,"a typical day hand  crafting coffee beverages "
good,"I would come in and unload the trucks, pallets, and then I would move to correct aisles to start restocking the shelves. I would the face all my products at the end of the night to make sure it was nice and neat."
good,"Day at work varied day to day.  Price change days were busy."
good,I love working at Safeway. I meet and work with wonderful people. I am only trying to advance my career after working there for over 2 years. I would recommend this position as an entry level position. I assist customers with their groceries and anything they need. I also assure cleanliness and neatness of the store.
good,Great company that leaves plenty of room for advancement. Good benefits for an entry level job. This company started me down the path of management and Human Resources.
good,"I enjoy working at safeway and providing excellent customer service to the general public.  I am a people person and I get along well with peers/ co-workers.  safeway has afforded me the opportunity to work with people of all cultures and diverse background.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being of assistance to anyone and knowing that I have done my job with great satisfaction.  The hardest part of my job would be when staff is short and the store is very busy. But in a situation like that I would take that into a positive look and let my co-worker know its time to work together and get the job done in a timely, accurate manner and provide excellent customer service to the public."
good,"A typical day would be fun and learned how to communicate and meet customers needs."
good,Safeway has a very friendly work environment and the staff feels like extended family. The benefits are good but could include tuition reimbursement. Advancing in the company is fairly easy as long as you show a desire to excel and move up. Manager training is probably the best I have seen out of any company.
good,the hardest part of the job was learning something new and smiling when the customers were rude. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customer and talking and interacting with my co-workers.
good,"You clock in check in with the area manager and give customer a friendly world class service, co workers are nice hardest part of job remembering PLU codes"
good,"My time at Safeway has been a enjoyable working experience. A regular day at work was to straighten out and organize the department. Once that is done, serving customers is a daily part of the routine."
good,Clean and professional workplace. The amazing people you come in contact with daily are more than enough reason to show up to work prepared to get the job done with nothing short of a genuine smile.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping a lot of customers, some rude some kind. What I have learned early is the faster you work the more you get done and also how to be patient with others. I've worked with 4 store managers, they were good at what they do and would work with you as long as you work with them. The co-workers were pretty good, i got along with everyone pretty well. The hardest part of working in Safeway would be sometimes you would have to work by yourself for a hour because most of the time they were short staffed. The most enjoyable was keeping a smile on customers faces"
good,"helping the customers with issues and helping them is what i like to do the most. making the customer happy. safeway is a good company, they just dont pay enough or give enough hours"
good,"Screening candidates all day for TX stores."
good,"I loved working at Safeway. I was able to flourish as a decorator and let my creativity shine at this organization. I really enjoyed the team atmosphere of Safeway. My peers and managers worked together as a unified whole. One of the most difficult parts of this job was pushing myself beyond my normal capacity to reach the excellent standards. Although challenging, it was rewarding. The most rewarding part was allowing my creativity to affect the lives of my customers. Filling cake orders for various occasions allowed me to feel like I was somehow a part of the most important days in the lives of those I served."
good,I have learned that hard work does and does not pay off. The hardest part of the job is when we are shorthanded at work. What I enjoyed about this job is when I get a lot accomplished. I worked with the best co-workers at Safeway.
good,Safe way helped me to build up my social skills in costumer service. I really enjoyed working there.
good,I was a shift supervisor. I helped the team with daily goals. Handled money and inventory on a daily basis. I handled customer complaints.
good,Safeway was the best job that I had. Management is excellent. Everyone is nice and professional. The only bad thing I have to say is they do not give anyone a second chance.
good,"Gather and prepare all tools as needed. Start shifting gondolas where they need to be moved. Re-assemble shelves and place them in the proper location of the store. Sweep and clean up everything until store is more sanitary than it was before we walked in."
good,"Every Day Was Different Which Applies To Me Because I Love Meeting New People And The Typical Usual Customers That Arrived And Bonding With Them. I Have Learned Tolerance Towards Customers That Was Unsure Of What The Card Meant Or How Much Gas They Have Put In, Or Their Scratch Cards Were Overly Scratched, So I Called The Scratch & Win Card Company To Assist The Problem. Management Was Great, Both My Managers Made Things Quick And Easy To Remember As Well As Bonding With Them. My Co-Workers Always Knew What They Were Doing, They Had Great Energy Towards The Customers As Well As Towards Me. The Hardest Part Would Have To Be The Weather, It Was Too Cold Some Days. I Enjoyed Every Part Of It."
good,After working there for two years i can honestly say want I have learned the most from that place is how to be patient and how to keep busy at work when nothings going on.
good,"Vons is a great place to work, friendly staff, the job keeps you busy, management is great, the hardest part of the job is the busy rush around the holidays and the most enjoyable part is being able to work with such great coworkers and in such a nice area."

good,"A typical day at work consisted mainly of merchandising, customer service, cashiering, and inventory management. I held many positions in the 4 years I was with Safeway: Deli Clerk, General Merchandise Clerk, Head Clerk, Food Clerk, Assistant Manager, Dairy Clerk, and Receiver. All of these positions taught me invaluable skills that I can and will apply to my future positions, such as teamwork, time management, and ultimately, how to work with people and specifically the 'public'. "
good,I was a baker so my day was making breads and ect. I was a easy job to learn. Good co workers.
good,"I prepared and served hot or cold beverages and cleaned and sanitized work areas, utensils, or equipment, and seating areas. As well as stocked customer service stations with paper products or beverage preparation items and ordered, received, and stocked supplies or retail products. I learned how to make coffee and to listen for what the people really wanted. The manager wasn't really a good manager. My co workers was very nice and enjoyed working with them. I cant think of anything that was the hardest. My favorite part of working  at starbucks was to see the customers smile when you made there drink and handed it to them and they were friendly."
good,Awesome place to work. I loved working at safeway. I was going to college and I had flexible hours which worked well. I worked with great people also

good,"As an extern in Safeway Pharmacy, Los Altos, California, I've learned a lot of things which I wasn't experienced in school.  I know that school experience is way different than working in the actual field.  I just felt good and grateful to the people working in that pharmacy for they taught me the things that I should learn as a pharmacy technologist in the future."
good,"During my frist job at Safeway was so much fun to work, meeting many new faces which I never know because I was originally from Miami, Florida. In that position put me very challenge because of communication, how to deal with hearing world at that workplace which I am suppose to help them to find the items that were told to help direct them which asile the item is at. In additional, get more involve with interaction at company such as holidays, cancer charities, musclar destrophy, etc.. The hardest job is how to become manage in that retailer store but I can challenge it if Job permit."
good,"worked in the retail stores for 10 years "
good,"I enjoy my current job and i have learned responsibility, safety, and much more. My co workers have became my family over the year i have work at safeway. The hardest part of my job would be how the bakery is understaffed and because of that it makes the job more stressful for everyone else. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the customers and my co workers."
good,very difficult job if youve never done it before or operated a electric pallet jack. its fast paced and safety is the number 1 priority because you can get hurt around every corner

At the present day, I get to work with great people who genuinely care. I enjoy shopping for others, and I treat them as though I am shoppping for myslef. I always treat their products as my own. The hardest part of the job is the monotony. I enjoy everything else....."
good,a typical work day can go by very fast.
good,"A typical day included greeting customers, many of them my regulars I see at least several times a week. Doing pulls and loans out to the cashiers, and balancing tills at the end of the shift. I learned more about customer service than I did before as well as more about the back end of the cash office part. My management was very approachable and helpful. My co-workers were wonderful. The hardest part of the job was getting hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was my regular customers and my co-workers."
good,"come in and set front display, clean fish, and help the Buchures."
good,While working here it gave me a chance to meet alot of important people in the metro Richmond area .I took this job to another level its not everyday you get to actually shake hands with the same people you see on tv or in the paper on a daily basis.It was part time but I enjoyed the fact of being in the same company as those who were as successful.

good,"Job security once you passed probation was excellent, advancement was not an option unless you choose to go into management. Job bidding allowed you to move into various responsibilities within the plant, opportunities to learn new"
good,"Safeway always makes sure to touch base with their employees and never leave anyone or thing in the dark. Great place to work, they are flexible with their hours...sometimes."
good,"This was and is a great company to work for.

We would occasionally have a huge lunch rush with all the car dealership employees next door order sandwiches for lunch, but they were always very friendly."

good,Work was easy just have to be fast paste. My manager wasnt a good manager. But coworkers are there to help. Money is good. Great benefits. Hope to come back
good,"There is always good and bad about any company,  same for Safeway.  The employee are great to work with.  Management has changed over the years. I believe for the better. It is hard work and customer s can be ruthless.  Some are great a d understanding  but you always get a few that really don't know how to treat people.  Management supports you when needed."
good,"It's a good place to work, with great benefits; but I feel the management could be better. The most difficult thing for me was knowing who came first."

good,"i really enjoyed working at the deli where i was able to learn alot from along with my coworkers, we were such a great time to have everything done by the time it needed to be done"
good,"I have learned bagging groceries, recycling, stacking carts and baskets, sweeping and signing the clipboard for security reasons. I could not make its probabation because it is too many tasks to be done and also not enough hours because of the union."
good,Come in and just get started. Work your loads and keep back stock neat and rotated. I learned to stay busy and on top of things so that i don't get set back or behind on anything. Management was pretty good. They could always answer questions or find out answers when needed. Hardest part was keeping up on displays and expiration dates mostly because i was working alone in a pretty large department. Mostly enjoyed everything from coworkers to customers to doing my job. It wasn't hard to catch on to but it just got boring being by myself in the department.
good,Some days it was good and some days not.my job wasn’t hard at all.i learned a lot.there is always something differnt.some of the mangment was good and some of them was mean

good,The company is outstanding. I've learned that I can deal with anyone that comes my way in life.The management is spectacular. But the hardest part of this job is trying to act like you don't like it.
good,I worked 15 hour shifts every day only have one day off on Sundays I was an order selector my job was to collect groceries from each aisle and that was our order we complete the order we drop it off at the truck and we do it again until the day is over till all the loads and orders are done.
good,I enjoy helping customers and seeing my regulars. Cutting meat is oddly satisfying. Preparing food is very high paced and out of my comfort zone but I enjoy it.
good,I started a cashier but after only 5 months I was promoted to customer service where I was given far more responsibilities. It's a great work environment and everyone is always super friendly. They are very flexible with availability and cancelling shifts.
good,The workplace culture there was very comforting. when I worked there it felt like you were apart of a very big family which made it easier when conflicts came up because they were resolved immediately.
good,"Good place to work, the mangers were nice and everyone was a team. When someone needed help, everyone tried to pitch in and help that person. It was like a family"
good,Nice company also able to pick up more hours if needed and would be able to talk to management to see if you can get more hours in other departments they can always use the extra help.

The management team was real understanding the type you could go to in any situation good or bad. Hours were flexible and manageable room to work around school schedules and/or another part time job whatever the case may have been.

good,"A typical day at work is always the same, bagging grocery's for customers and almost always or most of the time walk out with the customer and place there grocery's in there car for them, every 2 hours one or more employee would round up the used carts along the parking lot and push them back into the store for customer use."
good,"There is always something to do in the deli department, even when it is a slow day. You cook and prepare food, cut and slice meats and cheeses, clean, and serve guest. Majority of the time customers come up just to sample the meats, cheeses and cold salads. Great department to meet new people, if you are a people person."
good,"I mainly collected carts, bagged groceries and helped customers to their cars. Management changed a few times while I was employed there. I really didn't find anything difficult about the job, but I did want more hours."
good,"I have been there a short time as of today but the whole crew is friendly and supportive.  Everyone works together and helps each other.  Fast paced job and always busy and jobs to do.  I am still learning which is what I like.  I enjoy the customers and trying to make their day better.  From the time I walk through the Pharmacy doors I am working at non stop.  There is always something to do from data entry of new scripts and insurance, answering the phones, checking a customer out, stocking medications to so much more."
good,"I enjoyed every aspect of my position at Vons. The management and work culture were bar none. I also enjoy Vons as a consumer and after working behind the scenes so-to speak I know why."
good,"I worked in the night crew department. Work started at 10pm and sometimes i would go home between 7am-8am. Checking inventory, stocking shelves and also working at the cashier. store was open 24/7. We all worked as a tam. Made it fun but also staying focus and determinen with deadline orders to avoid shift leads from stressing or worrying about what the store manager would say or comment but in the end we all understood the job and never had a ""lazy"" co-worker. Hardest part of the job was making sure customers late night wouldnt steal, or make any trouble."
good,it is a great first job to gain experience and the management is very friendly. Has slow months so not always a stable income for everyone. they do not give out overtime very often
good,"I really enjoyed working for the Safeway company. The pay was great and management was amazing."
good,"A typical day at work is eventful. You get to see people of all ages, religion, and even political views .  What I've learned from this is the workplace culture is like a family, and so is management. The hardest part of the job is in a way the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"courtesy clerk was a fun job in my opinon, i was able to be helpful with the customers and my employees, some days were pretty difficult but pulling/pushing shopping carts in extreme contitions (snow, wind) wasn't a simple task, but the managers always were grateful and appreciated the hard work. Fellow employees, regardless of age, were always kind to me. tasks that were asked of me were as simple as restocking, facing labels of producks to make the isles look nice."
good,"Promotes equal opportunity and diversity."
good,"My typical day at work was to go in the back warehouse and start loading the pallets out the truck and then start stocking the grocery/merchandise out in the store. I learned a lot about tags,bar codes, and ordering items for customers. The management was great until we got new managers that made the store go downhill by cutting everyone hours and then making a bunch of people quit. The workplace at Safeway was really calming. Hardest part of the job was trying to find where each item belonged, for example trying to find a item that goes in a specific aisle. The most enjoyable part of the job was accomplishing everything that needed to be done, all the stress goes away which is a great feeling!"
good,Safeway was a great place to start when I was out of high school. Great advancement for younger adults to learn management skills. Not a life long job thou!
good,Normal workday includes doing everything that the managers ask and the standard job requirements listed under your job. The other employees are really helpful and kind.
good,It was quite a good and friendly environment to work in a challenging role to prove yourself and show your skills. I love being an employee at this organization.
good,"A typical workday as a Safeway employee involves clocking in, signing into the system, turning on the isle light, processing customer transactions, and very often bagging groceries with one or two 10 minute breaks between a 6-8 hour shift. Its a very straightforward position with very few surprises.  The main concern is customer service which isn't so bad considering you'll occasionally meet very interesting regulars with unique personalities.  Working the closing shift can be fairly easy if you know how to manage your additional closing duties after which most of your time will be spent walking around merchandising to Old School Rhythm and blues/Rock radio."
good,I loved working at safeway. Customers employees and bossses wers awesome most of the time. I worked and was able to take vacations and see my family througb the work days
good,I provided excellent customer service in the bakery and enjoyed the fast pace environment. I worked well under all circumstances and gave knowledge of products.
good,Working at Safeway was a very enjoyable experience and I love all the other employees I got to work with on a daily basis. I would duly recommend anyone that needs a job to work as a courtesy clerk since the job is so fluid
good,"When I worked there, I worked the night shift as baker time went by so fast, trying to get everything done in a timely manner by doing that I learned good time management skills, customer service, and how to work in a team and strong work ethics. There is always a good vibe and everyone is very friendly. There is really no hardest part there's learning experiences and the most thing i loved about working there is seeing the customers face light up once they see there cake or taste specialty breads I would make."
good,"A typical work day consisted of setting up displays, making coffees, and getting to know my customers."
good,"Overall good company to work for. Customers are great, management is understanding and company has great discounts in addition to store coupons. Also have great benefits."
good,"It was a wonderful place to work during high school, the hours were flexible and the salary was decent, given that I was in high school. I also learned how to interact with customers and deal with stressful situations effectively."
good,"I need full time to support myself and I cannot get it at Safeway. I start between 2 and 3 a.m. everyday that I work. I work in a very cold environment/refrigerated. I learned how to make hourly employee work schedules, administer time appropriately, sanitize and clean the chopping room, etc. The hardest part of my job is the hours. The most enjoyable was the people that I worked with. "
good,"They're very flexible and I enjoyed my job when I worked there. "
good,"I disliked the rules of the secret shoppers. However, it is a good company and if you put in the time and the effort, they will take care of you. I have worked in union and non-union states/stores and the same experience for both. My wage/salary was on par with my experience and skills."
good,everyone at safeway is kind and generous but when it comes to the management it isnt all that good. when it comes to rumors and legal issues managment does not do anyhting about it.
good,I worked in the deli and the bakery for many many years. It was fast paced and stressful at times but a great place to work. I learned how to do most of the positions in each department. I know it was a job but I had many fun and happy memories. I loved our huddles that boosted morale and was just fun.There will always be some difficult customers but overall I loved serving the customers.
good,"you get the option to be a part of ufcw union"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Safeway, they are fair and treat their employees well. Pay could be better but the benefits are great. They have a good culture and good people."
good,"Overall, Working here definitely gave me clarity and knowledge to the real working world. Also, I have gained customer service skills while working her."
good,"Beginning my day on time with a smile to interact with peers and customers.  The vast majority of my work experience with Safeway was as a Checker in the check out line.  Here I conducted myself professionally, happily and with speed as the Check out counter can be fast paced.  I greeted my customers, thanked them by name, accepted payment, suggested items, anticipated their needs, bagged up their groceries and asked if needed assistance to their car."
good,I have nothing but positive things to say regarding my experience with this company. As long as you are a committed employee that does what is expected they will treat you with nothing but respect.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in on the time sheet, going to the check stand to get everything was readily available and organized to start working. I learned good communication skills as well as how to work in a fast paced environment during the peak hours. The management was okay but there was not cohesion within the workplace between the staff and managers.

I want people to enjoy themselves as they will work hadrer and be more efficent. I really liked working with and evaluating people and their skills for promotional opportunities. I enjoy seeing a person take on a new challange and succeed. The difficult part was disclipineing employees. It never gave me pleasure to rebuke a subbordinate. I do it more than I like to but in business you have to have employees that do what their told. the company can not survive if employees just do what they want or feel like doing."
good,If you wana work nightfill it is very hard work dont know what it is like these days but when I was there wow big learning curve. your night starts at 9pm most nights and you wont get out of work till 6am the next day most days but you will get a few days off hear and there to recover

I have learned a lot about coffee and how it is made and where it comes from. I have also learned how to really focus and take on tough situations.

good,I have been lucky to work with a team that is passionate about our departments goals.  I've learned many things during my time at Safeway.
good,"My day starts with getting the non fuel items set up and opened for the days sales.  Getting reports printed up, setting up the till, getting paperwork done, waiting on customers as soon as we opened.  Learned a lot over the years.  Never would have known anything about gas stations other that how to pump gas if I hadn't worked here.  Hardest part of the job was working shorthanded.  The most enjoyable part is waiting on the customers. Co-workers are great for the most part.  There were some that were hard to work with, but we made the best of  the situation that we could."
good,"There really isn't a 'typical' day at Safeway, it always changes based on how busy it will be that day and whether or not you have to finish yesterdays work before you go on. As a first job, Safeway is a great company to work for, I learned the true meaning of being part of a team, and helping them achieve goals to help the store succeed overall. Management came and went, and we all stayed a tight group of employees. We, I would like to consider, ""adopt"" all the new employees that start at our store because we become such a close family with everyone. It as nice feeling. My co-workers are people i depend on when I need help getting something done, and vise versa. The hardest part of my job? I wouldn't say anything is really hard about the job, over all not making a customer happy is 'hard'. I always want to make each and every customer that comes to the store happy. I want them to find and be treated with the up most respect. I enjoy every part of my job. I enjoy meeting new customers, and I enjoy getting close with people I meet on a daily basis."

good,Safeway's culture provides a diverse workforce and opportunities to develop and expand your career.  Great people! Great career stories!
good,"A typical day at Safeway would be arriving at work on time with a positive attitude. Every company has customer that are hard to deal with but we always try to make their shopping experience a friendly one. I have learnt how to act responsibly in a crisis and, also, how to interact with  customers efficiently. I absolutely love the atmosphere at work. I got an opportunity to work with great managers and staff. I have been honoured to be a part of Safeway's great staff, however, I would like to move on and find a place that would work better for my future career path."
good,Great and friendly atmosphere. Co-workers are always friendly to each other. Customers are friendly. Working place is never boring.
good,"Safeway was a Family, we all respected each other and the jobs that each of us did. As part of the Management team I was fortunate enough to be able to be a part of the entire store and have a connection with all employees and learn the aspects of each job there. The hardest part of my job was having to discipline staff as situations occurred. The best part of my job was the satisfaction that I got at the end of the day knowing that my hard work was noticed and appreciated and that it made a difference to the company."
good,"I would come in early, just in case I was needed... then then best part would be when my customers would start coming into my line so that I could start making their day as bright and wonderful as I could.  I LOVE MY CUSTOMERS!! It made the day go so fast cause the best part was each and every customer that came into my line."
good,"In a typical day, I arrive and check the schedule, organize my workload, collect all the money from the registers, enter all required information into the computer, and prepare for the store opening that morning. After that, I make myself available for other tasks such as relabeling prices, stocking shelves, and set up links for discount products. I learned to be organized and productive for the limited time I had to do many things. I work well with other people and get along with everybody. I enjoy a challenge and the teamwork required to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is to get everything done on schedule as there was a lot to get done. The most enjoyable part of the job was the accomplishment of succeeding each day with the things on my schedule."
good,Safeway has a range of departments and allows its employees to learn the best tools of the trade and apply them in their jobs. Flexibility to learn and move between departments. Great work environment with lots of employee interaction. Easy to communicate with upper management and coworkers.
good,"I worked two different shifts, one was an early morning stocking position and the other was a closing helper clerk shift. In the morning, I stocked the dairy department and frozen aisles, as well as arranged the freight in the storeroom. For the night shift, I restocked aisles sporadically, helped in the front end, and brought out freight for the night crew. I think the hardest part of the job was working on holidays, particularly winter holidays, because the staff in general couldn't keep up with the amount of shoppers in the store. The most interesting part was that I got to function as a substitute for most of the other departments - so I learned about how to arrange flowers, how to take care of fruits + vegetables, operated powerjacks, frost cakes, and even sell alcohol while being underage."
good,"A typical day at work would be set up cases,help customers,put out product."
good,"Job hours were really reliable. You always had someone on hand to ask for help. It can be a fast paced environment at moments, and then be silent for the rest of the shift. Great experience if you want to remain in the convenient store industry for awhile. I learned the different types of cigarettes and tobacco. I also learned lottery sales as well."
good,"My job at Safeway made me really appreciate the overall company. It was a really enjoyable work experience with wonderful co workers... If you like deli work and are willing to get your hands dirty (which i was) then its a fun job to have, i really enjoyed seeing my usual customers and providing new customers with a good store experience."
good,"Work was steady, Learning was consistent, my co-workers were team players."
good,"I had a great experience at VONS and met a lot of great people along the way.  Watch out for Karen Lawson.  She is a useless, crippled snake that will stab you in the back within seconds.  She needs to retire as she is just taking up oxygen that could be used by capable employees."
good,I have nothing but good things to say about Safeway. The only reason i left is for a sick family member out of state.
good,As a student Safeway is a great place to be able to balance work and school life.
good,Always have a plan planned out to accomplish whatever task is assigned. Always thrive to do your best.
good,"A typical day usually involves working on the cash register. The hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable, is being around lots of different people. I have learnt great communication skills solely for that fact alone. Before this I had never need to communicate with such a large variety of people and I am grateful that I took this job because of that. I also like the people I get to work with, including the store manager. We all work really well with each other."
good,"In a typical day I punch in my time card head down to my designated till and starting ringing through customers. I have learned many codes, PLU's, and how to work the till successfully. It has grown me as a person putting me out of my usual comfort zone and talking to complete strangers as well as establishing relationships with regular customers. I work with friendly easy to talk to people and have great relationships with all of them. The hardest part of my job would probably be having to stand for 9 hours. The part I enjoy the most is working with my co-workers. The Safeway I work for has great management, the store owner is a friendly easy to talk to guy and all my supervisors or managers are nice and friendly."

good,"very fast paced work, learned a lot , had a great time with co-workers."
good,Standing a lot but very fun dealing with co workers and customers. Management was really nice and loved working with money.
good,"The reason why i'm trying to find another job is because my actual job is really far from home so i'm spending a lot in gas, and another reason is that the second shift is not working for me at all since 8 months ago i had a baby and now most of the time i'm tired or sleepy so i can't spend time with him or the rest of my family..."

good,"Safeway was my first step into the Pharmacy environment while finishing attending school with UMA. Great place to extern at. My co-workers were very team player oriented which made getting all the tasks done in the pharmacy on time attainable. While working there I learned how to input prescriptions into the PDX computer system, manage inventory, count pills, do some small compounding, return prescriptions to stock, get even more exposure to customer service and use the register as well. "
good,"It was a fun place to work, the customers were awesome, the management needed a little work, but it was a great job."
good,"Meet and greet customers, ring up their groceries, bag them and offer them assistance to their car. Management is cool but could also be better. It depends on who is managing at the moment. Co-workers are nice and helpful. There isn't much that is hard about this job. Most enjoyable part of this job is that it is a small place and doesn't ever get really crowded. I prefer smaller work environments."

good,"I made a lot of friends with my co-workers and some of the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job, of showing up days I was scheduled, was seeing my friends and the nice fun customers. The hardest part was probably having to deal with low hours with minimum wage and a few members of management."

good,I answered phone calls. I processed prescriptions and counted the medication. When I would receive control medications I would call the Dorctors Office to verify that the prescription was not a fake. The store that I worked at would receive a lot of fake prescriptions. And when that would happen the Pharmacist knew either them or I would call the police. I also rang customers up that were receiving their medications. I would help with expired medications and Inventory that was every 6 months. Basically I helped in the pharmacy where ever they needed me.

good,"My manager was amazing and flexible. When people say: ""When you have a good manager and coworkers, work can actually be pretty enjoyable"" they mean it. Because while working in the bakery was pretty taxing; having a good manager and fun, caring coworkers really did make things ten times better. Everyone went from being coworkers to quickly becoming pretty much my family and I actually kinda miss working there. :)"
good,I truly loved my job at Safeway(Vons) and it was almost fully because of the employees and managers that were their. Customers sometimes made days better but the environment that employees made and how comfortable they were with managers made everything better. The few times it was stressful was sometimes due to other employees not completely their jobs or on certain holidays like Labor Day and July 4th and Thanksgiving which require a lot of groceries.

good,Working at vons gave me most of my customer service experience. Being a courtesy clerk you are more involved with customers and will quickly learn a lot about the store
good,"I worked at VONS for about four years. My days were very much the same. I would bag groceries, check the aisles for spills and bring in shopping carts from the parking lot. Occasionally they would have me doing something else such as cleaning certain displays. During the closing shift I would bring more plastic bags up from the back and take out the trash. The hardest part was working holiday shifts because those were the busiest times however those were also the most enjoyable days as well."
good,Laid back management and hours are easy to change. Stock fruit and vegetable. Remove any that you considered bad. Keeping the produce department clean and organized. Help customers locate items and information on the prices.
good,"The job requirement were very enough to allow me to develop many new skills with respected food services.  For example, one day I could be making pizza and the next day I could be serving a variety of meat and cheese to the customers."
good,The bakery was a fast pace and fun challenge daily to get out product and be  ready for sales . filling orders and keeping product full and rotated. I learn how to work independently and with others.
good,Good place to work with great benefits. We have a union which is a nice thing to have. It's very helpful. The managers do a good job to work with your schedule if you go to school.
good,I had a great time working at Safeway and would definitely work there again. I recommend this company to all of my friends. My manager was one of the best guys I know.
good,"A usual day is sim plying helping the cashiers out, maintain cleanness around the store, and collect carts outside the store. The workplace was a very calming area, not much stress going on for the worker role. The hardest part of the job was trying to be everywhere at once if a lot of people suddenly needed you at that exact moment. The most enjoyable part of the job was how flexible the hours they provided the worker with, especially if one was a part timer."
good,"I was the general merchandise manager and in charge of 2 people and was in charge of orders, stocking, credits, inventory,modules, ans all the seasonal and holiday merchandise and placement of these items.I  never had a bad inventory and attribute that to having a great manager that cared and was available for me to ask questions and resolve any problems that arose."
good,"I enjoyed working for safeway because it gave me a lot of opportunities.  Once my family started I needed to make more money, so I needed to move on.  I did receive a lot of training in different areas of safeway which was really nice.  Its a great place to start working at if you are young."

good,"I loved what I did. Loved the customers that came in everyone is very friendly and caring. Management was easy to work with, when ever I need something they would help out.

good,The manager and I connected immediately. I enjoyed the connection with staffing. I liked the location. And I liked the benefits. The work experience was pleasing.
good,"I was in the front of the store and in the bakery department. I learned how to take initiative during stressful situations because they encouraged employees to work alone. The management was fair and very helpful. The workplace culture was great, everyone was friendly and there was great opportunities for advancement. The hardest part of the job was working alone because there was usually a lot of work to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was having good and nice people around to collaborate with or even just a friendly conversation."
good,"Great environment, and plenty of overtime for whoever wants it. Great people and boss, benefits, and job security, and perks that come with the job, discounts at the stores as well."
good,I learned most of my skills from Safeway.  Work life balance can be a bit challenging because of the demand of the job.  Overall I am happy that I worked for this company.

good,It was a great job I had the opportunity to travel and see different things and meet different people from different walks of life I had a chance to experience Alaska and work in different kinds of wether
good,Nice staff and co-workers sometimes very annoying customers and struggled to remember produce codes which irritated some. Training was provided and very well done.
good,Fun place to work. Plenty of overtime available due to high turnover. Union rules create unfair pay scales; checkout associates make 35% more than department managers

good,I really liked it but the lack of advancement. I would recommened anyone to work for them it is a good start up job school kids everyone is very nice and helpful
good,The hardest part of the day was in the afternoon around 4-8 p.m. at night. That was when our store was the busiest. Our store manager was knowledgeable and polite to his employees. I got to learn other departments that i was put in.
good,"I enjoyed working at Safeway. I worked as a Pharmacy Technician and only had 2 other pharmacists to work with. Nice people to work for, competitive pay and great benefits."

good,was fun place to work. love my manager. she help me understand more about the retail world. she give me chance and understand my  situation. entertaining
good,Safeway consisted mostly of cleaning the gas station and reorganizing the snacks. I mostly worked all alone for my shifts but it was okay since there was plenty to clean. I would also help people pump gas and I really got to work on my customer service skills with this job. The most stressful part was when I'd be alone on my shift and cleaning outside and customers would come inside the store and I hadn't known.
good,"Safeway is very productive and will always have work no matter what, the benefits are incredible but it is a very fast-paced job and non-stop running."

good,"I loved working at Safeway corporate office.  (The grocery store chain.)  But I need part time work and after an auto accident, I had to quit my job there, because they wouldn't give me enough sick time off."
good,"This was my first start as a bookkeeper , made many friends who I still have today. They had one of the best places to work and even had a course to help out new checkers. great training."
good,"Never had a problem here. My bosses are always nice. If i call out sick they dont give me a hard time, extra pay on sundays, you can earn paid vacation based on hours worked, raises are also based on hours worked. Uniform isnt the best but i can deal with that."
good,a day at work is fun you chat with customer with  thier shopping . Have your department in shape for manger to look at the work u accomplish  as well get an hour lunch
good,"On a typical day at work I would enter the produce department and assess my responsibilities for the day. If I was the senior staff I would delegate tasks to other employees, if a staff member senior to me was working I would deffer to them. The work environment was pleasant with a close group of employees working together to accomplish a joint task. The job would get busy at times but when we worked together it was always manageable. The hardest part of the job was days that we were understaffed. Once you are the only person working in the department it becomes very demanding."
good,"the job was very productive ,fast paste, heads on. Friendly workers. The pay was great.You get a lot of opportunity and growh with this job. Only down fall for me was the commute."

good,"I like the enviroment, my coworkers and the enviroment. The customers are friendly and happy to see us. A downfall is that we don't always have enough staff so our lines get backed up."
good,"A typical day at work started with clocking in and saying hello to the front end supervisor.  The management team was always nice and helpful and happy.  I would be given a cashier line and begin helping the customers."
good,"Some days good and some crazy, I learned that customer service is very imporant, management wasn.t there when u needed them, hardest part probably when we had to clean and broil out fryers, was making food trays"

good,"Management and co workers are one and the same. Family oriented atmosphere happy, individuals enjoyed their jobs. Everyone willing to help the next one out, willing to learn new task, attention to detail major key."
good,"Good place to work, with hours! Hours are flexible but very unstable shifts. Can be unfair when it comes to moving up for certain employees. Most of the time you get 30-40 hours depending on your skills."
good,"I worked for them part-time and it was fine.  The hours were crazy though, it was exhausting! The people were fun to work with but going in at 2am is too much for this 45 year old."
good,"Working there was great. I worked at Safeway in the warehouse for over 25 years and retired in 2015, I emptied trailers, lifted pallets, assorted stock. I used a fork lift to move heavy pallets. Maintainted the area for safety reasons. Got as many trailers backed up and emptied as possible."

good,Safeway is a great work place management was poor but overall it was a great job i wanted to be a manager one day but they didn't wanna give me a raise so i had to leave because i had a family to tale care of.
good,"I start my day by pulling the counter an do rewraps, then I reset the counter. I have an hour before the store opens to do the counter an put on an order.

good,"I worked for Safeway for 14 1/2 years. Was planning on retiring from Safeway. Until they cut full time employees to part time. Was under the understanding that our full time status would be given back in less than a year so after 3 years and losing our home, one of my long time customers had been trying to recruit me for solar for 5 years. I finally gave in, gave my 30 day notice and entered into the solar industry."

good,Great company to work for. There is always room for lateral advancement within the company. Company really seems to care about it's employees. Not much opportunity as it pertains to moving up the ladder.
good,"Safeway allows you to work as if it is your personal business, making recommendations and giving you the opportunity to implement your projects. "
good,"I did all the work that was assigned to me - preparation of flowers, customer service, fruit baskets, cashier, watering plants.  I liked my co-workers and management.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of knowledge needed to be in this department.  There was nothing I disliked about my job."
good,"great management team ,Got a pasteurizer and a weigher sampler licensce here.Fun fast paced enviroment alot of over time."
good,Besides all the stuck up workers the benefits are great and they have some really great managment that dont get the recognition they deserve latissa at the irvington fremont store shes so friendly and a great business woman and jenn Whom was once at the hub fremont store and moved on to managment. she was a great mentor who inspired me to be my best this company is a great stepping stone to high ranking jobs.
good,it was a great work place the co workers were amazing and the customers but I must say management had somethings they needed to work on. I developed a connection with my customers which they became my regulars over time because of the customer service I provided to them. it did get stressful at times but u had to know how to handle the stress but then again you also have remember it was a corporate owned store. overall it was a great learning experience and I would do it all over again.
good,"A typical day at work would be to unload the truck,breakdown pallets,stock the shelves with products,write the order for the next day,send it,clean up and break down boxes, and open store.Management was great. My co-workers worked really hard and we got along.The hardest part of the job was having all that done in 8 hours.The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the shelves in a timley manner."

good,"Fun , very challenging, (especially when mystery shopper shows up ready to test the different departments in the area of customer service),  I say with confidence that the Safeway Stores, are number 1 in customer service,  during my  time of  employment.  I learned a lot too, from using the electric auto-meat slicer,  to varieties of high end meat products like primo taglios and cheese varieties. The most enjoyable part is when the supervisor says the deli department  got 10 the highest  mark/point  in customer service."
good,"Safeway is a great place for advancement in the company for something long term. As long as you are under the old contract, it has great benefits and wages. You meet great customers."

The most enjoyable part is helping the customers with deals and serving them with perfect hand made sandwiches. Ultimately, I lenjoy putting a smile on a customers face."
good,Typical day included dealing with various customers who needed assistance. Also included meetings during the week where the team of CSRs and supervisor would discuss weekly standings and important updates.
good,Very good company to work for.  My experience in management has helped me become a better leader and to advance myself as a manager.
good,I learned how to connect with the customers on what they liked in a product and recommend products to the customers. Loved how everyone at this job helped in every way they could and was there if I had questions. They also were there when I needed help with anything that I needed help with.
good,I absotuley loved working for this company. Very fast paced. Management was awesome. I moved out of town or i would still be with this company
good,Loved this job very much. A wonderful job and place to work. Filled trucks with orders. Delivered to customers. Learned customer service skills and the lay out of my routes. Hardest part was some of the heavy lifting and driving around at night. The most enjoyable part was the little supervision and the drives. As well as the close personal customer relationships that were formed.
good,Typical work day is busy. Every day is a learning day. I learned to be more patient. Management is alright and coworkers too. This is not a hard job to do.
good,"Working at Safeway was the most rewarding Job I have ever had. This is because the staff were all very friendly and motivated. Everyone always looks out for each other and would help you even if you didn't expect them to or ask them to. I woke up at midnight and worked from 12:30am to 9:00am in the Produce department. I would pull the order load off of the truck and set the product on the wet rack. I would also handle the organics section; as well as occasionally help order. "
good,Working for Vons meant always on your feet. I didn't mind that at all. Working in a fast past environment kept me focused and ready for any task that was given to me. My co-workers made the job even more fun with their upbeat attitudes and their willingness to help.

I love to help out with the cashiers and help them bag customers items. sometimes if the customer needs assitstance  I'm willing to help out the people. Other than that I love working for Safeway. Everyone says that I'm the best worker there.
good,I was in high school and was always scheduled during my classes. The management refused to be understanding about me being a student. The money was decent at the time.
good,"I wish I could have still be working here, But I had a bad drinking habit I could not let go of."
good,"A typical day at work would include coming in and going to the front office to print out the daily sales and profit reports from the previous day. Once recorded and filed away i would do a sweep of the kiosk to make sure everything was fully stocked & aesthetically pleasing to the customer. Throughout the day I would make drinks, ring up customers while delivering excellent customer service, mentor fellow Baristas and delegate tasks to them to create accountability for them to take pride in what they do. Once a month inventory would get done to get a dollar amount for every ingredient, paper product, and retail item to keep ordering under control. Once a week I would place an order for supplies and ingredients. "
good,"I don't really work there, I'm only there for work experience but I learned so many things about that job like I learned how to communicate with customers and how to stock a products in the backroom"
good,"A typical work day is about 12 hours long. It involves opening the pharmacy at 9 am and closing it at 9 pm. I arrive roughly 20 minutes early to get the pharmacy operations up and running. I turn on the 6 computers in my pharmacy and start the necessary programs to get us actively through the day. I then check the voicemail, fax and e-scripts for any new prescriptions that have been received already. I follow that with checking my manager e-mail and checking the refrigerator/freezer temperature to make sure they are in range. The day then begins once the gate is opened and the phone rings, while the first patient of the day is waiting to either drop off or pick up a prescription. The day proceeds with many phone calls from patients, doctors and nurses to call in, refill or check on the status of their prescriptions. Keep in mind throughout the day, we are all dealing with insurance problems and overrides, which are always challenging.  "
good,This was my dream job right here. This job taught me everything about customer service. All the attributes to keep and assist customers. My co-workers were awesome. The hardest part was when I had to leave. The most enjoyable part was when the customers were satisfied with your service.
good,I had a great time working at safeways and waitrose always felt safe and secure in my employment
good,"I prepared tray of doughnuts for the morning shift, I baked breads, made cookies, decorated cakes, ordered cakes, put new products out and price labeled them. My management was a great support for me. I learned all the work that goes into working in a bakery. I enjoyed learning all that needs to be done in a bakery. The coworkers I had all worked together, we helped each other out with tasks that we couldn't get done and helped prepare each other for the next shift of work to be done. It was a lot of multitasking and it taught me how to be able to move from on thing to another with ease. The most enjoyable was meeting new people and being able to give the customers what they were looking for."
good,"I Unloading the trailers, teaching people how to stock, sky shelf’s, making tags, make displays, ordering, face the lanes and inventory control. Also worked in the Deli, Produce, Tellers, Cashier, Receiver, Closing Manager and acting Grocery Manager. As a Teller counted the money, received the bank truck, customer services, and run the entire store."
good,Day would start around 6 am. freight to work. Ordering to do. Customers to take care of. Management was terrific. Just a nice group of people to be around. There wasn't really a hard part to the job. I had so many years experience in dairy that it was an easy transition from one job to another.
good,"My typical day at work is mainly the janitorial experience of keeping the store clean and free from debris.  I usually am an opener in the morning shift keeping the shelves stocked , maintaining the front end of the store while bagging and utilizing stores customer services."
good,"They gave me my start in pharmacy and I was able to do many different pharmacy jobs for them, got to Pharmacy Training Manager."
good,Vons was a very enjoyable place to work. There were so many different things to learn and aspects of the job. I really enjoyed my coworkers; they were very helpful in teaching and explaining things.
good,"Managers are not always on your side. However, you have great benefits and the more you work, the more raises you get. You can learn every dept if you are into that sort of things which calls for great advancement  at the end of the day."
good,"Management was great and provided a friendly environment, my coworkers were easy going and easy to talk to and create a rapport with. There really wasn't a hard part of the job at least for me. I enjoyed working with my coworkers, this was the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,Awesome job if you can handle the physical side of it. Very fast paced job with high expectations but they compensate you handsomely for it. Best health benefits of any where I've seen and hours are perfect for family life.
good,I have learned a lot from Safeway as my first job how to great customer by there last name.
good,"Safeway was a great job that got me started on my feet in the working environment. The managers were cycled in and out which made it difficult to be consistent on certain tasks each manager instructed. As for the ""Job Work/Life Balance"" category was the ups and downs of hours as well as a new schedule every week. Just made it difficult to have monthly payments because of not knowing how many hours were going to distributed to each worker."
good,I enjoy the people at safeway and have known many for my whole life.
good,I learned at work how to be more friendly. I learned how to manage my time better. I learned how to work as a team with coworkers. The hardest part was not knowing how i'm exceling as an employee. The most enjoyable part was the customers that I got to talk with daily.
good,I enjoy the excercize and employers just want to move on with my life would love to do jewelry or makeup.
good,"A great place to work if one is looking for steady work and advancement opportunities. Always busy and constantly on the go, assisting customers throughout the store. There I learned a lot about hard work, dedication, and how important time management is. Management was doing their job and always hold to a friendly, welcoming demeanor as well as professional. Co-workers were often friendly and helpful although some could use some extra work. The hardest part was putting myself to the test to put myself in someone elses shoes in performing cooking of the china express stand in my department. I realized how hard the work is for one person and congratulate the ones doing it everyday without complaint. The most enjoyable was the satisfied customers and the hard work I did to keep them coming back, my abilities to meet and exceed sales goals through the demos for the deli department."
good,"I worked on the retail side of Safeway, and the stores are very fast paced. Each day presents new challenges and opportunities, and there is never a dull moment in the stores. I have worked in many store across the Sacramento Valley and Monterey Bay area, each store is unique but they each present a new challenge."
good,"Interesting and busy with plenty of support from colleagues"
good,On a typical day it is fast paced and full of fun.  On Fridays is our $5 days and we get to do calls over the intercom telling people what our department has on special.  I have learned that it is more effective when you have other departments following your call.  It makes the day fun not only for you but the customer as well. Your coworkers are helpful and work together with management. I feel that I was honored being able to work with such a great crew.  The hardest part of the day is the end of day cleanup.  We had a made a check list to ensure we had taken care of everything. The best part of the day was our rush hours.

good,"            I have been working for Safeway since I was in high school. For me, that is a long time. I really do enjoy working there. A typical day starts with me clocking in and opening up a checkstand or letting someone out for a break. 75% of my time is spent in the checkstand, helping customers finish their shopping trip so that they can get home. The rest of my time is spent stocking shelves or making the store look nice."
good,"Friendly work enviroment"
good,"Run Customer Service, manage the store when upper management is off. People are enjoyable and being able to help them"
good,"When working in retail, you get your good days, and you get your bad days. Luckily, the bad days have less to do with the actual job you are performing and more to do with the customers you have. I enjoy working in a fast place scene, and that is what retail is. Especially during the holidays when everyone seems to find time to shop and money to spend. "

The hardest part of the job was dealing with the people who were not in the best mood but I would help them out as best as I could and try to make their day better.
good,"During my days volunteering at Safeway I learned my creative side. I learned how to decorate flowers, make bouquets, help customers, make fruit baskets and make little creations such as swans and unforgetables. My co-workers were fun and very nice to me. On my last day the gave me a big bouquet or flowers and told me to apply as a florist or cashier. The hardest part of the job was cutting my fingers when decorating flowers.

My co-workers are helpful and very accepting. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people and being able to help them.
good,"A typical day at work means a lot of work in anything and everything that has not been accomplished by the person last on shift. This results because of time, or/and sometimes we get so busy we have everyone working up front, in a check stand. I learned you can always have a good day because of the customers that walk in. From compliments, to regulars that come in asking about my family or life outside of work."

good,"Very professional and respectful culture in the office, Good ethics"
good,"I've worked at two grocery stores and I would have to say my Safeway experience was the best work I've had. A typical day after clocking in would start with checking the bottle room machines for malfunction and emptying. Secondly, I would do a store 'sweep' and check the floors and the milk/egg shelves if they needed to be stocked. Frequently I would check outside to collect a few carts before going back for more inside work. When everything was at top shape, I would stand at the checkstand and help bag groceries until it was time to roam the store again. Occasionally, I would be instructed by my manager to do specific tasks or 'projects' as she would call it around the store. Management was very encouraging and valued me being on the team. My co-workers were very interesting and friendly to work with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with stacking large, heavy bins of recyclables for the bottle truck. As this was very dangerous at times and everything had to be handle with extreme caution. The most enjoyable part of working with Safeway was that my hands were always busy, and my work was appreciated. Sometimes I had wished I'd never left this job to relocate."

good,"A day at Safeway is a productive and interesting day. You see have a lot of work to complete but throughout the day you meet interesting people with interesting stories. Some of them make you laugh and some of them have you thinking. I've learned a lot working at Safeway, but the one thing I learned that sticks with me the most would be having superior customer service; with having superior customer service it goes a long way with a customer. The management at Safeway are very hands with the customers and the employees. The managers always encourage their employees to do the best they can do. With working with people at Safeway everyone has the same mind frame, which is to provide superior customer service. There is no drama in the workplace, we all help each other out and encourage one another to do the best. I would say there's nothing had about being a baker at Safeway, everyday you learn something new. But what I love most about the job is meeting new people and brightening their day with superior customer service."
good,"I enjoyed working for Safeway, but to be around gasoline for 8 hrs a day, our team should have been paid more than minimum wage."
good,"A typical day at work for me was busy, busy, busy. If I didnt have anything to do at my register I worked in customer service, where they had Western Union, lottery, and a cleaners. I also went around to the different departments and performed sanitation checks to ensure the are using the proper amount of cleaning solution for the utensils. My co-workers and management was great we worked well together, a TEAM! I didnt find anything hard about this job and the most enjoyable part was the different people I ran into on the daily basis."

good,Safeway was a fun place to work at while I was in high school. The only thing I didn't like was when I got promoted to work at Starbucks. The training was horrible. I was expected to train myself when I was brand new to Starbucks. Isn't training suppose to be when someone trains you?

good,"My job at Safeway as a Dot Com Associate was an enjoyable one and a unique experience for me. My job simply involved picking groceries for the online orders that came through the store - but I also worked on the file maintenance team from time to time. I learned more about products and how the store organized and categorized them on the shelves. The management always felt on top of everything and always working hard to keep the store operating at its best. I would say that the hardest part of the job would have to be the days when we had to pick large quantities of items with minimal staff. Everything got done, but the physical labor took a toll and the hours ran late. However, I enjoyed working for a service that was great for those who could not come to the store directly to buy groceries and working with my other coworkers. I hope that other stores adopt this service as it can provide more jobs and help communities."
good,"Safeway was a major supermarket it offered dry cleaning services , lottery, photoshop, a Starbucks"

good,I joined Safeway as a part time. Later on I applied in corporate office. Safeway is very fair to the employees and a workplace culture. The most enjoyable part of my job is traveling from one store to another store and so audits.  I learned a lot about time management and dealing with different type of customers.

There is always a great number of people to help you with any questions if you are unsure about a product or trying to find it's location. I learned a lot about different hair products to different brands that customers usually come in for. The hardest thing for me at this company was finding a certain location for a item that was really it. The most enjoyable thing that I loved about working here was the customers if I was able to help out someone and just to see a smile on a customers face made me happy I love helping others.
good,"This is a great place to work. A lot of opportunities in this grocery store/pharmacy chain. For those seeking to get into management, a lot training is available as well as a pipeline in how to get to the next level. Ability to work in the corporate office and make a difference. Overall great climate to work."

good,"As a Safeway Assistant Store Manger (which I worked my way up quickly) I enjoyed the responsibility of ensuring the success of my store. My job was to maintain store operations within the departments, and tracking sales daily, and reporting on our daily, morning also evening conference calls. Reporting to my boss (Store Manager) in the morning when I walk the store when she arrived to work was an essential part of my job, reason being I was able to talk with her about things that night crew either did not do or things that I could tell were not completed the night before. Even though Safeway could get to become a stressful work environment it was easy to maintain the positive moral by continuing to encouraging my employees of a job well done, which reflected in our CSAT.

good,Never a dull moment. A typical day is fast pace and never boring.You can't help learning something new every day. The management was  hard working and notice if you are working as hard as he is. If you are a hard worker the manager would let you know that you are doing a good job.

good,Safeway was such a good experience overall. When I came in to work I was greeted by the employees all time. The management were very professional  but were always kind when giving out instructions or tasks.

After my team and I had the numbers of what baked goods there were, we began to pull par-baked breads from the freezer, set up pre-made frozen pastries/ breads that included croissants, danish, coffee cakes, ect. Due to the high volume and busy department, we would mix the scratch items in large batches and store the remaining into the freezer. These items included corn bread, pudding rings, banana and pumpkin bread, and bread pudding. Frozens scones, turnovers, strudels/straws were then set up and baked along with thousands of pre made cookies to bake off.

You are constantly doing something, bagging, sweeping, cleaning, carts, service outs, or getting something for a customer. Floral department is a little more slow pace. You help customers, water plants, clean, etc. Starbcucks is also fast paced on the busy hours! Always making drinks, cleaning, sampling, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job if it wasnt working with my employees it was definately the customers!"
good,"I began my day at work by opening the Starbucks kiosk, conducting the daily inventory, and preparing for the morning rush of customers.

good,"Safeway is just like any other retail company to work for.  You have good and bad days, good and bad customers, some co-workers who want to work, and some who just want a paycheck.  What I have learned the most from working at Safeway, is that the more you put in, the more you will get in return, whether that be by the customers, or by getting more hours from management, or anything else.  The best part of the job that I find most enjoyable is the customers.  Some of them I see once a week, twice a week, or even some everyday.  But they become like family... You get to meet the mom one day, the dad the next, sometimes the kids if they have any.  Get to talk about the family, or plans for the weekend when your bagging their groceries, and it's nice to meet and talk to them.  Now the hardest part of the job is the standing on your feet for two, three, sometimes four hours at a time before you get a chance to take a break and sit down."
good,"The Customers & Other Employees always made work a place to enjoy. There was always something to do ,and fix. It was a great environment & everybody helped each other no matter what."
good,I learned how to run the register and answer calls and answer customer concerns. I learned all the codes for produce and other products. I worked with great coworkers and very nice management.
good,"very rewarding job, from handover from night team first thing in the morning, ensuring store is ready for trading, dealing with the day to day issues that arise, working with a fantastic team to ensure a smooth day was ahead.

good,"Safeway was a good experience"
good,"Great environment, friendly and welcoming people at stores where you go in and do your assigned job without anyone bothering you or micromanaging you. The work is done at your past as long as you're not working overtime. I was able to get more familiar with certain programs such as linux and got more comfortable using command prompts. Management overall is good, they are very specific on whats expected and best ways to finish the job. They're also helpful and a call away if something should arise. The people I worked with were overall helpful and friendly, we relied on each other for assistance before calling the manager we reached out to each other to see if we had the problem before and how it was solved. The hardest part of the job was for certain jobs we worked overnight or really early in the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was going from store to store meeting new people and building relationships with them."
good,"Good pay, plenty of room for advancement.. the managers are great and employees are great people....wish there was more companies like safeway"

good,"Safeway allowed me to live my life and raise my children, it is a very good company to work for. At Safeway you feel that you have accomplished something by th end of your shift, whether it was the customer that you made a difference to or the task you were able to finish. It's always nice to go to work when you know you are appreciated, as a part of the management team I always tell my employees thank you for doing such a great job and let them know how much I appreciate them! Working for Safeway you meet a lot of friends that last a lifetime. Not just your fellow employees but your customers as well. The hardest part about working for Safeway is it is a 24 hour 7 day a week job and weekends and holidays are our busiest times. You end up missing a lot of family get togethers, birthday partys, Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners that makes it a little tough. It is all worth it Safeway Is a great company to work for."
good,"Fantastic Company to practice pharmacy for.   Upper management only manages what their managers fail to manage and there is consistent support to meet the goals.   Co-workers produce productively with little hassle from doing tasks that don't need to be done.   The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the constant influx of new customers and meeting labor standards.   The most enjoyable part is the recognition, fair shake environment, and room for advancement within the company."

good,"Safeway is a great place to work. I've been working for Safeway for the past 9 years. As a student, I worked part-time, but Safeway pays pretty good even though I was a part-time employee! Managers are very nice and worked around my school schedule all the time. Safeway gave me so many professional and interpersonal skills. One of the skills was leadership. Managers gave me the power to manage solve problems with customers. I also helped and provided training to new checkers when needed."
good,This company taught me a lot over the years. Safeway was an excellent company to work for and my co-workers from California to Nevada were always outstanding. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was dealing with the customers and interacting with them. The hardest part of the job for me was never having a steady schedule. Hours would be changed constantly. It made it more difficult to make plans in your personal life.
good,"Worked with great people and gave great customer service. Keep store clean and organized. Keep items on stock, check prices. Offer carry outs and thank by last name."
good,"Great starting job, its fast pace environment, great managers."
good,I enjoy my job everyday it is a new exprience. The customers are polite and friendly and I love talking to them. I find the employees friendly and we all get along. It is what I would consider my extended family.
good,"This was my first job that I didn't want to leave. I loved my co-workers, the customers, how busy it was, the location, and my boss.  My family had to relocate which meant I had to quit my job. There wasn't a typical day at Vons. There were everyday things that needed to be done but the day always varied. I saw daily customers that I got acquainted with and new customers I pleased. I learned certain terms on the job such as 'go-backs' and 'sweeps'. The hardest part about the job I would say would be putting carts away. Some co-workers were lazy or too busy then I end up doing them because I care about the company's review and look. It was never a big deal though. The most enjoyable part of my day was everyday. I never didn't enjoy my day. There were some rough days when the weather was windy and I was riding my bike to work. Nothing too extreme."
good,"Typical day, walking and observing my standards for my store . Greeting and comunicating with my employees about our day and our expectations for our operation! Upper management always supportive and helpful! Interaction with my co-workers, Very important to acheiving great results! My time spent daily ,lots of hours! Hardest part ! Best part was what it afforded me as far as a way of life and the pride i had !"
good,I did a short stay in the months of summer of 2010 and do not have a lot to review in connection with the jobs completed while working for Safeway.
good,"As an office clerk i became familiar with all court systems on the island, making deliveries and filing documents as necessary. everyone in the office is friendly and outgoing for the most part, high profile cases can make things tense but everyone knows their jobs very well and few problems ever became major issues. working here was by far the best work experience I could have asked for as a younger man, the benefits are amazing, and the pay fair."
good,My review to this job Is excellent. The reason why I say that Is because I had to learn how to be patience with my customers when they were on the floor or whn they are In line to pay for their groceries.
good,"At work I would make sure that all basket cars were off of the parking lot grounds and that the parking lot was well maintained. I would also handle and bag customer food and supplies at the check out station. When time allowed, I swept and cleaned my workstation in order to maintain cleanliness."
good,"good company"
good,"show up on time clock in, head over to the deli and wash hands. from there help the closet customer with a smile and ask them what they need. Ask the customer if they would like to sample anything before moving on. The management will be on other tasks setting up sales and bring in freight. For the most part you get along well with your co-workers there are few that make it hard. The most difficult part of the job is helping a customer that wants something for free, even if the product is fresh and new. The most enjoyable part about the job are the friends that are earned while working"
good,"Loves to meet many different customers, friendly co workers, learned lots of things while working."
good,good place to work on and the environment is great to interact with customers and is a good place to learn more jobs other than the one that you are hired for.
good,"During my experiences with Safeway I made many lasting friendships. I learned a great deal about team work and the proficiency needed by all members to make the department as time/work efficient as possible; I was a member who helped move work along quickly. The management in the store was great. Moreover, the management in my specific department (Deli) was excellent. My manager taught me many things about team work, organization, and day-to-day managerial duties. I enjoyed showing up everyday to see my work team, catching up on the day, then diving into my duties for the day."
good,"SAFEWAY,its a very nice,safe and a wonderful place to work.I learned lots of things ,everybody is very helpful and co operative ,ready to help in every circumstances.Management is very good and understanding ,treats every employer equally and try to help them in every manner.I had to leave safeway because i was expecting,but it was fun working in safeway."
good,I loved working at Dominck's. This is the place I learned how to be a great employee. I started working at store level from the maintenance department all the way up to district office being a pricing analyst. The hardest part was leaving after 10 years. Safeway centralized the pricing dept. to California and laid off IL. location.
good,"Working with Safeway was like being part of a big family. I loved my job, the people I worked with and more then anything our customers. I am very lucky and fortunate to have had twenty-four years with such an amazing company. ""Thank You Safeway"""

good,"better opportunity, but over all i enjoyed working at safeway."
good,"Safeway was a great opportunity for me. They trained me how to decorate cakes in the bakery. It was never dull. Safeway has great benefits & provided fun things for employees & their families to do throughout the year - some free events, some discounted ones. The only bad part about working there was some of my coworkers. They were not very selective & I was frequently working with people who were not of good moral character."

good,"It was my first job, I didn't know what I was doing. Had a panic attack the GM calmed me down and told me I was doing a good job. He was really nice, in the sincere way not the creepy way."
good,It was nice to be able to work at all the companies or locally owned businesses I've worked at it seems that this world is so fast paced that there aren't very many familiar faces to really remember due to peiple progressing in whatever path they are pyrsuing and the short period of time that I did work at the Anchorage Safeway on Gambell I can say that if i were to be a part of a team or be lucky enough to be again I'm sure that it would be the same anywhere. But my overall experience working with who I worked with I notice is based on a team effort as is anything.
good,Its based around communication skills and sense of urgency. Your never in one spot. You walk around the whole store providing help and guidance towards each individual walking through our doors.

good,its pretty much what you would expect from a grocery store job its minimum wage 4 to 8 hour shifts but everyone who works there is really nice and want whats best for you
good,"A typical day at Safeway was stressful, no lie; I worked outside in the dead heat for hours at a time gathering carts, as I was scheduled to do so. I bagged groceries for customers, dealt with customers, anything they needed a range from opening the liquor cabinet to walking groceries out to their car; Even cleaned restrooms and preformed a full floor sweep of the entire store. I learned diligence from Safeway, I rode my bike to work made sure to keep on time, any time of day I was scheduled I made sure to be there. Hardest part would be keeping up with the fast flow at times, I could be called over the intercom to clean up but there'd be a customer in need of assistance right in front of me, nothing I couldn't handle. Enjoyed my coworkers, always relied on them for help when I didn't know what to do next. there were times when I didn't have a thing to do, reaching out to them helped get my pace going."

good,"The employees are very friendly, and the work place is safe. Slow in the morning, but productive. I learned to be more respectful to the customers, and management. The bosses do a great job managing on the floor and off. The hardest part of the job for me is the carts. The most enjoyable about the job is saying high to the customers, and bagging for them."

good,"I applied as a selector, but was called by HR and they wanted to know if I would instead be interested in a pallet breaker (glorified way of saying truck cleaner) it is an EASY job according to my co workers and my experience.

I love my job"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Safeway I learned a lot, I enjoyed the interactions with the customers. I loved seeing the same people on a daily basis. I was able to work at different locations  in the store"
good,"good choice of staff canteen menu"
good,It was a great place to work and learn how to deal with cutting meat for customers. This is a place that could lead to many other opportunities but they are limited on working with a person who has challenges.
good,"Very good company to work for . Great staff , great customers. Upbeat and fast work place environment. Happy faces. Vacation time,sick pay. Willing to work with your life schedule ."
good,its like a second family. If you can hang in there it gets better every time. but you will be on your feet all day and that can be painful. Over all its a good job. Its frustrating waiting for your raises because everyone is on a contract. the bakers union has great dental and vision benefits. Most people don't know the bakery is a different union from the rest of the store. But I hate that they make the bakers wear white now. Its so hard to keep clean and not dingy looking no matter how much you wash them
good,I loved working there! Very productive & a good environment. Would definitely work there again. Nice customers & employees. I really miss working there. Would recommend to anyone.
good,"Everyday working there was worth ever minute, Supervisors were easy going , they always made sure that employees were taken care of,  and always had Satisfied customers everyday."

The managers and co workers I worked with are friendly and patient with me and if I wasn't sure how to do something they would always be around to help me complete my tasks. I learned how to bag groceries, talk to customers, complete various cleaning tasks and also complete grocery carry outs for customers. One of the great things about working at Safeway was when I was called at the customer service desk to help a blind lady shop and then escort her to the deli for her ride to come get her. A typical day at work for me consists of managing the recycling room, pushing carts and bringing them into the store, doing carry outs for customers, cleaning, taking cardboard and hand counts to the back and bagging groceries."

good,"There were usually hours available, although you could almost never get overtime. The people were all grumpy, but it really has no bearing on your job so it doesn't affect you"
good,The best part of the job is the flexibility of hours which you can work and continue your education at the same time. The worse part is the pay rate which is the minimum.3
good,"Very positive and respectful people and learned a lot, very challenging but fun, good Management good culture and not wiling to work no where else but here"
good,"Coaches, teaches, and trains employees on world-class customer service and sales skills, over 110 employees "
good,"The work was a bit of a challenge, but the environment and the staff/management were great to work with. They’re flexible with your hours and very open to communication."
good,"i learned how to shelf products make cookies , costumer service bringing in shopping carts,  make bread , flower assortments i lked the working pace and it was very fun"
good,Very Productive and professional. Safeway went above and beyond to motivate employees and lift morale at the workplace. Manager was really hard working and understanding to employees needs.The hardest part of the job was having to leave and relocate to take care of a sick family member. Overall my time at Safeway was great. I enjoyed going to work there for 7 years.
good,"Amazing group that are always read for help you. I´m truly happy  to be a part of this team."
good,Working in a Keoats in starbucks you get to not only serve the public but employees of Safeway. My favorite time at work would be Christmas because all regular starbucks are closed so we get all the costomers.

good,"I would love to keep working at Safeway/Albertsons company until I retire. I like the grocery store setting, where the customers just come in and shop around while their prescriptions are filled. Also a huge plus is the lack of drive-thru (it may not be every store)."
good,I work my way to the bottom from being a courtesy clerk to assistant manager.  It was a great experience working with all the different varieties of people and customers . I had many different roles at Safeway providing superior customer service to our  customers and employees .

good,Fast paced environment. Great coworkers. Friendly. You learn alot. Make friends. Everything is easy to find. We have a busy system but it works out great
good,"Jumping between school and work has always been a bit of challenge, but it never really happened my experiences at Safeway. The average day would consist performing one of two roles I am trained for, checking and being a courtesy clerk. Checking feels the most gratifying, with extensive interaction with the customer base, though longer shifts can make standing in almost one place a little bothesome. As a courtesy clerk, running around to assist customers and make sure the store is in the best shape possible provides some excitement to the daily routine, although at times can be somewhat repetitive."
good,They are really great other than the low pay and meaningless jobs you do day to day. It would be better if you got paid a bit more for all the work that was need to be done.

The main goal each day is to ensure we have the product the customer wants, and it is kept full and fresh on our shelves to ensure absolute satisfaction.  Due to customer volume the days can sometimes be challenging for the crew, but the effort put forth is what keeps the store in top form and keeps the customers satisfied and coming back in time and time again."

Working the was great but it came to mind that i was doing so much for this job but it wasn't paying me enough.

good,a typical day at work just pushing carts on the Safeway parking lot while the weather was at 101 degrees  outside. I learn that when you work for a store like Safeway you need to always be own top of customer service. The management was excellent  always keeping their workers happy and keeping a safely  working environment. The hard part was cleaning the restrooms when certain people made a mess. what I enjoy the most was I got to get along with everyone and they always worked around my school schedule.
good,I was able to start my working career with Safeway. Safeway always helped me with hours and good pay. I owe a lot to Safeway because I could proudly say I had a job in high school

good,"Honestly, I hated working here as a courtesy clerk. I feel like you do not get paid enough to be running around all dang day without a break. It's also not a good job for young girls. I was harassed every single day by customers when I would go outside to push carts. Do not recommend this job."

good,"I miss working at Safeway/Vons, great opportunity to grow as individual and career wise.  It just takes time for advancement due to people not leaving the company as often. The shifts can be difficult due to constant change for coverage. Can be strenuous on the family due to the constant change or working weekends, nights and holidays."
good,"I loved working with the company, they hired me super fast and made sure I was treated well and my pay was awesome as well. The site was easy to use. :)"

good,I worked there for 6 years. I worked my way all the way to be a jounry man cashier. If you are looking for a place to start your first job this is where to go. You get benifets and 401k and stocl options
good,"Cash office is a position that allows me to work by myself in a back office while handling and processing cash. Typically cash office is only for a few hours and is done before the store opens. It isn't hard, but it is a lengthy and detailed process and there are steps that must be taken in order or else the whole process will have errors. Typically you count the safe, change drawer and registers making sure they balance, followed by preparing deposits(check and cash), advancing drawers, then opening registers and receiving manager approval before store doors open to the public. I learned a good amount, mainly understanding how the money and registers are prepped for the day. The hardest part of the job would be having to find missing money and fixing the errors of others when there isn't a lead on what could have happened. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work without supervision, and being allowed the time to complete and focus on the task at hand."

I learned how to test water and other substances required to clean with. Management was great! The hardest part of the job was just standing all through shifts, i am an active person so it was not THAT hard.most enjoyable apart of the job was meeting new customers daily fro mall around the world."

good,Typical day at work is dealing with a lot of different personalities and cultures.  Store are busy but are kept clean and safe.  Good environment to work in.

good,"A typical day is making sure everything is running straight and every customer is satisfied. Working at this company showed m e every customer has specific needs so each person needs to be handled carefully. The job was great, though the hardest part was having so many mangers."
good,"This job really kept me busy with the amount of hours they give me. There were pretty lenient with giving you the days off that you need. I ended up working there for almost 3 years and I had a weeks paid vacation for working a year. This job gave me skills to work customer service, floral, produce, pharmacy, check stand, and of course curtesy clerk. I developed a lot different skills from working at one company."

good,"Safeway being a union is absolutely amazing but unfortunately when I was employees through them I was only the age of 16 so I was unable to have there benefits but I did still how ever have to pay for them (union dues). The work environment for Safeway was some what kind of hostile though, working for Safeway there is a lot of childish gossip in the work environment. The hardest part of the job would be being a courtesy clerk and having a full mental list (and a literal list) on what people need and what needs to be done (because you are helping everyone, all the employees and customers)."
good,"Safeway is a great starter job or lifer job, the insurance was great, they have great people working there, they fallow all laws and care very much about they're people even after they leave.

good,It was a very independent work environment. You didn't have a boss tell you what to do every single day. The co-workers were all very excited and happy most of the time. I believe the hardest part of the job was just delivering on time under certain circumstances that happened because of packaging by the store. One thing I did enjoy the most was having to be out in the road by myself while working.

good,A great company to work for I got good hours and the company promoted me within one year of employment. I would recommend working for this company to anyone.
good,Safeway was my first job other than babysitiing. We were busy all day long but it made the day go by fast. I worked in different parts of the store which I loved because it gave me experience. Management was very direct and knew how to make you feel like your doing a great job. They were very open about everything. My co workers were all older than me so it was kind of easy fitting in seeing as they wanted me to be successful at my job. The hardest part of my job was working late nights. I was still in school and sports so I was usually exhausted by the time I arrived at work. I excelled in everything I did at Safeway which made it the best work experience for me.

good,"I really enjoyed going into work and cleaning up and organizing everything as well as assisted with answering phones and filing. Run by awesome people, over all great place to work"
good,"Safeway is a great place to work. Since the store is always busy, your shift flies by and before you know it, its time to go home. The management works well with your availability and they listen to your concerns. I think the hardest part of this job at times would be the amount of people you have to serve by yourself. You don't want the customer you're helping to feel rushed, but you also don't want other customers to wait too long."

I love helping others anything to help them leave happy to make them want to come back tomorrow."

good,"I started to work for Safeway Inc. when I was in High School.  They were very accommodating with my school schedule and continue to be to this day.  At Safeway Inc. I have had the opportunity to work with some great people and some not so easy going.  I feel like this has taught me some very important problem solving skills.  When I walk into the door for work I clock in and begin giving great customer service.  I believe that the customer is who pays me therefore I try to make everybody's shopping experience the best to make customers want to come back.  My co-workers are a good bunch of people to work with and tend to be very welcoming.  Management changes every so often at Safeway but, the management team we have currently is one of the best I have worked with my entire career at Safeway Inc. I would say the most enjoyable part of my job is customer interaction.  Some days your attitude can completely change the way somebody's day is going.  Therefore I try my best to keep a great attitude because if all it takes to make somebody's day better is smiling and treating them nicely why not spread the good energy.  I would say the hardest part is keeping up the good energy because when your standing for 8 hours a day and people are not treating you very nicely then its hard to keep a positive attitude."
good,"A typical day at Safeway for me begins by driving around to the nearest fuel stations and writing down there gas prices, this will help the system determine our gas prices for the day. After the fuel survey I hand count all of the money that is in my safe and put it in a deposit bag for Gaurda to pick up. I've learned a lot about the professional way to speak to one of my employees and a lot of great strategies to get everyone on the same page and working. The hardest part of my job is finding employees who want to work in the fuel station, I receive little to no applications and am very understaffed but it isn't anything I can't handle. The most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing my employees succeed, before I came to there store they hadn't had a manager in four months. They needed a ton of retraining and organization and to see them open for new rules and welcoming me to there team is by far the most enjoyable part."
good,This was my first job in high school and by the time i graduated I had worked my hourly wage up to 8.75 before college. Management was often understanding with scheduling and if you worked overtime they had no issue of granting it. The hardest part was working till midnight during the summer and no one coming in at all.
good,"Dealing with employee payroll, scheduling, hiring, firing daily, learned the value of a challenging work place with a friendly staff and ability to get help when needed"
good,My typical day at Vons would be coming in either in the morning or afternoon preparing all food for customers. Our friendly smiling faces is our number one key in our customer service it is my goal to make sure every customer that I had received left w a smiling face and is anxious to come back. My co workers and I had very good communication skills we understand that communication is the number one things it is very important we work together to keep everything clean fresh and organized for our customers to re assure that we are serving them the best service in town. The hardest part about my job would probably be making sure we do not run out of anything! we always need to make sure we have everything in stock at all times. Sometimes that could be a little hard when your not in control of delivery and inventory which is another reason communication in our deli is so important. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to help my customers and make sure they are being served w 100% genuine and sincere customer service being able to connect with them on a personal level to try to help them figure out the healthiest alternative for them. I love being able to help my customers and make sure they leave smiling when my customers are the happiest I am the happiest and being able to resolve any issue that may be at hand and making it better re assuring that every time we will do our best.

I learned a lot from them and working with them means embracing the culture. The culture of giving excellent customer service is what my team is aiming every single day, because we all believe that a satisfied customer will always come back. However, the greatest challenge is listening to people and paying attention to what they need. But keeping the goal in focus always guides me in dealing all these parts of the game.
