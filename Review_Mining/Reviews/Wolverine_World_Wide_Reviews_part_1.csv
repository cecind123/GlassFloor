bad,"This place should have gone out of business a long time ago, the owner is crooked and cuts as many corners as he can to make a profit and isn't even good at doing that."
bad,"Probably could have a been a great place to work, however the DM in the Upper Midwest in not someone anyone would want to work with. I really liked everybody else at the company though, especially the regional and national managers."
bad,"not a good environment, backwards and unaware of trends. chasing an existing market rather than creating one. mediocre product offering and lack of marketing investment"
bad,This company would fire you in an heart beat and think nothing of it. Everything is fine until you get sick and then they throw you away like you a trash.
bad,"Wolverine world wide is no longer a company within the area. I worked there over 5 years. When they went down hill and had to adjust shifts giving people a chioce change shifts or quit with minimum payout and ridding of anyone that didn't work to their agenda, I lost faith in the company. Surprised they lasted years after."
bad,The company had a horrible habit of misusing the employees there. There was never any actual employee appreciation when sales goals were met or if you went out of your way to help the store look positive as a whole.
bad,"So i worked at WWW for about a year, Not only was the management a joke, they had unrealistic expectations. They dont care if you get hurt but only if you get the job done"
bad,My District manager was a nightmare. She lived nearby so she would always come in and micromanage and be a stickler about this that and the other. Couldnt handle her fake personality. Had to go.
bad,"The manager was rude, coworkers were all stuck up, they never had hours for me, only called me when the needed me for about 3-4 hours. Minimum wage salary."
bad,It's basically a sweatshop where the workers don't matter only the product going out. Horribly ran and poor excuse of leadership.  Double standard with women.
bad,I love working with people and kids. There is nothing wrong within the company. I learned alot about kids because of this company
bad,"I worked for WWW in BR over the summer and it is honestly a terrible place. The hours are long, OT is suddenly sprung upon you, (I don't mind the extra hours) and the people that work there are all very rude and unintelligent. I've worked in a few factories, and honestly the only way to describe most of the workers is ""white trash"" because they are the scum you see climbing out from under rocks when something happens that they want to see in town."
bad,"Just really poor management to be honest. No hours. but you get to talk to a lot of people if youre into that like I am."
bad,"I was very optimistic when I first stated, until I started having issue with a coworker whom I was presented to me as a assistant manager."
bad,"Since the company was sold multiple times it has no direction.  Management has no idea what is going on half the time.  Company does not like to hire within so there is no growth.  People in upper management positions are not interested in their employees only customer service scores.  Hours are being cut all the time and tasks are always multiplying.  Stores are understaffed and moral is low,"
bad,"On the Friday of my second week there, they called me before work saying they didnt need me anymore. Dont on working here if you want a job that lasts longer than two weeks."
bad,Since the acquisition the culture has changed.  There was a big reorg which impacted many people.
bad,"i left a great job for what i thought was going to be another great job turned out i was wrong. these were a rude group of people. i was not able to fire anyone because they were a close nit bunch and everyone turned on me pretty much my first day. the owners were absolutley NO help. They left me out to dry...lucky for me i my old job missed me so i was able to go back no harm no foul, but i have never shopped in a Stride Rite shoes since that awful esperience."
bad,"Made schedule to insure we would not get breaks, anyone who went above managers head with issues was fired."
bad,Too many to explain. I worked for them for 13 years and they let me go stating I messed up an order which they never would show me where I messed up but they gave me 8 weeks of servence pay and unemployment.
bad,"If I could put no stars, that’s what I would put. Management is horrible. I wouldn’t want to work under someone that calls their associate names. Who wants to work in that atmosphere? Hated every minute of it."
bad,Hostile work environment that creates animosity with staff. Management is lacking any kind of management skills and just hangs out. Sad for what used to be an awesome company.
bad,"Pay is low, management is abusive of employees, with an expectation of six day, under 30 hour work weeks expected with very low pay. Corporate constantly changes policies on the fly, and no day follows the same rules as the last."
bad,I worked there for a year as a temp kept watching people with less experienced get hired. When i asked why i got a phone call from the temp service saying my job had ended after being laid off and being called back 3 times already. They also don't like it if you have to leave early if something happens to your children even though it was only once! Your a temp. You have to wait until they like you to get hired and even at that. Unless you have family or kiss butt they don't hire you!
bad,"Working for Wolverine was one of the most horrible experiences I've had at a job. Training is non existent, the supervisors do not even talk with you or help you at all. If you are a female you will be sexually harassed and do not expect anyone to do anything about it. I myself was harassed by several different people and when I told my supervisor nothing was done. Other worker here are rude and about as smart as a box of rocks who also love drama. If you were just hired here..... good luck! Oh and it's hot as hel."
bad,The people didnt know how to train. just the supervisor is dumber then a box of rocks and had no clue what was going on
bad,Management is poor and talks behind employees back. Cannot be trusted. Depending on department it can vary the hours. They hide benifits and feel you are wrong if you ask certain questions.
bad,What hate the most was everything never ever work here there users there selfish try to like it but cant just sucks it is trash so work at burger king
bad,"Stride Rite Children's Group Distribution Center in Brookville, OH has a leadership team that lacks integrity, leadership skills and professionalism. A work day at Stride Rite is like a day in middle school. They spend their lunch break in the break room watching The Young and the Restless and even refer to the break room as ""The Victor Newman Room""."
bad,"The culture at WWW was very negative.  Highly competitive, lack of empowerment, and very little opportunity for career growth.  Senior leadership lacks the strategy to really move this company in the right direction.  Ping pong tables, casual clothes and drinks in the office do not make up for the constant restructuring and micromanagement leadership styles that are reinforced from the top down.  The best talent is leaving for other opportunities - of which there are plenty."
bad,"Hard work, love the kids.  Nice to have parents call to see if you were working because they only want you to fit child's foot!  Manager was nice.  Not much room to grow in company."
bad,As a company I didn’t understand why they couldn’t keep anyone they hired until I got there the district manger they was promoted while i was there was terrible she was a condescending B
bad,A fast pace environment with doing many different jobs.  I processed credit card payments daily.  I authorized checks to various accounts.  I answered the phones.  I also did what ever was needed to be done.  The hardest part of the job was that there was no overtime allowed.  I really enjoy inputting data and doing paperwork.
bad,Going in to see my lovely coworkers which are so fun to work beside selling shoes /making sure they fit properly and engaging in conversations with the customers who always come there because of the service is very nice and refreshing.Hardest part of the Job is when the customers sometimes leave out because they cant find what they need.We don't like to disappoint the customers.Most enjoyable part is when the customers take surveys about the customer service and the put my name in there complimenting me the good service and how they were happy with what they left out with.I learned the more you talk to people you can find out what they like and don't don't like just by spending a few minutes with them.My Manager is just the sweetest she brought us presents for the good work.I like working with my coworkers because we are like a family there which makes the work environment much easier.
bad,"Pay isn't fair. Jobs are ridiculous and the team leaders are very rude. not long enough breaks and you cant leave on lunch. Only thing I liked was they provided lunch, of course you had to pay for it."
bad,"i didnt like it one bit. nothing was ever organized. my manager didnt know how to deal with our costumers on a day like black friday. other than that my job was to keep the store clean at all time, i learned how to ship and receive, to conference calls."
bad,"If you want to feel young again, or like your back in high school this is the place for you. This store has a great product but sadly the management team has no idea how to sell it. The manager has no skill beyond sitting on her phone, the key holder is always sick. There is so much drama in a store that just opened a month ago. If your really good at being a brown noser Id say go for the job."
bad,"A typical Monday with Stride Rite.  9:30 - 9:30 . one iron once a week.  Open  the  registers, do the paperwork, walk the floor store open at 10:00. Monday morning customers, the one who knows what she want then you have the needy on let's me have all of your attention. Whichever one you were  you got great customers service. District Manager from 1999 to 2009 was a great team leader.the not so fun part of the job, alarm 300 pairs of shoes in a day by yourself. The enjoyable competition who will make goal and sale the most shoe..."
bad,My store was run by a man who used his staff to his advantage. I worked 12 hours a few days a week so he could be doing things in his personal life. I also had to do all the paperwork and inventory items as there was no one else to do it. I would come in on my days off to open for people because they did not have a key was not given one prior- I was the closest to the store. There was little to no training minus a few videos here and there and booklets. We staff members took care of all inventory issues and customer service issues.
bad,"The owner was extremely rude, no PTO, always blamed anything going wrong to the new person there (which was myself at the time), managers will steal your sales so they can meet their goals."
bad,"The typical day at this job was stressful because of the people that I worked with. However, I did learn how to measure feet, hot to stock shelves, and I got more experience on the cash register. The most enjpable pert of this job were the the kids they always cheered me up."
bad,"nada mucho que contar, ventas en retail, lo mismo de todos los dias"
bad,"not enough hours for me to work, I traveled far distance for very little pay and hours. sometime shoes were in organized and customers would get upset because we would be looking for the box of shoes in the warehouse , or we didn't have the shoe and customer would be upset because ewe had to order from another store and have it shipped to their homes"
bad,"In my opinion, Stride Rite was more of a dictatorship than an employment. You were given no options or flexibility in your schedule, they would schedule you for mandatory overtime without notifying you until 30 minutes before your shift as supposed to end. If you had mandatory overtime on one of your days off, it was your responsibility to check the schedule and they wouldn't inform you of it. The Area Manager was always focused on the negative aspects of our work, and we rarely got any good feedback from him. The store manager treated everybody like she was above all of us. She was very demeaning and condescending, belittling, and rude."
bad,Working at stride rite was the worst. Only thing i took was learning how to manage a store and team. I disliked the way the store manager handled situations. and was forcing me to come in to work on days I was at school knowing from day one that I was a full-time college student.
bad,"I worked at the Center Valley location for 1 year and 11 days and it was the worst job I ever had, including working in cleaning at DorneyPark and Wild Water Kingdom. A typical day at work including forever unpacking shipment that the manager didn't feel like unpacking, dealing with parents who were rude, and trying to do all of this at the same time. I learned that I deserved way better than that ""job"". Management was great when I started, but then the manager left and the assistant took over. She was absolutely terrible and was defiantly trying to get rid of me. The district manager was extremely rude and degrading towards me, and I only met him once. The manager was always giving me false hopes of a better position, like full-time, which is what I needed at the time. But no, full-time high school kid full-time key-holder position and a college adult don't all because the other one was pregnant. I was there longer and had better qualifications. The manager simply didn't like me of my religion, and she said that multiple times. The workplace culture was horrible. The hardest part of the job was the entire job. There was no enjoyable part. The paycheck was mesely and I barely got hours... I also wrote a letter of resignation that went to corporate and down the line and never heard anything. I could have sued the company for many things. Glad this location was shut down."
bad,"They only cared about the quantity and not the quality of the boots. We were treated in humanly as workers cussed at and talked down to if we did not get our numbers out. Workers are injured and the lie and try to blame it on the worker , But in all honesty there machines are unsafe. I would not go back to work for them, they also encourage the line leaders to scream at the employees and they will get a raise. If other employees treat other employees wrongfully the also reward that awful employee."
bad,"Very Hard to have a day off to yourself. They would call you in on your day off, every single time you had one off."
bad,Recently bought out by Wolverine World Wide. Hopefully it will recover from the Collective Brand years when the brand was degraded. Staff morale hit rock bottom and company is still over-stored. Major store closures are needed.
bad,"My experience with Stride Rite was awful! After my first store manager got promoted to store manager for a boutique store, they brought in a new store management from outside with no people skills, allowed her her full time pay even though she only scheduled herself to work maximum of 3 days her week and scheduled me overtime (unwillingly) to work her 2 other days every week! I would often be scheduled a split shift (opening for 4 hrs, 2-3 hr “lunch”, then close the store), and when I complained (many times) to the area manager, nothing was ever done!! It was awful!!"
bad,"Learning about the product when the Information is given,management does not pass on information to each other so that everyone is on the same page. Hardest part of most days was when part time associates new what was going on in the store more than all the managers did.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with the product we had .  With as little information that was given to us"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of assisting consumers via phone/email with orders, product info, refunds, promo codes, etc.issues.Also,  filing claims for lost packages with FedEx and following up with them and consumer.  Workplace culture is not great. It's very cliquish.  Training seems extensive and great at first. However, once you are out on the floor you are told 10 different ways to do one particular thing from different supervisors; one tells you you are right another tells you you are wrong. It is endless inconsistencies."
bad,"Boring"
bad,Upper management does not consider family life or a balanced work place/ home life.  Compensation for an excellent employee is not considered.  This company's CEO is only concerned about the bottom line not the employees that are great and make the bottom line grow every year.
bad,Manager is very unprofessional. Co-workers are nice but agree its not the best company. It is a very slow store and does not make a lot of money.
bad,I was told along with 30 of my coworkers that our services were no longer necessary. Effective June our positions were eliminated. No stay bonus no nothing.
bad,Poor management while I worked here.  Manager did not work hour expected.  Frequently came in late and left early.  Expected staff to do most of the work while she sat in back room on her phone most of the day.
bad,"Not the best job to have when you have a family. Pay isn't good, and days off they call you into work. The company is more about making money then paying their employees better."
bad,Worked there my senior year in high school. It was neither slow or faced paced. I enjoyed working with the little kids that came in for shoes. The best part of the job was seeing the smiles  on their faces.
bad,"It is not easy working with kids, parents, and over priced shoes. Staff should be trained on how to deal with misbehaving children and lax arrogant parents better. The strain between respecting customers and respecting merchandise was not worth the money."
bad,"Job was  boring, slow and no energy within the organization. A dead end job with very low pay and no benefits or chance for advancement"
bad,I didn't hate working there. It was an ok place to work. The biggest problem was management they didn't care about customers. We constantly were battling with them.
bad,"Expectations high, low staffing. Too many conference calls long hours. Job became the only thing I had time for not structured enough to have great sales"
bad,They constantly make people redundant and employ mediocre external candidates instead of promoting successful internal employees. It's easier to to get a promotion by talking about yourself rather than being good at your job. HR and most directors are clueless.
bad,"Great for advancements."
bad,"I was in high school and played softball, my manager had a hard time scheduling my work schedule around that when I made sure to tell her I’m my interview that I had prior engagements."
bad,There are both amazing employees and occasional directional leaders.  The challenge is that they change management and direction constantly.  Each time they change management they lay off people rather than train and grow their employees.  Morale is low because job security is so low.  Low job security in turn often makes the employees turn on each other to save themselves....this makes team work tricky.
bad,The management wasn’t good at all. Our manager promoted someone who was only there for a few weeks to be assistant manager and he never did anything he just told people what to do. Even before he was assistant manager.
bad,"For the 5 years I've worked for this company; I took in shifts and covered people for other stores and managed my own schedule. I came in on days I didn't  have to work and overall they did appreciate it, I received 1 raise only because I work too many hours and it was costing the company too much money to pay me overtime,  Not because I was a dedicated associate. Certain managers liked to leave early or not come in because they knew they were a higher authority from their team members, The mangers would make the schedule for what convenient for them so they don't have to close, Which would leave the same associate to close every night."
bad,"a typical day at work:"
bad,It is a very stressful place to work. I feel you do not work your way up in the company from your merits of work. It is done by favorites of the supervisors.
bad,A portfolio of brand that are footwear centric.  Global distribution network.  Offices located in Rockford MI and Waltham MA.  Established culture with a emphasis on revenue growth and profitability.
bad,the place runs like no one knows what they are doing.  they don't appreciate anything you do for them.  you don't get paid for the amount of work you do.
bad,"Worked at Saucony on a contract, never felt a part of the team. There was little to no work to be done, no promise of growth, poor communication, and poor relationship with upper management. They are going through a transitional period, but many people left in the short time I was there and executive positions were just being filled at the beginning of 2019."
bad,"No proper training or work information provided. Turnover is very high"
bad,"Unsteady traffic, usually slow. I worked by myself a lot, which I did not like, especially when I closed the store by myself. During the summer I usually worked a lot more hours, during the fall/winter sometimes I would only work one or two shifts in a two week period."
bad,The staff was rude and they threw all their work on me. I wasn't trained good so it made working hard. the girls were all rude once I got there. kinda acted like I was 12.
bad,"Very old equipment, good maintenance group to work with."
bad,this company wasn't where management thought they should be so if  made the employees suffer. no matter how hard you worked if was never enough. management would never reply
bad,was only temporary they laid me off then called me back but i had already found a permanent job. so i didn't go back there. i have since moved out of the area
bad,Get ready to work every weekend and sundays open to close. Get ready to be under paid and under appreciated. Most managers stick there nose in the air to you and no one there will be your friend don't trust what they say. Our store closed a year after I started after being lied to for many months. No room for advancement and upper management is even worse.
bad,"It was alright but they didn't want to advance anybody out of temp service.  Therefore we were never able to get benifets. Coworks were pretty cool though, with little drama."
bad,"The job was a night shift because the company only operates at night this was hard for almost every worker because half of the workers where asleep. The good thing about the Job was that when the was working, the teamwork was actually visible."
bad,It was a great place to work till a new CEO took over and the culture changed as well as peoples attitudes. An overall attitude of fear of loosing jobs and people not happy to be working there.
bad,The job gets very monotonous. Not a lot of thought process is needed to complete the daily tasks. Pick shoe orders in a timely manner
bad,Decent place to work if you need money. Only certain jobs would pay well enough for easy living. Only a very select number of jobs that would provide above the poverty level and labor grades would be adjusted without any notice or explanation
bad,Wolverine paid a decent salary and had acceptable benefits.  They lacked in providing a work-life balance and are way behind most employers in today's world.
bad,It was retail management. Our company was bought by Wolverine with the intention of closing the retail part of the business but continuing to sell wholesale and online only.
bad,Stride rite is weird to work at. Typically I would be alone in the store for the night shift and by the next day I would get yelled at by the manager for no reason .
bad,"It's an okay place to work.  Benefits are great.  Need to overhaul in certain areas.  They need to start holding employees responsible for their actions or lack of action.  Plus give positive feedback and possible compensation to the employees who are doing other employees duties along with their own.  If they would practice those things, a lot of good employees would have stayed instead of leaving the company."
bad,"If you're just entering the job market, this is a good job for you. Very easy, not many responsibilities, the most difficult part is learning to use the register so that says a lot."
bad,This is not somewhere to stay. This is a place for college or highschool students looking for some cash and flexible nearly no hours to get by. I stayed there for 3 years and got a couple cents increase. I took on lots of extra shifts and there was no room for growth. I could not move up with the company.
bad,Merrell did not do a good job of budgeting payroll so the store managers could complete their ops tasks and actually take time to drill down and analyze metrics because they made the store managers work like sales associates.
bad,"THis was a sesonal position and very un- organized, i was always on my feet and could not preform at my best because of the enviroment."
bad,I enjoyed my time with company and live to work with these great funny children. The smiles on their faces used to make my day even when I had a bad day.
bad,only manager and assistant are full time....constantly recruiting because people are leaving for more hours...closing down many locations.............
bad,I love the people I work with. I only wish that I could get more hours and more money. You never get anything as promised except a hard time. Nothing good is noticed but if you do the littlest thing wrong your reamed for it.
bad,"Lots of benefits including WFH, Parental leave, stellar medical benefits.  Great culture being built.  Management is unrealistic about work load, has poor project management skills and is reactive to the needs of the business all causing unexpected hours, travel etc..."
bad,"I'm my first day on the job, my manager asked me to smoke weed with him on my break. Children puked on me, urinated on me, and bit me. None of these days was I allowed to change or go home early. I ended up getting a better job opportunity and leaving."
bad,"I thought I would really like this job because I enjoy communicating with customers and informing them on their choices of our product, but the employees and management were tough to deal with. The manager at the time was very rude to me for asking simple questions or making small mistakes, when this was my first job ever. On top of that, the employees were very catty and talked about you behind your back, which the manager actually encouraged by joining in. All in all, I would not recommend this position."
bad,The work at Wolverine is Easily accomplished but leadership and management is lacking.
bad,"Horribly stressful place to work I would never in a million years work there again. Never knew when u could go home because of quota, pay not worth it, people are horribly mean."
bad,This company gave me everything that I needed to become a good Manager and allowed me to make tough decisions and supported me in the decisions that needed to be made.
bad,"Poor Leadership but easy job if your looking for somewhere to punch in and out.  Leadership does not know how to win or hold people accountable.  Not bad but no great, don't look to make a difference here."
bad,"I didn't work here very long. Here's why...."
bad,"Stride Rite is going downhill... fast."
bad,Days at work were great when you were helping the customer but when there are no customers the job sucks i learned at the job that working with friends will never work management was just lazy and bossy co-workers were great if their friend wasn't working with them most hardest part was working when friends were working with you
bad,"If you get injured at work they make you continue to work, or if they let you go get a bandage, they dock your pay for it."
bad,"while helping customers was just fine, the management left MUCH to be desired."
bad,After hurting my back on the job was put medical leave for one week. this place did not pay me for this week of absents because they require you to be off of work for more than one week. I was told that they could not accommodate to my medical restrictions and that is why I had to be put on medical leave I was told there was no sit down jobs. A few week later after returning a similar situation happened to another employee who they found a sit down job for.
bad,Words can not express how strict and over whelming this work establishment is.
bad,"Liked the job alot cool people to work with ,hours were great,  nice enverment, lots of jobs to learn but only thing I didn't like was they were very sneaky you would think that when get hired on you would have to take a drug test and not a random test almost 3 months later. Especially when someone is driving epuipment."
good,"If you wanna work somewhere where no one comes in and the few who do come in dont  buy the ugly clothes and you only get 8 hours when they promised 25+, here's the place"
good,"Working at Merrell is somewhat unique but at the same time a typical retail job. The uniqueness of the job is the location of the store. It is located in the busy Union Square area of San Francisco and this is the hub for tourists to walk about. Merrell is so famous internationally that they immediately come in after noticing our store. This gives us an opportunity to converse with so many internationals and this makes the job much more enjoyable. "
good,"To excel at Stride Rite, Inc, one must be very compatible with children. Some of the children can be very enjoyable and make the work day speed through. Have to love Kids' Feet!!!"
good,Stride Rite was a good company to work for until it was sold to another company. From there the company quality and care for their employees and customers dwindled. This is probably why the company went under. Every day was different at Stride Rite the amount of customers that I dealt with in a day varied. Customer service skills is useful in any environment. I loved working with the children every day helping them pick out the best shoes. I didn't find anything about this job hard.
good,"Wolverine Worldwide lacks the ability to evolve with the times as other retail industries have. On it's current path, the retail side of the company will implode. The company lacks the ability to implement brick and mortar saving strategies like enterprise selling. Don't expect to be working for the cutting edge of the industry. If you don't want to develop or advance, this job is perfect for you. While I've had the pleasure of working with some great people in this company, the company as a whole is not built to grow. I've never seen a manager become a district manager."
good,"Overall a good place to work, but there is no growth for me in the company, unless I go to a different department. Most of the team members are friendly but tend to gossip and back bite others."
good,"Very little opportunities to advance within the company, and the company cares absolutely nothing about family and commitments other than getting product out the door. Managers do not manage people or process problems, its the same today as it was 15 years ago."
good,"The job required 45 plus hours, had a difficult time balancing a life with this job."
good,"It was a very slow-paced job, I met the manager at a different job of mine when she offered me the position. I was only ever working with either her or the assistant manager. The store manager was fun to be around and easy to talk to but the assistant manager was judgmental and inflexible. The customers who came in were rude and entitled and I was left in charge of the store for up to two hours by myself with minimal training while the managers took long breaks. After only a few months of working there, the location closed down and I had to leave the position."
good,Managers were sometimes not scheduled to work on busiest days. Manager arrived and left whenever they pleased. Pay was very poor in comparison to all the work and responsibility needed to conmplete jobs.
good,"If you want an unsteady company to work for work here! There is a high unprofessionalism trait with the managers that work here and a high turnover rate, meaning they work you into the ground because they cannot find any more members to hire for almost four months at a time!"
good,I was always busy with something at Stride Rite. The day went by quickly and I enjoyed the flexible hours. However my management was not to par and often had her employees complete her tasks.
good,"decent for a part time job, but you really should be making a commission for all of the work you do. customers are annoying, but thats not the company's fault"
good,"very disrespectful customers "
good,Sold and re-sold . Company is not concerned with store staff only upper management.
good,"It’s easy work, the same thing over and over every single day until the questions the customers ask drive you insane. Management makes insane goal demands  that are never hit. The actual turn over rate (once employed by Wolverine) is low which they pride themselves on, but the temps come and go so fast that by the time you know their name, they’re gone. It’s also promised that you’ll be hired on once you hit your goals for 2-4 months but you usually don’t get hired on until the 7-9 month mark.  The coworkers cause drama, which makes you feel right at home if you’re used to a high school type environment."
good,Designing at Merrell was a great experience.  I enjoyed the culture and the people. I was able to travel to some great places. the leadership team could use some help.
good,"People are very unhappy there.  The President sneaks in, doesn't greet the employees.  Nobody talks to each other.  Everyone has their headphones in and won't interact."
good,Too little time for product development. Stiff competition in management. Too many bosses. Lower level under staffed. Plant not up to code. Employees kept in the dark about company goals.
good,"Procedures would change without notification. Register system periodically broke down. No real support given to team. Changed hierarchy numerous times. It was almost as if the company had plans to close this location, as well as other locations, for quite awhile."
good,"My experience with this company has been average at best. My experience in the Woodbury commons location was not what I expected, much of the work load was put on people who worked hard as it is, but nto much benefits came from it. People who did nto work hard were pampered more than those who did. There was no balance across the board and hard work was not recongized and acknowledged enough by management perosnally. I left the compnay due to bad management and over working with pay equal to that of new associates despite expreince in the compnay and much of the grunt work coming from myself."
good,"Your perception of the company will greatly depend on what Brand and or Department you work in.  Every manager runs things their own way with little to no regard for ""Corporate Policy""."
good,"Upper management and corporate never on the same page, very low pay for management positions, co-workers were great, a lot of micro managing if you're into that sort of thing."
good,"I worked at Stride Rite for a little over a year and to be honest that was longer than I had planned on working there. I tried to get full time when I was hired to which I was told there wasn't anything available only to be working there 6 months and a new employee was hired full time... After that I sort of gave up on the job, I stopped trying to advance in the company as it was difficult to and the work culture was getting very over whelming. It was beyond ridiculous during the holidays and people would be real nasty when all we were trying to do was to help them find the perfect shoes for their kids. I've learned to never apply for a job directly dealing with parents and their children, it is by far the worst job I have ever had to deal with. After I got pregnant I found it even more difficult to work there, as customers did not seem to have any sympathy when I would explain that I could not do certain things on the job due to my pregnancy. You would think if your main customers are parents that they would understand why you can't do a certain thing at work due to being heavily pregnant. For the most part the kids were the best part of my job, it was the parents that were the bummer for me. I was asked many times by customers to babysit their children as they shopped, we are a shoe store not a daycare. I worked there part time and with a mixed and crazy schedule with absolutely no benefits/low pay. This is not a long term career job, strictly a job to earn some money for the time being. This company was hard to take seriously after they would constantly change policies, dress"
good,"Same as Sperry "
good,no one cares about how you are the shift leaders only care about meeting a quota they dont care about how co-workers feel or what they have going on in their families
good,"Busy and very active. What I've learned is being short and to the point, getting your work done on time and giving great customer service. Very strict.  Co-workers were very efficient with there work and getting it done. Hardest part of the job was finding the miss placed shoes. Being in an environment that reminds me of my childhood."
good,fue mi primer trabajo formal al cual le guardo cariño por el personal mas no por como se manejo laboral .....
good,"It has been an experience. I liked Wolverine Worldwide in the middle portion of my employment. "
good,"Great place to work, free coffee, management approachable, learned a lot on inventory control and in transit inventory accounts working with SAP."
good,"If the location that I was working at wasn't in the process of closing that location only to re-open it within the same month, an average work day might not have been so bad."
good,Budgets and lack of direction was extremely critical.  There was an extremely high turnover and lack of professional tools.  The position lacked financial backing making it complex and unsupportable.
good,Stride Rite unfortunately wasn't around very long once I was employed.  However I enjoyed the chance to make extra money if you made rate or went over.
good,They restructured the Upper company while I was employed and everything fell apart. Management in store was a revolving door. They were unhappy at all times and took it out on employees. Hi theft with no care. Rude to customers and we're never talked to but if a customer complained about and average employee we were demeaned retrained and it held over our heads for weeks
good,if i had to say anything about wolverine i would say that is was a fast paced job that you needed to be on your toes at all times.the management was helpful in many ways. the hardest part of the job would have to have been the pace we were expected to work at. the most enjoyable part of my jobs would have to have been getting to learn all the jobs that i had by doing instead of watching and being able to push out the shoes in a timly manner
good,"They were a great company to work for then corporate America took over.  Low quality shoes, lack of product, store reviews that had not bearing on staff.  Pay was good but Management need to work every weekend/holiday - not good for families.  Stores are closing on a monthly basis."
good,not very organized with the temp service and very rude security not enough job placement but it was a paycheck and it pais the bills
good,WWW has many wonderful and talented individuals working there. The work life balance is poor. Unfortunately it is common when someone leaves the company to pass on those responsibilities to coworkers or direct reports instead of filling the position. It was a great place to work.
good,"A typical day at work for me involves opening, cleaning the store, checking email for instructions, greeting customers, explaining promotions, measuring the feet of their children, bringing them the shoes, checking out customers at the register, opening shipment, taking care of stock, and closing the store. My manager is a pleasure to be around, as well as my co-workers. I have not had any issues with anyone at my job. The only reason I would consider my workplace stressful is because there is always so much to be done in a day's amount of time. Most of the time my work team and I are able to complete our work, but it is sometimes very difficult because we have a small staff. The hardest part about my job is taking care of customers and their children while preparing for a new promotion, especially when there aren't many of us working. The most enjoyable part of my job is gaining the trust of parents and satisfying them with a happy child and shoes that meet their needs."
good,I feeled good their work experience is nice their their is no harder in the job I have left my job due to shifting myhose at islamabad so I have need a new job...
good,"Its a factory what else can you expect. You stitch shoes, boots for other companies, Unless you know a supervisor you don't get a break and they play favorites with employees"
good,I had to form the heel on shoes the bad part was the line got backed up a lot so we had to take longer lunches and not get paid for them but I liked the people I worked with
good,Wolverine has some excellent product and they pay their sales reps well.  However in order to move up the ladder you have to be well connected.  A high percentage of the sales force is related and they generally hire and promote friends and family. This is a good old boy network at it's finest.
good,"Stride Rite was a great place to purchase shoes for children especially with wider feet, however, Stride Rite in several locations has been permanently closed."
good,Good brand teams who are dedicated to doing what's right for the brand. Large portfolio of well known brands across two work locations. A lot of change in the last year as the company realigns for growth.
good,"daily you have quotas of boots to make, and if you hit the goals you got to leave. if you didn't hit the goals the line manager would start treating people poorly and was not helpful in getting the line back on track"
good,"10-12 hour days. Lots of travel.   "
good,This is a family owned store. Although the kindness and care they have for their employees is genuine the balance in and out the store them selves is not well managed. There is no store manager to run the daily operations so the responsibility fell onto me with out the pay. I felt as though the time spent in the store by the owner was much more needed to help with productivity.
good,"The Stride Rite Corporation had a great corporate culture, good work-life balance, and was well know for its quality.  It also had a great team of employees who were intelligent, hard working, and pleasant to work with."
good,"Loved the company 6 years ago! I was lucky to be a part of the small Merrell community. They purchased a very large company and began to loose there core values, The values that made me fight to become a part of the team."
good,"My experience was that this was much like other low skill service industry positions. It was a means to an end and provided some money to help with college expenses as well as spending money, but nothing more than that for me. The direct management was fairly reasonable and understanding, while I found the regional management to be a bit out of touch and focused more on numbers than employees and reality. But, really, that's how all of these jobs ten to be. Recommended for a fairly easy job that nets you some extra money, but don't expect much in the way of a career unless your goal is to become a store manager."
good,you work long days in a hot box and if you miss one day because you have to go to the er your contract gets ended and they say they will take you back but I have wasted my time 3 times and they dont place you there.
good,"Great environment if you love being around children. Very fact paced environment measuring feet and helping find walking shoes, sneakers for the child."
good,I really loved working at Wolverine Worldwide. There are some issues that I think should be corrected but overall not a bad place to work.
good,"A typical day at Stride Rite is to organize shoe boxes, help customers, and measure shoe sizes. Hardest part of job is trying to resize all the boxes due to how mixed up they are and trying to find a mismatched shoe. Little kids do mess up all the boxes and leave them on the floor."
good,Average retail job. Lot of hours and the pay is ok. Expensive benefits packages. Fun dealing the kids. Messy upper management and poor training.
good,"managing a store was difficult from time to time learned how to deal with people and delegate authority.my employees were loyal and dedicated. Learned how to fit adults & children to have a proper fit for shoes  the hardest part of the job were the hours long hours and holidays never saw my family much. the most enjoyable part was the kids and the customers I'm a people person. A typical day at work was receiving stock putting it away  setting up for sales & floor changes, payroll, guiding employees to sell shoes , customer service, settling problems. Cashier & meeting sales goals every month."
good,"Stride Rite, MESQUITE, Texas"
good,Overall a good company but ownership changed hands three times within past six years.  Too many reorganizations and layoffs makes this place inconsistent and unsure where it's heading.
good,"Chegamos para trabalhar, trocamos de roupa, fazemos a contagem do caixa, verifica se a montra está bem organizada, verifica se tem algum arranjo ou reservar a fazer, batemos o ponto e começamos o atendimento."
good,"Very fast paced environment, If you live children and shoes this could be for you.  Downfall, Upper management only cares about numbers.  They do not spend time to explain corporate changes "
good,Working got Stride Rite Inc. gave me the opportunity to expand my customer service skills and learn about retails values other than being a customer.
good,It was a great place to work. Everyone got along and the management was very caring and always teaching you new things.
good,"Small store. San Jose location now closed. "
good,It was a good job as it being my first job. I experienced work with other people and were able to improve my communication skills. I worked with other people so i was abls to become more social and get out of my comfort zone. You have to be good with kids if you want to work here.
good,"Working at Sperry consisted of handling the constant shipment we receive and checking out customers. Not too exciting, it's slow most days. Hardest is not dying of boredom."
good,"Wolverine is implementing a new philosophy to help service customers, the ""Wolverine Way Forward"", but they have failed to be transparent in the information flow from top to bottom on specific information regarding building closings and relocation of product.  People are looking for answers, but the answers they are getting to their questions are vague at best and don't help the employees feeling of job security or trust."
good,fluctuated in hours never knew when we were getting out and got laid off in dec for 2 weeks. this was do to full time employees getting the opportunity to work and the temps did not.
good,"Fast Paced environment in a outlet mall. Multiple KPI'S measured daily. Weekly conference calls, Simultaneous promotions,   Daily payroll management, Daily truck processing."
good,Not a fan of the insecurity of not knowing Weather or not I would be laid off for a few months. If you want to get payed around the holidays this is not the company to work for.
good,"Wolverine is definitely a top down company, meaning the only ideas that receive serious consideration are those that come down from upper management. There is no system for process improvement. No standard operating procedures. No training materials. No training. "
good,Wolverine World Wide had great pay and the benefits weren't bad either. I also liked the fact that it is a union company. The hours were great . The smell takes some time to adjust to.
good,The title says it all. I would say I only enjoyed my co-workers and my manager. They were a joy to work with. The job was easy enough to make some money and flexible enough to look for another job.
good,"I have had the pleasure of working in many different areas from warehouse, cash applications, freight auditing, customs and compliance."
good,"I enjoyed most my interaction with customers."
good,"A company striving for the 'Gold' in a changing process. Fun environment with the proper employees. Customer Service is key to all retail jobs, especially with Stride Rite ."
good,"A typical day included inventories and stockroom maintenance, cleaning the sales floor, running the cash register and updating my knowledge or Stride Rite products."
good,"IT Professional with over 34 years of IT experience, 28 in a management or leadership role, in multi-platform data centers.  Hands on experience with mainframe, mid-range, network, client server technologies and end user support in a 7 X 24 X 365 environment."
good,As a part time key:
good,"A normal day was just a day where you expect to get into an argument with someone. The friendliness and the warm gestures stopped quickly. There wasn't much work done on the management level, but double fell on the sales floor associates. Not enough accommodations were made for students (majority) and decisions were based off of emotions, not on work ethics and skill. I enjoyed the size of the team that I worked with and location to my home."
good,The coworkers & management is toxic not the building or the work. The place has potential if the right people lead it. Overall I give it 2 stars. I been there 10+ years.
good,"Low pay for the job I preform.  Many employers in my area pay much more starting out.  Everyone starts as a temp through an agency and then they either get hired on or you apply for an opening.  There us no movement up, which is how it is with most customer service roles.  High turn over because of low pay.  Starting pay is usually $13, if you get hired on it a small raise.  You get a yearly incentive if your brand meets sales. Good steping stone job to move on to something better."
good,"You make it what you make it - you can go as far as you like, but the way to stay relevant is to be int he officially in front of as many people as you can."
good,Enjoyed working at stride rite and helping parents fit shoes to their children.  Enjoyed talking with the children.  Enjoyed the hours and management that I worked with.
good,"stride as a whole is a good company, I believe my area was not managed right due to closing. My store closed 6 months after I was hired. District manager was let go before my store manager."
good,"Decent pay and hours, paid vacation barley any bonuses - depending if you qualified. Barely room for growth and you can be very loyal to this company but they will not be loyal to you."
good,Usually when you come in the task is all ready set for you when you come in so multitasking is going to be required while you work. So be prepared to stop what you are doing to put the customers first.
good,"Wolverine was headed in a different direction than stride rite retail. Overall it was a fun place to work, and they had a great understanding of work life balance. unlimited sick time and fun work events."
good,Stride rite was a retail job i had when i doing working on my pre nursing associate degree. My store manager was great but i feel like the company demanded too much of us without any compensation.
good,"This would have been a great job had they trained you.  I was there 6 months and did nothing really that had to do with the job I was hired for.  Was told several times ""You are good"" then when I asked for more training I was let go."
good,"There was quite a few changes in management in less than a year. Depending on the time of the year business could either be really slow or really busy. Generous pay, easy to request time off."
good,Ok job in sales that included selling shoes and outdoor clothing. Store was fun inefficiently and managers did not treat associated well. Store I worked in has since closed.
good,Had to work fast to hit the daily production numbers. Can learn different jobs in the shop. Worked with a lot of good people. Had good benifits. Gave stuff away for some holidays.
good,"I had a fun experience working with Stride Rite. I had a nice amount of hours weekly I was a par-time experience. The people there were also, very jolly and It was a very comfortable work environment."
good,"I liked working for this company . The hours were really flexible ,we always worked as a team to help each other out  when it got really busy .and the manager would also help us out as well . We also did a lot of stock work"
good,It's a productive workplace if you do your job. Can't miss days off work. Raises after 90 days. The management needs to do things better there. Wanted to be hired in.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo , no obstante nunca habia comunicacion con mis superiores"
good,"I learned how to insole tact, remove staples ,pull lass, staple side lass, out plastic shanks on the bottom of boots, made boots and shoes. I enjoyed the people  I worked with."
good,I learned a lot on how to fit kids for their shoes and how to insert arch cookies.  The manager was very laid back and was very helpful when we needed it.
good,"Pretty good place to work for a part time position. The hours are reasonable, the pay could be higher.  The store manger is fair.  Some of the operating processes are grass roots but overall its a decent place to work."
good,It was an overall good experience had to leave because of conflict issues with school and scheduling but overall i loved working with the kids and my co-workers
good,"Great sense on community within Wolverine, but very little room to grow unless you are high up the ladder. "
good,we promote wearings upon sales for chinese new year . the overall sale was quite satisfying on weekends but dull at weekdays .
good,solo realice un reemplazo durante poco tiempo como para poder evaluar de mejor manera este trabajo
good,I loved working at Stride Rite for 14.5 years.  The micro management is a little brutal and the hours are all over the place as it is retail.  But i loved working with people and regular families that would visit.  Really got to enjoy working one on one with people.
good,"The day starts with the held order report, and the analysis which order can be released."
good,"The store managers tend to be very good. Corporate management was lacking. (former coworkers say they are trying to change this.)  If you like interacting with people all day, the job is fine. There is a fairly typical shifting retail schedule, and nearly all jobs are part time."
good,"I come in at 8 am and our phones turn on at 9 am. I answer phone calls from consumers to place orders, returns , returns of defective products, and product information. In between calls I process orders for replacement footwear, issue gift cards as needed, and reach out to consumers that have negative reviews on our websites and product. Management has given us the tools to do what we need to delight the consumer. Most of my coworkers are great and we work well together. Hardest part of my job is not allowing a negative call affect the rest of my day. Most enjoyable part of my day is talking to a wide range of people"
good,carried out tasks just as a manager or asst manager would. working to provide an exciting and enjoyable day for parents and children. i really liked how my store had a small staff which allowed us to communicate better with everyday operations.
good,"I was first a sales associate then part time key holder. I enjoyed working with the staff and everyone was great. My manger was fabulous. It's much like any retail job, there are many pros and cons. Great part time job for anyone starting out."
good,"Great place and brand to work with. Has a lot of obstacles, but great to test our limits. I was able to expand the business, create new distributions channels and a specific marketing methodology focused on the brazilian market. Great managing school."
good,"work with customers and there children"
good,"the job is very hands on, having to measure children's feet as well as pleasing the parents and the children. constructive criticism. the pace varies from day to day. sometimes its completely dead other days you are non stop moving, especially during BOGO."
good,"A typical day at work is very customer driven, with the customer the centre of attention at all times. Also through out the day making sure the shop in tidy and presentable and eye pleasing to the customers, as well making sure all new products are out and visually pleasing. Through out my time at Hush Puppies I have learnt more about footfall and the importance of customer service skills. All the co-workers are very work focused and driven by personally sales to achieve Bonus and Weekly targets. The hardest part of my job is interaction with customers some of the time. This is because when greeting a customer who walks through the door, you may not get a response or reply back which can dishearten you. The most enjoyable past of my job is dealing with customers, by having a great rapport with the customer and really making the customer feeling relaxed. Also the paperwork at the end of the day and through out the week are enjoyable as I enjoy working on computers and doing the equations."
good,"This is a good place to work. I have learned alot, please reference my resume. My co workers are totally awesome. The hardest part of the job is currently losing it, like I am. The most enjoyable is working with the accounts, retailers, reps etc."
good,HR wasnt even in the picture it was terrible. They would completely blame workers for somethings out of there control.
good,you must be able to work quickly and keep up. Supervisors do try and help you keep up if you are falling behind.
good,"Poor management, but great place to learn. The manager made a lot of people cry while I worked there, most employees quit after a day, but I stuck around for almost 2 years and you can learn a lot about sales and running a business."
good,"My day starts with a shipment of shoes they are always new and exciting. Morning paperwork to complete and file. Emails and voice mail to check and follow up on. The customers are different everyday and you never know who is coming thru the door. For me the paperwork is the easiest, it has a place to be filed. I learned from working at Stride Rite about giving the customer the pickle, they just want great customer service and that is what they get. Stride Rite is number 1 in customer service. The hardest part of this job is leaving it I love what I do, but need to move to a different company. I enjoy working with the staff we compliment each other when working together. We are like family because we are a small staff."
good,"When you have a great team to work with, time goes by very quickly at Ardene. You definately experience a lot in customer service when working in an area like Atwater. It is overall a good company to work part-time in but getting ahead is not the easiest task."
good,"I was a good place to work, but it was like a ghost town, not many customers at all."
good,"come in at 9:30 ,check all the closing paper was done ,go ahead and start opening paper work ,check morning emails for possible promotional  store changes ,make sure the store was clean and all product would be put out and was full (making sure store was ready for daily operation) count down register ,open the doors at 10am and provide outstanding customer service .All nightly tasks included ( restock floor where necessary, clean facility, paper work ,bank deposits etc...)  the hardest part of the day was ,popular products not having customer size ,or color preference or out of stock causing me to lose sales and making it harder for me to reach daily store goals .Absolutely loved the environment, product was top notch ,practically sold itself making my job easier ,good coworkers"
good,"great place to work, good opportunity to grow in the company. learned how to multitask and assist the company in its general flow. i had the opportunity, to work in a company that allowed me to surpass what i thought i was capable of!"
good,"it was pretty repetitive and tiring. I was able to get discounts on the product and the company always organized fun events for the holidays. management had its days depending on who supervised the shift that day, which made it difficult, but overall a good experience."
good,"Great place to work.  Only reason for leaving - Manager was downsized out, leaving me with not much to do as duties were transferred withing the department."
good,"Management within the store was great, the new DM is very... intimidating and condescending. Typical day- lots of multitasking! Stock, measuring and assisting families, paperwork etc. I've learned a lot about different cultures and people from watching everyone come into the store. Co-workers are fun to work with although working with a store full of women is hard at times. Hardest part of the job is doing everything by the book, but having the DM constantly tear all of the staff down, praising other stores, but not you for the same achievements. I love love love seeing all the kids each day and helping them ""find themselves"" allowing them to pick the coolest, fastest running shoes they can find that reflect their personality. Overall, a good place to work but no room for improvement. The DM's want open availability for everyone, which isn't possible with many in school for degrees or with second jobs for more income."
good,The saucony team is willing to listen to weekly feedback and help resolves merchandising issues towards a successful environment. Merchandise needs that involve inventory are quickly addressed and resolved.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. They promote a good work ethic and pay is more reasonable than many other retailers.
good,"-learned customer service, how to treat the customer"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty basic: help customers, unpack shipment, basic housekeeping, and display changes. I have learned through this job that customer satisfaction is the most important part of any company. That is the only way that a company will be successful. I have also learned how to manage multiple customers at a time when I am alone in the store while still managing to deliver excellent customer service. The management is quite hard to get a hold of (other than my manager). My coworkers all have different personalities, but when I am at work, I have to concentrate on work. The hardest part of the job is also the most rewarding: the customers. If you have a difficult situation, it is hard to work through it with the customer, but at the same time, it is the most satisfying. "
good,"Sperry-Top Sider is a very subtle company, It has it great days and it has it worse days."
good,"Hush Puppies/Merrell is a division of Wolverine World Wide. The company is 94 retail stores strong and has had retail stores for over 20 years, however, their main focus is on their wholesale business. The company has no policy and procedure manuals and is so driven by the employees needs that the business can suffer from it. The bar is set so high that acheiving sales goals are near impossible and that means no bonuses. Compensation raises are on an annual basis but only received a 2% increase for a meets standards rating or a 3% increase for an exceeds. If you are a store manager for this company prepare to put in 50+ hour work weeks, working 6 days on average and constantly taking calls from home when not at work. They stock their stores as if they are 5 times larger than they are and require use of your personal vehicle to transport merchandise to and from off site storage units."
good,"I strongly believe if you have a good time to back you and strong team that you will have a stress-free environment. Stride Rite as Company is okay, but It was a bit stressful with  all the things that had to be accomplished in short amount of time. They have policy in place to protect the workers and customers but when it all boils down  the customer over ride the policies , so it was a waste of time to implement them."
good,Was a great place to work and did have many opportunities to advance until the United States decided to pull out of Canada. Forcing us to liquidate with only two and a half weeks notice they were shutting down. With no severance. Such a shame and a let down.
good,"a typical day at work-creating a fun place."
good,"On and off days in the store, not the greatest looking store and could be doing much better than it is. Decent pay. But overall good experience for sales"
good,While working at Stride Rite I learned a lot about pitching ideas to customers about different products that we sell and how the product can benefit the children and parents.  This entry level position has made me interested in the art of selling and I would like more experience selling other items to a different market.
good,"A typical day at work consists, of greeting customers, making them feel comfortable and welcomed in the store, making sure the store is well-maintained and checking in shipment"
good,"Good job, but fluctuating business affects hours and layoffs."
good,A chance to work with some very intelligent people and a good launch board for other careers.
good,Mis colegas eran muy amables y cooperativos tenian buen trato.
good,"It was a challenge being a floor associate at a store that was low in volume. Majority of the time I had to be alone to run the entire store, which left me with big responsibilities. Another challenge is having to make younger children and babies comfortable during the fitting of a shoe. I have had a good experience with children, however sometimes I will have difficult children and that would make it challenging to sale the product."
good,"Responsible for supervising, monitoring, repairing, and attending to park rides, including boarding and securing passengers, starting rides, and ensuring passengers exit safely."
good,Enjoying  and dealing with customers is a great  way to engage and thats what Merrell is all about. Understanding the shoe technology is very important as well.
good,"We were our own company with upper management that cared.  Much depth at the home office and in our stores. Was proud to work for a company that had been in business, on it's own, for over 90 yrs."
good,"I enjoyed working at Stride Rite because of the children, but within my job, there wasn't any structure from management. I wasn't challenged or pushed"
good,"el ambiente laboral fue generalmente grato, hay oportunidades para aprender, todo relativamente bien."
good,"Really nice coworkers who are easy to get along with! Can be a competitive environment at times because everyone is competing to meet their sales goals, but everyone usually respects one another so the tension isn't too bad. I learned a lot that I never knew about what makes a good shoe and how to help people find a shoe that will work best for them."
good,I was the store manager at Stride Rite. It was a good job with good benefits. This was back in 2011 when I left so I am not sure how good of a place it is to work at now.
good,They’re moving outta the family style business and only worried about corporate America. They used to really care about their employees but not so much anymore. Especially with the water crisis in Kent county.
good,"I worked for WWW over the course of 6 years while owned both by Payless and then wolverine."
good,"During a typical work week, one of my biggest tasks is checking in on my staff and assessing their progress on various daily task. I like to meet first thing on Monday to discuss our priorities for the week, then meet again in the middle of the week to check progress, and meet once at the end of the week to discuss goal setting for the next week. I meet with smaller groups of my staff during the middle of the week to troubleshoot any issues.  For example, during a recent mid-week meeting, I noticed one team was a few days behind on a long-term task including daily sales target. I met with the team and, together, we came up with a strategy for increasing efficiency among the team. Along with constant interaction with my team, I also attend a weekly strive for excellence meeting where I present my department’s progress to the executive board. On Fridays, once all these tasks are completed, I make sure I have completed all necessary communication for the week via email and in person, and create a list of priorities for next week."
good,"amazing day to day opportunities including being able to build relationships with great customers. helpful & encouraging management. hard working coworkers, willing to always put in a team effort when required. aiding customers in the entire shoe shopping experience, including but not limited to teaching them the need to know specifics & removing any confusion or stress the customers may have, is most rewarding. helping some people to understand and believe what may be best for their child may not always be the easiest."
good,the most enjoyable part of my job is that i not only give costumer service to parents but also their children. i enjoy being able to share my knowledge to my costumers.
good,this was a seasonal job for me. i worked here for about three months and it was a great experience.
good,Fue una experiencia muy divertida porque todo el equipo de trabajo tenia prácticamente la misma edad y eso genero muy buen ambiente de trabajo e identificación entre los compañeros.
good,"I liked working at Stride Rite because I'm a people and very customer oriented person and I also loved working with children."
good,"Always had low inventory, low salary, inconsistent policy and procedures, product was just to expensive for the quality we received in an outlet, Not enough product to make our sales goals"
good,Great 10 year run but it has all come to an end. Thanks E commerce. People will come back to stores to shop.On line shopping is a tend for now and will stay but millennials will become older and become store shoppers. Watch!
good,Management is constantly changing very rapidly. New district managers every 3 months with new expectations everything. Very cut throat selling behavior.
good,Not a very good company if you are trying to advance. Not many hours and the way the company is ran is very poor. You have to do manager duties and get paid poorly. Fulltime is not an option is the stride rite I worked at.
good,Stride rite was my first job and the service provided to customers taught me more than I thought I’d ever know about children’s feet and shoes.  The experience was definitely a learning one.
good,"It was an alright workplace, the hours weren't as nice as I thought they'd be. The store was small, especially the stockroom. Otherwise, my coworkers were great and overall it was a nice part time job."
good,"The environment created in Sperry was incredible. It had a very beach type vibe to it, and everyone was very laid back. Our particular location was a low volume store, so business was very slow. A typical day was a lot of standing around, reading the same goal paper over and over again, practicing new sales methods, and more. The hardest part of the job was the end. Half of our crew quit, we only had two managers(myself being one) for a solid month before they decided to send in a store manager. Although the end was difficult, stressful and devastating, the overall experience is something I have learned from and will always be grateful for."
good,"I enjoyed working for Stride Rite. It was a great first job, but because the stores were so small, it was hard for advancement. However, most of the Stride Rites."
good,This company was a great short term company to work for while in schooling. A typical day at work was dealing with customers and putting shipment away and organizing everything.
good,"Started as a part time a part time sales associate and advanced to a full time associate. Corporate was going away from brick and mortar stores, and stopped advancements. "
good,"Sperry has a laid-back feel during most hours, but can get very busy. There are no real benefits other than an employee discount. It is also very unlikely to receive a raise."
good,"Pastel Invoices"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Wolverine World Wide, their call center in Richmond, Indiana, the work was easy and pretty standard day to day. Unfortunately, this was only a contract position with no room for growth or enhancement. Working for a call center was pretty straight forward."
good,"fast paced always sent the temps home  first .its a nice clean fast paced place to work everyone was very nice on second shift,never knew how many hrs you would be working until the last minute"
good,"No es una empresa que te haga sentir estable."
good,The district manager was not helpful did not provide a lot of assistance or guidence when asked. They kept changing holidays off and has us working overnights.
good,I loved working for Wolverine Worldwide. Work-life balance is what you make of it with team building. Management is constantly changing and can be hard to keep up with different management styles. Hardest part of the job is trying to create that team that both sells and performs operationally flawless. Most enjoyable part of job was building lasting customer relationships.
good,Wolverine world wide is a fun and easy place to work but do not miss one day or you will be let go from your position. It is repetitive work so you do not have to try and remember a lot of steps. with that being said the repetitive work can make you sleepy early in the morning. Good pay and friendly people to work with.
good,Management of the store has had a very rocky start at least since I started there. Changes happen almost daily. Its a stressful environment. Tourist non-stop. So there is always a language barrier. I love my job because I enjoy the children but there is so many opportunities out there.
good,I loved working for Stride Rite. They have such a great brand that generations of people swear by. My manager was not the best to work for due to her lack of patience with customers and lack of managing background. The most rewarding part of the job is to see a child find a pair of shoes that he or she truly loves and gets to leave the store with them on their feet!
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, there have been many changes so it was getting hard to adapt to different atmospheres every other week. The management was pretty legit and I learned to gain patients for children and parent. I dealt with a lot of face to face complaints that were absurd but, not to bad. The team I worked with was great and really made working there fun and easy."
good,Great environment to work in especially if you like seeing kids smile when they get the shoes and socks that fit and that they love they do charitable things for the kids as well
good,The company itself is a great company however the pay isn’t that great.its enjoyable to work with kids and that’s the best part of the job.the kids face when they have the right fit for there shoes is priceless.
good,"Opening up the store and preparing the registers for the employees, making sure the floor was well kept and clean of any spare shoes. I learned that customer service is key to sales and building relationships for future return buyers. Management  was not really around so it was hard to seeing what it was and what they were suppose to do. The Culture in the work place was outstanding everyone got along. Hardest part was learning to progress in the management field. I enjoyed working with my high school friends and the work schedule that was available for me to go to college."
good,"The typical day consists of working with customers by measuring child's feet and bringing out requested shoes. Most days the work is steady and easy. Once every six months a new shipment comes in and the team has to sort, price, and put away new shoes."
good,"Merrell Atlanta is an exciting place to work, because it is a small operation there is no upward mobility. Meeting people and giving great customer service is great way to spend a work day. At the end of the day, I know there is something more. Something that allows me to use my creativity and people skills."
good,"It was a fun job, nothing hard to do. The managers were flexible with scheduling. The discount was also great!! "
good,"Good overall environment, great working staff and managers,  able to learn alot about sales, and help customers out throughout the day, organization was apart of the jobs as well"
good,"The pay is a little below a normal warehouse worker but it’s pretty casual and most people are friendly. Usually work 40-50 hours a week, 5-6 days a week. Not a bad place if you want to work and make decent money."
good,"todo normal, cumplió mis expectativas y pudo trabajar comodamente"
good,"One of the most interesting places to work at because of the international tourism that came into the store on a weekly,  daily, and monthly basis. Always challenging in the best ways."
good,"Great experience working at WWW, but was disappointed  to be caught in a downsizing scenario despite being a top sales producer. Was not given the opportunity to become an in house representative."
good,"In my role at Stride Rite, I was both a Financial and Operations Analyst for our Keds retail division.  It was a great experience that allowed me to get involved more with the onsite activity of our stores.  The role took me out of my comfort zone and I feel I learned more in my time there than at any other position I've had."
good,"Regular place to work. friendly staff and management. good environment, hours are good and some overtime. supervisor was great and didn't micro manage"
good,productive focused team effort within the building only
good,I enjoyed working with this company because I love children. The company was very laid back and the staff were very personable. The only problem I really had with Stride Rite was no place for advancement within the company.
good,"The Canadian business is full of great people and shows great potential."
good,"working for stride-rite was fulfilling overall great atmosphere, promotion leads and insure i;m knowledgeable about the new items in the store for every season, management kept our team focus on sales and providing the best quality service  it helped our team hep our customers, years of quality service ad great customer service, the hardest part is not enough hours so i had to take find 2  job to help provide for my family.. the most enjoyable part is the customers smile when they walk out the door."
good,Came to Stride Rite because of my experience working for parent company ( Wolverine World Wide) previously. Company offers great benefits and wonderful work environment.
good,"everyday I would do shipment and stock.i also worked the floor and register,and gave knowledge to customers while measuring their child's foot. i learned how to deal with all different types of customers, especially the one who weren't in agreeing with some policies. The management was good with assigning each worker with a to do list.the hardest part of the job was having lack of workers, most of the time there were one or two workers in the store.  the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the families and children."
good,Our job was to sell children's shoes.  I learned to properly measure feet and fit shoes.  Management allowed team building relationships.  Customer service was most important.  The hardest part of the job was assessing sales productivity and meeting goals.  The most enjoyable part was interacting with parents and children.
good,"I learned much about customer service and sales at this job. I knew little going in and retained much when leaving. It was a temp position, but I learned much about professional development and sales."
good,Great company to work for. I enjoyed all of the managers that I worked with. The pace was fast and there was always something to keep you busy. Building great customer relationship's was the best part.
good,"fun atmosphere, got promoted from a store superviser to a store manager, good growth oportunities.Good Training Provided, lovely management. Lovely Staff."
good,"Easy Tasks, PTO is good, free stuff once in awhile.cross trained in areas.  Too much drama and gossip. Promotes ppl that don't have leadership skills."
good,"working with many different styles of shoes from baby walking shoes to girly teen shoes. "
good,I loved working with all of the children and getting the great employee discounts on the shoes for my son but I got a promotion on another job and no longer had time for this one. The pay wasn't that great but I was okay with that because it was just a second job
good,"Good workplace "
good,"Merrell is a great place to work for. There's only 12 stores in the world, so the customer cliental is very loyal and accepting. We work very hard to build relationships with our customers to get them to feel comfortable, leave happy, spread the word and eventually come again."
good,"Pleasant work environment, the opportunity to work with children. Allowed for the development of skills in inventory and sales."
good,It is a good first job to learn about how to make sales and be hands on with the costumer. It gets very busy in the summer and very slow in the winter so hours get cut a little because it is a small store. Very good first job.
good,"Stride Rite's product is something every parent adores, and it was always fun to work with the kids. I learned a lot in the last 2 years I was there under district leader; who taught me how to run multiple store locations, work towards achieving personal sales goals, as well as company set goals, and much more. I loved my co-workers, and to this day try to keep in touch with them. The hardest part of the job was in order to succeed, you had to devote a lot of time away from the family life. I still shop here for my kiddo's!"
good,Love my job with Wolverine World Wide.  I am looking for different work due to lack of work at Wolverine.  I am currently laid off and seeing employment for full time work with competitive pay.
good,I did the industrial engineering like layouts for production lines and machinery needed to produce product and number of people needed. The job could be stressful at times when starting new production.  It was always a pleasant experience to see the finished product.
good,"typical work day consists of shipment and customer service balanced effectively.....I have learned to grow business and oversee inventory and cash controls .....while learning to develop sales team and grow staff into potential assistants and store managers....hardest part of job is juggling all of the day to day functions of LP, safety, inventory, cash controls, hiring, training and keeping up with all the changes to paperwork that seems to grow instead of shrink"
good,"I have had the opportunity to travel the world as a footwear designer with Wolverine Worldwide at the Hush Puppies brand.  Most often these travels were for market research and purchasing samples to use as inspiration in seasonal development.  I have designed and developed many types of footwear including casual, dress, athletic, after sport, waterproof, & outdoor.  I have had an amazing team of very talented people to work with that I have learned so much from."
good,"Stride Rite is a loyal company that enjoyed working there for almost 4 years. I gained a lot of personal and business growth with the company. I enjoyed management and how well we all work together as a team. The most important thing I liked was the developmental growth with the company. You had more opportunity to grow with the company. So that challenged me to display my leadership skills the best to my ability ,and work harder."
good,"A typical day at stride rite is a pretty slow day. Greeting customers that walk in, offering to measure a child's feet. Explaining the current promotion to every customer. There is a lot of back and forth since all of the stock is in the back. Kids are cool! Very slow paced most of the time, but it can get pretty crazy."
good,"El ambiente es agradable tanto en relación con los compañeros y el público, lo salarios son buenos, se ganas además por comisión de venta."
good,"This was a good job."
good,"Environnent de travail agréable, etc. Opportunité d`apprendre beaucoup et relevez des nouveaux défis."
good,"This was great job I enjoyed speaking with shoe dealers all over the US in helping them place their weekly orders, checking shipping status and tracking if necessary."
good,"The actual work place is fun and energetic.  The store was the leader in sales and productivity.  However, the corporate office pushes too hard on the store and results in very stressed out managers and employees."
good,I was part of a team completing documentation for inbound shipments from overseas for Customs and Border Patrol.  It was a very friendly environment and I was always treated with respect.
good,I worked to develop and better materials and processes to share information with our international partners.  I really enjoyed the learning experiences from the management teams.
good,"During my experience at my previous job, I worked on many different projects to assist the international distributor business network and sales force.  I learned how to manage project development and deadlines.  Through encouraging and difficult coworkers, I continued to learn how to develop positive professional business relationships.  I enjoyed the challenging projects and how I developed as a person to become a better employee."
good,This company is driving growth and innovation with a focus on global markets.  The corporate headquarters is nestled in a small town with an easy commute from larger and smaller cities within an exemplary school district.
good,Supervised 3 retail stores with annual revenue of $500K+ and volume of 8K+ and managed 40+ associates
good,You get the opportunity to interact with different families everyday and a lot of those families are regular customers so you get to build a relationship with them which is pretty nice. If you love children you will definitely love being an employee at Stride Rite!
good,I liked the company. I was given training on ISO 9000 guidelines. The hardest part of this job was standing in one spot for 10 hours. I moved around a lot inspecting on the line to alleviate that and to get to know my line inspectors and leads better. I had a great supervisor who was easy to work for and talk to.
good,Having previously worked with children I eased right into my new surroundings. Learned how to correctly measure children's feet for shoes.
good,you see kids everyday you work even babies. you measure feet and try some shoes on that mom or dad picked out. when big sales happened we were really busy but otherwise a slow paces job
good,"Fun place to work...enables you to have full control over whole business...p&l, advertising, buying, training, etc, etc."
good,"First, clock in on time. start machine-keep an"
good,"I relocated not long after starting my job here, however, I did enjoy it while I was there."
good,"Sometimes days could be slow or sometimes we could be busy all the way till closing time. A lot of people love and know that Sperry is what's hot to moms, dads, and their children. It's a good quality shoe for the price you pay. The hardest part about our job is getting a customer who's never worn Sperry to know that the shoe is worth it. The most enjoyable thing is having a clientele. People who know you because you've helped them multiple times. Makes you feel good to know they come looking for you! I love my co-workers! We are all different people from different places, but know how to come together as one. I've learned that its kind if hard to deal with people in retail, but for the most part it fun. "
good,"A day at Stride Rite starts off with straignting up the store while the manager goes through the normal paper work. During business hours we help out parents/kids with questions about shoes, sizes, technology, etc. The hardest part about work is dealing with screaming kids. My co-workers were very supportive when I had questions, concerns, etc. "
good,Good place to work
good,It was just a temporary job. It was boring but easy job. I went in and clean boots.
good,Working at this company has been a blessing to me. The manager has worked around my school schedule allowing me to finish 2 degrees.
good,Typical day at stride rite was fun and energy draining at the same time. I learned that I had way more patience than I ever thought I had. Management was very scatter brained and things always slipped through the cracks or put on the back burner. I loved my co-workers though and we all got along really well which allowed us to work great together as a team!
good,"Corporate office is located in Grand Rapids, MI. Bad weather, high taxes and too isolated from a fashion center. Advancement limited without relocating to Grand Rapids."
good,The company is very well known and good to work for. It is a place where you can learn a lot of new things.
good,Wolverine World Wide is large fashion and apparel company that encourages a casual environment with work from home options.  They continue to evaluate the structure of the workforce and re-align the company as business requires.
good,It’s like any other assembly factory. You have the line your working on and the station you are working at. You get moved from each position typically every two hours which is nice for a change throughout the day.
good,"Worked at Wolverine for 7 and half years. Last three years worked and team lead. Managed company wide mobility platform, Took lead on different projects. Actively involved on other business initiatives and kept very well communication and coordination with upper management."
good,I was an interactive designer with Stride Rite for 5 years and got to see each of the major brands go through growth and two acquisitions. I worked on some partner brands such as Lucas and Marvel which brought fun to the projects as well as a re-brand. It takes a while to move up in this company though I did learn a lot in the time I was there.
good,"Merrell is an okay company to work for, to schedule is inconsistent and always changing. The corporate offices are very unreliable with sales and promotions, And the pay is low for what you have to deal with. Good product if you can stick with the company and occasionally get decent discounts."
good,"it's a great place to work with this company good employees and clean environment , not stressful , and always positive vibes. I recommend if you want part time"
good,Working at Stride Rite was a great experience. All of the staff members were hard working and knew how to smile and have fun throughout the day. Being able to work with kids throughout the day was always fun in my eyes.
good,"Great entry level job, good hours and very consistent with work. awesome place for college students to make a lot of money for the level of experience they have."
good,Wolverine is a great Company it is unfortunate that we are closing many stores and having to downsize the field organization. The Product we sell is of great quality and Customers love the shopping environment.. The associates have a great wealth of product knowledge and very dedicated to the brands we carry as a company. My team is a good team and the District was number one in the company.
good,"A typical day at Wolverine can be as hard or easy as one makes it. It consist of lifting boxes weighting 50 pounds. Sometimes more, just really depends on the day and what you're doing. Management is easy to get along with, just do your job and be productive and there is an ""easy to work in"" work environment. The hardest, yet my favorite, part of the job is how physical it can be. To me, I feel like I went to the gym for eight hours."
good,"It is fun working here. All the staff and supervisor are kindly hearted and always teach me something new, i dont have any experience in retail and the teach me patiently."
good,New alignment is not beneficial to our customers needs. Visual merchandisers at corporate level very unorganized.  Lots of inventory issues that lean towards corporate issues to not satisfy sales plans.
good,"Merrell on a whole is a good company that does great work with the way to keep the customers happy and does everything possible to actually compensate the way their Company Culture is."
good,"Collaborative work environment."
good,Work can go from slow to fast paced. Mostly work with customers and kids fitting shoes and when slow you fill your time doing stock. The management lets you do what you like as long as you help the customer first and are productive doing projects. Co-workers work as a team to get jobs done and make a successful and stress free work place. The hardest part of the job is taking care of kids who do not want their feet touched and trying to make them interested in getting their feet measured. The most enjoyable part is finding a pair of shoes the parent and child likes and seeing the huge smile on the customers faces. I would add getting to know the customers and kids that come into the store is a highlight of the job.
good,"A typical day at work: would be running reports to make sure to release product to the warehouse for shipment."
good,"Stride Rite is a great company to work for with opportunity for advancement, fun and refreshing, as well as a chance to learn something new everyday."
good,"Log on to rf guns (computer systems). Check your cherry picker for any malfunctions,strape up with safety hornet and start my picking."
good,"Sperry Supervisor is great! She is hands on and very positive and upbeat. "
good,Productive and challenging but fun workplace.  In the IT department there were always multiple challenging projects to work on with many opportunities to grow in your IT career.
good,"Fun people to work with and it was a very comfortable and nice environment. If you like the challenge of sales, this job is for you. There were many customers to come in because Sperry is very popular. So, the key to success is to have exceptional customer service. Treat the customer as if they belong."
good,"got to talk with lots of customers that were avid travelers and outdoors people, as well as elderly looking for good orthopedic support. management was very organized and easy to communicate with. aggressive sales approach was encouraged especially during slow hours"
good,"Pros:"
good,"Long family history worked at WWW. I worked in many areas through cross training.  This helped me work my 40+ hours a week.  Not to be sent home while other areas waited for work.  I liked being busying and kept working. "
good,"A typical day managing Stride Rite  would be to stock all new shipments, do all opening tasks, check daily reports and sales, make out schedules for employees and sales goals.  I learned how to manage a staff of at least 8 people, keep up sales and necessary reports for corporate. I over saw all day operations, staffing, customer service and inventory."
good,calling accounts and taking care of my customer needs. helping with other territories and exceeding customer expectations. Resolving customer issues and shipments.
good,Good company to work for. Not much room for grow due to location. Only store in Delaware and only one other  sister Brand in area. Fast pace during summer and slow in winter.
good,Great management and workplace culture. Learned how to stock shelves properly and work around large groups of people. Work was collaborative and enjoyable.
good,"Dislike working there. Unfair work place due to working as a part timer, they will throw you the lousy work to do. The long hours from 9-9 almost everyday."
good,Great brand full of energy and youth.  An American icon that cross generations and is still relevant today. Fun people who love the brand and the work is interesting.
good,"its very relaxing working there and its also an open enviorment customers are easy to get alongn with and so are the employess "
good,"Wolverine has been a great place to work in terms of personal development and experience. I have been formally promoted in terms of job title, and also had my role adapted to meet my requirements, and the requirements of the business - overall giving me more responsibility and a great understanding of the business."
good,"I reasonably enjoyed working here at Sperry as it taught me valuable retail and customer service lessons that stay with me until now. Although, the management seemed slackish and didn't set a good example or overall store mood (assistant store manager to be specific). The rules were very upright compared to what my friends rules at their retail stores were and were not withheld by management. For example, they would prohibit sales associates from going in the back at any time unless for breaks, but very often the management  would be back there for 30 minutes to even over an hour without being there break."
good,initially a very fun and satisfying work environment which gave me the opportunity to manage and learn retail customer service in a fast pace market place. The facilities and receiving were also my responsibility and the store never looked better.
good,"Several changes of organization ownership caused a breakdown in team building environment, sales goals, coaching, and development"
good,"Stride Rite offers competitive pay and great benefits such as tuition reimbursement. Always feel supported by upper management. Unfortunately, not much room for growth due to market conditions."
good,"I have been an employee for Stride Rite for 10+ years. I have worked with amazing manager, but have seen the company struggle to keep doors open in recent years."
good,Wolverine is a good place to work as long as you dont mind management making very odd decisions. Overal good work life with the added bonus of finishing early on a Friday.
good,"n/a I have never met the ceo, so the answer below I just put yes. Really not sure though. This was a part time job for me. My was awesome. He (we) worked  at the crabtree location."
good,"Store in-charge / Supervisor of Shoe Citi (Former Employee), Manama, Bahrain – January 2, 2016"
good,The hardest part about this job or any other job is to make sure all employees are doing things correctly. If everybody do their job than the business will run smoothly.
good,"I loved working at Rockford Footware Depot.   I had fun co-workers however management could use management classes.   Hardest part of my job was standing and walking and steps to the warehouse all day long.   Only 20 minute paid lunch.    Was very hard on my feet and back.  LOVED MY CUSTOMERS, LOVED THE NEW SHOES, LOVED BEING AROUND PEOPLE!"
good,most of the jobs orders are military contracts for footware. unfortunately if regulations change there may be less jobs available and cause company future to be unstable.
good,"I learned at this job that the customer always comes first. I learned that where you put things in a store can affect the way they sell, and learned how to multi-task while managing 20+ employees."
good,"Good place to work at, flexible hours, nice people. Although you do have to do some double work, it's still not too bad. One thing I don't like is that regular sales associates have to keep up to date with all that goes on."
good,its a good company to work for. good staff. good loyalty program for customers. everything is old school. full time benefits are good. they dont pay part time time and a hlf for holidays worked though.
good,Very busy and competitive. Customer service work and sales. cleaning and counting register. One 30 min lunch
good,A typical day would be to run the product down a assembly line and go down a shoot down box and tape up. This was a very active job but pretty easy going. Management was good stay in contact with all of us and let us know what was going on from week to week. Really wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part was the people we worked with.
good,"Typical day would be me working with children making sure I measure their feet , recommend shoes, suggust shoes and styles based on needs ."
good,"Greeted customers and determined their needs and wants, discussed type, quality and number of merchandise required for purchase, recommended merchandise based on individual requirements, provided advice to clients regarding particular products or services, Explained the use and advantage of merchandise to customers, answered customers’ queries and concerns, showed the live working of merchandise, quoted prices and discounts as well as credit terms, prepared sales contracts and accepted payment through cash and credit card, assisted in display of merchandise."
good,"* Good mall department store"
good,"Going into work everyday brings something new. We get to help a diverse range of people. Engaging with the customer, learning what shoe needs they have, helping them fill their needs, and following through with the sale. Everyone in the store works well together. We help eachother with projects. I love helping customers that come in and working with my co-workers. "
good,I really enjoyed working at stride rite with the kids and lots of regular customers who were like friends. I was able to get to know them on a personal basis in some instances. I enjoyed my co-workers and tried to make the job fun every day. The only down side is the pay is not high enough for the amount of work they expect.
good,"Title says it all. It is not a bad place to work, but direct customer service can be tiring. Not to mention its hard to find someone to help when you need it."
good,"I'm not saying anything more but I will say I loved my time there my coworkers were amazing. Granted I was in the Disney area. Free tickets, yes please."
good,"I love my store , we have a good team who is focused on the customer. We have a great Store Manager who strives to give us a work life balance. I love to be challenged."
good,The company really takes care of the employees. The job is very high paced but the workload is not overwhelming. The company educates you on products thoroughly and the training for all of the different programs used day-to-day is top notch.
good,enjoyed interacting with the children and I loved showing our line of new products and services to our guest. Very pleased with the products and customer service always accommodated guest.
good,"I came / clocked in, walked around the store making sure everything was neat, tidy and in its place. I learned how to use the store register, help people find shoes they needed and extra shoes they didn't think they wanted for a later time."
good,Stride rite was a good job. But I was sexually harassed and got no help so I quit.but I wish that didn't happen because I really like to work there and to help children to find shoes that they love and was very comfortable
good,"I learned a lot i had good training. Love working with kids, love to stock and price tag. Management not so great manger had favorites. Worked as a team which is great."
good,"There isn't much to report for this job. It's a typical retail job. It mostly consists of customer service, merchandising, and handling cash. Staff has to be able to perform all duties as the staff is small and there isn't a dedicated receiving or stock staff."
good,"Nice place  to work, people where very friendly a responsive to your advice and help. Co workers where dolls to work with, would like to have them at every job place."
good,"Wolverine Worldwide is a great company to work for within the city of Richmond, IN.  It is about the highest paying position in the city for those without a four year degree.  The job does tend to need overtime, which isn't always approved to have."
good,Being around kids all day makes for an energetic fun filled day! There's never a dull moment and there are constant cute new products coming in for the kids!
good,I only worked a few hours but the day was always busy. I learned management skills and how to pacify and angry customer.The hardest part about this job was the store was never properly stocked.
good,"My experience at Stride Rite, started out good. I have never worked in retail and wanted to try it. I was promoted four months after being hired, from Part time Sales Associate to Full Time Sales Associate. I picked up the skills pretty quickly. The typical day at Stride Rite, there could be some very hectic days like the weekends, or really slow days like during the week. Typical days at Stride Rite are unpredictable. Being at Stride Rite, I have learned a lot about myself and business. I learned that I can handle any situation and still get my work done. No matter what gets thrown at me, I will always be prepare. Management  is great. It is not overwhelming. I worked with some of the most amazing people. Most of everyone that I work with worked together to get big shipments done, and making sure that the store ran smoothly. The hardest part about the job, was dealing with difficult customers and be able to give good customer service. But the most enjoyable part of the job, was being able to interact with the children and make their process of shopping for shoes fun and joyous for them and their parents."
good,"I love children! So I enjoyed working with them every day. Listening to their stories or how their day was at school while I measured their feet was fun! Stride Rite is not a very big store, so I able to provide that one on one service. I worked at the location at South Park Mall and Carolina Place Mall. My whole management and sales associate team all got along so well."
good,"I have thourghly enjoyed working for hush puppies for the last 3 years and unfortunatly due to redundancy I am having to leave.I have learnt so much whilst being here especially improving my IT skills,and learning the latest systems like SAP .We have a great team who made everyday fun and succsesful, I will not however miss the late night openings and the working weekends"
good,i LOVE this company and what it represents but my manager is just......
good,"Great company with good benefits, including great employee discount on company products.  Interdepartmental communication could stand to improve."
good,I've been working here for a few years now. The pay could be better but its part-time and the children make it worth the while!
good,Had All management Duties in Line And Still Not Included In Store re-Management ... company Need Regional Management Experience .. Not Paying attention To employees .
good,"I loved working for Sperry Top-Sider, the environment was extremely approachable, friendly, and easy to acclimate for new-comers. I was well-trained to do my job as a Key-Holder, it being my first time as one, and by the time I left, I felt confident to move up in the Retail world. A typical day at work involved helping customers find the best styles for them, keeping the floor clean, processing shipment, and interacting with the general public. The hardest part of the job was the only hard part about the job and that was not getting enough hours. I was looking for something closer to Full time, and I would get about 20 hours a week while I was there. The most enjoyable part about working for Sperry was definitely my co-workers. Some of the funniest, helpful people I've interacted with in Retail, I met while I was there."
good,"Merrell has quality products and draws in people who know either everything about the brand or nothing at all. Regardless, your expertise in used and if you know your information, it's not too difficult to sell."
good,"A typical day at Stride Rite was helping parents find shoes for their gowing children and providing excellent customer service. I learned a lot about the feet of children and how great our products were. i learned how to really work as a team, but also how to work alone and close a store. the management there wasn't the best, my manager didn't do her duties and passed them off on sales associates such as myself and never gave fair hours to any employee but herself. The hardest part of the job was getting children to sit still long enough to tell them what size their feet are. My co-workers were nice when i actually got to see them, i only saw co-workers when register training them or showing them how to close the store, i mainly worked alone. I most enjoyed selling shoes, i enjoy sales and meeting new people."
good,Normal work place. They were family oriented. I dont believe they allowed for advancement so much for males because they wanted to create the work place for more of a second job for women.
good,"Stride Rite was very organized with their receiving, and shipping processes. I learned nearly every position in the warehouse except for maintenance and loading trucks to be shipped. I learned how to pick and pack orders, replenish stock to be picked, and forklift operating for receiving and shipping merchandise, Management was fair, reasonable, and yet stern. Coworkers were motivated and productive. The hardest part of the job was working in hot conditions during the summer months. The most enjoyable part of the job was earning incentive pay according to the rate we achieved."
good,"Co-workers were great, manager was great, and I had a fun time meeting new people."
good,"this is a very fast paced place to work in if you are not use to kids and parents letting kids run free in a retail store this is not the place for you there is always someone crying, running, or pulling things out of place"
good,"Friendly staff, everyone gets along and works together to get orders out, supervisor our helpful the will assist u on and off work, standing in 1 spot most of day some areas you get to move around"
good,"Physical work that can be demanding, but provided fair pay and excellent benefits!  There are many different positions to work in which provides a change of pace from time to time!"
good,Times can be rough on the weekends and trying to make goals. But working here is definitely worth while. You feel like you're family and there probably isn't any other manger like the assistant who runs the store! She's awesome
good,Forus cuenta con varias marcas y tiendas disponibles para apoyarse unas con otras. Los descuentos de personal son atractivos y el ambiente juvenil se encuentra en todas las tiendas.
good,The thing I liked about stride rite was greeting the customers and making them feel satisfied. At the end of the day the customer is always right . I also enjoyed the people I worked with .
good,"I don't have anything that I would like to say at this time about the company."
good,The job was great and easy. Could get crazy at times during sales. I mostly worked weekends. The coworkers were very friendly and definitely looking to help out.
good,A fast pace environment most of the time which makes the days go by fast. No two days are the same due to the customers you have.    The best part is seeing a baby take their first steps and the joy in their parents eyes.
good,Nice people great location. Free shoes for employees and discounts for family. Good medical benefits. Worked at the Disney springs location.
good,"Working at Sperry Top Sider in Disney Springs was a fun and great environment to work in. The co workers and managers that I had were the absolute best and we all started out together and grew as one. I loved working there, I wish I was still there but I had left the state due to personal issues. Great job!"
good,Have a meeting at start of work every day to let us know what was expected of us for the work day. Then pick and pack product. I learned alot about different types of shoes. Co-workers were great to work with. Loved everything about the job it just relocated to Ohio.
good,"The atmosphere in the whole office sometimes feels slightly fractured (what with it being a culmination of several different brands that often do not interact with each other, other than socially). However, it is an easy-going one with an overall nice 'vibe' to it."
good,"working here was great!  measure feet, point customers in the right direction, and just keep shoes organized. management was good and co works are very helpful. hardest part was people would like to steal and you'd have to be prepared for that. i enjoyed working with the kids measuring their shoe size and helping them find the perfect shoe."
good,"Fun place to work. Small store that is fully staffed. Great as a part time job to meet new people and make extra summer money, but not for anyone looking for full-time employment."
good,"I enjoyed coming in to work every day, I love working with kids. It was challenging as we had to meet sales goals. My managers and co-workers were all great to work with."
good,I had a lot of fun working with Wolverine World Wide threw Manpower. I was only a temp. at this job. Working in my position at wolverine was difficult at times because there was no room for error. This job had steady hours.
good,"This location was extremely busy but we a lot of fun. I learned so much from my associates and how to be an awesome team player. I learned how be more flexible, listen more and be creative. An awesome and dedicated group of people. Making the decision to leave the company. Working with my associates, meeting deadlines, making sale goal on a daily basis and being the top performing store in the district."
good,"I learnt alot of skills at Merrell such as Customer Service, Till work, working as a team, working individually, stock take, and deliveries. Luckily i was working with a very nice group of people, with a mix in ages. Allowing us to all learn at the same pace as well as together and from each other, making us a stronger unit by knowing we could ask a question at any time."
good,Love the products and this place was good to work at but it closed down.  It was in the woodbury commons and had a huge selection of stuff.  Wish it would have stayed open.
good,"Good people, strong brands, but corp culture of setting crazy high targets which creates bad behaviours. "
good,"Working for Wolverine inc. was a easy going experience, it wasn't a fast pace environment. I was a machine operator and a mail packager. I left due to maternal leave.."
good,Was good job but could no longer do to disability. If wasn't for the disability I would of stayed there longer. Unfortunately I the shop I worked at is no longer there
good,Strong company with great culture. Always looking to evolve and connect with their consumers. Strong heritage. Part of Wolverine World Wide group so lots of opportunities to advance.
good,Stride Rite was a very fun job allowing others to learn among others those that walked into the store. I was able to really get to know the guest and make sure that their needs were met for their purchase and that they left the store happy.
good,Sperry Top-Siders is one of the premier boat shoe producers.  The company produce a high quality product that is known for its endurance and dependability.
good,Wolverine is a large corporation that is growing in a difficult retail market.  This is a great place to work if you want to be challenged and enjoy your job.
good,"Working at Merrell has so far been my favorite job ever. The people I work with are all spectacular, and the shoes sell themselves. Yes, you need to have some understanding of product knowledge for when people ask, but most of the shoes have similar features (i.e. vibram sole, waterproof interior, etc.) that makes it easier to remember. The only real problem I've had is trying to get more than 10 to 12 hours in a week, because corporate would rather hire more people for the same position than give hours (and potentially overtime) to the people currently working there."
good,Excellent oportunities  and helping people with there needs learned to do measurments for costumers and had a very friendly environment with all associates
good,"I love retail job. I can work on shift hours, on weekend also during public holiday. So i decide to continue and want learn more about retail. Maybe i archive my goal to be A machandiser or a manager."
good,Saucony was a great company to work for. The co workers were fun and enjoyable to work with. There were sales competitions that kept us active and focused on the goal ahead.
good,"Great place to grow and learn. great work culture and good location "
good,"stride rite was a great baby and adult shoe retail store the employees are friendly and assertive we are fast paced, organize shoes by color, size and style"
good,You have to be able to multi- task while working here. It is a very friendly environment to work in. You meet a lot of nice families. If you like working with children of all ages this is a great place to work.
good,"great company to work for. Unfortunately they are closing half of all locations. nice locations limits theft, great communication through out. quality products."
good,"If you are an hourly employee that the company conceders to be exempt for are paid well. you seem to get 2 raises a year. you get paid weekly and u receive PEP and a yearly bonus. Non- exempt employees are paid bi-weekly, you ar4e not included in their pay advances nor do you receive pep, and you are not included in their bonus."
good,"Over Great Work experience within the company. "
good,"Although working for Wolverine was a great opportunity, the process in which they decided to improve their company is lacking.  When looking for ways to improve, they only go down the totem pole to the floor managers.  They are only worried about meeting their metrics. They are not the people receiving the complaints or getting yelled at by the customers.  When wanting to make improvements in a company, it is important to actually listen to the people that construct the backbone of the company."
good,it was a very good place to me for being my first job. A little stressful but manageable. Let me make my 40 hours. very relaxed to work there. Learned a lot
good,"Wolverine is a great place to work, but there can sometimes be the fear of job eliminations that can make the working environment a little stressful and uneasy."
good,i worked in their retail stores and it was a fun time i would still be working for them if the stores were not slotted to be closed. and overall the experience was great.
good,"All my work comes in as emails and we typically work through them at our own pace. It is a very relaxed place, but it sometimes can get pretty hectic. Overall a great place to work."
good,I have worked for Stride Rite for 11 years.  We just recently shut our doors permanently.  It was a shock to most.  I enjoyed my staff and will miss them a great deal. I had an amazing District Manager.
good,"Great working place.....                                                         "
good,"My opinion of a retail job are that its long, hard, disgusting and rigorous type of job there is...handling bad customers, and possibly of not doing the job that the higher ups would like."
good,"Training and hiring all employees."
good,It was great when the machines were working properly. I didn't mind the work at all....I was taught how to work well with sewing machines. It was an good working experience.
good,"The day would start with planning for new launches both in terms of product and outlets."
good,"Wolverine World Wide was a very high stress, high pressure job. Extremely fast-paced and lots of over time. I worked as a line inspector. My job was to overlook a lines production and make sure there were little to no flaws. I recorded data of cases coming in and out."
good,This place had a very good atmosphere.  Most people were willing to help you any anyway possible.  The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to work with customers over the phone and just be involved with the everyday business.
good,Fast pace environment with customer service and managing the sales team and merchandising. Goal oriented company with the main goal the bottom line
good,"During my time at Wolverine I learned a lot of new ways and strategies on how to work effectively without overdoing yourself. The shift started out with a mandatory start up meeting, we disperse and report to our areas assigned to us for the day. Upper level management was caring, helpful and hopped in and helped when need be. My fellow co-workers were friendly and always willing to assist on matters that I did not know of. The hardest part of my job was mainly physical. Once I worked and stretched for a few days the job was a breeze. We were offered free snacks, lunches, and prizes on special occasions. Overall I enjoyed myexperience working at Wolverine Worldwide."
good,Thankful to this company for being there for me while I finished my degrees. The days consisted of customer service mostly.
good,located right off rt 2 in Lexington.  Stride Rite allowed you to work with many brands.  There was always room for advancement and company had great benefits.
good,A day at Stride Rite is always a good day. There is always nice families that walk in. Its never a time that i don't wish to be there. I always look forward to going to work. The things i learned working at Stride Rite is how to measure a foot and how each show is different. I have friendly co-workers. Hardest part my job is not finding the right shoe the child and they were looking really forward to the shoes. Most enjoyable part of my job is see all the children excited that they're getting new shoes.
good,Great place to work.  Busy but productive.  Exciting and challenging.  Fun but serious. All levels of personnel are friendly and family culture business.
good,"a typical day at work would require me to acquire new business, sales and marketing execution, account management, grow the territory, deliver presentations, attend and execute tradeshows, execute negotiations. "
good,"Love the people, workload, and being part of a team"
good,"as a sales associate, I performed duties such as morning/nightly deposits, inventory check, unpacked inventory received, interacted with customers"
good,"I would enjoy every day because i got to see from an infant taking there first steps to a toddler going crazy over light up shoes that they were really excited to come with there families or parents and get shoes. I would have to explain, fit properly and size the children. We interacted and made there shopping experience fun and parents would recommend to only have me be there sales lady because how satisfying i deliver great customer service."
good,I would pick shoe orders and do so many and sometimes get told to start packing and send them to shipping. I had to load truck a lot it was very hot in there and very hard to do.
good,"Clean, measure children's feet, stock, inventory, and closing and doing paperwork at the end of the night"
good,"Arriving at work at 8:30 am. Review emails, files and prepare for the day. Phones turn on and 9:00am and the fun begins until 5:00pm."

good,I enjoyed every minuted of my time at Stride Rite. It was a great place for advancement and I learned a lot about managing and training employess.
good,"I love the company I work for. Its a heavy multi tasking job and keeps you busy. The hardest part of my job is when your super busy and the same customers are not allowing you to help others and makes you go back and forth for the shoe. The easiest part of the job is doing the visuals, and stock work which I love. We work as a team and that's what makes the company fun to work for."
good,Was a very nice place to work . Great company to be a part of . They actually shut down I believe last year . It was A baby shoe store & it had to Be one of my favorite jobs
good,Productive and creative work environment with day to day discussion and target meeting to improve quality and productivity of the shoes. Keeping in mind best interest of both manufacturer and end customer.
good,"Top Managment needs to get it together, but base line managers are awesome, relaxed, and hard working, there to help you. for the full time employees you get good time off and some other benefits you can view on there website"
good,"Inspiring, Fun, and Team based environment, a beautiful company and inspiring employees, had a blast working here and learned life lessons as well. the hardest part was the hectic hours, the most enjoyable was being surrounded by positive influences."
good,"It was a great place to work, and a wonderful environment. Unfortunately the company decided to invest in the online business, and closed all of their brick and mortar stores."
good,"Typical day would have been starting off by checking previous days sales, sales goal for the day/associates, tasks that need to be completed, checking email/store intranet to make sure no changes to current promo or any tasks that needed to be completed from corporate."
good,"The customer base is pretty low key, lots of hippies who like to hike so irate customers were rare. Days were easy, stores are small, and training is thorough."
good,"I was brought in to help out because two people in the group who were temporary put in their notice on the same day.  While I was there, it felt easy going yet work related.  I never felt rushed or anything like that.  As long as you did the work asked everything was fine."
good,"Using a wide range of product knowledge to ensure customers are outfitted for their outdoor adventures. Very laid back, productive culture. Sales focused to achieve goals."
good,"You have to be very patience for this job, when you are working with parents and children. Overall a typical day was measuring children's feet and bringing out different styles. You had to be very patience especially with parents who are looking for things online and realizing that each store varies. When you weren't measuring children's feet, you were replacing any stickers that might have fallen/pulled off by customers. Cleaning the sales floor, and reorganize the stockroom. I enjoy this job very much."
good,"Its awesome working in such a busy mall ,got chance to learn much which is more vital to boost my career and to develop organisation goals."
good,sells great shoes for kids . great customer service provided to customer . open and close store .shipment and stocking front floor and stockroom
good,"While working as a manager for the company, I oversaw and maintained the daily operations of a retail store designed for children's footwear.  Generally my coworkers were great, but like any job there will always be lemons.  The hardest part of the job was staffing the store I was managing.  I was only granted to have part timers and because of this I had a high turnover rate.  My employees would either find higher paying jobs or jobs that were full time.  I did enjoy being able to interact with children and families."
good,"I worked at times in the morning, sometimes closing the store. "
good,Everyday is different. I am constantly challenged in a sales driven workplace. I am driven to have to push past daily sales goals and other standard requirements.
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is working with the children.
good,Relaxes atmosphere enabled you to actually wait on cutomers and build relationships with them.
good,"Un dia tipico de trabajo comenzaba recibiendo los pedidos de la tienda, para posteriormente ordenar la bodega y comenzar a recibir clientes. "
good,I have enjoyed working at Sperry. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with every individual at the store. I find it is time to look for a job that is closer and pays better. My favorite part about the store is their flexibility and their discounts off of the shoes and apparel.
good,"Each day I would go into work, I would love every second of it. I was able to work with multiple children and adult each and everyday. The staff was outstanding as well as management.  I without a doubt have learned how to have a outstanding amount of patience."
good,Wolverine is a growing company and i was happy working with wolverine .helped me to nourish my confidence and skills.Management was friendly and supportive.
good,"En ocasiones había mucho trabajo y en otras solo era manteción de lugar físico,aprendí a organizarme con un orden definido, tuve compañeros con un ambiente grato en cuanto al trato desde la jefatura hasta el puesto más pequeño que de vendedor (part- time) y eso fué lo que más me gustó.Quizás en único contratiempo era el retraso con algunos productos y deficiencia en el sistema de internet."
good,Worked for this company for 10 years and always was treated good.  The company does a lot of extras for its employees with fun days full of different activities.  Everyone in the company is very nice to work with and appreciates the work my department could get done is a short time.
good,"J'ai eu le privilège de fréquenter une équipe du tonnerre. Merci a toute mon équipe, malheureusement nous avons du fermer les bureaux. Cause de re-structuration au Canada. Maintenant en route vers de nouvelles aventures."
good,"I enjoy working with families but mostly children and being able to fit their child to perfect shoe. It is a great atmosphere to work in and it can get pretty busy at times. I have learned to fit, and explain different types of shoes to different people. I ring up people's shoes  do exchanges and returns. I enjoy working with the management because I have worked with the store manager for the last 15 years at different jobs. The assistant manager is really fun and enjoyable to work with. The co-workers are really friendly and outgoing and also fun to be around. The most enjoyable part of the job is to work with people, and knowing that I made a difference in a child's life by making sure they leave with the right size shoe to match their foot."
good,"Manage day to day business including all tasks such as opening, closing, selling, handling the register, Inventory, stock shipment, Coaching, scheduling."
good,stocking and selling. i learned how arrange shoes from size to brand in order. how to stock shoes. management and co workers were really friendy. hardest part of the job was keeping enough shoes for the customers they buy them out so quick. everything was fun
good,my day would consist of coming in and making sure that the right shoes w ere where they were supposed to be and i loved when people woulld bring there kids in cause i love kids so that would be like the highlight of my day and the hardest part about my job would be when a customer wasnt understanding somethign you were trying to tell them
good,"I had a great time working at Stride Rite even though it was only temporary. The management was nice and the co-workers were friendly and the pay was pretty good if you're looking for extra cash. My family has been buying from Stride Rite for nearly 30 years so I was very sad to see the company go. Overall, great work experience."
good,"A typical day at work felt long, but it was a lot of movement from the back of the store to the front, example, we received shipment all the time so we were constantly moving products around. My coworkers were friendly and worked hard, we quickly became a family while working there. The management was great, but after a new manager was brought in there was tension between him and the assistant manager which could make the job unbearable sometimes. Other than the breakdown in management, working at Merrell was enjoyable, the most enjoyable part was interacting with my coworkers and the customers."
good,"Bastante trabajo día a día en la tienda, he aprendido bastante sobre ventas y manejo de bodega, conocimientos en tecnologías de vestuario y calzado."
good,"Rockford Business Center:  Great place to work, nice people and good company culture."
good,Supervisors are very knowledgeable and always willing to help. Employees are very friendly and have a family type atmosphere. A very safe environment to work in
good,i would come in and start my day with responding to emails and there will be new projects ready for me to go if i wasnt already working on a project for a vendor. My manager was great she taught me alot and was a great person as well as the rest of the team. It felt like family.
good,exelente empresa buen ambiente laboral me enviaron a hacer varios cursos de perfeccionamiento tengo muy gratos recuerdos de mis compañeros de trabajo y jefes de la epoca
good,Was a great place to start working needed to hire better mangers but all in all was good experience to get under the belt to help for the future with customer care field work
good,"Working at Stride Rite was very high energy majority of the time. Being that it is a shoe store for infants up to big kids I saw children all day everyday when I worked. That was the highlight of my being an employee there. I saw so many different cases when children came in for shoes and in turn that broadened my knowledge of shoe-fitting. I've fitted over 200 children for shoes. I really got to understand and perfect my customer service skills at Stride Rite. The staff worked as a team , especially on busy days. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the store shoe displays were laid out in a way that would make it easy to sell shoes based on the customer needs. The most enjoyable part was the children and the many parents that I helped solve the issue of  ""Where can I get my child shoes that fit without flaw?"" It brought me joy."
good,"It was a fun place to work at because everybody was kind to one another and helped each other out, good team work. Its a very fast paced environment and it was a bit hard to keep up at the start but gradually got easier with training from the senior employees. I mainly worked on the dock so I learned how to operate pump trucks(Safely) and also how to unload and load trailers and wrap skids."
good,"The environment of Stride Rite is great, especially when you have a team to work with as I did. This job was very easy, fun, and satisfactory when you successfully fitted a child's foot. This not only made the kid's day, but the parent's day as well."
good,"Great overall company. "
good,"Employees are very nice and I learned to handle stressful situations whither with customers or just work in general. Management was not the greatest, hardest thing about working this job was fairness and equal opportunity."
good,"1.  Rf scanning product & order pickup"
good,A partime promoter indeed still require a high level of skills. That disclosing on how much training and lesson been learn in order to perform the task with an ideal performance.
good,"My manager was a lovely woman who I am still friends with today, I am not very fond of the fact that the company shut down all of it's store locations and laid us all off to move their stock online."
good,"Wolverine Worldwide was a very good atmosphere to work in. Everyone was willing to help with any difficult situations I came across. It was overwhemling at the beginning, as I started at their busiest time of the year, but the job was understanding and repetitive."
good,"Relaxed place to work with but the job need much responsibility especially when we are dealing with customers. "
good,This was my first retail job and I learned a lot about retail and what to expect in this line of work. Had a great and enjoyable experience working there

good,Very friendly staff and boss. Flexible shifts and perfect for anyone who wants to work in a dynamic environment.........................................
good,"I was promoted from Key Holder to Assistant Manager.  During my first couple months as Assistant, some issues arouse and I was then acting store manager.  Due to circumstances the Store Manager positions was not to be filled.  The only problem I had was the lack of help during this time period.  The staff was great! Upper management was great as well!  Lots of room to grow, and a very fun and exciting place to work!"
good,"It was a fairly easy job. I would have to say the hardest part was getting a customer to commit to a sale. With that being said, getting customers to commit to sales wasn't all that difficult. The most enjoyable was returning customers. The management was great and the culture was easy-going."
good,"Nice work day with friendly individuals"
good,"loved it, best times. learned so much, and had fun while doing it! great environment to be in, good music, nice people, always my first recommendation for first walkers!"
good,I loved working here during college. Flexible hours and an amazing team of people made this job perfect for a college student.
good,Aprendí a trabajar con un muy buen equipo en una buena empresa
good,I enjoyed this job because it was fast paced and I learned how to drive a forklift.. My co-workers were wonderful to work with and  we had fun while doing our job.
good,"Typically I would open the store, check the cash register and turn on systems. Greeting & assuring customers needs as they enter. I learn how to greet and serve customers appropriately. My work team was very helpful and dedicated. The hardest part of the job was not getting attached to the children I served. My favorite part of the job was helping and serving the customers and children making their experience a great one."
good,Good Management ! Always learning new things seeing the same people and seeing the children grow! Love seeing all of the new items that come in. Love figuring out everything that the child may need .
good,"Have great co-workers. A great manager. Hours are flexible and are able to a just to nearly anything we have going on. Clean and very Organize.

good,"Management was good.  Typical day was greeting customers, measured children's feet, sometimes had to call other stores for other shoes."
good,"Sperry Top Sider is a nautical brand that is largely growing here on the west coast. My management experience there taught me that even jobs that require work and productivity daily, it can still be extremely fun. We have great associated that share the same values as we do and enjoy the time they are at work, as well as the management team. I would say the toughest part of the job is the selling aspect and sales goals, in which we always meet, though it does take some skill and learning to be good at it."
good,Overall a great work experience. Worked with wonderful and hard working people.
good,"· Assisted customers with merchandise selection and purchases"
good,Supervised many employees and enjoyed every aspect of the job. I would have retired from this place if they had not outsourced our jobs.
good,Stride Rite was one of the best places that I have ever worked and when you work with children how can you have a bad day. Stride Rite also takes good care of their employees.
good,"Everything about this store made me love it. There can be a lot of customer problem solving, which is the hardest part of the job, but with the proper training all will be fine. I loved my DM, store manager and co workers. I learned everything that I needed to know about retail management here since this was my first management job. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with little kids."
good,"I work from my home and manage 204 locally owned shoe stores within eight Northeastern states. Depending on the time of year, I am either on the road meeting with accounts face to face to present our new lines of children's shoes, or entering orders and making spreadsheets so that I am aware of my goals and what numbers I need, per account, to reach said goals. Working out of my home means that I am not in very close contact with any coworkers, but we do see each other at various shoe shows/functions throughout the year. I keep in touch via phone and email with various other Account Executives on the road if I have questions or to bounce ideas off of them. Although we do not see each other often, the Account Executives are close and are ready and willing to listen and help when approached. I would say that the hardest part of my job happens to be my most favorite part, and that is everything is all on you and your performance. You make your own schedule, travel dates, appointments, for which you need to be disciplined and self-motivated. The pressure of making your goal for the season can be eliminated once you know that you have done your job to the best of your ability."
good,"organize display, work register, fit kids in correct shoe size"
good,"supervised 6 employees, daily deposits, opening and closing of store"
good,great place to work. enjoyed the company of those around me.

good,I was young but working there I picked up on so many new management and learning skills. The team was great all the way up to management if it wasn’t for relocation I’d probably still be there
good,everyone gets along great and the environment is good for any type of person coming into the company. steady and fun for us all. i would recommend working here
good,"Stride Rite is a great place to begin working. It helped me get through school, and the scheduling was very flexible. Management and coworkers were great to be around, everyone was friendly."
good,"-Great management team that is very helpful and accommodating"
good,I enjoyed working at the office.  The customers we're nice and also my coworkers.  The schedule was great .  And my boss the owner was great with all his employees.  One of the best jobs I have had.
good,"Daily day at the job was to assist every costumer and ring up customers, fix merchandise, and do some stock work."

good,Stride Rite gave me my first manager position. After that it opened a lot of doors for me. I learned a lot about retail and management. If stride Rite wouldn’t of closed all of their stores I would still be working with the company.
good,Stride rite was a great job with a different opportunity. I loved being able to see the kids and help them find a pair of shoes or just talking to them while their parents looked around.

good,"great job, great co-workers and supervisors."

My co-workers were very helpful because they knew this was my first job. . They were very patient with teaching me how things were suppose to be done. The hardest part of my job was leaving because i loved loving at Stride-rite. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure the customer was taken care of"

good,"I worked at a ton of retail stores including a huge outdoor company based out of Portland, OR and Merrell is the only one I would consider going back to if I needed  job.  I loved the work culture and the product.  My boss was the best manager I have ever had in my career and that includes moving into the mental health field."

I developed a following and had many return customers.  I learned people skills, customer service skills, stock, shipping/receiving, how to set sales, make attractive displays, be organized. I did open and closing procedures and was trusted with bank drops.  If one likes kids and families, this is a GREAT place to work."
good,"Really enjoyed working for wolverine world wide, I have no complains."
good,"This was my favorite place to work until it closed. The manager was friendly and accommodating to my schedule at the time, and the entire team was friendly and got along really well. Had the store not closed I would still be working there today."

good,"A typical day at work would be, coming in and greeting my co-workers. And then I'd proceed to my big rack, a metal rack containing materials used by factory throughout the day, to do my morning inventory check. These inventory happen twice day. After my AM inventory, its usually time for me to examine the delivered materials and part to make everything was properly delivered. At this time I have a lunch break, after break I complete my rack order, a list of material needed for production. At wolverine I have amazing management they do an amazing job keeping me busy. Wolverine is a very busy workplace, everyone is always in  a hurry. With that being said I get along great with everything just very little time for anything more than that. The hardest of my job is the constant change in the production schedule, the more contracts the more material the factory needs. Also learning all the part numbers was a little difficult. The most enjoyable part of my job is the amount of knowledge I have learned about coordinating material for production. I knew nothing to be completely honest, and I can honest say I was great at my job."
good,"Typical days were busy with employee questions regarding their benefit(s). While employed, we completed the process of an acquisition of another company. The process was stressful, however, we worked together as a team and completed the steps necessary. It was a great learning experience. The HR team was great, we supported one another and worked together as a team. The part of my position that I enjoyed most, was assisting employees with understanding their benefits. During a typical day, I received 50 - 75 e-mailed messages and 20-30 phone calls."
good,"There is always something to do at work. The customers are usually entertaining and a pleasure to work with. On a regular day, I measure a childs foot, refer and suggest shoe styles to parents and complete purchases. At the end of the day I count the registers, fill out paperwork and close the store."
good,I loved working with the kids. Just being able to help them express the way they want to look brought joy on my face... If you kids as much as I did then u would love this job as well
good,"Stride Rite has taught me everything I need to know about sales, inventory and building relationships with customers (and shoes of course). A typical day is helping customers, sizing and fitting shoes, putting away shipments and gaining experience."

good,This was a great place to work. Everyone that worked here was like a second family. The managers were great to work for and always showed their appreciation to their workers.
good,"When I was hired I hit it off with my manager and co-workers instantly.  At the time I believe I made $10/ hour which was pleasing. I worked in the mall so the hours were nice and I got paid over time for the holidays. Unfortunately, during that time period they were franchise owned and eventually went corporate. Everyone lost their jobs. I miss working in a positive environment like that."
good,I loved working at Stride Rite. I always had tasks to complete to keep me busy and the atmosphere was so positive. The employees were all team players and the customers for the most part were friendly.

good,I really miss working there and with those great people. My co workers really made the store what it still seems to be today. They really like what they are doing and enjoy their team. The hardest part of the job was figuring out what to do with the 100+ cases of shoes that would come in right before Christmas. I enjoyed our regular customers and hearing about their travels or just about their days and experiences with our products.
good,"Very busy and never a dull moment. Retail is always a fun business to be in. I have learned a bunch of different systems, AS400, AFS, SAP, BW, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook. Work with many different people within the business in numerous positions."
good,"A typical day would be a challage. Get as much done during the beginning of the week, so by the weeks end more time could be focused on that days shipments. Management was very appreciated with the respect they showed with trust in those who demonstrated a true concern with the work performed by them. Co-workers were always friendly and helpful by doing their part in making the next step easier. The hardest part of the job was making it all come togetter so you could really appreciate your time off at home relaxing."
good,Working at sperrys was wonderful and the people I worked with was even more intoxicating as a result the store had closed so unfortunately I had to move on

Customer service is what all jobs start with I believe, its all about how you talk to the customer/client. You want them to get the best customer service that you can give and they should walk out the door happy. There was always room for growth in this company, we had some great training and opportunities."

My typical day at work I would greet customers, smile as much as I can because customer service is our priority to make them happy and feel comfortable at the moment they enter the store until they leave. My co-workers were easy going, no drama and it made the job easier to work. Hardest job part of the job is juggling customers at the same time but you end up learning how to multi task. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping parents look for the babies first new pair of shoes when their trying to walk and seeing how happy, fun and enjoyable the family can feel when their shopping."
