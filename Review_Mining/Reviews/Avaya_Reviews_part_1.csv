rating,review
bad,"Bad at all times did not enjoy it at all, would not reccomend to anyone, dosen't care for their employees at all, stay away from them at all costs.  Bad place to work"
bad,It was a good place to work earlier but in recent years many changes happened in management and it's no more a good place to work if we plan for long career with the company.
bad,"Working was not good working at Avaya because of the Silver Lakes carve out company that was always downsizing and relocating the workers."
bad,"It has been over 16 years since I worked at Avaya.  During my short tenure there, I was pretty much happy but then it seemed like they were going to outsource most of the work and it became an unstable environment to work in."
bad,Environment very toxic and cut throat.  Heirarchy EA's run the office and bedroom checks were regularly made (EVP walking the floor to make sure we are there).
bad,worst place to work. they mistreat the employees and you don't get any raises. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. They made with resign because I wanted to go back to school.
bad,"It was my need hence I stuck to it for 3 years."
bad,"They take advantage of people. Everyone works very long hours, constant lay offs, no communication, no structure, no clear vision and sense of direction."
bad,"Very difficult to maintain to good work ethic due to the threat of lay-offs always occurring every quarter."
bad,"Exactly as stated in summary title. Management doesn't care about the employees. To be transparent, I worked for this company when it was known as Nortel Government Solutions. So perhaps the name change and whatever other changes came with it changed the culture as well. But when I left, I was unhappy with the zero consideration my employers had towards me expanding my family."
bad,Avaya is grate place to work. It is one of the best company I have ever worked with. I am glad to be part of the company like Avaya
bad,Avaya lacks concern for their employees and is not focused on technology. Leadership and corporate goals due to leadership change create a distraction for employees.
bad,Emerging from bankruptcy with a higher than planned debt obligation will only result in constant head count reductions due to the steady decline in revenues
bad,"Due to financial trouble,Avaya seems to be going away or dwindling down. They overwork employees beyond reasonable hours. I do not recommend working for this company. Potential prospective employees beware."
bad,"Avaya has been unable to keep their employees happy for as long as I can remember. I worked for them for almost 20 years but for the last 10+ years, I lived under the constant threat of layoffs as leadership was never able to guide the company towards a winning strategy or profitability (I was laid off twice). "
bad,"Executive management has no clear direction and needs to be removed. Almost every day, domestic US employees wonder if they will be cut. Outsourcing and customers leaving for other communications solutions due to lack of support has caused a wonderful company to be one I would never work for again."
bad,"Avaya once was a great place to work, but since the private acquisition by SilverLake Partners, it's gone downhill in a big way."
bad,"Ruled by intimidation.  If you question process or disagree, you’re terminated.  The CEO leads by fear. Poor management.  0 African Americans within HR and very limited within the entire company.  No diversity within Leadership."
bad,"Poorly run, high debt.  people dropping like flies.  Lack of a solid solution.  All over the board.  Gone through multiple levels of management.  Including staff from Cisco, who have since left Avaya since Avaya filed Bankruptcy."
bad,"Avaya was not a fun place to work.  Poor leadership and no support from management.  A great deal of pressure was put on the employees.  Even if you exceeded your sales goals, you were not guaranteed your job."
bad,"I left voluntarily in 2016. The value placed on employees, contractors and consultants is very low. US employees are targeted for cost reduction to avoid the high expense of eliminating jobs in European countries. This communications software company enforced a rule of reporting to an office (any Avaya office, all of which have insufficient work-space) three days per week, regardless of where employees live, creating a very negative atmosphere at the office, as well as generally low morale."
bad,Employees considered commodities.  Exec staff completely in their own world.  No training or advancement opportunities.  Constant reductions in force.  This company is imploding on itself.  Not sure how much longer it can stay afloat with extreme financial debt coming due in Oct 2017!
bad,Management has no direction. Lack of strategy and suggestions are not welcomed. Decision maker like to follow my way or high way kind of approach.
bad,Even with the high pay structure the turn over rate is unbelievable.  I entered the company with six other senior managers and after one year was the only one left.  The entire senior leadership team turned over during the one year I was there.  Each department guards their data intensely and will refuse to share even though you work at the same company.  Don't expect any training or support/guidance on how to complete the vague objectives you are assigned.  It was the worst year of my 20 year management career.
bad,"My last years with Avaya were characterized by leveraged buy-out management trying to make the company into something that it was never designed to be (by either customers or employees) who totally destroyed the company in the process, which has resulted in their current bankruptcy.  Senior leadership was constantly laying off knowledgeable people who were making things happen to bring in their friends who could read a spreadsheet, but were incompetent in all other aspects.  The workweek devolved into fear of which week would be your turn for termination.  I cannot currently recommend either working at Avaya or Avaya products to anyone."
bad,"This is a disaster of a company....mostly due to lack of ethics and professionalism and and seriousness. There was rampant cheating by the inside sales group (passing on sales that they weren't responslibe for ) and getting double commission, which was condoned by management. Management (which I understand has all been let go)....The work environment was similar to a circus. No sales were actually made nor work produced. Most employees suspected my particular sales dept was created as part of an Obama stimulus package and that is why no real work ever got done. All managers were let go, some for doing drugs and having sex with the employees during work hours. A typical day would be that most people would socialize and watch Youtube videos and go home and come and go whenever they wanted...Business partners would submit done deals and let the INside Sales reps at Avaya pass them off as though they did them so Avaya would pay double commsision. Management condoned this to beef up numbers for the corporate office."
bad,"Positives:  Work from home for some positions. Salary was good."
bad,"A formerly great place to work that has been driven into the ditch by bad management. "
bad,"Totally mismanaged, soon they will disappear (great technology) as a company... unable to make profit as totally mismanaged.  Desperate times at Avaya, wondering how much longer the investors will be willing to poor money into this company!"
bad,"The work itself is fun, challenging and rewarding. However senior leadership has done everything in its power to squash any culture the organization had, they are unable to follow their own values promoting the purposeful misleading of customers and business partners while masking true company results to improve numbers. The good news is the overall benefit package is strong, however there is no career path and workforce adjustments at mid-level down is common place. When I left the company I was expected to work at minimum 7 days and 65 hours per week with no end in sight. I am fine with long weeks to finish a project, but this is to cover for recent layoffs, so the work / life balance has now been ruined."
bad,"Terrible benefits, poor pay, poor management, poor direction, lots of layoffs, little innovation. The only positive is a good work/life balance and the ability to work from home."
bad,"Avaya is a telecom company in turmoil. With debt recently downgraded to junk bond status, the only thing Avaya willingly spends money on is 7 figure salaries to the executives who have overseen revenue decline quarter after quarter. Layoffs happen weekly, all departments are starved for resources, and morale is at an all time low. Avaya makes good people do bad things, and competent people look incompetent."
bad,"Average day at Avaya was 15 to 18 hours. I have learned how to groom my multi tasking skills."
bad,"How the CEO can run the company into the ground especially with Privately owned...I guess the owners really do not know telecom world and now can dump this junk company for anything."
bad,"Culture:  good old boys club; who you know more important that what you know; rewards based on what you did not on business impact."
bad,It's run by Americans who think that everybody else is American.  Senior management and architects were severely limited in their technical knowledge and this could spell doom for projects.
bad,"I learned a lot about working in a R & D environment.  For the most part I worked with very good managers who cared and provided good leadership."
bad,"Exceptional front line talent but due to salaries, management is always looking for ways to send work to India."
bad,"sales/acount executive"
bad,worst management  ever great products no direction good pay and benefits not very good growth potential do not work here management took company bankrupt
bad,"Simply put, couldn't expect consistency in pay, job duties changed every week.  Didn't help the perspective and reputation of a black owned company."
bad,Avaya is an OK company to work for. They are coming out of bankruptcy so they working on that. They are working on providing the best equipment so that customers are happy with their equipment choice.
bad,These people do not know how to run a business. They promise you things and never deliver meaning raises promotions an such this to me felt like a dead end job.
bad,4 billion in Matured Debt - Chapter 11 bankruptcy= layoffs... Sold off portions of the business in order to stay afloat that jeopardized 1000's of jobs
bad,"focus of company is entirely on revenue, not customer satisfaction. Each employee group works against others in order to protect their own revenue results.  Lots of unnecessary processes, tracking, reporting diminishing time that customer-facing employees have to actually work with customers.  No training on new products so teams have to learn as they implement.  Pricing models are flawed.  No work-life balance."
bad,Used to be a great place to work before being sold to capital investor.  Since then it was a constant fear of layoffs (which happened often).  Seems to be no direction and uncertain of their future.
bad,"This is the worst working place i ever worked. No management, no rule. Overall poor working place."
bad,The first day I started I was assigned to a lower responsibility job.  I was asked to be a team player and manage it for 2 months while they hired someone to take it over.  Two years later I had the same responsibilities with no end in site.  The company only hit their quarterly sales and financial targets once in two years.
bad,"Told in the middle of a ""small town meeting"" that if I needed to make more money, I should find another job outside of the company. Embarrassing, poor excuse for management. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to seek employment here."
bad,Upper management top heavy and out of touch with reality. Decision making regarding jobs are just made just to meet headcount not customer service needs.
bad,"I was hired as a sales person and paid well. However I was not given the territory of the person I replaced. I was given less than 1/2 the territory and after 2 months on quota they let me go. I wasn't selling direct, I had to rely on the channel to sell. They let a lot of people go at the end of last year to lower costs before an IPO. Read their 10K - billions in debt!"
bad,"Avaya, was a spin off from Lucent which was a spin off from AT&T. I remember Don the CEO flying in saying they needed a major layoff to reduce costs. His next sentence was defending the purchase of the second corporate jet. He said, You can’t expect the executives to use public transformation. Also commented on the executive golf course which he said was where the deals were made."
bad,Avaya was driven to bankruptcy by poor management decisions and blood sucking VCs (Silverlake Partners) Huge egos in senior management failed to capitalize on superior acquired technology and the vulture capitalists sucked the life (money) out of the company.  Same senior management left behind to put lipstick on the pig to dupe customers and investors.
bad,Not a place to build a career unless you are looking to cruise.  Culture for sales is not there and management will cheat you of your bonus if they can get away with it.
bad,"Massive Layoffs seems to be the key the last 7-8 years I worked for Avaya. Our team was being bounced from manager to manager. It was very difficult to concentrate on your job when you do not have a secure position. As more and more people left, job quality seemed to disappear."
bad,"Consistent decline in business revenue. Constant cost cutting, & layoffs. Always doing more with less and increased stress. Very depressed environment."
bad,"The Incubator was created in the Nortel Leadership working for Mike Z.  CEO at the time."
bad,"Company is in Financial Turmoil."
bad,"Sadly, a great company is now about poor management since they went private and layoffs are constant. My manager was a great gut, but was stuck in the middle of the current quandry."
bad,"At Avaya, I have been able to work with some of the brightest and most dedicated employees in IT.    The bleak financial outlook and limited resources are the most difficult part of the job.  The products are rock solid."
bad,"Work hours are flexible. I always put in more hours than 40 hours/week to get my jobs done to my satisfaction. No mandated language or tool to use, whichever works better for what the testing needs. Great relationship with co-workers among all teams. It would have been an ideal job to keep if it weren't for the continuous layoffs in the recent years."
bad,"The company has a lot of potential and some very promising products however the management (at the moment) in ANZ is rather poor and hence there is lack of motivation, work culture and positive reviews to give."
bad,"Due to an acquisition, I worked tirelessly from home 12+ hours a day to ensure I built trust with management, to no avail.  I left afterwards even with the possibility to gain another week of vacation.  Not worth the stress and hours."
bad,"fun place to work"
bad,"this company has the brains to be what ever they want, the leadership is great. they lack the ability to keep their employees happy with perks and they leave. this in turn makes everyone else wear several hats and it will burn you out"
bad,Company was not doing too well. They were cutting costs at all ends.
bad,"I would take 20 to 30 customer calls during a shift. I would handle a variety of requests and help other associates handle their calls, when they came across a request they did not know the answer or methods available, to complete the request."
bad,"During financial restructuring most of the good people left or were let go. Avaya will have an up hill task to hire the same level of talent."
bad,"Plagued by bureaucracy and silo'ed teams there was no place to go but down for this company. "
bad,Good pay but long hours and a lot of travel.  Past paced with constant changes; management was a revolving door with very limited leadership qualities or understanding of the business requirements. The company eventually went bankrupt.
bad,The opportunity was very challenging with no rewards. The company is struggling to stay afloat after their acquisition of Nortel.  Everyone is in panic mode wondering will their jobs be in existence tomorrow.  I would not recommend this company for anyone who is looking for a stable work environment.
bad,Avaya started off pretty well however in recent times company's performance has not been well and there a talks it being sold to some other Major corporation.
bad,"I'm actually surprised to see jobs posted when layoffs took place last year, and notifications just went out again for this year. No raises, slim bonus, no promotions or lateral transfers. Constant change in management, personnel leaving without notice and no back fill for vacancies."
bad,"Avaya seems to get lost in its acquisitions. We take on the bad habits in addition to debt of drowning companies. The acquired product lines add to the headaches of an already struggling company. Looking forward to the day when the policies and procedures will benefit Avaya's stability. The job itself is enjoyable and the customers are great, but the furloughs and layoffs every year do not give employees the idea that we will have long term careers with the company."
bad,This company is confused by its own heritage. Red or Blue - they don't know. Unfortunately quality top management is overrun by incompetent mid-level managers who have been there for life.
bad,"EBIDA EBIDA EBIDA"
bad,"Very Stressful - constant layoffs"
bad,"Boring culture, no work life balance, very stressful. In the end after at Avaya for a few years, was laid off. Previous CEO drove the company into the ground causing the company to have to file C11 bankruptcy. Although they came out of it, there were a fair amount of budget cuts."
bad,This was an ok place to work. Poor management made it hard for your team to grow. Excellent benefits. Great training. Room for advancement. Challenging. Lack of communication between supervisors and team leads.
bad,"Financial stability was up and down with the company the entire time I worked there. Leadership was vague and listless.  Compensation was excellent, but you knew you were on a sinking ship."
bad,"Like to build products without any market demand. Reject anything innovative, especially when it comes to their current portfolio of products. Massive brain drain of talent including most of their creative thinkers. Completely run by accountants."
bad,"Avaya, used to be a great place to work for...sadly when Silverlake/TPG bought it, it no longer cared about its customers and became disinterested/scattered & misdirected with its own company and its employees."
bad,"Great people and technology but needs to grow and innovate beyond the PBX core products. Struggles to catch-up or keep pace with new leading edge technologies. Constant senior leadership turnover has resulted in uncertainty and low morale. Seems poised for public offering with strategy to leverage embedded base to sell new virtualized solutions for ""cloud"" play however IT spending challenges may limit success."
bad,Good place to work
bad,Company was great to work for before investors took it public and shifted to a short-term outlook. All decisions seem to be based the quickest way to take the company public to maximize bonuses.
bad,"Avaya is a competitive environment with only minimal camaraderie. However, the people I worked with were good people with an appreciation for their work. "
bad,"Growth opportunity occurs as result of continuous restructuring."
bad,"My manager and the team I work with are excellent individuals and contributors. I have learned a great deal from them, both professionally and personally."
bad,A typical day is working across boundries to close open issues.
bad,Company pays well and has excellent benefits. Lacks leadership and upper\middle management do not know what they are doing. Expects employees to do the work of 2-3 people
bad,"Legacy CPE company, struggling to get to cloud offerings. No clear contract, pricing or delivery model. Technology is excellent. Unstable job environment"
bad,"What an awful candidate experience in Argentina. How can you disregard that kind of thing? One of my interviews was re-schedulled unconveniently, it's the first time ever someone made a comment about a physical aspect in one of my interviews and my present job was downgraded by people who seemed to haven't even read my CV. Really unprofesional. I never had an experience like that before. Very disrespectful to someone you haven't even read anything about. You don't even know who Is in front of you and give that kind of treatment. And worse yet, in a professional environment."
bad,"great engineers Good work-life balance and overall quality employees"
bad,Workplace and colleagues are very co operative. They are always helpful and always ready to give a helping hand. The campus is good as well. Overall is not bad.
bad,"My team is very good, and team members are very supportive. However, company overall is struggling. Product/marketing/business model all have their issues."
bad,"Avaya is perpetually in transition to the 21st century, lacking any coherent strategy or rational leadership. At this point it's a shell company for outsourcers, marketers, lawyers, and accountants, a scrap heap of failed acquisitions, old telecom patents, and b2b buzzwords."
bad,"1 good experience "
bad,"Most of what I did at the job was travel preparation for government people, traveling internatiaonlly and domestically. My coworkers were awesome. The Federal workers that I worked with, made it clear that contractors were beneath, which brought down the morale of the job. Avaya was not very supportive or inactive with their employees."
bad,At Avaya was mainly focussing :
bad,"They have no class.  I was acquired from another company as a remote worker.  They told us we were the best of the best as we made it through drastic reductions in the prior company.  I was laid off after 3 months via a phone call and the next weekend I received a welcoming kit from Avaya. Lost my sign on bonus as well because I didn’t stay a year. They did provide severance though.  "
bad,"Recent bankruptcy makes it unsecure. Great work and life balance. Good for someone who is already experienced . That's all about it...,................."
good,"Learning work, it was difficult to work in the graveyard shifts"
good,Not a very trusting environment. Out of three VPs only one VP has influence on the CEO and he is not very open to other ideas.  It's his way or the highway.  No work/life balance.....even when you are dealing with life events!
good,The people you work with Avaya are good people and really know alot about what they do.  The downside is that they have been there for a long so they only know that job.  That is the issue with Avaya is that they do not have any way to promote people who deserve it because there is no place to move unless you get rid of someone or create a new position.  The pay was not good because they were so tight on cost.
good,Great pay and you get to work from home for most positions but its stability and turnover is horrible. I would think very hard before accepting an offer from them.
good,was very happy with work place. once change in management came the culture changed. Avaya is a good place to work if your not looking to move up within the company.
good,"You can pay the bill, but always be ready to be laid off. Worked there 7 years, had 10 different managers. People are removed with out any thought. No continuity with customers. Management only works to the numbers. Unethical book keeping practices."
good,"liked my coworker, but had a very high turnover rate. its a good place to learn, but very hard to grow. work load is so much and its very stressful"
good,empresa de buena competencia en el mercado tecnologico y buenas infraestructuras
good,This company was a pretty large business ran like a start up.   People were aligned to the wrong positions internally and externally.  Putting contractors in the right positions was big problem.  Clients constantly asked for replacements.   There were miscommunication and conflicts between contractors and government clients all the time.
good,This company does have some great products but it doesn't seem they are very interested in promoting the employees and moving them up.
good,The management and company will not allow an idea to come to fruition and turnover is constant.  They need to decide what kind of company they are going to be and stick with it.
good,"This was my first experience in retail buying at large scale. I was in kitchen electrics, luggage, and small electrics department."
good,"Management do not have even the slightest idea on the work employees do."
good,"You never know what a new day will bring.  The work is interesting, management manages up, but not down.  It's all politics and it gets in the way of productivity and quality."
good,Pro's: Fast paced environment. Good benefits and decent time off.
good,"Avaya WAS a great place to work, talented people working hard toward a common goal. This changed in the last 18 months. No strategy, no leadership, teams cut to the point where they are no longer functional."
good,Management seemed to be very confused.  they were more concerned with time entry per week and forecasting into the future than the treatment of the customer.
good,"indians men refuse to take orders from a woman which makes it hard to work with them. The job itself is not bad, there needs to be more available resources."
good,"Once the venture capitalist bought it, they accelerated the downhill slide of the company, eventually driving it into bankruptcy."
good,"No communication from upper management, company is trying hard to retain revenue and talent but it's not really working.  People are nice to work with though."
good,"Managements main focus is on production, no employee activities planned. Very little employee training or interactive activities to promote communications and development."
good,Something was always different every day that kept the job interesting.  Variety made the job new every day.  Mary had a little lamb it's fleece was white as snow. Management was good.
good,Thought Avaya will be carrying some of the Lucent cultures being a spin off of Lucent but I have to admit they are Far Beyond getting there and not sure if they will...!!!
good,"Avaya has a huge problem with their technology, they inherited the enterprise portfolio from Nortel and completely abandoned all of the positive benefits from the Nortel portfolio.  Avaya also did not properly incorporate and/or manage the Nortel Enterprise data portfolio.  Whereas Nortel's philosophy was the customer always came first, Avaya's was to try to swindle as much money from the customer as possible...and often by producing long, complicated and illegible quotes/proposals"
good,Not a company to reward merit and talent. Managers don't give space to employees to perform. The culture promotes mediocrity. Values like ethics and integrity are seen missing.
good,"Overall, this company had some dedicated loyal employees from prior acquisitions. The company was in constant turmoil from financial difficulties. Corporate message was not unified and the company didn't totally embrace acquisitions from 2008."
good,"Managed a team of customer reps in call center. Trained and wrote practices on customer service. Observed calls for accuracy and quality.  Hardest part was keeping up with 15-20 people, document files doing quality checks on all of them for purposes of yearly reviews.  Harder than that was having to let people go.  I loved the personal contact and being able to work with different people and watching them grow into great reps."
good,"Company has excellent solutions for customers and great tools and innovative events for employees.  It would be great to stop having annual mass layoffs and bankruptcy every 5-6 years !"
good,"Is a place where there's always a new procedures, but never a communication of when this changed, or how to proceed. You just received an email rejecting what you just did."
good,Very technology oriented company but lack of long term perspective. Customers are there just to win but not to keep.
good,"My review of Avaya is not good as well as my experience. The business was focused on technology and trying to provide the right tools to the customers, but somehow management lost site that their employees that work hand-in-hand with the Avaya customers are just as important and need to be taken care of appropriately."
good,"Environnement de travail plutôt agréable "
good,"upper management is poor, always changing! no concern for the customer.  the company lowered head count to reduce expenses, rather than pursue organic growth of the business."
good,"I was part of Nortel, before Avaya bought us out, we became Avaya in 2010."
good,Company kept getting smaller and smaller.   Every Executive Management especially in IT would eliminate most upper level management and replace with their own staff resulting in major disruptions in our we supported the business.
good,Would not recommend them for someone hoping to remain at one company and not bounce around.  Not employee focused.  Interested solely on the business and no concern for family work life balance.
good,The group I worked with did not focus on anything important during the day. They used vulgar more often than not. The experience was awful and the company is on a downhill fall
good,"I worked there for 4 months. In the first week my boss quit, soon after most of payroll followed. Wasn't the greatest work environment, and"
good,"I was able to work remotely. Coworkers were helpful and friendly. Limited opportunity for advancement. "
good,"Working with my fellow senior technicians was a joy and honor. They gave 110 percent for all the high impact customers using our products at Avaya. I worked very long hours and watched as the work was given to other companies to streamline our company. It was hard watching the company lose so many intelligent, skilled and responsible people. I do enjoy the time being in the field working with all my customers, both large and small businesses,"
good,"I start the days reviewing and deciding on which projects to prioritize and maintain detailed configurations, customer communication, task scheduling, and problem resolution"
good,Involved in a lot of international tax planning and transfer pricing.  I have nothing else to say about Avaya and the culture.  Will discuss the company further in person.
good,Avaya has very large off-shore team.  Daily calls started from Sunday midnight to Thursday midnight.  Very taxing and disruptive to have a healthy work-life balance.
good,Laid back management structure. Ideal environment for applicants with previous experience in mental health field. Can be confusing and misleading if not.
good,"Too many D and E level management changes.  The organization was in a constant state of flux with each leadership change.  It seemed as though they were chasing their competitors by trying to mimic their management approach.  "
good,"Great people, decent work, little opportunity for advancement. And future is not bright. what more can I say. Not what I would recommend"
good,Flexibility for remote/virtual working culture. Best part is co-workers who supports each other. Long hours and heavy work load. Best part is virtual location and co-workers.
good,"I was responsible for managing a ticket queue as well as answer inbound calls in a fast paced environment. Daily duties included programming as well as troubleshooting Avaya's VOIP system for small/medium businesses. In addition to learning skills to troubleshoot the telecom system, I also learned to troubleshoot PRI, analog and H.323 lines. During my time at Avaya, I was able to hone my customer service skills. I really enjoyed working with the small/medium size customer base."
good,Slowly declining market share and customer base thus not much growth cannot be expected. It's okay to stay there for a short time but I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay with Avaya for a longer-term.
good,Company has gone through difficult time as entire industry has changed.  Company is struggling to remake itself.  time will tell whether the current strategy will succeed.
good,"Classic mixes of how NOT to manage; Part arrogance, part incompetence, add in another part of ""because I said so"" and stir in some vindictive ""gotcha"" and you have a cocktail called, ""Why care about people?"""
good,"Avaya has been thru many changes. Company allows you to work from home, good on the job training and good atmosphere. If company was financially stable would be a bonus to work for."
good,Avaya was not a very people orientated company it was all about the bottom line financially and job security was always at risk. The upper management were not very good at meeting the people and communication was lacking.
good,"Fun place to work, the hardest part of the job is staying focus on just your projects.. everyone wants your help if you're a rock star! Knowledge is power!"
good,Company does not protect its employees or help them find other work within the company. Some managers ok. Our prime was a tool and did not know what he was doing.
good,"I have nothing really to say here. Was an OK job, but Sr management is woefully deficient. Poor product and financial decisions.  But again, they no something we don't"
good,"Excellent technical teams working hard towards the short term goals."
good,outsourcing for cheap unskilled labor is taking over avaya. They have let go of so many talented employees that now work at many business partners of Avaya. Upper mgmt and silver lake partners are f'ing horrible. The horrible vision and decisions they made have ruined the company. Billions in debt.
good,"Most difficult part of the day is heavy work load and constant change."
good,"They are hard working, living the values and goals of Avaya.  CEO needs to care more about his teams and foster them with a fun supported work environment."
good,The internship was a great introduction to the corporate environment.  Management did an excellent job ensuring that Interns got the most out of their experience.
good,"Great people, advancement difficult, lack of opportunity for growth experiences."
good,Avaya is a technology giant in the area of telecommunications
good,Was once a great company to work for but do to out sourcing and change in company direction has become a dead end company to work for. With no training and little room for advancement has become a place to be from and for going to.
good,"I am employed by Avaya Government Solutions, but I work in a federal building for the Administrative Office(AO) of the US Courts.  I report to a government manager and work mostly with government employees.  Avaya bought this contract 3 years ago right when I arrived, and the only time I hear from them is when I need to sign my time sheet or they are announcing another cut to benefits. Avaya is not involved in my day to day and I have received 1 yearly review since starting 3 years ago."
good,"I am employed in a union enviornment, so the job security is good but there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement. T, or movement. There is a lot of micro managing that takes place, and the priorities change from month to month. I also don't feel that Associates inputs are heard from management."
good,"The company has some of the most intelligent, dedicated, and talented people in their Services organization. The thing I see as a challenge is the management churn currently occurring. There is a great deal of change going on in the company currently."
good,Global company striving for best in class services. Consistently laying off large numbers of it's labor force. Great management in the Managed Services division.
good,Hard to be happy where your efforts are not fully appreciated.
good,Avaya appears to be interested in improving benefits and culture. Career advancement is difficult. Not a lot of perks to working there that would differentiate it from any other place.
good,"Telecom jobs are slowly going away do to new technology.  This new technology was developed by Avaya, but open to any company who wants to use it.  Not a great industry to be in if you are looking for job security."
good,"Great technology that is fun to sell and propose to achieve desired customer requirements.  "
good,"Avaya's business is in constant decline for the last few years. As a result the company has no other choice but to keep restructuring and cut expenses, leading to layoffs and deteriorating employee benefits.  The company spent 2017 in chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, but it emerged out of bankruptcy in 2018 with half of the debt forgiven and went public."
good,"Buen clima laboral, es flexible para poder balancear el trabajo con la vida familiar."
good,"We provided Telephony support for many Canada's largest companies. great work atmosphere,It was a great place to until they outsourced many jobs to India."
good,"My recollections of Avaya are less pertinent than whatever's currently in the news, as the company is still struggling to emerge from bankruptcy. I will say the company has successfully transitioned from a hardware-centric company to a software company. At the time I worked there, management and leadership was generally very sloppy."
good,"Compania en caída, mala situación financiera muchas presiones, upper management incompetente."
good,Management was a joke -- they spend so much time posing and doing politics that all efforts are passed onto the teams. Top Managers also don't care / deal with non-managers. Terrible work experience.
good,Responsible for installations and repair of small business to enterprise telephone systems for the largest company and corporations in Michigan. Was able to increase my skill set into the digital and voice over IP communications arena.  Management would routinely allow me to function and supervise the crew with little or no macro management.  Learned to better lead and mentor unionized technical crew.  Took pride in customer satisfaction and coaching subordinates.  Crew gained numerous industry certifications along with company training.  Enjoyed being the person the customers could count on to repair or upgrade their communication systems.  Hardest part was the eventual downsizing and laying off members of my crew and ultimately being laid off myself.
good,Company is not perfect. Seems as though they are trying to make changes in order to go from private to public.
good,"Avaya has some of the top people in the industry.  It is a fantastic place to be exposed to cutting edge technologies, and work with experts."
good,"A great place to work back in 2009-2010, somewhat unstable with a high turnaound and a constant change of role responsibilities not allowing growth."
good,A typical day at work would be taking inbound outbound calls and while I was an employee for these companies I learned to keep my cool when the pressure starts to set in while also staying focus and productive and as far as management I didn't spend a lot of time with my superiors due to work load but I had plenty of time to assist co-workers during down time which I didn't mind because we worked as a team and the hardest part about the job was keeping a positive spin on situations when dealing with irate customers but the most enjoyable part about the job was knowing that I was able to help a customer get their issue resolved.
good,"My colleagues in the Law Group were hard working, knowledgeable and professional. Many were Nortel veterans. Unfortunately the merging of the two companies was never quite as harmonious as it could have been with the right direction."
good,Assisted VP with terminating employees and closing Austin office.
good,"I am employed by Avaya Government Solutions, but I work in a federal building for the Administrative Office(AO) of the US Courts. I report to a government manager and work mostly with government employees. Avaya bought this contract 3 years ago right when I arrived, and the only time I hear from them is when I need to sign my time sheet or they are announcing another cut to benefits. Avaya is not involved in my day to day and I have received 1 yearly review since starting 3 years ago."
good,Avaya is a spinoff from Lucent which is a spinoff from AT&T. The work is complex and at the cutting edge at times. The company has some financial problems and has been reducing the workforce for several years in areas not growing. The current workforce is working long hours and little support from managment is the norm. Trival issues grow to become bigger issues that have to be escalated to get the required attention. Most workers are having issues with work/life balance.
good,A very challenging and timebound work environment with new projects lined eachup to learn and deliver with efficiency and effectiveness.
good,"A typical day is 7x24 as your are on-call , so week-ends and vacations are not free."
good,Typical daily activities included creating customer proposal packages. Communication between cross-functional organizations. Learned Corporate business model and values. Became efficent in various software applications. Management and co-workers were always very pleasant to work with. Hardest part of the position was working very long hours at quarter ends.
good,"A typical day at work involves juggling several different deliverables simultaneously. My current role is very demanding. The information that I provide is used to make critical strategic business decisions. The current state of the business involves a number of different restructuring activities. I work closely with our Human Resource Business Partners, Corporate Finance and our Leadership Team to ensure that we are meeting the monthly objectives that are being set by the corporation. I also enjoy working closely with my colleagues. With the high demands and short timeframes, it is crucial to have people that you can count on to be there for you and with you to see the projects through. The most challenging part of my job is finding enough hours in the day to be able to complete all of the different tasks that are presented. The most enjoyable part of my job, other than my team, is in knowing that the information I provide is critical and that there are some very complex business decisions being made based on the facts that are being presented. I enjoy being able to communicate with all levels of management assisting them with understanding the facts that are being presented."
good,"Flexible hours but sometimes the schedules are demanding."
good,Worked closely with the Vice President of CRM Solutions and served as a member of the executive management team.  Avaya spun-off from Lucent Technologies in September of 2000.
good,"Learnt a great deal"
good,"My tenure at Avaya was very short.  It provided me the opportunity to learn, grow and advance to other opportunities.  I believe that Avaya would be a company that I could work again."
good,"Check in, then supervisor meeting 10 minutes, I manage two 10 man and woman stands one of them beer only. I oversee a 20 to 25 personnel Stand. After meeting walk through each stand make sure everything is turned on, working and operating before my employees check in an hour after me. Every stand has different groups for instance an high school football and cheer team,parents and coaches. Or a high school band group of parents. So interacting with soccer fans and team members is enjoyable to any one I believe"
good,Sales Position. Sold Cutco Cutlery Knives sets to customers. Used Avaya phone system to contact leads. Customer Service and sales experience. Outdoor environment.
good,"good company great product good benefits worked with great people on the job training"
good,This was a difficult company to work for due to the fact that when I joined it had just merged with Nortel.   This made for a difficult transition in determining the workplace culture
good,Avaya is a critical vendor to many companies around the world.  The new Avaya team is transforming the company and will create new exciting solutions for its customers.
good,Culture improvements will come now that Avaya has emerged from Bankruptcy.  Investment in products and solutions will help the company grow and possibly win back marketshare.
good,There was a general lack of mission and focus when I worked here making it difficult to find ones place and ability to contribute.  I believe this has improved
good,"Although I enjoyed my time at Avaya and the people I worked with and for I felt resources were stretched thin, there was no clear cloud strategy or product to sell and the compensation plan was very confusing.  I think Avaya is much different now they have gone public and been able to remove the large amount of debt they had on their balance sheet. The Nortel purchase was not handle properly in my opinion and those customers were not monetized.  So yes, now I would recommend Avaya to a friend however back a few years ago I would not have. "
good,Worked on Avaya Aura / VOIP product suite. While the technology was cutting edge; it wasn't a conducive environment for business during the market crash. Worked with a lot of smart people. Was fun!!
good,"I had a great time working for Avaya over the years, however the recent changes created a difficult environment to sell. Teams work against each other, tools and systems lack flexibility. Getting a customer quote took an army."
good,"Overall Exp is good, "
good,"The company has great developers, the produce incredible products. However, most of the research and development is being offshored to China and India."
good,"The company is a leader in the call center and unified communications arena. However, it was late to develop cloud solutions and it is loosing market share. Also the company spent most of 2017 in chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, which also hurt revenue."
good,"I enjoyed my position with this company, however I worked among many employees that did not feel compelled to uphold a high standard of work. The managemant was well ran."
good,"Workload is reasonable."
good,typical day at work is fine.  management is fine.  most enjoyable part of the job is people.  hardest part of the job is data mining.  workplace culture is fine.
good,How can I say it any other way the atmosphere and people were great but the stress and low pay was ultimately why I left. I was head hunted by my next employer for a 30% increase in income.
good,Una empresa con mucho potencial pero con problemas financieros.
good,Very open work culture and lot of freedom to research and development. Learning new technologies and working on them always welcome in this company to wrok.
good,"It was no fun to work with the team since everyone is just working. The hardest of the job in my team was unfair from manager. Overall, it's just OK ."
good,"Here we go again on why do you need a review of my previous place of employment."
good,I enjoyed working with Avaya Federal Solutions team which was a subset business unit of the larger Avaya corporation.  The work was challenging and fulfilling.  Little by little the corporation took away 401k matching and accrued vacation days.
good,They valued there employees and did a lot of fun activities to boost morale. It was a union environment so you the benefits package was top notch. There was some advancement but not tons
good,As a tech it is very fast paced rushing to the next customer. Training is all on the job formal training is nonexistent. A lot of driving with little customer site time
good,"The company I began with, Lucent was very busy and growing when I began.  The company was purchased by a private equity firm who worked tirelessly to make the copy ""lean"".  Unfortunately, this adversely effected the customer experience and employee moral and job security."
good,"Managed the Indirect Channel Marketing team looking to expand our channel partner base within our channel programs. Focused on demand gen, partner training and enablement, communications."
good,"I learned a lot while with Avaya, met lots of wonderful people. The company seems to have lost focus on their employees."
good,"Avaya is known as a leader in helping organizations around the world succeed by integrating communications with business strategy and operations. In fact, Avaya came about as an independent company so it could bring even more focus to innovating in business communications."
good,All companys have there ups and downs it ok too work there to many changes and managenet were not sportful Co workers talk to much and the manager just dont give you any support I did not like working there that much
good,"A la suite de délocalisation stratégique vers des pays à moindre coûts salariaux, la société belge a décidé de se séparer de plusieurs de ses collaborateurs lors d'une procédure de licenciement collectif qui fut finalisée en décembre 2015."
good,"There is a minimal amount of overtime and several learning opportunities.  Management is easy to work with however the company does not have a stable environment for management and layoffs occur on a regular basis"
good,"Worked from remote office. Typical work week consisted administrative day on Mondays usually, customer meetings Tuesday through Thursday, and Fridays consisted of team meetings and wrapping up the week to perform duties such as appropriate follow-ups, meetings, etc. "
good,"Independent workplace environment, management for the most part entrusts their employees to get their jobs done, and done correctly."
good,Ho avuto la possibilità di confrontarmi con colture internazionali da cui ho tratto molta esperienza sia di vita che lavorativa
good,"The company carries a lot of debt both technical and financial. "
good,"The team I worked on, was a good team. There was division between the contractors and government employees. Company did not do a good job and communicating with the employees."
good,I was there to support the client. Did not work directly for the company. Very friendly atmosphere. Nothing more to say as I was a contractor not an employee
good,Avaya offers decent wages and benefits but the job security is absent.  Avaya is constantly laying off employees without warning to ease their bottom line.  This is not a place to work if job security is important to you. The products are exceptional but the ability to get them to market through the channel model is challenging.
good,Great opportunity for anymore that thrives on an atmosphere that requires juggling more that one task at a time. Avaya is a company that utilizes an individual talents in all sectors of company.
good,"Generally a good place to work. People are great very helpful, I really enjoyed the challenging work environment."
good,"1) A Typical Day at Work"
good,Troubleshooting Complex issues escalations. Ticketing system. Customer visits. Workshop. Training courses
good,In this job I worked as an off-site consultant for AVAYA as part of obtaining a Six Sigma Green Belt.  The team that I was on was tasked with finding ways to improve customer satisfaction.
good,Great place to work. Dynamic company with  very capable highly experienced professionals.
good,"Un día típico puedo ser desde mi casa o yendo a la oficina, la clave es la presencia virtual. La empresa cuenta con muchas herramientas administrativas para tener centralizado tu trabajo desde tu propia PC, incluyendo teléfono, conferencia por video, etc de modo que puedo dar soporte desde cualquier lado con conexión. Aprendí mucho sobre necesidades y como las como las tecnologías pueden empalmarse con otras, converger y generar sinergia, incoporporé trabajar con colegas de diversas partes del mundo en muchos husos horarios. Aprendí a poder tener un supervisor argentino localmente, tanto como con un norteamericano desde el exterior sin que cambie la relación profesional. La parte más difícil del trabajo es la inmediatez permanente y la cultura de la escalación en búsqueda de atención donde todo pasa a ser una prioridad. Por desgracia muchas veces responde a trabas por procesos administrativos que no agregan valor. Lo que más me gusta de mi trabajo, además de la flexibilidad es el permanente aprendizaje sobre los cambios de mercado y como la empresa responde con soluciones. La cultura de trabajo y la gente que trabaja en ella que se ayuda mutuamente cuando es necesario y todos ponen el hombro."
good,"Good to work here."
good,"not much to say, union made things interesting, typical work place nothing special"
good,Excellent work environment and its a great place to work and grow in the business/IT world
good,"A typical day includes challenging day at work. A lot to learn with agile projects and with co-workers matching your trade of thoughts. "
good,First company that i worked for. helped me build up a good platform.
good,Excelente ambiente laboral. Plan de carrera inexistente. Muy mal salario.
good,Building PCS cabinets for Sprint. Impossible to hit the daily expected quota.  Union shop and worse off because of it.
good,Summary says it all.  Company is in the process of transitioning product support to 3rd party overseas venders.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"A typical work place similar to AT&T and Lucent:"
good,Good company with a strong union.  Until they beat down the union and ruined the job.
good,Working for Telecommunications Corporations was very rewarding. You learn to work harmoniously with many cultures across many different countries. My most difficult task was China induction into the new Expense Management System. The language barrier was difficult and learning the China Banks would not converse with US Citizens directly made it difficult to work with them. After 2 years of communications we were success in implementing a new corporate card program and a new T&E system to include over 40+ International Markets. It was enjoyable learning the cultures and different programs and governmental agency requirements. You are rewarded with making new friends and coworkers all over the world. Learning their cultures and developing working relationships and personal rewards knowing you were able to make a difference and succeed in your job.
good,"Nice workplace, Learning new things, Better Exposure, Nice co workers, Hardest part is to except the challenges, enjoyable in work life balance manner"
good,"I always felt that management, especially at the supervisory level, could do more for the technicians. Reasonably good benefits for unionized employees."
good,"Worked with some brilliant minds. The compensation and benefits were competitive. There were good technologies and high standards in place. The overall culture was work hard, provide rock solid code, and every once and a while escape to lunch/outing with your co-workers. Standard working hours."
good,"Stressed work typical, and one PM with much of customer project on the same time."
good,"The pay and benefits are excellent. Training is almost nonexistent for techs, mainly web based CBT."
good,As part of the lab management team we took requests from the engineers for equipment / network set ups.
good,"has pro's and cons but the usual multi national issues\politics exist."
good,"Their facility is nice and in a great location with added amenities like a gym and other recreational areas.  "
good,"Stressfull jobs, Owners of Avaya didn't care about the customers or their employees. The job was a good one but management made it stressful and unfair at times. Management didn't treat everyone equally. Bad workers got away with it."
good,"Of late, the company management has changed and also the company went public. Since then, the hiring quality has fallen and that resulted in hiring of some Service Company mentality managers. They are now managing a product team like a service company. No emphasis on quality but more emphasis on processes."
good,"Trabajo con buen ambiente, me sirvió para aprender varias herramientas de la empresa y utilizar lenguajes de programación como Javascript."
good,"The company worked for a contractor which worked for another contractor, which worked in conjunction with overseas agents, and the lack of being able to communicate between departments was very stressful."
good,"After 32 years, Avaya cannot get out of its own way. Combining the Bell Company mentality with the new ever dynamic marketplace has proved daunting for this company. Their products are fantastic, their service is mediocre at best, their overall strategy continues to get muddied leadership that is slow to market, unacquainted with the fields needs and our customers requirements."
good,"Had a great opportunity to affect the marketing effort of a fairly large region. Regrettably, management was very hung up. Ethernet legacy employees (AT&T days) versus the newer workforce.  These conflicts hindered free flow of ideas. Many good people left."
good,Avaya is a good technical and company where you can learn a lot of stuff. But management seems to be not working for growth of the team. Overall a good experience and enjoyed working here.
good,You do get opportunities to learn.The work life balance is very well taken care.Its always good to be a self starter and not wait for direction from management
good,Great legacy killed off by failing direction taken by upper management and Venture Capitalist owners. It appears as of the start of 2017 bankruptcy is eminent.
good,"• Set up a mini LAN and managed wiring, device placements and installations singlehandedly"
good,"Continually in a downsizing mode, as revenue continues to drop. Increased pressure/work on the remaining staff.  I would not recommend this as a place to work."
good,"It is a great workplace where personal & professional life is balanced."
good,"Avaya continues to reduce staff, causing more work to fall on the people that remain.  Employees uncertain of the future of Avaya, which causes unrest. The employees made the job, and when the experienced people were forced out and new, lower salaried people were brought in, it caused a lot of dissatisfaction and a lot more work for the veteran employees.  Not a fun place to work. I hope they get it figured out before it's too late, but reducing staff and expecting the same level of work is not the right way to grow a company.  you will begin to see this in the CSAT reports."
good,Nice place to learn and improve on Avaya telecom products and explore new products and work on implementation from scratch to sign off. Also few things where we can get exposed to Dubai clients and there requirements. But need attention on employee benefits so that they get encouraged and give better output.
good,"Good group of people in the department, management is weak and will not get out in front of major/tough decision. Work Life balance is non existance. Leadership suffers from shiny red ball syndrome."
good,"Different level of System & Network Support up to the Hardware & the Software Standards to end users/Clients"
good,"Avaya boasts a great end to end suite of solutions, with great pay and benefits for those who work toward it."
good,"Good benefits with good pay."
good,"Established strategic ways of selling our product lines with positive results. Exceed quota by 150%. Have brought a customer base of Fortune 500 clients, in the financial, medical, technology, etc. fields. Also increased our business partner’s base."
good,"My typical Day at work is to get escalations for a Product called Call Management System, I also would receive requests to assist in installs for our client application called CMS Supervisor.  I was the Subject Matter expert for this application and would assist installing it in many different environments.  I recently was laid off due to cuts being done in the whole Avaya organization and will miss all of my co-workers and those that made me the IT professional I am today"
good,"great people, complete work life balance, decent pay, however not much growth opportunity."
good,"Overall good company to work for, but business rarely stable."
good,"When Avaya was spun off from Lucent Technologies over 10 years ago, there was a lot of talk about how ""nimble"" the company would now be. Cut to 10 years later and it seems to be more of the same old AT&T attitude."
good,"Did nit enjoy my co workers "
good,"Avaya is a slow-paced, easy-going organization. If you are not too creative and excited about working for a living, this is your place. They take good care of their employees."
good,Great company to work for.  Allows employees to have a work/life balance and has a great overall structure.  The only downside is that there is no job security.  Throughout my 9 years with Avaya I've seen dozens of layoff periods and the atmosphere was somewhat grim.
good,it was an ok place. People are nice and you can work from home. not much opportunity for advancement and the company is going through a lot of changes in leadership
good,"Great team, good leader"
good,Opportunities to learn all types of job functions if willing to learn.  Hardest part of job was the always changing environment. Hard to maintain a work/life balance.
good,"Company has excellent products and many Fortune 500 customers.  Unfortunately they are in Chapter 11 and going through a lot of reorganization. Great people to work with, but trying times."
good,"Avaya is a promising company still working to shed it's legacy identity, recover from the disruption of the Nortel merger and move forward with re-branding itself.  The people, technology and vision are in place.  Marketing and the sales / SE force are also improving. "
good,Interacted with customers to optimize their solutions. Researched the future of communications and developed presentations for company VP.
good,"alle im Forderungsmanagement erforderlichen Arbeiten wie:"
good,Many years spent working with this company.  It has been a great place to advance my career and salary.  Currently many positions are being impacted due to continual forced staff reductions.
good,"spent 27 years with telecom, the last 2 were not so fun. Avaya refused to train non-management an any new product they developed, decreasing our role in technical support"
good,Not that same work atmosphere as when it was Nortel. Managment not as open and infromative about the true state of the division/Company
good,"Placing and reviewing orders from internal as well as external customers. I'm available for incoming calls so being able to multitask is one of my many attributes. My position is a ongoing learning experience which is important to staying a valuable asset to the company. Can be high stress environment, so I'm very capable of handling all types of issues that comes with my position. The most pleasing part of my job is my fellow counterparts. They're very enjoyable to work with."
good,"Avaya is an interesting place to work.  Great technology to sell, good compensation packages, but a constantly changing Executive Team.  The ability to lead a global Team was a fantastic learning experience, I enjoyed my time there!"
good,I enjoyed working for Avaya.  I think the officers of the company make unfair decisions when it comes to resource cuts.  They cut resources in the US before other countries.  US employees are not secure.  Longevity or excellent work performance is not important to Avaya when it comes to cutting resources.  US employees are targeted first.
good,It is an excellent place to work in as you have flexible work hours and work pressure depends upon the projects you are working on but overall it is a nice place you can work
good,"Worked with a fantastic director that provided an environment for me to thrive as a presentation designer. Working directly for the CTO ensured job security, but also put constraint for any lateral movement in the company."
good,"1. Good company to work with"
good,"A typical day starts with Service requests."
good,good place to work but compensation is very poor once you get in. Very minimum or no hikes at all.No fixed salary appraisal cycle
good,Perform call blitzes to generate new business for the company. Built great relationships with my territory account managers and partners. At times the job is challenging but it is something that has helped me grow as a professional and an individual. Best part of my day? Seeing everyone on my team.
good,"Good high paying job. Worked without supervision. Went to customer locations, with excellent customer relations skills."
good,"I am student, searching for a job to which i can do in my spare time 5 days a week. I have I.T Operations, Telecom Operations & Avaya-Polycom Sales Experience."
good,"The hardest time of my employment at Avaya was the two years before they emerged from Chapter 11.  The main focus was on cost reduction and led to layoffs and reduction in benefits.  However, there were a lot of smart and innovative people to help ease the experience.  Now that they have emerged from Chapter 11, hopefully they will be able to restore the excitement and the good spirit in the workplace."
good,"	Technical Support for international Business Partners, Customers on the network & hardware related issues in all data portfolio of Nortel (AVAYA) within the agreed SLAs."
good,Avaya overall may make great products but this is some place where the future individual talents aren't given a lot of opportunity for growth.
good,"Avaya was once a great company to work for.  They produce some of the best equipment for any size customer and they probably are great as far as customer satisfaction goes. The problem lies with Avaya being a Union based company. This means that every field technician is equal on every level with the exception of seniority. So no matter how hard you work, how much smarter you are, or even how much better your year-end review compairs up next to the more senior technicians you will still be the first one to go come layoff time."
good,"learned lot of things like coordination with sales and services and stores dept. "
good,Gran escuela para aprender de Marketing Digital y Eventos.
good,Avaya is a good place to work. i run daily reports conduct staff meetings. work life balance is pretty good. the hardest part of the job is dealing with inventory shortages from 3rd party vendors. co-workers are very enjoyable to work with.
good,"avaya has its pros and cons. pro you can work from home. con they are always laying off. no 401k matching."
good,Management will want a lesser staff to work on 20 projects at the same time instead of focusing on 2 or 3  good product or strategy. Wide swath with lesser and lesser resources at each passing day.
good,Very fast paced environment with constant new regulations in the cloud environment. Constant changes to embrace Next generation products in a Voip environment.
good,"A lot of work and more work"
good,"This experience has shaped my life both personally and professionally and I will carry it with me until the end of time."
good,It was contract work.  Respond to help desk trouble tickets.
good,"- Empresa voltado para o profissional e para o aprendizado profissional em diversas áreas;"
good,"Customer Sat, Pricing Support to go to contract, dedicated to named accounts"
good,"Avaya is Ok to work at right now, going through lots of layoffs so no security at this time.  No upper movement as everyone is afraid to move to other positions as they go to the top of the layoff list,"
good,"It was a good job, now the company is going through bankruptcy and lots of layoffs. The pay WAS great, paid benefits, vacation and sick time. The culture was nonexistent, do you work and come home."
good,"Was Good Company to work as it was working in telecom domain, with cutting edge technologies."
good,"This company went from $6B years ago to >$1B in recent years. The company strategy was to utilize resellers to sell their products and service their customers. The result was that many resellers simply took the customer base. This is still a good company with great products to sell and learn about. However, the goal is to ultimately become a software company only that relies on VARS selling multiple solutions. Good place to learn...not much of a long term company to work for."
good,For the amount of money you make it is worth putting up with all the negatives of this position. Relationships between management and the union workers is the worst I've ever experienced. You do not feel supported some of the time and it can be extremely hard to get assistance from your managers. Co-workers are typically enjoyable to work.
good,"This was a field tech job. You met new people everyday, and the coworkers were great. You something new everyday.I entered this company at the worst time, they were already laying off the field techs, and moving away from the union shops."
good,Highly demanding and all tasks aere mission critical.  The work environment is fast paced and everchanging.
good,Avaya is a company where any employee can work hard as well as enjoy the life also outside the office hour.
good,"It has been over 12 years since I worked for Avaya, they were a publicly traded company back then.  I understand they have been through many changes, so I do not feel I can provide a current status."
good,"A typical day in field service was to see if you had trouble tickets or service orders assigned to work or you could have an installation project scheduled ( servers, port networks, gateways) "
good,"An excellent company for improving your technical skills. The workplace culture is also very good and relaxed. Compensation and benefits are at par with industry standards. One can work remotely at times, if needed, as long as the work is done."
good,"he wood-panelled tailgate of the 1972 Oldsmobile station wagon dangled open like a broken jaw, making a wobbly bench on which four kids could sit, eight legs swinging. Every Sunday morning, long before dawn, we’d get yanked out of bed to stuff the car’s way-back with stacks of twine-tied newspapers, clamber onto the tailgate, cut the twine with my mother’s sewing scissors, and ride around town, bouncing along on that bench, while my father shouted out orders from the driver’s seat. “Watch out for the dog!” he’d holler between draws on his pipe. “Inside the screen door!” “Mailbox!” As the car crept along, never stopping, we’d each grab a paper and dash in the dark across icy driveways or dew-drunk grass, crashing, seasonally, into unexpected snowmen. “Back porch!” “Money under the mat!” He kept a list, scrawled on the back of an envelope, taped to the dashboard: the Accounts. “They owe three weeks!” He did"
good,great collaboration and teamwork thruought the organization
good,"Avaya tries its best to get the business going and not to let go of its employees. When the company took off all the amenities just to not lay off another one of its employees, it says a lot about the mentality of the management team."
good,"Typical Work Day: Busy"
good,"This is a good company to work for, well managed, good pay, great vacation and health benefits. The environment makes you feel like a family member even though you work in a fast paced competitive environment"
good,I liked the job I had and the people were great to work with.  My customers liked me and I was able to build a strong relationship with them.  I enjoyed the opportunity to meet face to face with the customer and work on there issues.  Overall a good experience.
good,"While at Avaya I worked in repair, customer service, billing, training and customer software programming.  I was responsible for 4 national accounts and my day was consumed by the programming and removal of telephone lines and voice mail for the employees of those national companies.  There were also several accounts where I did the monthly inventory and monthly billing of the accounts."
good,"Cant talk about it now, but in my old times, I could rate this as my most memorable work. I did work a lot, but the team was great, the effort was general, the fun was excellent."
good,"Stressful and competitive place to work. Fast paced communication company on the cutting edge of technology. "
good,A good balance of work place and private life. I experienced good exposure to new technologies and the problem domain was very interesting at time. The company is coming at of bankruptcy after several years of being under the poor leadership of an equity firm.

I worked closely with project managers, account executives and upper level management in making sure all equipment was input and billed for a complete system whether it was a hospital account, an accounting firm or some other business entity that had small sub companies. I learned so much of what was entailed in having all lines of telecommunication functioning properly in order for a business to be online with all employees, management and all. The hardest part of the job was the timeline in collected and all work was complete. My adrenaline was always pumped up if I had to bill and collect on a multi-million dollar telephone system.

good,My management was hands off and allowed me to work and complete my work without supervision.  Discretionary time off is a huge plus.  401k matching is okay.  Healthcare benefits are terrible.
good,"good people, good learning with technologies and security within the DOD environment. I don't believe this company is around anymore. I believe they were bought out by Cambridge."
good,"Avaya had great opportunities for learning new networking features.  Direct management was very responsive, and acknowledged the efforts with perks.  Environment was fascinating and always undergoing change.   Benefits were competitive.  Training opportunities were available.  Best part of the job was the team.  People stayed because we were a very close and talented family."

This company is in financial difficulty and therefore reflected in the number of layoffs over the past number of years.

good,"Great teammates, knowledgeable."
good,I had work for AT&A and also Avaya for over 12 years and both work environments were similar.  The companies were very top down driven.  The people who did the most work got the least recognition.  There seemed to be an ever changing philosophy which made doing day to day operations difficult
good,"Great products, great people at the working level.  Upper management seems very set on being in front of the innovation pack and the new team that has taken over as Avaya emerged from bankruptcy is bringing massive change, too much at once.  A better evolutionary approach would have been more prudent, there's a huge installed base to care for.  Time will tell.  I hope it is successful, but the chaos level is the highest I've ever seen."
good,Was free to set my own agenda to accomplish tasks and goals.  Learned about being flexible in a changing industry.  Management/culture is somewhat old school.  Enjoyed taking critical/catastrophic problems and solving them.

good,"The client (Department of Army) has a major ""work-in-progress"" IT environment.  Here, I'm adjusting to the changes in going on with their processes, staff, and technology.  I learned that not all government agencies work the same way.  I mention this because the client office is where I spend all of my time.  As far as Avaya Government Solutions, my co-workers are kind, quiet, and helpful.  The hardest part of the job is getting used to the inconsistency and disorganization of management in the client environment.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know my colleagues as well as the easy, laid-back environment in DOA."

good,"As the only one onsite at the triage facility for Avaya I acted as the eyes and ears for management at the remote location. A typical day required that I be aware of what everyone was actually doing, and scheduling, inventory, test results, and any issues. I acted as the communications link between Avaya and two third parties. I learned a lot about logistics operations and SAP both which I had no experience with. My direct management was very forth coming, attentive to detail, and thorough. My co-workers were third party personnel and a few other onsite Avaya employees at the warehouse facility. The hardest part of the job was seeing the hand writing on the wall and not being able to contribute to it. Communicating between multiple parties that didn't have any interaction with each other was challenging. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compensation."
good,"I was an Avaya Systems Specialist for Citi in the Global Command Center. Typical day consisted of troubleshooting tickets that came into the telephony queue. Working with customers that had issues with VPN phone connection issues to network outages that affected remote Citi locations. Workplace culture was several different departments such as voice and network working together to resolve problems that would arise globally within the Citi environment. The hardest part of the job was the initial troubleshooting on major outages. How the issue started, the resolution to fix the problem and acquiring all applicable employees from particular departments to aid in the resolution of the problem. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was close to my residence and it was Monday through Friday. When the workday was over there wasn't a continuation of work at home."

The networks included servers, gateways, routers, phones, etc.  The parts would arrive in larges boxes and they would be assembled, configured, message loading and tested.

Our real management was the customer, whom we kept in contact with often. Co-workers always worked well together. The hardest part of the job was working with the vendors. They wanted a service and didn't know what to ask for (i.e. pots lines instead of tie lines) and since we weren't trained on their switches (overseas embassies) we had to work with them to figure what they wanted and program our switch to work with theirs.
