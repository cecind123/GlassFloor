rating,review
bad,"Toxic environment. Terrible pay. Unqualified managers.  If you are thinking about working here, just stop.  You DO NOT want to work here. Literally anywhere else is  better"
bad,Turn over was very bad wouldnâ€™t encourage anyone to work there. Manulipating sales for certain people and management to gain management bonuses was evident
bad,This is a great job is if you know people with money! If you're poor don't waste your time. You will need to get rich people to invest in you. Good luck with that!
bad,Make phone calls to set appointments daily.  I learned I didn't want to be in the insurance business any longer.  My manager lacked the skills to create a team environment.  No one stayed working there past 1 year of service.  Long hours without the chance of overtime.  I enjoyed working with people.
bad,just sink or swim. not a fun gig if you're just starting out and looking for your first job. company is stuck in the past and have a high turnover rate.
bad,"Do not work here"
bad,Management is stuck in 1950!
bad,"If you're in love with sales, go all in. The hardest part was working with chauvinistic bosses who thought I was an idiot. The best part, I haven't figured out yet. I hated this place."
bad,Company is outdated and old fashioned.  IT is not run efficiently and lacks ITIL standards.   I would not recommend this as a place to work.  Also working remotely occasionally is highly discouraged.
bad,"Cry babies rule. Management always gives in to the cry babies. The women make all the rules and do what they want. If they don't want to do the work because it hard, they complain to their manager, and he changes his view and dumps the work on the newest person."
bad,"Provided world class customer service to domestic and international transportation customers.  Managed up to 20 other managers; managed all responsibilities for 2nd shift crews, and weekend crews."
bad,Corporate records backfile team has fake/biased manager who harasses you unless you're a brown noser. No transparency to save your life unless its time for a written counsel. There is no diversity I can count on my fingers and toes how many black ppl work in the company. They will cover up dirt for favored employees. I warned you run for the hills my loves run!!!!!!!!!
bad,"Management steals leads from sales people. Upper Management allows local management to steal from their employees. When you call corp to complain, they have a lawyer call you back and change what was said."
bad,"This was a mult-level-marketing company.The management was strong in the area of recruiting training, but the sales training was weak."
bad,"The company has a strong history and corporate culture and there can be a good deal of flexibility during the week as is the case with most insurance sales jobs; however, the numerous checks and balances in which you find yourself telling your sales manager the same thing about scheduled appointments everyday and then again on Friday is too much like micor-management. Lastly, though the company has been around for awhile, there is little name recognition which can be a hurdle in addition to those that already exist in sales jobs."
bad,"I was not a fan of working for this company as they were unethical in their practices, it became a ""man's"" world and was not a profitable experience or a pleasant time."
bad,Pay is basically 100% commission. they give you a little bit your first year but its barely enough to live on. Cold calling and lots of traveling. they don't give you money for gas but expect you to drive 100 miles to make zero commission.
bad,"Communicate with clients by phone and at their houses, the hardest part was to let people to give you access at their properties, the most enjoyable was to meet a lot of people."
bad,"i was there for 5 years.... had some good times, but mostly bad.   Recently we had a branch manager change at the Los Angeles office and at that pointt I started living my nightmare.  Finally after 2 years of weekly verbal and mental abuse, I decided to step down and quit."
bad,"they lure you in with a ""pie in the sky"" marketing of the company and ability to earn a high income.  Reality soon sets in..."
bad,"No target marketing"
bad,Did not feel they were concerned about agents or their success.
bad,"The job is not the problem, it's the culture and the I am better than you attitude that people present. They tend to pick on people and try and find anything to make you feel less adequate. When I started I was so excited to be at a company who ""cared"" for their associates and valued development. Then I found out that they only value certain people. If you are not in their circle, then you will not fit in and they will find ways to get rid of you. "
bad,"Working for Western-Southern was like trying to pull good teeth.  It was harder than it had to be because there wasn't any local advertisement like they did in Cincinnati, OH.  Agents in OHIO got the benefits of a massive local advertising campaigns so the customers knew and trusted.  Outside of Ohio was a different story.  Unless the people were very old and held very old policies, it was extremely difficult to get customers to know who the company actually was.  For new agents, this is a very difficult stumbling block that very few managed to overcome.  Advertising and promoting is everything to successful sales. Western-Southern was  too conservative and narrow-minded to grow."
bad,The support from branch office was not sufficient for a new agent with limited knowledge of the industry. Most coworker were easy going
bad,"I enjoyed the job but in this part of the region life insurance is incredibly expensive and I had a hard time maintaining clients to keep my commission based income at a minimum. Management was great, they were nice open and would help you with whatever you needed. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a regular customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I was providing a necessary service."
bad,"They treat their non-exempt hourly associates like gold!  There is not a lot of high expectations placed on non-exempt associates and if they don't do the job they were hired to do, that's usually OK.  W&S offers many benefits to their associates, though less than other companies of a similar size.  The company is very resistant and slow to change.  Many processes, systems and people are stuck 20+ years in the past.  If you're looking for a progressive company, this is certainly not the company for you!!"
bad,Calling current clients as well as potential new ones.  Selling life and health insurance.  Working from referrals
bad,"Salary and benefits about average for industry. Otherwise not a very good company to work for in my opinion. Unhelpful, sometimes rude co-workers, especially the long-timers. Limited lines of business and insurance for sale to customers. Very political, bureaucratic management type of environment. Decreasing benefits for newer employees. Overbearing HR department. Free lunch is provided, then managers and supervisors say that there is 'no such thing as a free lunch'. Bizarre to say the least. If looking for employment in insurance or financial, my opinion is to not apply at W&S, look somewhere else."
bad,"ok company not much training by managment team , they write on top of agents and do not work with agents , been here for 3 1/2 years and have no managment out in field with me. go co workers good support from clerical"
bad,It is very difficult to move up in this company without a bachelors degree.  The dress code is very strict and they do not give breaks other than lunchtime.  Lunch is free.
bad,Networking and building a customer base was a great challenge
bad,"I was not happy there after the first month. Very political and ""clique-ish"". It got to the point where going into work was an event every single day."
bad,Not my ideal fit for a job. Hard to sell their products because they are not competitive with the top of the market. The only good thing was the flexible schedule.
bad,W&S is a very strong mutual insurance company but a little behind the times when it comes to product competitiveness.  Management is good but is heavily controlled by the CEO which leaves less room for improvement of the day to day products or services.
bad,"Help customers clarify their financial goals"
bad,the money is terrible because of the 100 percent commission. they make you manage a portfolio of clients that have no interest in making any changes to their existing policies. Management needs an upgrade
bad,"Western and Southern is an ok company. It provides decent pay and job security, but the work is boring and the company culture is not great. The mindset of the company is very old-school and does not allow for a lot of innovation or growth."
bad,We did a lot of cold calling. The co-workers were enjoyable. The hardest part was all the cold calling.
good,The best job in the company is an agent.  Management is unable to correct any issues in the field in fear of loosing their job
good,"unhappy time of working. long hours, lots of lapses and over bearing district manager. co workers were nice and sales manager were the best."
good,"Extreme micro-management, even to the experienced agent. Three days per week requirement in the office from 9am to as late as 3pm and after."
good,"There's a huge need for financial services.  There will be high demand for most of a person's working life.  There will be 10-11k baby boomers retiring every day between 2018-2030 with most of them rolling over retirement funds.  "
good,"The CRC is, what I like to call, a call center on steroids. You are dealing with customers who have issues and do not want to help themselves, and when something goes wrong, that's when they call home office. You are constantly trying to resolve problems that you didn't create but still trying to get the angry customer to purchase addition coverage with you. "
good,Great work culture
good,You can have a career if you are willing to work. Great benefit package. Good information on products and what's going on in the company. Miss working there.
good,"Not the job for the emotional people, you will see people after someone has died and talk about death with people to sell them policies. The management at your office matters most, good managers will pump you up and keep you working, bad managers will just criticize you and make things miserable"
good,It was a good atmosphere to work in but being a 100% commission based job it was extremely stressful.
good,I have learned a great deal about the insurance industry in the past year. Management has many different styles within the company. My co-workers are all vastly different and each come with their work styles and talents.
good,"My family has worked here forever and money can be made. You have to work long hours in order for it to be done thou, you can basically write your own paycheck here!"
good,"After careful thought and hindsite I never should have taken the job. The interview left me thinking ok , Base pay + commission, I can work with that.  However the base pay goes away after 8 weeks and you are totally on your own.  It's no wonder that employees left so frequently.  The company made some very unusual management choices to say the least.  "
good,"Established customer base. Many are dissatisfied, but do not desire to move or explore additional products. Hard to be promoted from the sales field into corporate. Talent match is not the best. I was told that I must complete 1 year in the field learning the business before being considered for a position in Human Resources. After 3 years in the field, I saw that I would never get the opportunity due to the field offices not meeting their overall goals."
good,"I enjoyed the business when it was good. Sales are tough and you have to been committed and have lots of self discipline.  Challenging but worth it, if you put the effort in. I qualified for Cancun Mexico and was able to take my mom."
good,Good Company to work at . Great job security. Company culture and drive is key to company's success. Overall very good company to work for  and build a career.
good,This a stable place to work for the home office.  It has a very old work culture that requires suits and ties.  Kind of dated in company beliefs (its like working for a company in the 1970's).  Offers good benefits and a pension.  Great for a person looking to safely plan their future if you can deal with the dated policies.
good,"Human Resources is an integral part of business operations. Daily interactions include career counseling, discussion of performance management, assessment of employee potential and how to motivate others. Position requires ability to work within limited focus based on senior management desire. People in client groups are great and true partners day in and day out."
good,"Manaage policyholder relations in the book of businesses to optimize growth, retention and profitability.  Seek sales opportunties through referrals from existing policyholders."
good,Western & Southern is a financial institution that has strict regulations for its employees to follow. You are continually judged on making additional sales for the sales department while servicing existing accounts. The company has good benefits but doesn't value the personal needs of the employees.
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Western and Southern Financial Group. I started fresh out of college so it was challenging to work on straight commissions. I ended up leaving because of a personal situation, not because I didn't enjoy working there."
good,Prospecting for people who want to buy Life Insurance.  I would call about 30 people per day setting appointments to go the their home to present different kinds of Life Insurance  Policies to help protect a family from financial loss.
good,Overall a good insurance company. Good benefits but very hard to get business off the ground. Really need additional money to get leads.
good,Work week typically exceeds 45 hours per week not counting off hours support. Programmers are overloaded. Development time is the first thing slashed when a project is behind.
good,great place to begin your administrative assistant career.  Management doesn't care about clerical staff but other than that it is a great place
good,"Flexible and profitable for experienced sales people."
good,"commission only, long days little pay, do not work for this company"
good,"The company has a good policy keeping the company in business, but has hard times to grow."
good,"WS has been in business over 120 years now.  They are a Fortune 500 company and very stable financially.  The last comdex rating I saw was 96 which is remarkable.  Last year was their greatest earnings year ever.  That being said, they do have very rigid rules especially for their clerical personnel and they have a rather byzantine bureaucracy which responds to change very slowly.  Communication within the company is not their strong suit.  "
good,"This job is very entrepreneurial.  It requires you to get out and become engaged in your community.  At the end of the day it is a sales job.  If you feel uncomfortable asking your family and friends to sit down with you and talk finance you will fail miserably in this job.  The compensation is a roller coaster ride.  There's amazing opportunity to make great money, but statistically speaking very few people make good money.  I would recommend this company for anybody who wants to work in financial sales and has the resilience to handle rejection.  Ultimately if you can make it work you will have a wonderful career."
good,As a life insurance agent with Western & Southern Life you will be provided with a great deal of training to learn about the Life & Health Insurance Industry. You are provided with a laptop loaded with tools to conduct client needs assessments. I was given a book of business with hundreds of existing clients to service which was good to help me as I started out in the industry. If you can be disciplined enough to manage yourself and you have a large network of potential clients this could be a good position for you.
good,Working in the call center was extremely stressful and difficult. The management did their best but it has a very high burnout rate due to limited staff and excess call volumes.
good,"Company will give you a 7 week salary in which you are trained and get an idea of how to do the job. Training will be every week for as long as you are at the job. The trick is to have a list of people you know in your immediate warm market to call and set appointments for referrals or even better sell them a product. It will take you a few months to get your bearings and to exhaust your warm market. Once warm market is done, you will have to become creative with prospecting, visiting businesses to sell/build relationships, attend networking groups to build professional relationships, do events(cost money), seminars ( cost money),etc. It is advantageous for the new employee to schedule and close as much business as possible during their 7 week salary period as the commissions closed during this period will not be paid until after the 7 weeks. You will need to be a master of forming your own structured schedule, tracking case/lead metrics, following up with every client, and organizing your ""business"" to make sure you can keep yourself accountable. It is easier if you have some other means of financial support from a loved one or family while you try to get your business off to a good running start. Management will be able to help you run these appointments and close them without taking your commission. Underwriting is a little more slower and conservative at this company. The way the company offers some products and how commissions get paid to you can be confusing as the company has a handful of core products, but other products are through selling agreements with other companies."
good,Working for Western and Southern Financial has been a great experience. The management staff is very hands on and are more than willing to help their sales agents reach new heights in their careers. As a Sales Agent you are only required to come to the office Monday and Friday from 9 AM to 1 PM. That is a great weekly format because it gives you other days of the week to be able to prospect and build your business by acquiring more potential clients. The co workers are very friendly and bring a family atmosphere at the specific office that I'm at. The hardest part of the job would have to be maintain your client retention. Life insurance is definitely a necessity and many people believe in the product and want to sale however many people buy a policy before they are ready to fully commit to a monthly payment. In result occasionally a client's policy will lapse or cancel. This can always be prevented though by the agent assuring they provide great customer service and give the customer an affordable policy they can comfortably afford. The most enjoyable part of the career would have to be ultimately getting to meet and interact with new people everyday and build relationships. Overall my experience at Western and Southern Financial has been great!
good,"Good training program and structure - if you have a good manager."
good,"Good company.  "
good,"W & S does not lay off employees. That security is great. Very good free cafeteria. Like many places, management is often out of touch with what is going on."
good,"This company has great benefits free lunch, great vacation packages and good insurance. However a very high workload can lead to extremely stressful day!"
good,Compensation was the low for this position. Management was great and very flexible
good,"Provided lots of cushion for sales representatives just starting out by providing a locked in pay rate for the first few months. They also provided plenty of leads and training both online, group, and one on one. Seem to pride themselves in still making house visits and had some disgruntled customers from previous sales reps that you needed to try and repair the relationship."
good,"Still have to wear slacks and shirt.  No opportunities for working at home."
good,"My typical day at Western & Southern is many meetings driven by collaboration to move towards different ways of thinking, executing a strategy, and making change within the environment.  The easiest part of the job for me is partnering with my peers and team to make better, more informed decisions and motivating one another to think differently for the greater good of the organization. The hardest part of the job, however, is driving the senior leadership within the organization to make the right decisions holistically across core business unit lines, based on conversations around benefits, risks and costs to the organizations regarding the decisions we make.  It's tough getting people to think broadly outside of what they are directly responsible for."
good,"Good company, however the training provided is insufficient. Basic sales job, little effort is put in my management to help succeed."
good,"Western Southern was fine for work. But, they make sure every new worker buy policies within their first three months. Which is totally taking advantage of new workers."
good,company has current changes that hinder employment the current changes create situations where employees are unable to do day to day work tasks
good,challenging but rewarding. great company with a great history behind it. the company cares about its clients. accountability is always number one for the employees.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that it Allows you to provide value to clients family.  The hours are also flexible which is plus for the self starter.
good,Great company with good opportunity for growth. Was paid fairly and good management and commission to motivate production. Would recommend other to work here.
good,Solid company; over a century in existence; consistent corporate earnings; Very involved in the Greater Cincinnati community; CEO is excellent to work for.
good,"good work family balance. many perks for employees not offered at other companies, reliable, stable, good company culture"
good,I have learned all about the insurance industry. It is a good place to work.
good,Western and Southern is a great to place to learn and grow in the insurance industry. They have a good training program and have sales managers to help guide agents. The hardest part is growing your own client base.
good,"Go into work and check your emails. Have your morning meeting about clients you are to see that day and discuss issues the client has and explore, with co-workers and manager, possible solutions that you may use to resolve them at your meeting. Go to your scheduled meetings and then go back to the office to fill out any paperwork you may have."
good,Great solid company with very experienced management team. Plus free lunch!!!
good,2 week internship in ticket office very busy atmosphere but also a lot of down time during non busy hours
good,"But if you don't follow the system by one little bit, you will be criticized and shamed even though your strategy is working.  If you go there, they will tell you that you are a w2, which you are but they will make you believe that it is a salary. They don't tell you that you make your salary."
good,"Very competitive industry, but in the middle market, WSFG is the best.  Very solid product line, priced well for the market, and lots of opportunity.  Good employer"
good,Great place to work. Great people. Only downfall is the pay. You can make great money however it's straight commission.
good,"I really enjoyed my year working with them. But when management changes and compensation changes, I just could not afford to work there. I really did see me making a great living for them."
good,Straight commission sales isn't for everyone and life insurance is a hard sell. Strong company with a rich history and longevity. Great growth opportunity for top producers.
good,"This was a commission based job so it required a lot of hours.  When a relative had a stroke, there was no way to be able to continue to work the hours."
good,"You have a set salary for the first year, but you will work more than 40 hours per week."
good,"Western and Southern Financial is a very structured company as far as insurance companies go. The new Franchise model is good for people who want to dedicate their lives to this career and make good money. It is a great place to be, to learn and stretch yourself."
good,"The company its self is a great company to work for but I would not recommend working in the call center due to the lack of concern for the employee having to take these calls, you only receive a forty- five minute lunch, they will say in the interview you get thirty minute personal time but when you actually work for them they don't want you using that time would rather you reframe  from using.  It is a very strict place to work such as being a few seconds late to you station and then there are so many responsibilities they put on you, it makes you feel they want you to fail, many people have relocated to a different part of the company and yes you could move up and in a different department but getting there is no joke, the pay is fine but I learned from working in THIS call center money isn't everything."
good,"A typical day involves meeting with clients, making phone calls to fill schedule with clients. Doing prep work for client meetings. There is constant training to give you the tools you need to succeed. The management is there when needed and does everything they can to help. The office is friendly, helpful while being competitive to keep you going. The hardest part of the job is making cold calls to get people on your schedule. You have to have thick skin to survive the rejections. I really enjoy being able to help people. Knowing I can give them peace of mind to care for their family in a time of need."
good,Managed 8 sales representatives in the Pittsburgh area.  Responsible for hitting our sales numbers on a quarterly and yearly basis.
good,"Nice place to work free lunch very good variety of fooduuufgfhfyfhvuv"
good,Western and Southern has a lot of room for advancement. The culture of the company is very conservative and they are trying to catch up with the rest of the world with technology. This is a very good company to work for if you would like to start off in the financial world.
good,The process at W&S can be determined based on the clients we have day to day.  A typically work day brings me in contact with 30-45 clients.  I help each client develop a plan when it comes to their life insurance needs.  Management is developing different approaches to bring our company into a positive profit.  The co-workers are great and bring a great effort each day and provide a fun atmosphere.
good,Nice office and the people are friendly and helpful. The office is large and updated. The office location is very convenient and is located in a well-known business district.
good,"Tried to be a good team member. It became clear that some teammates valued themselves and their ideas well above others. There were personnel concerns not uncommon in other workplaces. Would have liked to have been instrumental in bringing positive changes to the department, but knew my ideas would have ostracized me even more than I already was. Felt much condescension from certain teammates. Western and Southern is a great company with very many good and kind employees. It offers fair compensation and great benefits. If you can find a place there where you fit, you can build a good career and hopefully enjoy a long, healthy retirement."
good,The job is great and being a financial representative gives you the freedom to tend to clients . I have learned how to deal with clients but also helped developed my personality
good,"This was a great way to meet people, listen to and help meet their needs. Everyday we would reach out to office buildings, getting business cards and then calling to set up appointments.  The hardest part of this job was going to appointments and people not being home at the time!"
good,I enjoyed helping others protect their assets and family. I learned a lot while working for this company. They trained their employees extensively.
good,"Great opportunities and compensation "
good,Excellent work hours. If you can run your own business. Excessive training. Micro managing should have more hands on training. Hardest part of the job is time management with the appts (Clients) and with the office training and reporting and planning.
good,Very good company to work for. Great products and relatively speaking good commission schedule. They have a fantastic compensation plan for first year reps.
good,"Fast paced, love my co-workers, hard to deal with the home office at times, can be stressful dependent on work load. Office work is dependent on your location."
good,"The training was good, and the mentorship was top notch.  I had the opportunity to balance my life and work.  The office staff and management were very helpful."
good,Itâ€™s a great place to work. If you are looking to star off in sales and marketing I think this is a great start up company that teaches and guides. Gives work life balance and teaches business structure
good,"It was relaxed. From the jump, the environment was very relaxed which I believe became a hindrance for my development. In the early stages, I relied too much on talent."
good,"Western & Southern Financial Group is a sturdy and overall great company to work for. Family oriented and team environment. Free breakfast, lunch and dinner."
good,This was a volunteer opportunity in which helped the Children's Hospital of Cincinnati. I was able to help make the tournament into an enjoyable one for the players and the guests.
good,This company is a great place to work and they really take care of their employees however they are very strict with schedule adherence and logged into your phone.
good,"Typical day was well established - clear standards of what to do - learned many systems and information about industry and company. Culture is high on radar, management could use more training in communication."
good,"W&S is a great place to work. The culture is friendly, but the dress code is very strict. Management, processes, and technology are disorganized and out-dated, however, strides toward improving these areas are being made."
good,Very nice employer if you are willing to work hard and be diligent about your daily tasks. It is a commissioned sales position so your salary depends on how hard you are willing to work.
good,"Wonderful Company, that truly cares for the employees. Great place to work in a team environment and still be able to control your own growth in the company."
good,Typical day entails phone work follow-up on lead prospecting or add-on coverage to existing clients.  Some training to stay abreast of the business and travel to and from appointments.
good,I enjoyed selling policies but the economy didn't hold up.  I sold 25 policies in 6 wks and within 2 months most of them went belly up.  Economy went bad in 2008.   I had no control over that.
good,"Customer care, calling and making appointments to go out and review coverage for current clients and answer all questions/concerns. I also do a lot of cold calling to potential new clients and prospects. My manager is very supportive as well as most of my fellow sales reps and clerical. The hardest part of my job is the long hours; I work 60+ a week and this is difficult to do with small children at home. The enjoyable part of my job is helping my clients achieve their financial goals. It makes me happy to know I have helped them protect their families."
good,Good place to start a career but commission based. The local office closed and I am not comfortable with drive long distance in the winter. Great benefits!
good,"I was promoted and encouraged throughout my career.  I was highly involved in upper level management and development of programs.   The corporation was terrific in providing free lunches, pension plans, and other benefits"
good,"I started at W&S last March and stayed until Oct 2014. I left as I was recruited to work for a non-profit agency. It was the worst mistake to make. I ended up coming back to W&S and my income is built back up close to 1k per week. When I left it was over 1k per week. I notice a lot of bad reviews. This is not a job; it is a career and it requires work and persistance. Yes, there are quite a few rejections; however the yes answers are worth the effort. Our staff manager does not micro manage and to be honest if a person has to be micro managed then maybe this isn't the career for them. YOU determine what you make! Here are some tips to new agents: 1. Get a name. 2. Call a name. 3. Ask the right questions. If you do this, then the money is right there. We have great products that are priced to be competative. "
good,"There is a level of micromanagement if you are not able to produce on your own, however higher producers have a great deal of autonomy. If you have a good manager you will find ways to be successful as training is great. Allows for a fun, challenging environment while putting you in charge of your own success."
good,Loved my fellow co-workers.  Management was great and put me in the management training program within 6 months.  Fun environment and lots of ways to earn.
good,"The day was individually structured.  Work, life balance was great.  The training was top notch, and the management cared.  It was a wonderful place to work."
good,"While I only worked there for a year, I enjoyed it quite a bit. This company treats its employees well and promotes from within. Promotions are readily available to those seeking advancement. I would strongly recommend recent graduates to apply here."
good,"Great company and down to earth people. Great environment. Not many viable leads to sustain my employment, so that part was tough. However, they were open and creative minded enough to allow you to think of ways to find leads and support your efforts."
good,"Great associates, management culture is declining.  Company is behind in technology for their associates, customers and agent. "
good,"Western & Southern as company is like every other company out there however, our office team is brilliant and united together.   We  work as a team and have mutual respect for each other.  Thats what makes this job a great place to work."
good,finding new business daily was lots of fun. I have to make 200 calls daily and 150 of the calls are cold calls. Visiting different families was not fun
good,love the people i work with. everyone gets along great and always makes new employees feel welcome. the managers are also always willing to help.
good,"Nice place to work, very conservative, flexible work schedule. Worked full time then after having kids was able to go part time"
good,"A solid company in which your work ethic is tied to your income. 50+ cold calls a day, you are building your book from scratch"
good,"Great company to work for that has been around over 127 years. Typical day of work would be make telephone calls to client to assist with a review of their coverage, assist them with to find an a common goal to get them from their current situations to their desired situations. Also look into details of assisting them with their retirement options as well. Being a senior sales representative, I've taken on additional roles to assist the Assistant Managers (on the job coaching and assisting, Call monitors, and feedback). I love to help people out, being our customers or our employees, I want to make sure everyone is taken care of, and learning what I can do next to better myself and the company. The hardest part of my job would be that the calls are made on a outbound call system, so it can be a challenge to reach our clients at the perfect time to talk with them."
good,"I learned more about the insurance industry, long-term finance industry, and sales."
