bad,"Poor: "
bad,"When I was first hired I was told so many different things about a flexible schedule. The management would change the schedule around with no notice. Sometimes you wouldn't even know about the schedule change until it was the new time you were scheduled. The pay for a key holder was a dollar above minimum wage.  Maternity leave was a complete disaster. They had me call I believe 3 different people in HR before I could even get answers on if I could take it or not. They would not work with lifting restrictions while pregnant. The store manager would make up her own policies to on coupons, and on the daily policies in the store. One day you were supposed to do it one way and something completely different the next day. The manager and assistant manager were constantly having disagreements about anything and everything going on in the store. There were times people just didn't show up for their shifts due to management. I have debated putting this review up but I feel like people should know what they are getting themselves into when they take a position at Hanes."
bad,"Horrible company, my manager was hated white people. And the company did nothing about it. Always walking  on pins and needle. Complaints number of times nothing was done about it. Pay was bad."
bad,Contractors were put at table not desk that was not big enough to work at.  Left out of activities but expected to be a part of the team.  No communication.
bad,They blacklisted me because i never gave them my badge back. Never trained. Always spoke spanish but even though i understood nobody else did. Senority over everything.
bad,"I was made a floor trainer but when the lead that did so switched shifts, they took my job from me and there are many people there that pick and are spiteful towards certain ones."
bad,After working weekends holidays and 10 and 12 hours a day hard work you would assume someone went off of you as secure permanent position after 2 years
bad,Didn't like Hanes they didn't treat you good at all even when you had to go to the doctor they still took points when they said if you had a note they would exscuse it
bad,Would not think twice about leaving here. There is very poor management in this company and they don't seem to care about their employees. They don't give you any time off to spend with your family. Only managers and supervisors get weekend's off
bad,"The managers are sometimera and the employees are messy .. they are very shady people and the managers are lazy , the sit in the back and talk on the phone with their “husbands” while the associates do all the work ...and then they get mad when you get tired"
bad,Store manager stays in the office for hours and gets mad at you when you ask for help on the sales floor.  Open door policy is a joke with the company.
bad,You come into the job not knowing if you are going to be working all day. Supervisors didn't know what they were doing. Management would go along with whatever the Supervisors said even when they were wrong.
bad,Their production is insane. They have a very high turn over rate. The majority of people working there are temps. Most people don't last because they can't make production.
bad,Supervisor displayed favoritism amongst co workers also spoke to certain employee's as if they were children. Scheduling on weekends are on short notice and at random.
bad,Co-workers are rude and management will not follow the employee handbook about harrasement. They only care about you doing what they need done. It would have been better if I had been a robot.
bad,Going to work is dreaded in large part to the uncontrollable negative factors due to poor strategy developed by management and the monotony of the daily tasks.
bad,"You have to go through temp agencies they pay you way less than what the people that are actually on with the company makes."
bad,I advise anyone not to work there they have changed the company around since I left they do not hire felons at this facility it’s used to be different
bad,"You will never have any benefits or any security. Your hours and shuft are subject to change on a daily basis without regard for childcare or other life circumstances."
bad,They don't care if you go to the hospital. They write you up for the being too slow even if you work fast. They make you feel bad making you feel like you are going to get fired all the time.
bad,Worked for Maidenform as a dual manager. and a training manager great company to work for and managing for it was always different everyday and week .
bad,I worked there. It is a sweat shop. I was lied to about what I would be doing to start. Fork lift driver to box sorter. Another guy beside me was also supposed to be a forklift driver. After a few months he was still sorting boxes and wasnt hired for a permanent job so he could get the full pay. Boxes by the thousands.. 8.50 per hour. You get two 15 minute breaks per shift. 10 hr shifts 7 days a week. No training or explaination of your job duties. Very high turnover rate. They cant keep workers there. The job is a nightmare. My first day the supervisor put an Enforcer on me.. I was ready to fight this guy. No cellphones with cameras allowed because of the environment and conditions. They dont want it getting out. That was a red flag. Its like the Night of the Living Dead in that factory...
bad,There is so much wrong in that warehouse that corporate don't care to acknowledge or bother fixing issues with management. I guess since we are from South Texas they don't care about hearing our opinion. The company is a decent company but management and pay needs to be changed and be looked at by someone who isn't in the special circle.
bad,"No correction, they only care about store managers. Who get away with being unfair to crew and the region manager support the store manager in their bad behavior."
bad,Place is awful to work for!! They are always laying off constantly. And they treat their employees terrible. They could care less about them. I wouldn’t recommend working for this company to anyone!
bad,They take forever to get you off of the temp service payroll and they lie straight to your face and tell you they are going as fast as they can. You are constantly belittled for your work machines are in poor condition at best safety features when they break or wear out they do not repair them or replace them at best they tie a pair of pantyhose around it and go on.
bad,"They always post the same jobs every week for a graphic designer. I have been interviewed 3 times and still haven't got the job. Either people are quitting, you all are hiring people that suck, or laying people off."
bad,"It's an awful work environment."
bad,"Manager was lazy, everyone that worked there was a bunch of little cut throat hussies. They would make mistakes and blame me for them. My last day there I got a talking to about my job performance, my numbers were down, number one you have to have customers to bring in money. I don't see myself dragging customers in off the sidewalk to shop for high dollar bras and underwear, unrealistic goals by a dying company. Sad bunch of people."
bad,"I used to think that working for this company wasn't half bad.  Being trained was a joke.  They kept pushing for efficiency and timed me with a stop watch. If you get a bad efficiency, it's the end of the world and they are going to take money away from you.  If you do happen to get a good efficiency, you don't hear anything.  No good job or anything.   They judge you by a unfair efficiency.  100 percent is the entire 12 hours.  They don't take out time for breaks and lunch.  After working there for a while you start to see the truth.  The management is horrible.  They will tell you your life outside of the company doesn't matter and you can be replaced, you know where the door is.  Good luck having a second job if you need it.  They will spring MANDATORY overtime on you without warning the week they need you to work it.  If you can't do it, it's a day counted against you.  Don't get sick, you have no sick time. They took it away from production.  The office people get sick time and more vacation time.  The office and production are in the same build.  The office is treat so much better and production does the hard work.  If you have to be late more than an hour, the whole day is counted against you.   The machines are always in bad shape.  At the end of the year they give a holiday bonus.  $50 that they tax you for.  That includes gift prizes you may win at the so called holiday party.  All taxed.  The insurance  is horrible and hard to use.  When new people are hired, they usually stick around a few months before quitting.  I wish I would have figured it out sooner."
bad,It was a temporary job it was ok the managers where not that good too much work for low pay no good benefits bad hours too no good nothing bad everything
bad,"Unless u wanna bust ur tale and not be acknowledged at all.don't work here.unfriendly environments. Some areas are unsafe. Supervisors are rude, and expect to much"
bad,"The management has know idea what they are doing and expect you to know what you are doing, while they play on their computers and expect you to work. You are suppose to lead by example."
bad,"Management is awful. Short staff, so you are expected to complete more than what your job is. Required to work every weekend and not very likely that you'll be granted days off."
bad,"Very stressful, cut throat work. Can not get straight answers about what production is. Work hours were switched by company to eliminate mandatory overtime and make overtime optional. I am working 4 ten hour days now and they have again made overtime mandatory 7 days a week 10 hours a day. They do not care about their employees health or well being."
bad,"The training pay is reasonable however as a picker it is the worst job in the warehouse. The production scale used is not ideal most are working for barely 8 an hour. There are write ups issued for not meeting production goals which it is not clearly posted what is expected. 100% is base pay for every wrong piece picked or crossed on the cart is an ""error"" which will bring production down ""substantially"" but again they will not disclose by how much.  The overtime is too sporadic going from working 6 and 7 days a week to being sent home early several days in a week. While you're encouraged to sign for other jobs there are so many that sign for them it's really hard to advance. Temp workers can be moved from job to job while permanent employees have to bid on jobs or get written up for not being able to physically meet goals."
bad,Hanesbrands  met a lot of different people at Hanes interesting place to work. enjoyed the time I was there. Over all a nice place to work.
bad,"I have worked in the apparel industry for over 30 years, and for many brand name well know companies, and GEAR was by far the worst! In my 30 years in this industry, I have never experienced a company culture like theirs. They are definitely stuck in the dark ages when it comes to their managerial style and HR policies. As a result, Gear for Sports is a great place to work if you like being exploited for your talents with marginal compensation, non-existent raises, poor benefits, and very few opportunities for advancement."
bad,"This was not a company I was used to nor was it a company I knew I wanted to continue to work for. Managers would come in and felt they knew what was best for the store. They did not want to hear any other ideas from the other employees. This company is very unorganized and are trying to get their processes and systems into 2016 because they are stuck in 1985.The computers are so old and outdated. The training for the management position was horrible because you constantly got interrupted, the trainer had to smoke and it was broken up. You are constantly in the store alone even at night."
bad,"No track for advancement, jobs are given to favorites instead of the person who is most qualified. definitely not an equal opportunity employer."
bad,"A typical day is working 12 hours giving 100% trying to reach an unreachable goal.  The people that did reach their goals, lied and cheated on paperwork. This company tells you that your life outside of the company doesn't matter once you walk through that door.  You are expected to work mandatory overtime whenever they are behind, with little to no advance warning.  Some of the management plays favorites with the employees, and treats others like they are not worthy of respect.  There were several co-workers that were wonderful people to know and work with.  The hardest part of this job was always working your fingers to the bone and never getting any kind of recognition.  They offered raises if your goals were met, but anyone that is honest about their work...never met the impossible goals!! The most enjoyable part of the job was the few times we (the production crew) got to attend special events that the company put on for its employees. This company however did not treat all employees equal.  The production crew was rarely invited to any of the special events...the office people would get paid to attend, while the production crews had to continue working. Several people whom have worked for this company for a long time, told me that since it was bought out by the newest owner...it has turned its back on its employees."
bad,"sinces thIs company is in south Texas we get cheap pay for what we do! People from Kansas which is were the company is from ,get paid double what we get paid! The IC (inventory control) ""crew"" don't do nothing! People that are pullers,replunishers,ect basically do there job! HR manager never tells them anything it's just pure favoritism! Never fails that they find any little thing to not give you your raise! Was at 100% on efficiency for 8 weeks (which they said you'll get a raise from) if your consistent! Yet they would make it a big deal and not give it to you! Plus now there's hardly work and one shift gets more hours than others and it's just totally not fair for everyone ! Overall this is a bad bad company! No good what's so ever ! Worked there for couple years,still didn't appreciate nothing what's so ever!"
bad,"In the beginning I liked this job because the people I worked with seemed nice and the managers as well. As time went on, the Assistant Manager turned bitter. She never allowed me to shine, she always assumed that I didn't know something and that I needed her help. When I put in my two weeks noticed, she didn't allow me to finish, she allowed me to work one additional day and took me off the schedule for the rest of my time there."
bad,"Vendas"
bad,"12 hours shifts with short breaks, rude people, if you do good they will watch you to find errors so you won't do good but will tell you they want everyone to do great.  Overall they have a nice building"
bad,I was the maintenance assistant......if you never wanna get ahead and do all the female dog work. THIS IS YOUR JOB!!!!!! you will do everything they don't want to do. ...good luck.. you'll be begging to get out.
bad,people are rude hours are long advancement to other positions are promised but not set I stone
bad,"Left my previous job of 5 years with health benefits for this one because of higher pay.  Was offered a position as Inventory Planner and did nothing with inventory planning.  Was told I would be permanent at the end of 90 days, but stayed a temp for almost 2 years, only to be let go."
bad,Being able to help customers finding the right size for them.
bad,"Not at all a good place to work, management are not very people friendly and are very disrespectful. Do not treat employee's fairly."
bad,Never was allowed to use my vacation time. Temps were allowed to work while the permanent employees were sent home.
bad,company no longer care about there employees.Its all about the bottom line and the product is suffering by retaining inferior employees and buying inferior materials
bad,They treat the temp's like dogs they think they are stupid.They don't pay you enough money!I
bad,All upper management take up for the supervisor. Human resources not take up for their employees but side with the upper management. Some of the people that you work with are good but are not able to talk to him because the supervisor will do correct of action. I did like maintenance but I hate working at this place. AlmondRidge and Annapolis!
bad,"When Hanesbrand purchased the store, Maidenform that I was working at, I was thrilled. I had always believed it to be an empowering company for women and I was excited for any of the changes. I was surprised with how many changes there really were and they were all negative changes. Despite learning everything necessary to complete my day to day tasks successfully, it still ended up being a nightmare working for them. As Assistant Manager I had been very proud of my store until the day they took over, and that’s besides the very illegal and unprofessional things they did when I was pregnant and on maternity leave."
bad,"New management. Worked there for 9 years part time and recent management makes job more stressful than needs to be. It is now just as stressful as my full time job.  I am considering going elsewhere. Only benefits are the discount and  other associates are wonderful to work with."
bad,Extremely poor and clueless management. No direction. Does not care for employees. Does not value opinions of employees. Will not work with employees about needing time off. Cannot take problems to hr without them telling everyone. No confidentiality on problems told to supervisors. Very poor management
bad,The work was enjoyable but their management is very poor. Too much drama between employees & too many people out to get each other just because they dont like someone. Ridiculous. I wouldnt refer anyone to this place. Some times they would work you 7 days a week for 10 hours a day for months at a time with no days off or they barely worked you enough to get 20 hours a week. The distribution of the work load was handled very poorly among management
bad,"hanes brand was a stressful company to work for they bring you in just to get through their busy season , also you work pass your 90 days give you the run around of the possibility of getting hired , then some people are hired who has less hrs than you orwho they like. it was ajob in which if you was a kissup individual you moved ahead. you was not respected for your hard working effort,it also seem the one that didn't care seem to be given chance after chance."
bad,"My job as a battery charger with a 2 year degree applied science was wasteful,,, I should have been offered the level 2 tech position after employment the company started a testing program that was for already employee to test in January and July but a opening had to be available,,,, most of the time they hired from temps or wwitjpromise"
bad,No work life balance.  Commuters and women who don't have children are discriminated against. Exclusion is also practiced among managers which falls under work place harassment.
bad,Bad behavior in upper management is rewarded and hr protects the managers and not the workers. Not a safe place for POC or parents. No growth or advancement opportunities. No raises ever
bad,"The managers that are chosen have very divisive tendencies that lead to splits in the team.  I think the latest manager is very hostile towards certain people, very arrogant and self centered.  If you have a choice, don't work here. It's the most hostile work environment I have ever seen."
bad,"We had barely any staff at my store and no store manager, I was a key holder working 55+ hours a week and 12 hour shifts at least four days out of the week because they couldn't find one and were ignoring me and the two other employees reaching out saying we needed extra help. This was all during thanksgiving-after christmas which everyone knows is the busiest time for retail.It got a little better when the new manager came in but she never did her job and sat in the office. It's not worth the pay at all. I loved the job itself but the company is trash."
bad,"Those with higher seniority in this company are extremely untrustworthy, deceitful and they will throw you under the bus if it means saving themselves or the company. They have taken wages from me that were owed to me after working required hours, and they do not stand by their policy of no harassment. I was harassed and assaulted verbally by management several times and nothing was done."
bad,"first you are not trained well at all. you basically have to train yourself by watching others, and asking other employees. the majority do not speak very good english so even asking is a guessing game. "
bad,"Not the best place to work."
bad,Store  manager unfair treatment  to staff.  Does not train employees  to company stardards. This my worst employment in my 20 plus years in retail.  Always negative remarks never a positive remark. I would never refer anyone to work in the pleasant  prairie. Store.
bad,"Very disappointed to find that upper management frowns on flexible work schedules.  I had to fight to meet the needs of my young children while working at Hbi.  No exceptions were allowed. "
bad,When I started there it was not bad at all. After 25 years an a few name changes it slowly got worse. Stop listening to employees an no communication before management and staff.
bad,The job was easy and it was heated or air conditioned.  Management was horrible. They had no clue what they were doing and if you tried to tell them a better way they wouldn't listen. If you didn't know someone you weren't going anywhere in the company. Pay was horrible as well with raises about every three years. They are laying off a lot and doing away with a lot of jobs right now.
bad,Hanesbrands is most interested in it's bottom line. They are in process of relocating all manufacturing outside the United States. There is no security here.
bad,"This was the worst company I had ever worked for, the management picked their favorites to get away with certain things while others were treated unfairly."
bad,"Well when first starting this job,I thought to myself, that this is a neat place to work. Then came the new digital carts that takes an hour or more just to complete one order. Youre no longer doing the job of one. Youre doing the job of 3. With the old carts you just pick the order that your assigned. Now you have to pick the order, run quality control on it and pack it out. Its a HUGE headache. Ive never seen so many people quit a job in one week. The new machines have caused the warehouse to become extremely behind so now theyve put the employess on 7 days. As if its the employees fault. No one told them to run out and buy those carts. I see this company losing a lot of buisiness because of this. Customers will become impatient and look elsewhere. If you want to catch up on the orders then the logical thing to do is start a 12 hour weekend shift. Advanced auto warehouse does this and it has worked out well so far. You cant expect one person to pull 7 days all the time. Ive heard these people at Hanes go 7 days for 4 months at a time. Rediculous!"
bad,"Very unorganized way too much overtime, they dont care about employess, thwy do not train you they expect you to know how to do the job, the suoervisors are never around they work you like dogs"
bad,"No convite que recebi foi vendido uma idéia que no decorrer do dia a dia não foi cumprido pelo contratante. Me senti enganada, pois foi realizado tantas promessas e nada foi cumpridopor parte da empresa."
bad,The atmosphere can be stressful.  Too many working weekends which gives the employees less family time.  The pay is not worth the work that is required.
bad,"Loads of long term employees, many 2nd and 3rd generation, consistent brands and as a whole working to improve the culture. IT has a lot of potential for the right mindset."
bad,Great benifits but worst corporate and upper level management. Center managers are unfair and unjust. They don't appreciate their team and the teams hard work. Use the perks of being management to an abusive level for personal gain.
bad,"A typical day at Maidenform consists of constant cleaning and straightening of the floor for the associates. Management has to work with 90s tech to file and send paperwork, save and write schedules, make floor plans and do payroll. I had to save my nightly numbers on a FLOPPY DISK with computers that make Windows 98 look like Vista. "
bad,"From H.R. down to directors down to managers, they are never on the same page as company policies. You can talk to them individually, and none of them will ever tell you the same thing."
bad,This job used to be pretty decent but now we get paid off all the time. I think they could treat there employees alot better then they do. It's not so much the managers and supervisors but the upper management.
bad,"Unfortunately many operational and management issues which have been going on for years.  The company probably doesn't' know the extent or they would probably take some action (maybe).  Nepotism runs very high in the facility.  If you are part of the ""in group"" you can get promoted with no skills or experience especially if you are willing to go along with management to get along.  If you try to make improvements or resolve problems you will probably eventually leave or lose your job.  Good management leaves, finds other jobs or gets let go.  "
bad,Great place to work if you were permanent staff member. Unfortunately they treat all the stores the same and don't understand country stores need more of the personal touch. Area manager can make such a big impact on the whole team moral and at the moment that is quite low. It's disappointing that managers don't feel comfortable they can be honest how the team is feeling. I certainly wouldn't work there in a casual roll.
bad,"slow days, then everyone wants everything done at once, with no communication on what they want. They give you a project at 3:00pm and want it completed by 4:00pm same day, and give you bad directions on how to do the project. I learned you can't trust upper management for anything, workplace culture is I know everything and you don't (job security) No one wants to share information on how to get the job done correctly, so you look bad if it isn't done on time. The hardest part of the job was communication, no one is willing to help the other team. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day."
bad,Poor management. Teamwork is not encouraged. The harder you work the more you are left behind. I have applied for jobs in the plant and have never been prompted. My manager told me it was not due to my job performance it was that i could not be replaced.
bad,"I loved the people I worked with but the hours were absolutely terrible, the sales associates would only get four hours a week."
bad,"Good place to work but the managers don’t know how to properly talk to people And They Try To Rush You To Do Things There Way. And There Unorganized, You Never Know When Your Gonna Be Working Because They Say They Never Know What They Got Coming In So We Just Work By The Day Until We Hear Other Wise."
bad,Work as a casual for just over a year and have never seen such a messy in and out of store management. They aren’t supportive towards staff members and are also not interested in progression within the company for current employees.
bad,"As a store manager my duties involved opening and closing the store, handling all deposits and merchandising the store. Normal paperwork with shipping/receiving, recording losses. With 6 sales associates helping, we successfully operated one of the most profitable stores in the company.  I had a wonderful staff who treated each other like family. They became the most loyal friends who had the most diverse backgrounds and taught me a different perspective on life. We worked very well together until the company was sold to Hanes. Our state of the art Maidenform point of sale system was ripped out and Hanes installed their 1990 computer system. Within months it all went sour. We all resigned within a few weeks of each other."
bad,The store is now closed but when it was open. The behavior coming from management was distasteful unethical and just plan disrespectful in every way possible.
bad,"They don’t give you enough hours or money for the hours you work. They send you home early and and they don’t always have enough work for everybody. So, they  send people home who haven’t been there the longest."
bad,"Hanesbrands is nothing than a slave laboring unsanitary place that has maggots falling from the ceiling and workers are very rude, disrespectful and management is butt sucking leaches!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its not what the company can do for you but how the company can SCREW U!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"I feel as tho this company is backwards they will promote from with in don’t get me wrong, if it’s their only choice. I’ve seen 3 people leave because of the store manager and her behavior. The company doesn’t pay over time, apparently will not let you go to school if you are a full time employee, and the schedules aren’t flexible if you want to have two jobs and Hanes isn’t the priority. The pay for lower management is sub par. Overall the company needs to get rid of that store manager, changes to the policies need to be made so people can go to school and better themselves, and the pay wages need to be raise"
bad,"I worked here for a couple of months. loved everybody i was working with. but the supervisor was not understandably at all. the supervisor is unprofessional, when it comes to life situations."
bad,"A typical day involved stocking the racks, cleaning, organizing and assisting customers with there shopping needs. This was definitely a helpful time to build my customer service skills. As in every work environment there are some personality's that get along great and others that do not. The hardest part of this position was trying to keep busy and find something to do. The most enjoyable part was helping customers."
bad,"Worst job ever, unethical unfair not treated equally.Its too much to type.Its just absolutely not a good place to work at all JUST DONT DO IT PERIOD..."
bad,Not organized what so ever never a steady schedule not a stable environment to work in management needs to separate personal and work life Hanes is more busy than maidenform
bad,"Very unfair, stressful, environment. They treat the people whom come through the temp services like dogs. If the management doesn't like you up there, they will find away to get you fired."
bad,Very strict on time in your seat with headset on for calls. Tenured coworkers obviously most important here. Management only does assigned tasks. No frills. No personal interaction. Worst job I've ever had!
bad,Business operations and technology is extremely outdated and shipments often contain a single item in a very large box = not green conscious. Zero tolerance for tardiness; even 1 minute is considered an absence and multiple tardies gets a write up.
bad,Do not expect a raise every year. I have worked there for 19 years and have only received 5 raises; those were only 3% or less. The work environment is less than professional and nepotism runs thick. The supervisors and plant manager are related to several employees. The opportunity for advancement is next to nill unless you want to kiss butt and are related to someone. There is not any recognition of work well done. If you want to work your butt off for less than fair pay go for it with HBI.
bad,"Management: Disarray"
bad,Went into store and you where always cleaning up display and refolding shirt. if you weren't folding you where greeting customer and following them around asking do you need any help with finding product or measuring customer for the right fit of product. and then follow the customer to casher
bad,"This place was alright, it payed good but little hours. They only called you in when needed. The workers worked expect the Manager. The best part about the job was that there were so many stations to work on."
bad,"The hardest place I have ever worked in. Their process is nothing to be desired.  "
bad,"This place doesn't appreciate the hard work people put in.  The pay is terrible, you barely get any vacation time and they don't promote from within."
bad,"The HR manager at this place is dating one of the workers, and shows a lot of favoritism towards him and his group of buddies. The job itself is great but extremely low pay for the amount of work that you put in. EVen if you're a great employee inventory control will cherry pick any mistake whether major or minor that you maKe in order to use it against you to make you look bad. Management idiotic they reward theyre poor employees and punish the good ones. Promotions are awarded to those who don't deserve it and are unqualified. Anyone who has worked at the Pharr warehouse knows this is all true. P.s no raises!!!!!"
bad,Periodical layoffs. Aggressive co-workers. Production pay is demanding. Uncomfortably hot in the summer. Not guaranteed 40 hours. Poor management.
bad,"Hanes will lure your with very good staring salaries for the cost of living in Winston Salem. However there is little to no opportunity for growth. Most people have been in the same roles or with the same titles for double digit years. The are still very old school in company culture and layoffs happen almost annually. Go in with a plan or you’ll be stressed, frustrated and stuck!"
bad,I was really excited when I was interviewing and applying and thought it was going to be a great opportunity for me. I ended up doing jobs I did not get hired for. The department was snooty and kind of ‘cliquey’ after they initially seemed super warm and welcoming. The pay is not worth the workload or position & the company started making ridiculous policy changes towards the end of my time there
bad,"It's very hot, People are childish including supervisors! "
bad,"Dont care to say anything it wasn't  a good job experience it wasnt a good job surrounding it wasn't a good learning experience "
bad,sempre nos passavam novas obrigações mas nossa função nunca mudava
bad,It was a nice place very laid back but the boss didn't know how to run his business he was barley around and he was always late paying people there money
bad,"Sales associates cannot talk. The always have a hiring sign so that is never good. Store cannot keep employees. Not allowed to be friends with coworkers, had to make friends in secret. Instructed to sniff undergarments to be put on sales floor."
bad,"- Stack boxes all day"
bad,I loved my job until I was the only one actually working besides the assistant manager. I learned to to give my all no matter what the situation is and ignore the people who try causing trouble and drama for you. Only you are responsible for your success. The hardest part of the job would have to be all the talking behind my back thinking that I didn't hear what was being said. The most enjoyable part was working with the public and helping women not only find the perfect bra but being confident because they had the right fitting bra.
bad,Started at about 6:30 am daily left between 8pm and 10pm.
bad,Worked at Hanes Brand for a few years a supervisor fired my girl over nothing then told she didn’t like me no more 2  days later after she fired my girl then I was fired a week later
bad,"Company does not recognize the importance of IT, hence outdated code continues to run and not a good grip on SKUs. Because IT is ignored by business, no development opportunities are offered in IT."
bad,This is a job that looks good on a resume. It will help you find a better job at a better company. You have to either exceed unrealistic expectations to advance or be bestfriends with someone in management. They work you like a dog and pay you poorly.
bad,A decent place to work stocking socks and shirts. Hours and work that is easy to work around and improve skills. Fast pace and packages coming down and putting in sections its needed.
bad,"I worked their for a very short time and don't have enough information to provide an accurate review."
bad,"Horrible store manager, bad regional. I was screwed over by the company 4 times in 2 years. High turn over rate. Priorities all wrong. If you need quick cash, go for it. If you love helping customers go for it. If your looking to move up in the company or have an equal home and work life don't bother. Very twisted company, some if it is just the regional and store manager. I went from loving my job to hating it in no time after new management took over. No appreciation for your loyalty to the company. Plus after 2 years no raises. What kind of company does that. They obviously don't want to keep people. High turn over rate means lower pay. Plus the store manager and regional are two faced."
bad,"Did not care about associates' personal lives"
bad,"No leadership or care from the store manager."
bad,"hanes brands was a great place to work but there were a lot of problems upper management never seemed to want to investigate anything that went on in the facility, I seen at least 4 terminations that could have been prevented if the supervisor/manager would have posed an investigation in the first place."
bad,"The Great Lakes Crossing store was a totally horrible place to work. I have gone to other locations and they did seem nicer, at least as a customer. At this store, though, the management is really rude and disrespectful to employees and customers. There was a pattern of the store management deciding they didn't like associates and making up things to guarantee the termination of their employment (providing incorrect instruction to associates on register policies on purpose, keeping employee entrance locked so associates couldn't clock in on time). Two associates in an all-female store were fired in less than a year for claims of sexual harassment and one was fired because sickness led to some minor tardies (as defined by reasonable companies: less than three minutes). Human Resources was no help to these employees. The claims of sexual harassment were never investigated. The girls who were supposed to have harassed others were never asked for their side of the story. At different times, associates contacted the district manager or human resources to say they were worried about the way the store was being run. Not only were these concerns not looked in to, every employee who contacted HR was fired. It was a super hostile environment. The hardest part of the job was feeling like being constantly attacked and berated by other employees. The store had a hard time keeping employees because everybody was miserable."
bad,I would not recommend this company unless you like working under pressure. You will be scheduled according to their personal favorites and zero to none work life balance. I enjoyed meeting new people.
bad,They need to work management it's out of control they don't know what they are doing some days I feel it's going under some they can't and will not get it right
bad,"There isn't any hard jobs there and everyone is mostly friendly. The management is awful and will lie right in front of your face. It's a good job just for the pay-check. I worked there for many years and got no where except permanently laid-off.  My job there wasn't hard just repetitive. Some months they would work you 7 days a week, and other months you'd hardly work a 3 day week. I really liked the job, ashamed I got let go."
bad,The pay was good but the stress of working there made it not worth it. The managers and leads was hard to work for. There was favoritism everywhere and you could get in trouble for something u didnt even do.
bad,It's a fun workplace there was a lot of pressure between store manager and assistance manager. As employees we where always happy to receive people and help them with there personal problem.
bad,Main issues was the machines. Had way too much down time and kept having to bounce from machines to machines. Couldn’t make my quota cuz I was either bouncing from machine or at a table checking the products that have already ran thru
bad,Company has no performance evaluations and only gives small cost of living increase about every 3 years.  Extremely political environment with little opportunity for advancement.  Little to no cross training.  Overtime is expected.   Layoffs occur frequently.
bad,"No Chances to advance in this job unless youre a favorite of managment. Sexist as there are no men hired, management have favorites and pick on employees until they quit or they fire them. Recommended for a half a year"
bad,Just in the department I worked in was leadership so poor.  There were a lot of great people who worked there. Employee sales were a good thing.
bad,this company was straight just clean and break down boxes and palletizing boxes onto boxes
bad,"Establishes realistic goals that can be achieved through very hard work, holds team members accountable, while reporting performance monthly against targets and adjustung the plan to overcome subpar performance."
bad,"Maidenform, INC , has a high turn over rate of employees for a reason, managment can drive u nutty some days. a lot of things that should be in place as policy are just discarded as words that dont apply to everyone! Be careful to mind your P's & Q's!"
bad,Awsome job management poor i love working there if only the managers knew how to treat there workers. And if they gave more hours the job and pay would be lovely if management was under control i would re work at Hanes brand.
bad,"Worked there for a year. Held a reasonable position with reasonable pay - management decided to change the job description without warning or consultation, and this was very detrimental to my health. They were not very cooperative in remedying this issue, so I left."
bad,Pace I go out of my way to help others this job you may get 40 hours per week or you might get 16 hours it’s a roller coasters ride management can be confusing they don’t communicate making work harder than it should be would not recommend
bad,good place to work if you love the retail industry  learned a lot about stocking . just be determine to learn and there's always someone to help you out if needing help .
bad,"It was a decent place to work, but the poor management has made it unbearable. It's at the point where everyone is being treated like children. Morale is at an all time low and people are leaving as soon as they can."
bad,"I worked here for 3 months and it was horrible! Management is absolutely terrible, the head and assistant manager! Schedule was not flexible at all! Find something else. Do not apply here! I repeat do not apply here! All though my other co workers were really nice and easy to work with. Management made me quit."
bad,"it was very tiring "
bad,"Big joke they want you there everyday to lay you off. Pay is very low and expect lay offs very often. If you need part time work it is the perfect place,"
bad,I love the work but I wasn’t to good of a fan of the working environment. It was more slower than a face environment so it kinda got boring quickly but I love the work
bad,The job was not a problem. It was the management that made this one of the worst places that I have ever worked. Most co-workers made the same comment. You could not trust anyone in management. Workers treated unfairly on a daily basis.
bad,"Hanes is not a place i will not go back to. This job was very stressful and the employees there was not nice at all except for one person. My duty was to measure women for bras and operate a cash machine, and make sure all the customers were satisfied. This was my first job and i was only in high school when i started working, i was young and still had a lot of growing up to do."
bad,"I started to like this job, but then I started to not like it and I wasn't getting enough hours as well as days, that's why I'm really looking for something else."
bad,"Not enough pay and hours. My assignment ended in 4 weeks right before Christmas. What a Christmas gift! Most week I worked under 30 hours and almost half of my check was taken from taxes. It was poor sportsmanship in the facility. I personally thought it was an unprofessional environment, a lot of drama and negative energy was in my department."
bad,"I don't like it people are not treated equally, there are no advancement there the pay should be higher the people or good an they need better benefits"
bad,"Hanesbrands is a fortune 500 company.Top management is solid, and they offer competitive compensation and benefits as to be expected for a company of their size.  The company is currently experiencing rapid growth as a result of recent acquisitions, but they struggle to organically grow existing business.  The culture of integration is to achieve their goals at all costs which does not work well with work/life balance."
bad,I would've had an enjoyable experience if management actually did their job and call people when you were suppose to be at work early. Other than that it was okay.
bad,My review of hanes is the place could be more friendly. The pay for the job is not worth it.  There is little time to eat for breaks. Needs more structure.
bad,"its ok,need better pay willing to work hard worker, I been there for a while but im looking to better myself for as job opprotunity and working experience"
bad,"OK not really a excellent company to work for as they claim to be, I have seen a lot of people get up and quit even if they do not have another job they just could not keep working there."
bad,"Empresa boa em lidar com o funcionário, e muito boa relação entre os funcionários , rotinas de trabalho semelhantes e tranquilas."
bad,Co-workers and employees are very hardworking people. They know what is expected of them and do their best each day to meet the expectations of job.
bad,"Employees did not want to work. Very stressful for low pay. No benefits of any kind. Management would take off for hours at a time on their ""lunch break"""
bad,Working here was busy and fulfilled the day.  Plenty of work to do and always a project to keep you busy.  Loved doing the job and communicating with other clients on the eastern part of the US.
bad,There is not a lot of opportunity to be productive at Hanes Brand.
bad,They do not compensate people properly. This is why everyone leaves.
bad,Hanes Brand Inc is a good company to be apart of. there always having benefits for people and always having games inside the company to do were you will get extra money on the side!
bad,I am a remote rep.  I have very little interaction with anyone in the company.  Our IT department is awful.  Many days I cant get my computer to work at all.  Management changes constantly.  Managers are made to just run reports but not there to help out with customers at all.
bad,"My typical day at work would be walking through the doors, talking to friends, and going to the floor to clock in. Then grab my my tape, scissors, my paper work for the boxes, what company we would be packing for and their requirements. What I learned was you gain good skills of paying attention to your work and learning what speed you can get to.the management was not so great there was always complaints being made all the time and nothing getting resolved.the workplace culture was good nice emplayers, big enough space to work in, bathrooms were nice and clean.the hardest part of the job was packing the garments separately in the bags if they were not done right you would have redo it no matter how many of your boxes were wrong.the most enjoyable part of my job was talking to my friends and getting to know people."
bad,"Working as a casual for Sheridan means that the area managers do not care about you. They will consistently bring you down and make you feel as if you do not matter and that you need the company more than they need you, when really its the other way around. When you need something and attempt to speak to the area manager about it, she will shut you down and make you feel horrible."
bad,"Some Supervisors have poor leadership  skills, lack of training, everybody wants to be a boss strict attendance friendly co workers a temp to perm position"
bad,Typical day would be connecting to an over capacity obsolete network. Forced conversations and attempted manipulation. IT's office is located in a fire pump room and is very crammed as it's also a toner room for the entire warehouse. Highest tier techs do not respond in appropriate times to issues in builds or cloud services while end users blame on site.
bad,"Hanes started off as a great place to work. You get at least forty hours a week and the pay was fine. They don't tell you that you work based off of productions until you've accepted the job, though, and they're always forcing weekends and holidays on you at the last minute. They also started a new shift schedule where they switch from 1/2/3 shift to A/B/C during peak season with no regard for anyone's personal life. They tell you which shift you'll be expected to attend a maximum of three days before the switch, and if any problems arise they literally tell you to just quit. There is absolutely no communication between higher ups and shift supervisors, and the amount of favoritism is astounding. They have no idea how to run a business, and it shows in the way they treat their employees"
bad,i enjoyed working for Hanesbrands not so much as a temp. I feel Debbies Staffing  does not look out for temps who are not hispanic.just an observation.will work u 10+ hours a day during peak season after that can be released without warning.does not look out for veterans.
bad,"Production artist get stuck in production. Good starting job after college, but don't stay longer than a year. No design opportunities if you come in as a production artist."
bad,A typcial work day consist of analyzing sales floor and working with account managers in acheiving stock and product placement. Ensure that each brand was displayed accordingly with the requirments of account executive. Provide accomplishments each week and items sold on sale events. Learned to operate as an effective representative for Hanesbrands and communicate with mangement in all areas. The hardest part of this job is trying to gain more responsibilites in an overall comany's budget.
bad,"They were flexible with in-office hours, but that is only applicable to specific departments (based on manager's discretion). Worked there for 5+ years with a promise of advancement but there was no career path."
bad,"Hanesbrands Incorporated is an interesting place to work where a lot can be learned. The facilities are clean and climate controlled. None of the jobs are extremely hard; some heavy lifting is involved, but not a lot and not in all positions."
bad,Maidenform taught me how to work well with others and how to make sure my customers got the best service. I'm very thankful for Maidenform being my first job.
bad,"Been working here a couple years. I started out as a knitter and became a fixer. It's getting old because it doesn't really offer much past that point, just a good paycheck. They layoff here and there so they lack job stability. The insurance isn't good either. Very long shifts on concrete floors."
bad,"-Isn’t a rewarding role, it is boring many times   "
bad,Dollar Tree is your basic retail store that provides friendly customer service and all your households needs for only a dollar!
bad,"Daily meeting and objectives"
bad,Seems they have developed an business image of being a challenging place to work.  Great people to work with for the most part but they are closing plants here and downsizing occasionally to make the overall corporation more profitable.
bad,"They are always hiring........ "
bad,"Women are not valued in C-level positions, pay is good, too good. Employees are like lemmings, only doing what they are told.  No place for entrepreneurs.  "
bad,"The primary focus is to increase profits."
bad,I think that if u work a eight hour shift u should get two breaks
bad,Hanesbrand has transferred to two different warehouse because of downsizing. I have taking pay cuts and they even messed up my years with the company to t put me in a lower paying job.
bad,"It's very laid back, but it's too much drama. It's alot of she say and back and ford. If your young and working you will get the most backlash versus someone who is older or an adult. You tend to learn alot about bras and panties and the people you work with."
bad,"Haines Brands is a collaborative company.  They hold many meetings and include different departments to collaborate on designs, colors, reports, sales."
bad,"The manager picks favorites, the environment isn’t friendly there is abouaolutly no AC. Rules constantly change and there isn’t and consistency. Not a lot of fairness going around either"
bad,"its ok can be very slow at times as a tech, supervisors think you can  make anything run with in a few mins, most machines are junk and scrap do to poor maintenance."
bad,Working with customers takes a patient person.  If you are not patient and willing to overlook small thing then this is not the type of work you should be doing.  Some days the calls were heavy and other days work was very slow.  I worked with a great group of people.
bad,The company was okay to work for. Pay was good. Just was the staff. Store manager never wanted to work . Assistant manager was racist. The store I worked at was the worst
bad,The job was actually enjoyable.  I feel that I was terminated falsely.  They were nice in your face and talked about you behind your back.  I would never recommend anyone to work there.  I would not want anyone to be treated badly.
bad,just a place to start building a career but I feel I needed to move on and get something better for myself but my time there was awesome and I will recommend to anyone
bad,"Used to be a fun company. Regional Manager is horrible."
bad,12 hour days. i cant say too much about this job because it was not my line of work
bad,"Gear wasn't air-conditioning. I worked as a finisher who would retrieve garments from an oven, rolling down a converter belt.  The hardest part working there was standing on concreted floor without any kind of padding on the floor."
bad,"I worked there for a whole month and they couldn't let me mourn the death of my grandma. For a few days. Screw this place."
bad,Apreendi muito nessa empresa tive um bom relacionamento de modo geral na minha permanecia lá.
good,12 hour shifts were hard to get used to. One person had six machines to clean and stock. Not much room for advancement. Not much inter actment with co-workers.
good,"Fun for a summer job, no advancements in the company. Management doesn't care about employees."
good,"not too much heavy lifting but it is a fast work environment."
good,no benefits treated as second rate management needs to be trained and an employee shouldn't have to train them on the job what are they managing besides dog labor no ac and water sprayed on trucks when trying to explain how humidity works they refused to listen making working in the trucks insufferable
good,"Typical hours put in a week 44.5.  At time I would put in over 70 a week.  They don't give raises after 2 years, they believe you have learned everything you need to know, but we are always having new training. Co workers are there for a job and that is it. They can care less about the goals that needed to be met. They don't do any more then they have to or go out of their way to help with projects. Hardest part of job is all the training for new employees and all the paper work.  It is worse than buying a house or car.  The most enjoyable part was working with the customers.  You always have one that is just not a happy person but the ones that appreciate your help make it worth wild."
good,Enjoyed going to work seeing all coworker. I learned a lot in 15 years I was there. Management policy do as I say not as I do There was no communication in dept form the manager or supervisor. Co workers are are co workers everyone has has good and bad day.
good,Greet customers upon entrance
good,Needs work on management. Employees need to work on team work.
good,"Credit review of new and existing accounts of my reports.  Aging review and analysis.  Review and analize prior work day reporting. Manage ""Special Handling"" accounts.  Interface with sales and sales management.  Handling of accounts placed for collection.  Handling of all legal matters regarding credit department.  Daily monitoring of my staff.  Putting out ""fires"" as they come up."
good,Enjoyed helping the customer. Loved the co-workers I had. Always busy at Maiden Form.
good,"In a hole it’s not really a bad place to work. It’s hot no A/C. When I was interviewed I was told one pay and received less when I signed the paperwork. I was not very happy about that, but it is what it is. They tell you one thing and it’s just so you want look for another job."
good,"This job was hard on my body. Nice manager, productive job, and warm work environment during summer. No central a/c or heating. Easy location, but no long-term benefits."
good,"La paga es poca, solo promocinan al que mejor le cae al jefe."
good,"Train and mentor new existing employees to ensure the realization of corporate standards & objectives. "
good,Not professional. Didn't take the manager serious because they would talk about their employee behind their back. No breaks. Couldn't wear sports shoes even tho we had to stand all day
good,While working at Hanes you were kept quite busy with bra fittings customer service and running a cash register. But like any job it had its ups and downs for example it depended on which manager was working and if they had brought personal feelings into work.
good,"Management is horrible and the rate of pay is not equal to the amount of work that is being asked. Due to the location of this company, a typical day is rather slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is handling shipment because it gives us something to do."
good,Hanes Brand Inc. could have been a better company if they were as concerned with having happy and well compensated employees as they were with saving the company and compensating the higher ups.
good,Good place to work  maditory overtime three weeks a month good insurance and dental free meals every quarterly  good on job training  and training to use forklft and towmoter and mule
good,"In my department, the culture was very much a ""good old boy"" network. My reports who had been with the company longer often knew information I was not told even though the information had a direct impact on my duties."
good,"I spent a lot of time putting merchandise onto the sales floor, finalizing customers transactions at the register. I learned how to balance a drawer at the end of the day and how to properly manage a busy environment"
good,productive place to work.hours are good but heath care is not. if orders are slow you may be sent home early.the supervisors are fair and helpful. some times you may have to work Saturdays and sundays.
good,"Enjoyed working here when it was strictly Maidenform.  Ever since Hanes took over, everything has become disorganized and irritating."
good,cleaning and sorting new products. folding and hanging cloths greeting and assisting customers
good,"Mi calificación para laborar en Hanes Tlalnepantla es buena; Tiene prestaciones superiores a las de la ley, los sueldos suelen ser buenos o superiores al promedio."
good,"Their pay is very low but the job is fairly easy. Very slow, so there is a lot of down time where you have to kind of ""look busy"". We go hours without a single customer at times."
good,"temp job and very bad computer programs that did not work after update to new system. "
good,Hanesbrands has awesome competitive compensation and benefits packages.  Easily able to make lateral moves to different departments but almost impossible to be promoted to a management position unless you started in a management role.
good,It wasn't that bad a place to work. But for being a distribution warehouse I felt like they could have offered better pay & benefits for their employees.
good,"I liked working at Hanes.  I learned a lot about Preventive Maintenance, and battery changing.  I also used my painting experience throughout the facility."
good,"Current employee - on the verge of quitting.  A lot of politics and unqualified people in different roles.  Very old school mentality and does not treat employees well.   I would really think twice before going towards Hanes as a long term career.   Good luck if you join, I hope the odds are ever in your favor."
good,"Okay place to work at, not much room to advance. Not much hours given to part time employees. People were ok to work with. No vacation time for part time employees or any other benefits"
good,Worst place to work at because the manager's unfainess. High turnarounds because of her. I still don't know how she is still employed?
good,"Too few hours , no advancements , great co-workers Customer service to over 150 customer daily "
good,I just did not like working 2nd shift by the time I got home it would be dark and I wouldn’t really be tired so I really didn’t have no day so I would rather work first shift job
good,"Good team of people, very family oriented and helpful and considerate of each other.  The corporate culture can be different outside of the individual department."
good,"HanesBrands prefers to lay off rather than retrain its employees.  Any training will be done on the employees time, rather than company time.  It also has a history of requiring more that 40 hrs per week from the IT staff."
good,It's very non stop and they constantly want you to work harder. The management was polite but very pushy. Everyone seems to be in their own world. Hardest part is standing for long periods. Enjoyable part is lunch break.
good,"Hours were never the same , males allowed to use female bathroom  quick paced fast and very competitive quiet way more expected out of you then what your getting paid for"
good,Là một nơi lý tưởng để học hỏi và phát triển bản thân
good,"Nice and easy place to work at, stress free because there’s not to many customers at once and if there is its pretty easy to handle. Management always works with your schedule and a lot of times you will get the days off that you need or request."
good,Gear for Sports offer jobs that are easy to keep. If you show up you pretty much are guaranteed a job.  The work is faced placed and there is always plenty of over time to be offered if you work in the warehouse area.
good,"Work on weekends, favoritism to certain people, during the holiday time very busy after January work gets slow and they send you home so you are not guaranteed to hours."
good,"many times when you may asked for help to lift or with something in your Job, the response would be, that's not my Job, when obvious that help was needed others would stand around while you worked, management would play favorites, and there were many unfair decisions"
good,A great environment for working with others and coworkers. The staff is willing to help and show the way on new things. There were always things to do to keep you busy. From working with the customers to putting out shipment.
good,"A day of worked was very busy, You have enough time to restock everything at the front counter between ""Happy Hour"". The coworkers I was working with was very nice and knew answers to the questions I had asked them. The most enjoyable part of the day was knowing everyone's order was taken correctly and bagged correctly before leaving the store and/or drive thru. I learned a lot working in a fast food environment such as staying motivated and always having that smiling face."
good,Hanesbrand is an organization that has a number of great brands across various appearal categories but theire culture can be a bit challenging.
good,Handle all customers stocking and receiving.  Supervise other co workers.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers that came in to the store.
good,"this job was fairly simple, the job had a lot of hours. working and life balance didn't match up. furthermore, everyone would stay to themselves. however, wages were good."
good,"normal,e dependendo da forma em que você levar o seu trabalho a serio é o que importa,aprendi lidar com cobranças e lidar com vários tipos de génio e pessoas,sobre a direção só podemos saber que somos funcionários e a pessoa esta acima que você na relação do cargo,bom relacionamento com colegas de trabalho,e a parte mais dificio é saber que você esta ali só de passagem e se você não, tomar cuidado você pode perder ele ,é quando você é valorizada não só pelo seu trabalho mais sim pelo que você é e sempre foi para empresa."
good,It's been acquired by Hanes and no longer exists. It was okay to work at but the management team wasn't very solid.
good,"Providing excellent customer service and helping people to find what they need is the best part of working here. If working with the right co-workers and management, then this place is good. Job is easy to learn and fun as long as co-workers and management do their part to make it a great place to be."
good,"I enjoyed working there. The only issue was no raises, no room for advancement and upper management did not pay attention to what people were telling her."
good,"Though they are innovative with their product, they are resistant to change and improvements."
good,Not enough enough an then when u do work 6-7 9 hours it seem like they don’t pay you for overtime or all you hours want show up then when you hit your production an quality is good they don’t pay you the quarter or up to
good,It was a good place to work. The insurance benefits were great. I worked in several areas. Each had it's own culture. You have to be adaptable and reliable.
good,good discounts on clothing  many benefits available  strong female presence  fun workplace with a ping pong table and a microwave  lots of jobs if you can work part time retail
good,"I have held various jobs related to the packaging department, The job isn't difficult if the machines are running. However most technicians are lazy and even if they aren't management will tell them to make the operators run it until it breaks, so you have to deal with it regardless. The people are the best part, everyone is friendly regardless of what shift your on, They totally understand the situations occurring throughout the plant. There also is no progression here, you might get lucky and become a lead after  5+ years but, that's the end of the road. There is no Management has been making cuts throughout the plant to cut costs stating that after the cuts we could work a 40 hour work week, they failed to deliver. Every couple weeks you might work two days one week and full week the next. Your lead and supervisors are pretty decent but, Management isn't interested in the employees, you could have any concern and they just don't care. They don't pay your for your loyalty, once out of training you make the same amount as the old lady on first shift that has worked there 20+ years. If you want a quick job, this is the place to be, Its not worth investing in because they won't invest in you."
good,"Hanesbrands is a somewhat okay company to work for. However, the work emvironment consists of trashy people. You do not work that many hours. It has a dramatic atmosphere. The people act like they are in high school."
good,I had the job only for the summer. It was a good paying job for a teen that working but it also was very exhausting. I learned many things such as being in a production line and using all of the gadgets they have as well. I didn't really enjoy my time there because they had so many people that were always in some type of drama. They would also fire so many people everyday causing people who went to work to do more labor.
good,create work orders all day for work that must be due out in approx. 3 days but people stand around because they don't have the work to do it or they don't have anyone working that has a forklift license to get the work. Management all work together. You cant confide in them without them saying who said what. Open door policy does not work. We work 8 hrs or more and only get 2 twenty minute breaks
good,"Started in the warehouse floor, where I was already prepared to adjust to the heat since I started in the summer, which also happens to be the busy season. Overtime pay was nice, but I was hardly able to accomplish anything at home and stress began to bear down on me after about 5 weeks straight of 10 hour days. I have several chronic issues but would still be penalized for being absent due to them, which repeats the cycle of stressing me out and getting sick. Weekends and holidays are always given off with pay which is nice. I think most of my positives for this experience are due to my history of working part-time retail jobs honestly."
good,I keep to myself work hard at what I do and just try every day to survive. The supervision and management are pretty good benefits are decent I hope to retire from there.
good,Decent place to work
good,"Depending on the department shift and staffing company you are highered through will depend on your experience. The management upstairs is great while the management downstairs for the most part is unorganised, does not communicate properly, and will use their seniority to get you fired if they do not like you. I have even heard of a manager leaving stuff off a girls production because she did not like her. There are a lot of women in there that are caddy and coniving even if you like myself are not very talkative and like to be alone. The overtime would be fantastic if it were optional and not last minute. Not a job for those who also are employed else where as they will tell you to choose between the jobs if the schedules interfere. The point system is terrible. If there is a state of emergency for bad weather and you don't show up you will be pointed. If you are I'll and vomiting and contagious even with the flu and even though you sign a document when they employ you that you won't come in with certain symptoms, they will punish you for not coming in. Even if you have a doctor's not or even if you were in the hospital for something serious. They will just fire you."
good,A typical day at work starts at 9:30am and would be done about 4:30pm and I would interact with customers and there family. The hardest part of the job would have to be getting along with the other women that I worked with. The management there needs work and a better leader. I learned that sometimes people just need someone to talk to and I also learned how to measure someone for a proper fitting bra.
good,"typically when you come to work, you either work on the shipment or you are on the floor selling. there is always something to be done and its never really boring."
good,"The product is great and so are the people.  The staff is very lean and the work is very plentiful.  If you're not opposed of working late nights, this company is for you."
good,fast paced everyday. alot of walking. learned alot about shipping and packaging. managment was ok. hardest part was dealing with the heat. most enjoyable part was working at a fast pace with a different routine every day or week
good,"Decent work environment. A lot of employees would tell me to find a better job else where, that was a turn off for me. I was not exposed to much room for advancement."
good,"Good Compensation at HBI.  Lay-offs occur on yearly basis often lowering employee morale. Opportunities for advancement seem to be few at HBI with no succession plans and limited professional development."
good,I was able to learn valuable skills and work with very friendly people.
good,Your work life is very structured and micromanaged on many topics. The employees are great with management being a bit overbearing. Hardest part of the job was trying to rise in the company to find out they are unwilling to compensate or acknowledge performance. BEst part of the job was learning from other employees and making someo great friendships
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, sueldo bajo, pero se compensa con otras cosas como horario, etc."
good,"They have two offices, headquarters in NJ and a small office in NY. The atmosphere in NJ is great. Everyone is nice, friendly and the work environment is great, even for interns. For people that work in the NY office, they do not have desks, their own phones or their own office. The work environment is primitive and awful."
good,"While working as a retail key holder It was my responsiblity to open or close the store dependent upon the work schedule. I also maintained detail accounting totals of cash kept in store, prepare cash drawers and registers for daily use. I was trained to follow store protocol by inputting daily accouting totals and deposits into the database and preparing cash for armedd guard pick up. I assisted other associates with sales procedures, trained associates and assisting customers with cash and credit purchases."
good,a very good place to work it didnt work out for me i drove fork lift for 6 years loading and unloading truck putting away stocks in there location shipping out boxes for ups and fed=ex working on the line when someone out to keep the warehouse runing
good,"The days at Maidenform were long and the job was stressful,"
good,I loved working there it had great pay at first but the management could have been better.
good,"This is a good company to work for, you can get excellent bonus when your goals are meet. However don't look to make this a life long career unless your in upper management."
good,"Very, very hard work. Inconsistent work, less than fair pay. Tendency to cut lots of temp and seasonal jobs as soon as peak season ends. Very little chance of temp to hire."
good,I truly enjoy my job.  Its a great company to work for and I enjoy learning about new products all of the time.  Always have something to do.  I'm not quitting the company.  I want to leave a bad manager.
good,Hanes was an ok place to work. Taking orders all day and doing trucks. Not too much help from employees you were basically on your own if you didn't understand anything. Hanes was not my best job but thru paid good. I was expecting and sick so it was too much on me.
good,"If you love walking and walking fast, this is the job for you! It is very face pace. The people that I work with are wonderful! Having friends in a work place makes the job more enjoyable. I learned how to order complete, pick from paper, how to look up finish goods, replenish, price change, how to do inventory, how to pick on the pick to light carts (PTL) and work on the single carts. Working here has taught me a lot! Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being taught new things. One con that I have is the hours. Some weeks you'll go from only working three days cause there is no work then you will be in there 10+ hours working non stop the inconsistency of the hours I do not like but that is warehouse job for you."
good,"Very paced but also easy work that had to be done, the supervisor has set how many picks that should be gotten that day so you have a goal for that day to get to so you can’t play around on the job you have to be serious"
good,"I was there through a temp agency. I worked 3rd shift as a picker and packer for one week then I quit. It was very fast pace... the team leaders never once said they appreciation/thank you or comment on how great of a job we was doing. They never came and checked on me to see if I was straight the whole week I was there. Also It’s was always stuff like, no talking, move faster, you have so many order picked or you would be reported, can’t do this can’t do that! They didn’t have all the equipment to the hand scanners so, that made your job a little harder, they where low on sleeves (helps from scratching you up when making boxing or putting stuff in the box) and gloves so I couldn’t get none. Each and ever night we did something different... it’s was drama between the females there. I felt like that a lot of changes or adjustments could be made there to make the work much more easier instead of back breaking. The walking, standing, lifting, and bending all night was hard, when I got home my back and feet would hurt. I will never work there again."
good,Enjoyed going to work and enjoyed my job. Wasn't too hard or anything. Easy to learn with not having any experience. Willing to cross train employees for different areas.
good,"I was offered a temporary, 6-month position on the data entry team. I was offered only $9.00/hour. Having over 10 years of experience, I asked for at least $10.00/hour and was denied. I turned down the job. Pay that low is just insulting."
good,"Working at Hanes has been enjoyable overall, but over the course of years, I have seen the company deteriorate in the areas of work/life balance, expectations of employees, some benefits, and quality of work life. "
good,Load material onto slitter and cut according to customers orders. The personnel assigned to train me had to keep up with his productivity as well as assist me.
good,"Hanes is a good place to work. Hanes gave me my start, and I've learned a lot in the five years that I was there. Hanes is a good place to start making a living."
good,"Compensation is great, however job security not so much. There are several layoffs that happen throughout the year which makes it very stressful to work there."
good,Must be flexible and willing to work a lot of hours.  Most of the local management is willing to work with people for advancement.  Not a lot of upward mobility.  Job security is not an issue.
good,"Only issue with working at Hane's was getting Laid off, Not much of job security, the benefits are good, good work atmosphere"
good,The most enjoyable part of Hanes brands was the interaction we would have with the costumers and the co workers. Succeeding at meeting a costumers needs are always a please .
good,I like my job for the most part but the favoritism in there is very bad. Management lets too many things slide for certain people and gets onto the others for the same thing that didn't get the others in trouble. It is rough on your body because you are on concrete floors all day.
good,I loved working for Gear. My co-workers and Managers were easy to talk to and get along with. The fast paced environment was great for a competitive worker. My first position in this company was lost due to a factory shut down.
good,"During my stay at Hanes Distribution Center, I had to learn how to sticker and band packages under 8 hours or less. The amount of boxes were over 70's and for each box there has to be 18 packages minimum. I also learned how to fold the way products in the stores are folded; it was a fast past environment and I picked up my speed overtime and actually produced. We would have lunch breaks for 20 - 30 minutes and 10 - 15 minute breaks in between. I worked the afternoon until midnight and enjoyed working around that time. The hardest part of the job was to actually produce and the most enjoyable part of the job was the socialization. The coworkers were very kind and very helpful."
good,"Overall good place to work, hardest part is it being a temporary job"
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy, mainly busy on weekends. Helping alot of customers, also ringing up customers at the register. The most enjoyable part of the job is just helping customers finding what they need."
good,The job was an 3rd shift job;we worked according to the job orders from companies(Buyers). Most of the co workers was friendly.The hardest part about the job was making sure you meet the production numbers everynight.
good,I have learned many things from working at Maidenform. I have grown personally and professionally and have to say that the greatest part of my day is working with the tremendous talent that this company has in its ranks.
good,-8 hour work shift
good,"I worked for Hanes Brands during the summer while I was out of school. I operated a carboard crusher, I moved product around using a Pallet Jack. I stocked the warehouse when work or product was needed."
good,OK job. Was hired as temp and pay was not good for the work. IF more pay would be better job
good,"It’s been a few years since I worked their. I was payed mediocrely - and the opportunity for advancement is really down to who you know. I wouldn’t recommend. That being said, maybe under Hanes it’s changed for the better"
good,"I like it a whole lot because I like the working in a warehouse/ distribution inviroment the best. All the jobs are repetitive but keeps you busy and there none that are hard. I actually work through a temp service right now but am looking forward to getting in my hours and turning perminent. After that I think and hope that i will move my way up in the company, to be more apart of making it succesfull."
good,"I was excited to work for Hanes until I would drive 30 minutes to work and they would send me home unexpectedly. I would have appreciated a curtousy call, or a warning. Over-all it was a good experience and I would possibly go back if given the chance, I feel like the management could use some work though."
good,I enjoyed seeing what I accomplished throughout the day. It is a fast paced environment that requires teamwork. The only downside is the company has a high turnover.
good,It was a great job for a college student .  The pay was minimum wage .  My management at the time was wonderful and they worked with my schedule. A great part time
good,It was OK I love the hours and the money it was the 7 days a week that hurt me bad my body the most I worked hard and fast every day the pay was good but the ppl sometimes really made u ready to get out out
good,fast-paced workplace a lot of machine noise and forklift noise its typically cold when they have the fans on high. you get two 20 minute breaks. the hardest part is trying to get faster over time with your placement in the job.
good,"Trabaje en la hanes por más de 3 años, es un lugar sumamente estresante... la mayoría de las personas que trabajan allí som irrespetuosas... exigen demasiadas cosas por una paga absurda... no lo recomiendo"
good,"A typical day at work, would be to fill out before shift paperwork. Then run products through machine and fill out after shift paperwork. The management for the most part is great but there is always one at the company. It has a diverse workplace culture from all walks of life. The hardest part of the job is keeping your sprits high and getting the job done it is not for the faint of heart. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of completion when you finish a order to be sent out."
good,I tried getting hired on full time after being a temp I didn't not get the postion but they were nice people to work for laid back and it was not hard work
good,Get a pull cart and pick up your order. Get the right amount of boxes you will need for your order.  Put labels on and sync to cart press start button. Follow location which are on a tablet connected to cart and pick merchandise. Once done tape and put on shipping belt.
good,They don't really go out of there way to make it a nice place to work. It definitely is corporate America setting. There are some really nice people that work there and would go out of there way to help.
good,"typical day at work "
good,"I worked this job a long time ago so management has probably changed. I do remember it being laid back and fun to work at, but again no room for advancement."
good,Good work place and good hours and pay they sometimes let u off of work and they they are nice and help u out with stuff that u need answers for and help each other out
good,It was an enjoyable place to work. I always enjoyed interacting with my fellow employees. It was fun and enjoyable. The hours and pay were fair. Workload was fair.
good,not a place a familyman want to be at. Its a dead end job. No bad things to say about the company. They don't have room for any advanancement.For the workers
good,its a okay place to work. some days you didnt know if you were working or not due to product which wasnt good. sometimes we hardly had a check but then we might get a lot of hours so it was in between.
good,Its a nice place to work the people are friendly the management are ok the Hour's are ok i haven't been there long so i don't know that much about Hanes so
good,It wasn't too bad. No listening to music though. That probably would have helped with production. Oh and I got moved like three times and I'm still not sure why.
good,I hated working the third shift and with the people that I used to work with. Many of them were not up to the task as inventory was always under stock.
good,You are always on your feet. You get 3 breaks. You are always doing something. You get good hours and you can work through a temp agency and work higher till you get fully hired
good,"You will definitely get a work out at this job. Constantly moving, lifting and placing boxes on pallets. Hot working atmosphere. Overall not that bad."
good,"It's really good money if you can hit production every week. It's not a hard job to learn or even get use too. The hours get a little crazy every once in a while, but like I said; the money is really good when you have mandatory OT and you hit production."
good,sales cashier  learned how to work one on one with customers selling products good management was good to work with workplace culture fairly pleasant sometimes making sales working with coworkers.
good,"Maidenform is like a lot of other retailers -- lowish pay, long hours on your feet, expectation that management put work first. Many of my direct co-workers and supervisors were awesome, and I truly enjoyed working with them. Corporate management was less great, but that is often the case in the world of retail."
good,"I don't know if there are even positions in the area for Maidenform, I worked in Bayonne, don't know if corporate offices are still there.  Most positions moved to the south"
good,"I've worked for the company for almost 3 years at this store. I became 1st Key Holder shortly after. Have recently had a total management change (Store Manager and Assisstant Store Manager). I enjoy who I work with most of the time. The company does take fair care of their employees, but not many advancement opportunities. Very slow in the cold months."
good,"it was great experience it was hard work wrapping and unwrapping pallets everyday. Correctly labeling boxes, printing and reprinting labels to correctly label boxes."
good,"Good place to work .Managment need to be improve.Work a lot of over  for about three months a year,A very good safe place to work.Good pay and vacation time"
good,Locating boxes on a forklift  and the scanner would tell me where to go get these boxes it was a 3rd shirt job we had different task To complete on the forklift
good,It is fund and relaxing place to work. Fellow employees were very helpful to get you to do a good job. The manager is very professional and lead by example.
good,"Open store, train associates, assist customers, merchandising."
good,Good place to work I guess most the time the will work you till your about ready to quit but the pay is okay but the place will look out for you very good and understanding supervisors long hours and short breaks
good,Best place to work for if you don't want to do a lot of physical moving. It is the ideal job for a part time work place that offers discounts on the products they sell.
good,Nice place to work room for advancement and benefits are ok pay was decent plenty of  diversity within all levels of the organization great place to grow
good,"The day to day functions at Hanes Brand were filling orders, stocking merchandise and loading material on the conveyer belt and helping out where I was needed. My co workers were easy to work with as well as management. The hardest part of the job was when we were short on work and had to be sent home. The most enjoyable part was working with such great people."
good,"I come in an hour before the Shift to prepare for the shift. I am over the picking and Shipping department. I have 35-40 pickers and 8-10 associates in Shipping. Go to a meeting with the previous Shift to let me know where we stand and if there are any issues. The biggest focus is working on what's due out that day or the next day. Focus on Safety ,Quality and managing the pickers to hit there production rates. Also work closely with the staging desk coordinator to make sure we are giving out the correct labels to the pickers. In shipping I focus on Safety, Quality and palletizing and wrapping pallets and loading and staging the trucks that are ready to be loaded."
good,"Some rules from the company are slightly ridiculous for our new generation."
good,It was a good job with nice people to work with. I learned how to pick and pack orders along with organizing items in a big factory. Most days were realivently easy.
good,Co-workers did not as a team. They would not help each other even though they pushed the idea of teamwork. People would often have to do the work of two or three people while everyone else would be on their phones.
good,"Good company in a fun work environment. Easy job for the most part, hardest time in during holiday season  since they are busy."
good,the management skill level was a lot higher but lots of concerns with lay offs. i managed the specs that the plants needed for production and i also completed purchase orders and reconciled invoices
good,"Long hours daily, difficult to get vacation time in due to financial calendar.  but pay compensates for challenges.  Great people, mentors and management.  Summer hours with Fridays off."
good,Typical CPG like company. Company has lots of brands and does a good job. People have been with the company for a while which tells about its culture.
good,"Move product with forklift to assign location in warehouse with computer driven system, RF scanner to ensure product was in the assign location, also work in shipping and receiving"
good,After you clock in you had a morning meeting to discuss work for the day. At first when they first opened they cared about their employees but as time went on and management changed hands they could of cared less. Moral was really bad
good,Maintaining product flow throughout the facility. Performing repairs on equipment to ensure productivity. Fast paced work environment. Job can be physically demanding but it is also rewarding.
good,"This was a good job if you enjoy industrial work. Everyday that I came in, there was always something to do. I loved the busy days!"
good,Fast pace company with a strong lack in communication or human contact.  Depends solely on emails as communication.  Only management to management had communication verbally.
good,"De winkels op een creatieve manier presenteren. "
good,Very strict uniforms all of which you have to purchase. management wasn't very good. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers.
good,I always walked in and out of work with a smile. I have to be honest it was hard adjusting to Hanesbrands Inc. when I first started working but with the proper training I was able to run the store when store manager was out. I love helping customers look for their intimates. I also loved that I had the opportunity to meet different people. From the moment I started my work day until the end of the work day I was always busy.
good,Ensuring that all apparel images were perfect to produce/make the logo on the garments as flawless as possible.  also meet a daily quota of garments produced each day
good,"Good job. I worked in the Inventory Control Department. Forklift Operator also, 5+ years accident free and none since."
good,A typical day was very productive. I learned how to use a hand scanner. My management team was great! I stayed to myself because I was focused on getting my job done. The most enjoyable part was when I know we've worked hard and there is no work left to do before the end of the shift.
good,I already previously submitted my review. I develop and source trim for the Champion brand.
good,"Good place to work, great co-workers, opportunity to grow, nice environment"
good,"I like my job. I preform essential work, I inspect clothes, fold clothes and put them in boxes to ship to the company who ordered. I enjoy my co-workers. My mangers are respectable and fair."
good,Overall I had a great work experience with the company. although there is not much room to grow and the pay is steady without raises or any type of bonuses for hourly associates.
good,Good working environment that made a day at work easier. !@ hour shifts made it possible to make a lot of money while working for minimum wage
good,Maidenform was a good place to work.  They have been aquired by Hanes or I would not be looking to leave.
good,"Lots of work and time was just perfect for it"
good,"A typical day at is meeting a set quota, so you have to be very productive, constantly moving if you want to meet your production quota.I've learned to be productive and many other different jobs.Management tends to stick together and only tell you what they want you to know instead of addressing the problem. Co-workers are out for themselves and are willing to do anything to see you go down. There's no hardest area or part to my job for I accept all responsibility that comes with my job because I'd signed up for that position and agreed upon any added requirements that's asked of me. I enjoy my job because of the constant movement and physical part that is required."
good,A typical work day would be to attend the morning meeting for about five minutes and after that would be nonstop work. I learned to be a team player as well as working as an individual. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning multiple jobs and being able to help others.
good,Long hours and hard work but it is only a temp job. Wouldn't recommend unless you like to work hard and worry about losing it soon.
good,"Great co-workers"
good,"Customer Service and cardboard runs are a typical day"
good,"	Coordinated Corporate Marketing and Trade Marketing, overseeing a $ 3,0M budget and four - member team. "
good,This job did not pay enough and they worked you too hard for the little amount of money you receive and hour. They also would not work with school schedules
good,"very good work environment, very clean and organized great management and teamwork"
good,Encuentro muchas oportunidades. Hay gente con compromisos adquiridos en el pasado que no permiten tener un desempeño extraordinario
good,"daily skills involved opening the store and managing other employees"
good,Working in the uncertain field of textiles: mostly short work weeks. Been forced to work other positions as my own position had available work. Working 3rd shift is never fun.
good,Being a smaller company you get to wear many hats which I enjoy and learned a lot from
good,"high customer service expectations, good clean store, good corporate values expressed but not necessarily followed"
good,Its a great environment to work in. Their are plenty of departments to advance in your career.
good,it was ok place to work but i thank they told the vec something different then what they told me when they left me go
good,"This is a good company, but they get times where it’s really slow and no one gets to work, you’re lucky to get 3 days a week, and most people depend on money so if you have bills I suggest you find something else"
good,Hanes is an fast pace working job and its very easy. Its a good job for teens 18+  that is still living with their parents and does not pays bills.you could save good money working here.
good,"The job is a warehouse and I am looking for customer serviceI unload trucks, pull boxes off of racks.  My supervisor is a great supervisor to work for.  I have to lift heavy boxes and on my feet."
good,Hanes cost for medical insurance is really bad for a company of their size.  They do not do year reviews so there are no merit increases.  The CIO is a real bully and leads by intimation and the company lets her get away with it.
good,"The job itself is a good job, but with a disorganized management means the floor will be disorganized. Plenty of promises have been made but nothing really is accomplished."
good,productive long shifts great opprotunity good experience well staffed good enviorment great communication with managment and staff well organized work space
good,slow paced job i was a picker so it was some what easy your just reading a order sheet and picking the items to hang up or place the hours where good and reasonable
good,i now work in a really laid back area i luckily don't have to stressed about production or conduct. It is basically just me because i work at night but it can get very slow and boring.
good,Place was put in the slow environment side. Not enough customers walk in on daily base. Recent lots of product but not enough space to storage or not enough sales to sale them. Great management team. Loyal customers. Just too many high exceptions.
good,Very productive job also a cold environment all year around have to work around some chemicals. What my job title was to do was pack salad in a box. The people and supervisor are good people.
good,"This is a good place to get up to speed on how larger companies operate and learning some of the standard technologies. Unfortunately, all raises are percentage based and your job description is more of a suggestion than anything. Upper management are almost looked at as gods and it seems like continually just make up new titles for themselves while being detached from day to day activities. Also they force you to use half your vacation days during the last week of the year."
good,They offer at least once every month or so lunch and raffles so you get a chance to win a tv or a gift card. Also had friendly helpful people who were hardworking.  The pay is another story and chances are you arent going to pull all your hours that week.
good,I enjoyed working in Retail because of the flexibility of schedule and the ability to take advantage of sales before they are available to the public.
good,"getting boxes filled with merchandise then repackaging them to be shipped off."
good,"Work is fast paced and driven by key metrics and objectives. Hanesbrands Inc. has excellent Leadership and Executive staff member. Current strategies and sales rate has created an unstable environment where downsizing ha become a core competency."
good,"Pt emp only. Great discounts, Very small staff but great to work with."
good,"Go into work, get briefed on what we were doing and i go and build trays all day.  I learned how to build trays, pack trays, and stack pallets.  The management was always around to help.  My co-workers were all nice and most of them were productive.  The hardest part of my job was stacking the pallets and keeping up when having to wrap them.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,"long days and hours."
good,Cosnstant downsizing to move jobs offshore make for a stressful work environment.
good,"customer service, bra fitting, management is good if they know what they are doing. co-workers are fun. hardest part of the job is alot of paper work. it is a paperwork company. i most enjoyed merchandising and putting out freight"
good,"great managers, learned a lot about sales and mens clothing. enjoyed everything about the company."
good,Pack undergarment
good,"This is a good company, but the one I’m at it’s unorganized and for our hard work and all the things we have to do we should get paid more. Some days is good and some is ok. U will learn different things in different departments, there’s nothing hard to do at the job"
good,"hanes is okay, its fun to work there. not really much of an opportunity to advance. the puerto ricans show a lot of favortism towards their people. management pick and choose who they want to advance so theres really not a fair chance to get promoted or advanced"
good,very supportive  learned how to drive a forklift everyday was a new challenge but in a good way if I could I would go back  management was ok were there when you needed to talk
good,Salarios muy bajos en rejection al trabajo realixado.
good,A decent company to work for.  Company has been around for over 15 years once it spun off from Sara Lee.  HBI provided employee discounts that were a nice benefit.
good,"Typical day at work consist of daily bank and credit card  reconciliations, checking emails and voice mails from clients and colleagues to solve problems. "
good,"Productive and compensation benefits,life balance, job security,advancement, the hardest part of the job is stand up working 12 hours at day, only in sometimes when the year start pay off, I think the company need improve supervision to ensure employees acomplishing their assing tasks."
good,Company culture seems outdated and not many opportunities for advancement.  Benefits are standard to other companies for the same position.  Management was always pleasant and helpful.
good,"-Typical day answering phone calls, Placing Orders and checking order status for customers."
good,En la búsqueda de disminuir costos opto por disminuir calidad sin embargo competidores optaron por adquirir materiales chinos mas económicos y de mayor calidad.
good,"Great experience to work,, I would definitely go back to work there if I was able to,, I have tried but they wouldn't approve of me getting hired back on"
good,All fun and no work. A very small company where work was very less. Not much opportunity provided for individual growth within the organization. no proper planning for future
good,"Upper management expects too much. Most days are good. The customers are awesome, that's why I stayed so long. In my store I was always fighting with inventory to get product I needed."
good,I would say this a GREAT job if you love money. Even though you don't have any days off the pay at the end of the week is worth it
good,"A typical day involves meetings with cross functional teams to update project status and issue resolution, updating the project schedule and registers and continuous follow up on open items for complete resolution.  The environment is fast paced but friendly. The hours can be long but not always.  The best part of the position is the satisfaction of closing items and projects with solid results.  The hardest part of the job is keeping teams aligned  and focused through projects that may take years to complete as planned.   Through these projects, everyday I learn a little more about an internal process and or strategies of cross functional teams to help the company become more productive and grow"
good,"A day at hanes was steady, there was always something to be done."
good,"Uma empresa com um bom ambiente para se trabalhar, que fornece amplo suporte para o desenvolvimento das rotinas de serviço e todas as ferramentas para exercer todas as funções pertinentesa função."
good,"Overall a good company to work for, values, security, advancement, their management and ties in well with life because you do not have to work on the weekends."
good,"A typical day at work depended on the time of day"
good,Hanesbrand is a good healthy environment to work in. The pay and pay raises are rather low. Management staff is very good. The benefits are good but once again the pay isn't equivalent to the constant increase of the cost of living. The pay is stagnant which makes job less attractive. The work environment is relax and team oriented. Everyone knows the part they play and they're dedicated to getting the best results possible.
good,"I had an amazing time within the last 3 years working for Hanesbrand,. I was able to learn in a fast paced working environment, I went from part-time employee to full-time with-in two years,  I am now able to say I'm an expedience floor supervisor. I have been able to broaden my resume with customer service skills, managerial experience, and hands on learning environment. I'm grateful for the time and value the opportunity."
good,"The work is constant but the management needs work. For starters, they pull work from weeks ahead, making the hours slack for the following weeks. In addition to that, the managers expect every worker to work at 95% of production or higher, regardless of whether the work gets done or not. They don't work us as a team."
good,"Good Company Philanthropic, the culture is good, management is good the company does alot for work/life balance. They have greata excercise facilities and promote exercise although people don't really take advantage of it"
good,"Gear For Sports is a great place to start your career. Working here has enabled me to learn a variety of characteristics about the marketplace, customer relations and project management. In addition, I will take away the expertise of managing a business, forecasting and understanding of profitability models."
good,"Contato direto com gerencia, vendedores e representantes. Facilidade de relacionamento com gerencia e diretoria."
good,Great people to work with! I'm not a late shift type of person. The pay per hour probably has changed by now. They do let you do exercises before performing your routine.
good,Great company to work for but no opportunities to advance within company.  Job becomes boring and repetitive with no opportunities for advancement within company.  Most leave after two years employed with company unless they are in management positions.
good,"Company has a great training program, loved the fact that they just didnt throw you out to learn everything on your own. Great interaction with customers and fun work environment. Store Manager was lazy and single minded."
good,"i am still friends with many of my former co workers ,the people were great the job was easy and the benefits were too. when Hanes took over the satisfaction went down hill quickly"
good,"Buen lugar para crecer profesionalmente, politica de puertas abiertas."
good,Work environment is relaxed but busy.  Mid-level management is well above average.  Co-workers are motivated and hard working.
good,"In a work day I assist customers with their needs in finding the correct bras and items Hanes has to offer them. I have learned the upmost hands on customer service skills. As well as strengthened my people skills. I love the management they are very great, friendly, and set good examples. My co-workers are very good at being helpful and doing their job correctly. The job is pretty easy there is no real hard part. The most enjoyable part is helping people, and working so closely with them."
good,"Very busy, management high expectations, co-workers easy to work with, hardest part of job would be unloading of merchandise from container, enjoyable part of job would have to be working together with my co-workers."
good,The store Manager was mean and rude. Treated all of us like trash..she was mean to customers and us. The company is great. I left because of that store manager.
good,Nice place to work. I recieved oodles of training that has been useful at home as well as on the job
good,The employees are fun to work with. It is a great place to work. Everyone works together for the benefit of the customers and it is big into teamwork.
good,Plant shut down. Not sure how you would go about working there again but I do know you have to go through a temp agency to work there now. Not sure which plants are actually operating now.
good,"New ideas aren't encouraged and at times aren't even heard. The management is approachable up to the GMs, but above that there is a gap in communication. Also, if you're interested in marketing, this isn't the place for you. Inventory is the focus even for marketing managers."
good,"Working for Knight's Apparel recently acquired by Hanes Brand Inc. was a pleasure.  Flexible work schedule for parents and an amazing ""family"" all around."
good,I worked my way up from a sales associate to a supervisor. I liked working in this store because the atmosphere was good. I learned a lot about customer service and retail management.
good,Good job for those who are just looking for the first time. The benefits are very good. Different job opportunities if you have knowledge in those particular areas.
good,Face paced and fun work enviornment. There were times when it was slow. Also got to try the product at a discounted rate.The overall job was easy.
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo: Atender publico ante dudas internas y externas a la marca"
good,I don't take for granted that this job provides a steady pay check but it's not enough to live off of. Also the start off pay isn't enough to get excited about. I only came here to help a friend out but Im struggling here financially because Im not getting paid what Im worth!! Im the only one with a degree here and Im getting one of the lowest pay rates here..
good,"I started working there right after graduation at the age of 18. I stayed there for 3 years and got great experience in Sales. Working there, I did:"
good,"I really enjoyed working with our customers. It was a great feeling knowing when they purchased their items, that I helped them and knew they were satisfied when they left our store."
good,Was a really good company at one time to work for then they started to offshore a lot of the work from the plants
good,"Long hours. You do multiple jobs . Also, limited resources now which is the reason you do multiple jobs. There are lay-off quite frequently. The people are the best part about working there. I really like the current CEO, he is very approachable and interacts with his employees."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to come in at 2 pm and get my station ready get all my paperwork for the pallet in place for example if i was doing shopko that day i needed to get my shopko paper template then id go back to my station and prepareto get started on my product. I learned how to do Data entry and label printing and i learned to pick and pack product properly. Management waa great they always made shir it was a learning experience for not just me but everyone, the hardest part of the job was leaving there of course it was a  awesome work environment and i miss it for shir, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting the opportunity to be a hanes employee and learning the many different things that i learned."
good,"Nice place to work, good customer service.  Management has open door policy.  Not consistent with scheduling hour and no paid holidays or vacations. Retail environment is volatile at best."
good,Although I've decided that i'm not really into working in the retail field a small business such as maiden form was a good place to start off when looking into other retail environments.
good,"um dia de trabalho muito corrido ,muito agel ,tem que bater sua meta ,mas por um outro lado aprendi muito nessa empesa , mas por um outro lado a encarregada era um pouco rispida  ,mas sempre mi dei muito bem com todos os meus colegas de trablho ..."
good,"Great group of employees, trainers and managers. Easy job answering incoming calls."
good,"Working at LHPB was a great experiance it was by far the biggest retail store i had worked in. I had learned a lot of back office which was a hard thing for me to et the hang of due to that fact that most of the work was paperwork not so much electronically done. I manged to do do it by taking my notes and refreshing my mind as needed. On a daily basis i ran floor, operated registers, cleaned floor, helped with shipment. I loved working with my staff they always made work a great time along with our customers."
good,A person will likely work for extended amount of time as a temp employee before being offered full-time/permanent position
good,"My work felt meaningful. While my coworkers and I clearly had differences of opinion, we were typically respectful of those differences. It's one of the few jobs I've had where I didn't feel guilty about selling products to customers. We genuinely wanted them to be happy with their purchases. The only drawback of the job is that a few months in, the manager who hired me took a long break for health reasons and there was no promise of her returning. The Assistant Manager then took her place temporarily and there were tensions and hostility rising between coworkers. The workplace became very toxic and the promotion I was promised by the previous manager ended up falling through. I left the job but miss it a lot. If the previous manager ever returned, I would highly recommend this job. If not, I might try another location."
good,"Satisfying to help customers, only busy around Christmas time, some high quality products."
good,Coming to work to clock in and immediately doing stretches then off to work. The day started nice and slow then slowly started to began to become fast paced. Environment was stressful but nothing I couldn't handle
good,"typical day was helping customers and bra measurements. Learned how to correctly measure a women for bras. Management has bad communication, rude and favoritism."
good,I enjoyed working at Maidenform and really like the coworkers I had at the time.  Mid management did a pretty good job of relating to workers and the VP was also very approachable.
good,started out as a very good place to be employeed but as time went on and government gave better reasons to leave the US they took the money and went over seas leaving workers stuck with out jobs.
good,"Micro managed the approximately 60 UPC approval process everyday for all brands. Coordinated marketing labels and tags  activities with corporate overseas operations office and contractors. "
good,"regular working hours, fair benefits, safe working environment, It's a demand driven distribution center, sometimes the workforce has to be reduced. Very social workplace culture and disciplined management."
good,"Very fast paced work place , always moving .. heavy lifting. Good supervisors , they make sure you take every lunch and break on time , constant schedule ."
good,It was a great place to work just wish we could work our 40 hours not have to worry about going home early but other than that I enjoyed It . Great team of co workers great environment
good,"Hanes Brands International, Ireland, is a nice company to work for and generally the Management team are okay. Communication between departments isn't good and sometimes things can be dropped on your lap out of the blue"
good,Working at a hanesbrand was better than most of the other sales associate jobs I worked at. Everyone was great to work with and we got everything done on time. Had some slow days and had nothing to do.
good,"Solid company, a number of contractors working full time. Unreasonably slow to make change. Ethical, Good work life balance. Good discount on their branded clothing."
good,"Especially as a young, able-bodied adult, I was expected to be the quickest and most efficient worker by day three. I felt really good after a full day of 2000-piece order and yet my maximum speed was considered below average."
good,"HanesBrands was a nice place to work.  The management was a bit uptight but overall it was okay"
good,"I learned a lot in my position as keyholder, which increased my work experience with management, taking leadership and making independent decisions.  The manager was not in the store a lot, so the key holders (there were 2 of us) that did majority of the work.  A lot of the women we're older, so the culture and work life was more relaxed, and slow-paced, and filled with mostly women because it was a bra store."
good,"Worked many positions over 20 years.  The majority of positions were positive and development was on-going.  A typical day was stressful, yet manageable."
good,"No leadership vision, or room to grow, otherwise it's okay. There is no typical day at work. You don't learn very much, other than how to handle ""fire drill"" type situations and knee-jerk reactions."
good,Hanes brands is a good company to work for. The managers are very kind and have the ability to empower and motivate the staff to be hard workers and expert sellers.
good,"The last almost 6 years I never felt secure in my job. I expected a layoff every week. I have worked for Hanesbrands, Inc. twice in my working career. The first time was 22 1/2 yrs. My position was eliminated. I worked for them again for 5 yrs. 11 months as a temp. The pay was decent, more than anyone else in the area would pay but I never had the chance to apply for a FT permanent position unless  an office position became available and only if no one was qualified and the job was sent to our local VA Employment Commission. Temps were usually not allowed to apply for anything permanent unless for the warehouse. This last layoff was not caused by anything I had done but a FT employee needed more work bc she stayed on the phone with personal calls so I had to train her for some of my duties. I really enjoyed the last almost 6 yrs bc I worked 20 hrs. a wk. Plus, I really like working for the Eng. Dept. and I miss my co-workers. But for a FT employee they have good benefits and the pay is good."
good,I learned WMS to work with.  Managment is good.  Co-workers are nice.  Really liked to work there.  Vacation and benefits are good
good,"seeing the customer happy and wanting to come back to do business making the numbers for the month brings excitement to me because I love to be at the top of everything I do , working there I got to ineract with different culture and learn how to speak several languages the hardest part of my job is seeing an upset customer Leaving the store"
good,"i enjoy working at hanes, on a daily basis i build pallets, package underware."
good,"Loading yarn onto pin trucks, picking up roles of cloth. I had mostly good co-workers. The hardest part of the job was keeping yarn at 40+ machines."
good,"Large, well known company with a large number of employees.  Good benefits, good compensation.  Located in a small town with a low cost of living.  Good choice."
good,Great local company that emphasizes employee training and growth. Affords employees with a good degree of autonomy. Did not experience micro-managing.
good,Pick pack is a good experience there is just no steady work. We go home too often. Sometimes only work 4 hours at a time. I was hired on after 3 months of working thru staff masters
good,"It Was A Nice Experience. I Labeled Box And Made Sure They Are Ready For Shipment. Nice People , Low Pa , Nice Break Lengths . Social People Not a Bad Job"
good,"Worked for the company for 3 years. It was a wonderful company culture and great benefits. "
good,"it was a fun place to work, everyone there is treated like family. it was very productive and had some great opportunities to learn and grow. the hardest part of the job was to make sure that the customer was completely satisfied with the product, which in reality wasn't all that hard if you knew the product and what you were doing."
good,"Overall the work we did, Hanes Brand had there fun time like we got to talk when there was no work available. We also got free food if only we got the job finished on time."
good,"I've worked for Hanes for nearly 9 years. For most of the time there, I have enjoyed my co-workers and the job itself. Most of the work there is relatively simple for the compensation. Benefits are pretty good as well, if youre single with no family."
good,very stressful job and keeps getting worse keep adding extra things to do with no compensation was told i wont get anymore raises and my pay could go down
good,"Everything that company does is reactive rather than proactive. There are so many archaic, interlocked systems (both financial and marketing) that have never been fully integrated with one another but have been added to the queue as yet another band-aid for a symptom of an issue - never truly addressing the root cause. There were way too many instances where upper management were more than okay to provide a"
good,I learned how to be productive and became a trainer. I was able to cross-train on different jobs. The hardest part of the job was pulling the carts because they was over 50lbs. And the most enjoyable part about the job was the co-workers.
good,"Hanesbrands could be a wonderful place to work if they put more into their employees and less into relying on their products long time appeal.  They do not pay employees time and 1/2 for holidays in the united states. And only observe federal and stat eemployee  laws when they are forced t,. As a member of management I was treated much better but part time employees are not treated well."
good,"Some of the customers were feeling at home but at the same time it seems like the managers were bothered. Some of the work needed to be done most of it was finished but we had packaging coming every once a week."
good,Good place to work. Good pay. Good benefits. Just wished they would work better with you when or if something came up. Sometimes they give you points for stuff they shouldn't give them to you for
good,We have a fast pace and a slow time.. Peak times r very complicated... It can be fun... But there is alot of drama .. You have that at any place to work at..
good,"Worked with wonderful, inspiring, supportive women on a daily basis. Positive working environment. Understanding when day off is requested. Worked around my class schedule."
good,"A typical work day : I open store and count in tills, mon weds and friday we go the bank. I straighten up store until it time to open. I receive shipment abuout 1030 am and check it in to the computer and start hanging and steaming in between customers. We keep track of kpis hourly and send a 12 o clock read and. 3 o clock read to the dm"
good,"Pay is appropriate for part time living at home but you can't sustain yourself on it alone."
good,Working at hanes was a experience the people are fun your job will be fun if u enjoy picking order or moving boxes or folding shirt but all and all hanesbrand is grate
good,The work environment is great and the staff is welcoming. The only major negative is that there is only 1 possible pay raise for your whole career there :(
good,Good company.  Decisions have to run through many layers in order to make sure that all are on board.  It makes the decision process long and cumbersome.
good,Ce stage chez Hanes Brands fut très formateur. J'ai beaucoup appris et ai eu de nombreuses responsabilités.
good,"Great place to work . Looking for full time , permanent positions! Better pay and better opportunities to provide for not only mevut my family as well"
good,Working at Hanes was cool. It is great for a college or high school student looking for part-time work. I enjoy working there but now I'm looking for job within my degree.
good,"Nice job, great people.  Learned how to use the SAP system.  Worst part of the job was watching people who worked there for twenty o thirty years get laid off."
good,Great place to work. Plenty of work to be done. This job does require being available 7 days a week when work is needed. Overall it is a easy fast pace job.
good,"The management was very helpful and supportive to all members that worked under them. In my department I learned how to differentiate different shades of color. The coworkers are very supportive and helped further build on teamwork. The hardest part of my job was hitting our targeted production for the night, for we had high set goals to reach."
good,"It is a great experience with unique opportunities for one on one with customers, employees and corporate management. Feedback and input into sales, marketing, policy and procedures are highly valued and often implemented by corporate."
good,I gained a vast amount of knowledge in the daily operations of a warehouse. I received certification for stand-up forklifts. I enjoy working with my fellow team members and management.
good,"It was okay for a part-time job. Management wasn't always friendly to customers and customers would complain to us associates that had no control over it. Was very easy, simple work. The location I worked at closed though."
good,Meeting with Lead Technician. Discuss issues which need to be resolved and assign individual(s). Trouble shoot machine and work diligently to get back into operation. I enjoy learning how to operate new machinery and working as team.
good,"Productive and fast paced enviroment,weekend work and overtime must move quickly and be able to learn about different depapartments."
good,"Good people to work for, coworkers are great. Temperature controlled environment is very helpful. Long hours but days off to compensate."
good,Very corporate and conservative environment. Not great for truly creative people. Management is very closed minded and not for the employee
good,"Assisting customers, working on shipment. To listen well and incorporate your knowledge in sales.  Management was straight forward and fair as to scheduling and getting work done.  Worked well with co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was getting back stock out and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers."
good,"Since leaving Hanesbrands, Inc. I have remained in contact with many of the people.  They have so many amazing talented employees ... the true strength of a company."
good,Assisting customers on a daily basis is my favorite part of my job. A typical day at work consists of greeting assisting customers with their personal needs. This company works well with life schedules such as going to school full time.
good,"Hanes Brands is an excellent place of business and to work. During a typical work day we greet the customers as soon they walk, as well as putting out shipment of bras. Management tries their hardest to keep everything order. Management makes sure their customers get everything they need and makes sure their employees have an excellent time at work. My co-workers are the best. When you are knew they help you figure everything out. Also my co-workers make the work day better because even though we work our hardest, we still have fun. The hardest part about my job is helping a customer find the right bra. Sometimes bras don't fit like they are suppose to and the customer just can't find the ones they like especially when they are in between sizes. It's quite difficult for them to find a bra but I try my best to help them find something suitable. Lastly the most enjoyable part of my job is the team. The team at the store is excellent. Like I said before we have an excellent time, putting out shipment and helping customers. Hanes Brands definitely helped me grow."
good,"this was my first job learning to sell, and interact with customers. great learning experience. because now i am not embarrassed to talk to customers or up sell to anyone. I am confident in my customer service skills."
good,"I would help with returns and write up credits for non-returnable products. Data entry, filing. I learned a lot about returns and the process. The credit manager was AWESOME. My co-workers were fun and willing to help as needed. The hardest part of the job was the busy seasons. Very stressful. The most enjoyable part was the community out reach programs."
good,"The people you work with makes up the company. It's a really good place to get your foot in the door and get to know people. A typical day at work consists of creating new arts per customer's orders, proofing coworker's art to ensure quality of design, interacting with customers and sales reps to create the perfect design for them. I've learned so much just working there for over two years. We've learned how to prep files for the screen print press and knowing what can be printed and what can't. The job isn't very challenging until you get a request that just won't work as a design or it won't print well. We have to deal with a number of hard designs, either custom build logos or the customer sent in something that we would just have to be creative with and make it look good. The job is very satisfying though when you see your design printed or you see someone in the streets wearing what you created. The people are amazing and you make life-long friends there."
good,Hanes cares about their employees and offers a variety of tools for everyone to succeed on the job.
good,It was a nice place to work. Had daily meetings to let us know about our production the night before. In the hot months we where allowed a heat break where we could sit for 10 mins and cool down.
good,"I enjoyed working for Maidenform as a part time employee.  The work we did empower women young and old, and make them feel comfort in their lives. The store was relaxed; we didn't have sales goals or any metrics that were really stressed to us, which I believe are important for personal growth.  I like to have goals set and know what is expected from me."
good,Sometimes the job would be fast paced but I quickly caught on. I managed to learn something new such as how to do paperwork or be a material handler
good,As a key holder I got to do almost the same things as a manager which was great because there wasn't any competition.  They trained everyone extremely well with their customer service skills.  They also trained you to do bra fitting in a very professional manner.
good,I really enjoyed working their. I was a Shift Supervisor very challenging but I enjoyed it.
good,Hanesbrands is a great place to work if you like to interact with different people on a regular basis
good,I miss my coworkers we had fun but we also got the job done. Its hard to grow with this company most people want to move up with the business not stay at entry level.
good,"Well i just come to work, find out what i`m suppose to do for the day and get to it. I have learn to that team work makes your job much easier and my co-workers was so nice from the day i started. the hardest part of the job is doing multiple task when u first started and the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and working with very nice people"
good,co workers and management are great.  best part of the job is inteacting with customers.
good,very stressful with people always talking and gossiping while u work
good,"I enjoyed working with such a culturely diverse group of people, I learned a lot about operating an embroidery machine"
good,"A good place to work, friendly people, good enviroment.  Sometime the work gets slow and you don't get alot of hours. "
good,Over all it was a very good place to work for. At the end of 2009 they shutdown and moved overseas which was very disappointing to me. The management were clueless on what was actually happening out in the plant and on the production floor.
good,Work place had up to date computer platform which allow you to learn new software.
good,"Typical day included either opening or closing the store, focussing on the customers, knowing the product, receiving shipment."
good,"my shift started at 5pm and ended 5am, i always reported to work 15 minutes ahead of time to get all the necessary documents i will be using. mostly the evening shift starts with a short meeting where our supervisors educate us on new developments and how we are suppose to g about it. after the meeting we get back to out desks and wait on the cloths to come out for inspection. any garment that does not adhere to the standards of the company is taken out and scrapped, we get three total breaks. two fifteen minutes breaks and a 1 30minutes break."
good,"I acquired many skills at Maidenform. Mainly the art of multi tasking. I learned human resources, sales training and loss prevention."
good,"I have had a joy working for Maidenform but it is time for me to depart. I am ready to leave Fayetteville and relocate, I need something I can make a career and it is hard to advance there."
good,"Work was not bad other than temp of building in summer, management was ok."
good,Hanes is an established company with a good work environment and an efficient work system.  The work spread out amongst employees to make it a teamwork effort.
good,"Good company, with the same old politics you will experience in any large company. Good compensation. However, they tend to let go of anyone over age 55."
good,"The store was located in an Outlet Mall so was a very busy location. Hours are flexible and when you apply if you put down the hours you wish to work they do try to do as you wish. The pay is low, I had been there 7 years and was making less that starting pay at Walmart. You don't get auto raises, you our your manager has to request one. Dress code is much better now than when I started.  The only holidays off is Christmas and that was the malls rules, that all stores be open all holidays except Christmas."
good,"Prior to being sold the atmosphere in the office was relaxed and department and cross functional teams worked together well."
good,Just great to work but didn't get paid enough. Wanted to work to much for just a little money. They don't want to give a raise are even up the pay rate.
good,"While some days were faster paced than others, there was always some work to be done.  The main goal was customer satisfaction even if we had to send them to a different Hanes location or process an online order for the customer or price match an online rate in store.  You learn the value of teamwork, being on time and consistent, as well as patience.  I loved then interaction and helping customers (even the difficult ones).  Hands on customer service is lacking in most retail experience and Hanes is all about going ""above and beyond"" to give customers a good experience even if they don't find what they need, they become repeat customers for future purchases as well.  Management works side by side with hourly employees doing the same work as everyone else as well as our own required office duties/paperwork.  I loved all the girls I worked with and the real sense of family during difficulties and celebrations.  The hardest part was leaving this job.  Unfortunately I had no room left to advance at the time and needed full-time work and better pay.  I really loved working there."
good,"I loved my job but unbalanced hours of working"
good,The work I done at Hanes was good. I loved it. I learned very fast and the people that taught me my job was very nice. You can also make up to 12$ an hour in production. It was a great job.
good,I really enjoyed the team I worked with. Everyone worked hard and would strive to make the account better. Very large company with many opportunities.
good,"It's a job. It's a very quick paced job. Based on production, and so you want to keep it moving at all time. Time is money. And it's money to be made."
good,Hanesbrand is a fantastic place to be employed.  The management is something I noticed as soon as I began to work their. Their training wasnt bad either. Great work environment and cool breakrooms!
good,"Very Laid back workplace at times "
good,I've been working here now for almost a year I worked here previously two times ago. It's a pretty laid back job other than when we have to work seven days during the summer time.I'm I'm the works of becoming permanent this third time around so that's a plus.
good,Overall working for Hanesbrands was a positive experience. Advancement can be limited depending on which group you work.  Working in the marketing area seems to have a better advancement potential than the finance area.
good,"Very Good Work Place, Excellent learning work place for any professional."
good,go get your order start picking it then turn it back in and get another one I learned a lot about teamwork and how coworkers could have a big impact on your life the hardest part of the job was walking and standing in the concrete floor and lifting the boxes all day and the most enjoyable part was the friends I made along the way.
good,I always like to learn something. I have learn so many great things for me to succeed in a company but at the moment they have no position open for me to move up. My job is a great environment and great people i work with but i'm at that age where i would like to ove up in life.
good,"era uma empresa boa de se trabalha porem eu nao ficava satisfeita com os descontos , mais nao podia reclama pois quando eu entrei na empresa ja sabia sobre eles ."
good,"Hanes is a great place to be employed. Very structured."
good,"I loved most of the employees and it was a fun place to work for, however it was a Union job and the head union employee on first shift wasn't the best choice the union should have made because she was always trying to sabatage someone. Using her power to manipulate the human resource manager. Other then trying to work and stay out of her way and walking on eggshells when it came to her, it was a fun place to work. This company was bought out by hanes and 250 people lost there job."
good,"Responsible for screen print, setup, registration, etc...  12 hour shifts graveyard and 3 days a week."
good,Very intense 24/7 working environment with 4 shifts. Tremendous learining.. very good workers dedicated that were fast learning. I learned everything from yarn spinning to finished knit fabric for tee shirt and brief manufacturing.
good,"Clock in the morning shift and head to my specified area which is normally the same station"
good,"A Hanes é a primeira porta de emprego que tive as 18 anos e agradeço muito não tenho nada a reclamar, hoje procuro outro emprego para crescer profissionalmente e adquirir novas oportunidades na área de trabalho."
good,Exciting organization with innovative brands and industry leader. Challenging work environment always pushing for continued growth. Tough place for an outsider as there are a high percentage of legacy employees.
good,"Performed opening and closing of store"
good,I enjoyed my time here. I learned a lot from my manager. I built a great customer service foundation.
good,There were curtain employee's that would work real well together. Which helped everyone's job loads.
good,"A typical day at work wasn't really all that hard, all i had to do was unload the assembly line and match the product codes and cities up, on some days i would load trucks, i got along with all my co workers everybody was pretty laid back and did their job, the most enjoyable part of the day was loading trucks"
good,Employees are friendly and helpful. Customer service is THE #1 concern and they strive for excellence when it comes to making sure the customer is happy and helped. Product knowledge is another thing they are big on. Not much room for advancement in the company as for high managment . Store manager in specific store was not appropriate or approachable much of the time and not friendly
good,"Found the work and process of screen print to be overall enjoyable. The 10 to 12 hour shifts can get tiring, but they do provide longer weekends. The most stressful part of the job is trying to hit efficiency every week and having management that don't seem to care about their employees. They have a lot of overtime if you are a fan of that."
good,My experience was limited as I never worked in the actual Hanesbrands office. My company was purchased and absorbed by Hanesbrands ultimately resulting in my leaving Hanesbrands. Hanesbrands was focused on doing what was right for the employees although there were not opportunities for many of them at other locations as any opportunities required relocation.
good,At one time when the company was privately owned the entire organization took pride in the product quality and styling along with customer service. Now as part of a mega-company GFS is nothing more than a distributor for other brands.
good,The job itself is pretty good if you get the right position but some of the management is unprofessional. Not letting negative people get involved with your work helps.
good,Hanes have good worker but they pay  Rate need to go up 8.25  To be shipping or anywhere  Where else in any corporation.   take out the freezer fresh cook food .
good,"Hanes call center is a good call center job. Not too fast paced, not too slow. A typical day entails answering calls and helping customers place online orders. Sometimes a customer just needs helping tracking a order."
good,A hanes é uma grande empresa ; onde nos trás grandes estabilidade ; uma grande equipe e liderança
good,"Es una empresa de Estados Unidos, pertenece a Hanes, y su cultura es sana, es una empresa estable."
good,"I would recommend Hanes as a place to work to friends or acquaintances. Staff & management is very friendly. They do everything to make sure everyone works in a safe, clean environment."
good,It a really great place to work.  They give you free dinners you can advance up quickly some of the jobs are a bit tough more of a skill. Not ones you can easily pick up.
good,"Nice environment "
good,Strong management team. Very LEAN oriented and focussed on key objectives. Plant was relocated off shore in 2008. Low turnover within workforce and compensation for hourly workers was at or above industry standard.
good,Thoroughly enjoyed my time working for this company. The work flow of things was smooth and everyone understood their role and followed instructions accordingly in the process.
good,Hanes was a textile mill that closed down. Had a fair amount of on the job training. 12 hour shifts were hard at first but the total time off seemed to be enough time with family.

good,"Three day work week was nice, paid lunch, but long shift and could be very messy with all the ink. The management was good, and went to bat for me when I addressed issues."
good,"This was my first retail job. I was a sales associate for 6 months; then I was hired as a key-holder for a year and a half. As a key, I measured women for their bra size, opened and closed the store, counted the cash drawers, deposit, checked in shipment, ect. That was usually what my days consisted of. I learned how to sell bras, and measured women. Management was not all that great. The co-workers were great to work with, and the hardest part of the job was measuring people at first, but I got used to that. I enjoyed working with customers each day I worked."
good,"For the most of my 15 years there the management and supervisors were easy to work with ,the pay and benefits were very good  we were rewarded with dinners when we met or exceeded production goals had annual picnics and holiday dinners with games and prizes"

good,I enjoyed my time with Maidenform.  It was a good work environment with good people from entry level staff up to upper management.
good,"Maidenform had it ups and downs. I was a order selector and I loved doing that. I love working with the forklift also. Before I becam forklift certified it was alot of walking, so its definitely hard on your feet. I enjoyed my co-workers and management team. The hardest part of my job was all the consistent walking for 10hrs straight. The most enjoyable part of the job was schedule."
good,"Scheduled plants in Winston Salem, NC and Mexico City, Mexico."
good,"validar los procesos de los pedidos por surtir y programas de producción , aprendí a trabajar en equipo, desarrollo de ideas , estabilización de procesos productivos , desarrollo de personal a cargo , La gerencia otorgaba el apoyo completo para desarrollar ideas de cambio, el ambiente laboral era demasiado bueno, la parte mas difícil , ver pasar los años y no crecer mas procesionalmente , aprender los procesos del centro de distribución al grado de poder fusionar dos Cedis y hacer uno nuevo con nuevas tecnologías diseñadas por el personal a cargo"
good,"Hosiery would came in eggs in different colors and sizes from Stores and we would clean them and sort them to thier matches in bins. Then learn to get full boxes with codes and match to the front line bins them to fill orders from stores. Hardest thing to do at first is learning all the colors and sizes and matching them with bins they go in. Working with everyone was mostly good, Had one manager that was younger then most everyone and it went to her head! Had fun trying to beat other coworker who could go faster."
good,"Best as a temporary position. Fun, loving, and caring staff. Great people to work with"
good,"I was worked at night shift 12hrs, I learned how operate the machine as a knitter and the management is good, some of the co-workers is friendly some not, for me this kind of job is not hard actually I was enjoy my job before as a knitter but the company got slow so they permanent layed off some worker including me...."
good,"A typical day at work consist of projects and weekly reporting. I have learned several skills while being employed here. I have learned about procurement, negotiating, and all aspects of purchasing for a textile company."
good,"love retail. Great customers, good people to work with, retirement plans. Easy job description. Good hours"
good,En la actualidad la empresa tiene una gran área de oportunidad para mejorar la dirección y conseguir un equilibrio en la administración en general.
good,"Thanks to this company I have big experience in organice merchandise ."
good,"Great staff! "
good,"Hanes is an amazing place to work. But, the management was very immature and all of them would sit around and gossip about the people that worked there. They would actually get in to arguments with some employees over some type of drama. Hanes is full of drama!"
good,"Great team of co workers in my store. Open store count safe, get tills ready for day, set sales floor. Do scheduling for week and receive shipments. dealing with customer complaints daily part of job. i really enjoyed the people i worked with and most of the customers."
good,The job itself was easy the pay isn't quite good enough for all the running back and forth and all the paper work but the free safety dinners made up for the lack of pay.
good,Hard to balance life and work during busy seasons but overall a good place to work for co-workers got along well or at least in the department I was in but could be a little more organized during the busier seasons
good,"The experience depends a lot on the brand/business and your manager. Overall, lots of great people and talent although most executives have worked there for many many years."
good,"Strenuous, dirty,smelly and hot work at times. Pretty demanding at full production rate. Management treated employees fairly well. Workers did enjoy good benefits clothing shoe allowance, company dinners."
good,Productive place to work.  Given clear instructions on what job requires.  Stresses safety and ergonomics.   Will allow employees to use emergency days and vacation sometimes on same day requested.
good,"for the last 4 years when it came to raises the technician never got their raise that was posted but was cut by 1% . They say we make to much money but the thing is were running twice the number of machines as other companies for the same money as other companies pay but they don't recognize the number of machines as relevant .we used to have 5 breaks in 12 hours but now we have only 3 , we use to have 3 breaks when the company was on 8 hour shifts  but they say they don't have to give us even 3 breaks"
good,overall good place to work.  some areas are much more flexible than others.  Great cafe in house for breakfast and lunch.  And great medical facility on site.
good,"When I first started at Gear it was pretty amazing. It was the first large company I worked for and one that was within my field I was able to dabble in a bit more. The people were great and the projects were interesting and fun to be a part of. However when Hanesbrand fully took over, things started going downhill. Reviews became nonexistent and I never saw a pay increase, but once in my 3 years there. Work started getting chaotic and deadlines unreasonable with limited help."
good,"Hanes Brand is a well rounded place, it is fast but the jobs are not hard. I was a temp so I can't really give much detail about them but I really liked my job there. Long as you go in do your work and do as they recommend you will do fine and they hire for all three shifts 1st, 2nd and third"
good,"Overall the job was great and come with good benefits . management could be a lot better, but I would recommend the job to others. Its very easy to get hired"
good,"Good place to work, i just wish that there were more opportunities with advancement, more family understanding, different pay schedule(once a month is hard), and a bonus would be nice."
good,"Everybody I worked with had a great attitude and were all friendly. Although business is usually slow there, it was still a pretty great place to work. The company would have competitions for the regional stores to make reaching our sales goal a little more exciting. For example, there would be cookie challenges for a specific time period, and the two stores with the top improvement percentages would get delicious cookies delivered to the stores. It was pretty cool."
good,"Um ambiente agradável, com alongamento antes do trabalho, pausa para o cafe a tarde, boa comunicação entre os funcionários com os supervisores."
good,"a large company, so experience really depends on what team you work on. Easy to move laterally within the company, and most of the people are pleasant to work with. Overall not a bad job, but job security depends on your department."
good,Good place to work management could be. Alittle better more training needs to be required and the ability to move up faster would also be a great thing
good,"worked different shifts@ hanes brands, enjoyed my job very much, filled orders for different companies,also did quality control for all products filled in order picking dept. had excellent supervisors, very good people to work for,hardest part of my job was working third shift,"
good,Typical day at work would either be running the register all day or your out on the floor helping costumers.I learned how to run the register and different things about bras and undergarments.The hardest part of the job is dealing with rude costumers and not being able to switch hours with co-workers.The most enjoyable part about the job is that if the store makes goal for the month then we get pizza.
good,I would tell a person to work hard and try and keep a steady pace after your shift is over clean your area other than that everything else is a breeze.
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Hanes Brand Inc. so far. It's a fairly easy job and enjoyable at times. Management is very questionable at times, give you the run-around, and say what you want to hear instead of the truth. Your not very informed of how the plant is performing or any issues. Safety is a strong concern but could improve in many areas. The pay is fairly good for the amount of work and location. Benefits are good and dependable."
good,"I like the diversity of the workplace and the friendly and fun environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a woman find the bra that is the perfect fit that just makes her feel beautiful. Working here I learned so many things about underwear and how it can really impact a person's self esteem. The management is amazing, they are respectable and kind. They get the work done and get their points across without being rude or disrespectful. My co-workers and I got along as well, I guess that's why I liked the job so much. The hardest part about the job was dealing with people when they've had a bad day and want to be rude and disrespectful, but that all seems to change once we find exactly what they want and for me that was the most enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working with the women as fellow employs and customers. I thought bra fitting would be difficult and uncomfortable but after a couple times, I felt like a pro. When you could help a woman with a difficulty, it made me and the customer feel great."
good,I set up merchandise per the floor plan and tailor the plan for the best selling experience.  I have learned how the customer thinks and how she/he shops.  I have learned to arrange merchandise on the floor for easy shopping experience.  The hardest part of the job is some heavy lifting but I enjoy my work.
good,A regular day at work went by smooth most of the time. I learned alot about locating and ho to load trucks properly. My co-workers were easy to get along with and they helped me improve on alot of things.
good,"i would get to work and run shippment reports, organized them according to priority. Then i would pull report, and ship the orders. I would load and unload trucks with forklift stand/sit or reach lift, which was one of the most enjoyable parts of my job."
good,"Friendly staff, good benefits, and a fun place to work. A company that wants to grow and beieves it's people are the foundation of the growth."
good,"I maintained business license for 233 retail stores. Created month end journal entries and assisted my manager with other accounting duties. I have learned to work in a diligent manner when working with the complexity of the business license. Each state, county and city had different formats so I worked in a professional manner when working with different locations. I worked well with my co workers and showed respect to all. The hardest part of the job was to learn the different calculation requirements for the business license. Some could be more completed than others. I enjoyed the flexibility that my job provided."
good,was hard work good employer great job to have if you desire o.t. the hardest part of the job was walking the plant but after some time you get used to it
good,Overall a good company to work for; high percentage of growth off shore.
good,"I worked with and for good people. There was good, there was not as good, like with any company."
good,This is a excellent part time job for someone with a lot going on in there life right now. The customer flow can be slow somtimes but this is a great store to build up your one to one customer service skills!
good,"Una excelente empresa, solamente es gente recomendada, el salario semanal es increíble y puede aumentar a los tres meses con un examen para subir de categoría."
good,I was fortunate to be trained in several different departments. My favorite was the reachtruck in the shipping department. Load and unload trucks with walkieriders.
good,"Good team of people who work together. A lot of temps but  they can be hired of if they work well. Hourly pay not great, but work is not difficult. Management is a good team."
good,I had remove scoks they are in a bag and put them a buggies that are lable the same every 4 hour and can be up to 40 or 50 bags.management was ok as long as you did your job. hardes part of the job was putting the sock in the buggies.
good,"Obtive uma experiência muito boa, conheci novas pessoas, aprendi novas coisas, e gostei da areia que atuei"
good,"I love this job and it has helped me grow. A typical day is easy going. Most of the customers are really nice and I love to help them find what they are looking for. Management needs some improvement, but for the most part I have a lot of good days with my managers.That's the most enjoyable part. It makes my job easier. The hardest part about it is when we don't have a certain product that a customer wants when we really need the product."
good,"Global company, leader in the Basics category of clothing. Long term plan is growth by acquisition, which means we're constantly absorbing new companies. Integration never goes like it's supposed to, so there's typically a lot of confusion, silos within the company, and high stress. If you are comfortable in a constantly-shifting environment, you will appreciate Hanesbrands."
good,Good place to work.  Would like to have a pension plan.The people are nice and easy to get along with.  As I am thinking about getting things in place for retirement in the next 15 to 20 years I would like to know that there is a good pension plan offered through the company as well.
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar, só o salario que era pouco"
good,"A typical day at work consists with mainly helping women find the right bra for them. We do sell men's and woman's clothing, however that pretty much sells itself. "
good,"Picking orders, learned how to you scanners, cherry picker, and pallet jack, management could be much better. The drama is the hardest part of the job."
good,"A typical slow day, shipment and communications were priority. When a customer comes in the priority shifted to them . We encourage every team member to make their goal for the day by making themselves easily accessible to the customer."
good,"Working conditions aren't easy. Standing for long hours, feet will hurt, but co workers are great. Shifts are like clock work. Workers have been their for years. Fort lift driving."
good,Very good company to work for. you able to get discounts on clothes which can come in handy because they always have good sales going on in the store.
good,"You have to like working directly with your customers working in this type of store. I learned how to do bra fittings, with a smile. The opening and closing of the store fairly easy."
good,"Trained to fit woman for bras to help identify appropriate garments."
good,Hanesbrands offers a great work/life balance. There is such diversity within the company and some many exciting opportunities that take place to keep employees engaged making it easier to enjoy what you do!
good,"Has the same downsides all retail has - nights, weekends, holidays, keep you just under full time hours, on your feet all day. Retirement plan was good, but did not have health insurance in my position (part time.) Customers were an interesting crowd. Always something to do so the day never got boring. Co-workers can be hit or miss, as with any job. Good timing and consistency of 30 min lunch and 15 min breaks."
good,"Always have something to do. The customers are great. I have learned quite a bit from working at Hanes. I was promoted to management after only 4 month being on the job as a sales associate. The store manager is awesome, probably the best manager I have ever had. Nothing is hard about working at Hanes, it is pretty laid back and friendly environment. I really enjoy my time at Hanes with my coworkers."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company and interacting with the customers. Many of the customers would come in with no idea of what size bra they actually needed and were grateful when we helped them select bras that fit them and flattered their figure. "
good,"Hanes Brand is a wonderful company with hi quality standards and focused on results."
good,a good company. struggling with transition to hanes but still growing and strong.  benefits are good.
good,"Great brand, great senior management team.  Family environment.  "
good,"This company promotes products which cater to men, women, and children alike. Friendly employees, engaging fellowship opportunities."
good,It's a good place to work but no raises. It's hard to staff a store so it makes it tough on full time people to work an 8 hour shift.
good,"it was my first job, so it helped me learn, grow and know what it takes to stay on task and keep it up on a everyday basis. management was good. my co-workers became friends and we helped each other out during the process. the hardest part was marking the errors in the computer, sometimes you had it sometimes you didn't."
good,"Realmente el ambiente de trabajo en Hanes era excelente, la empresa cuenta con mucho talento y gente con experiencia en el ramo textil que nos ayudaba a lograr los objetivos trazados al inicio de cada año."
good,It was a great place to work.  Co-workers were knowledgable and willing to help out new employees.  A place where you could grow and develop.  Not a lot of politics.
good,A typical day at HBI is usually busy. The thing I learned the most working for HBI is you always have to work together and move at a high rate of speed so you can get your task completed. The management is good at HBI. You work almost seven days a week but they try to give you a day off. For the most part I enjoy my co-workers and working with them. The hardest part of the job at Hanes would be to keep your speed throughout the day so you can make production. The most enjoyable part of the job is when they provide us with meals for our hard work.
good,Empresa agravável com grandes chances de crescimento na área de propaganda médica.
good,My boss if is very understanding and will work with you on your schedule. It is a great place to work. My co-workers are very friendly.

good,I was a great place to work! They paid you enough to enjoy life and still had time to spend with your family! Everything was good until they up and moved to China!
good,"Being an assemler was a great experince, but it was hard working with the either the line leader or floor supervisor because there was not alot of communication with the workers."
good,Hanesbrands est une excellente école pour les personnes voulant travailler en marketing. La gestion de marques / produits est un rôle dans lequel une gestionnaire peut s'épanouir avec les multiples projets et différentes marques que Hanesbrands englobent. La variété de projets rend le travail motivant et dynamique.
good,es muy atareado en las fechas de temporada y en los cierres de mes
good,"I started working with this company at one of their smaller stores and I grew to love it. The atmosphere, the staff, and the customers. Although, since it was a smaller store and somedays our foot traffic was low, there were always things to do and helpful people there to do them with. The managers I worked under helped me come out of my shell and taught me how to walk up to new people and initiate a conversation. Our staff became fairly close to one another because we spent so much time together. I would say the hardest part of the job would be determining what the customer is wanting when they come into the store, but for those who love a challenge, like myself, it's a great fit. My favorite part of the job was how naturally things come to you while you're there. Whether it's the technical part of the job or the interaction with the customers."
good,"As a regional manager, I traveled daily and interacted with different employees in as many as 22 stores.  I was asked to handle all marketing, merchandising, and human resource issues that arose in the stores. I was in constant contact with corporate employees handling any issues that arose involving my job duties and stores locations.  I ;handled all of the hiring, firing, and training of all new managers and new store teams.  I oversaw the opening, closing, and remodels of stores.  I managed payroll budgets and supervised all supply requests."
good,"I set personal sales goals for every associate and motivate them to meet thier goal before their shift ended. The retail store has heavy trafic most of the time which makes it hard for us to keep conversion up, but we upset that by giving outstanding customer service to every customer who entered in the store. As a result, the company end the year up with a good increase sales."
good,Great place to work with decent benefits. Great people as well.
good,"Processed freight invoices from all sorts of freight carriers, both paper, and mostly by EDI. Paid freight bills weekly through 3rd-party freight payment provider. Supervised from 1 to 3-1/2 employees processing invoices. Weekly and monthly Lawson journal entries. Worked closely with other department managers and our director to provide timely and useful reporting to logistics operations personnel,"
good,Great company to work for learned many things.
good,Company looking to advance business thru state of the art thinking and obtain employees and contractor that will support that endeavor. You expertise is greatly utilized
good,Gear for Sports is a great 8-5 office job with competitive pay and room for advancement. Business is great with Champion and Under Armour so job security is nice. The work we do with apparel and design is fun to work around and coworkers and management provide fun environment.Pay could be much better but it keeps up with other company's salaries.
good,"good benefits, flex time Summer hours, casual dress code,  gym available to employees, management communicates the companies vision, goals and strategy,"

good,Stay busy work really hard keep moving as fast as you can never slow down don't get distracted if you see anything that needs to be done do it without anybody having to tell you
good,The jobs at Hanes are easy to learn and not physical. It would be easy for anyone to work here no matter how they are built. I’ve worked there for 17 years with no problem. I stand all day but it doesn’t seem to be an issue for me.
good,Relax place to work. I like working there at Hanes Brands. They are flexible with your time. They understand working Mothers. They care for family. They give you employee discount.

good,"It's a great workplace but low paying job. "
good,I have worked here for over a year now and I really do enjoy it. The benefits are great and all but you have to use 3-4 days of vacation during holiday shut down. The pay could be better for sure. They also offer sales to the employees where we can get great discounted product. Also your vacation for the year does not roll over to the next you use it or lose it.
good,It's easy job to do you stand up for 8 hours but it's not hard to do floow your tickets and you get paid breaks. Once you get hired permitant you get paid vacation

good,As I start my day for work I began to enter my work station and grab my work things I enter into my computer tell everyone hey and began to work my most important thing I learned bout this job is  every thing has to be done just right.

Attendance, and short morning discussions with coworkers began the work day. Production goals and changing  project objectives kept the day busy and challenging.

good,"A typical day at work was to use the scanner gun on your wrist to locate items throughout the warehouse.  Once locating the item, the scanner would tell you how many pieces of the item to pitch.  Pitching is putting the items in a box.  The hardest part of the job was the scanner sending you to locations where no items were available.  This would lower our production for the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the close knit bond between the workers and the bosses."
good,I have been at gear a little over a year now. The culture and people make me look forward to coming to work every day. i work three 12 hour shifts and the time goes by fairly quickly because I always have something to do.from folding to preprice to package garments.

Putting customers in fitting rooms , ringing the customers up on the register. Helping assist customers with what they need / want. The part i enjoy the most is getting to know the customer as i help them till the best of their needs and hardest would be trying to get a certain amount of people to get a bra fitting because most women don't want to be bothered but that doesn't stop me from trying ."
good,"A typical day will be spent helping customers find items and ringing them up. This can be a challenge due to the specifics of woman's lingerie. I learned how to properly measure a woman for a bra, how to deal with upset customers and how to assist my management with their daily duties. The management is helpful at teaching you your duties and giving you tasks to fill any slow time. My co-workers were helpful at assisting customers and retaining a clean sales floor. The hardest part of the job is handling upset customers and working the retail hours of night, weekends and holidays. The best part of the job is the regular customers and  my co-workers, also I enjoyed the challenge of a customer who needed help finding just the right item."

good,"I absolute love Hanes. The upper management are very approachable, the work environment is great and the culture is very diverse. However, you are typically underpaid from the industry standpoint, but that is made up for how well they treat their employees."
good,"At hanesbrand you get and order, you scan the order ,you pick the order, you seal the order and put it on the belt to be sorted. to pick the order you have to log into your scanner and that scanner tells you where to go and how many you need and what envelope the product go into and it will also tell you when you are finish .labeling  you insert what ever the ticket tells you to insert into the envelope but first you have to run a labor through the glue machine then stick it on the enevolpe after labelrs  finish with envelope the picker gets it and starts picking."

We would get a little slow on business every now and again, to stay busy and pass time I would walk around my area and areas around me was safe from all hazards. I learned that keeping a positive attitude will give you a better outlook on life and gives you the advantage of getting head on any goals you are planning to pursue.

The management was helping, caring and understanding about the job and personal care. The co-workers would help others and was always there when you need them. The labor is hard on some, but once your body gets use to it then it sort of gets better. The benefits and knowledge of the job is helpful."
good,Love my job there. I love working with women who were eager to learn. It was a lingerie shop so when women or men came in it was my mission they would leave out of there with a smile. My coworkers were like family.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of: keeping up with a balanced register, helping the customer find a product to fit them to their liking, dealing with money, answering the phone to help with customers over the phone. Stocking the racks when needed. I learned the time i was there was how to approch customers and how to deal with different situations. The managers were very nice and very helping if I ran into any problems. My co-workers were also very helping with handling situations and helping with customers. The hardest part of the job would have to be dealing with mutiple customers in the dressing room and having customers ask for you help, it was pretty easykeeping up with them all but having to turn down an chance to help someone was the hardest part for me. The most enjoyable part of the job would of been interacting with all the different customers."

good,"Overall,  working at Hanes Brands wasn't all that easy, but I took accustom to the work area and I am happy with my results."
good,A typical day at this job was challenging. You are always on the move and keeping busy. Management keeps you working and allow you to express your concerns. Co-workers were fun to work with and did not give you any problems. The only hard part about this job was that you may have to climb stairs at times to find work at another station and in the summer the facility would be extremely hot! I enjoyed the job for the most part.
good,wonderful staff was only pt but my hours got cut during the slow time where the job was not worth my gas and company did not seem to care that a employee was leaving

There is nothing hard about the job. Its a quick pace work and job. Hard to get hired on if you can be fast and great attendance. What I enjoy most about my job is the people I work with and the environment that I'm in."

good,"There are so many ways to ineract with a diversity of people. Hanes stays busy throughout the day until about 12:00. I've learned different techniques of handling different situations. Only if I knew how to drive, I would have been a wonderful key holder. My co-workers were friendly and honest. The hardest part of my job was training a new comer on the job. Most of all I really enjoyed working there."
good,I truly enjoyed my job. The people I worked with were wonderful and encouraging. There was always something to learn and to improve upon. the only thing is the constant hanging over your head of a layoff.
good,It is HOT inside the factory.  But I liked my job at HBI. And if I hadn't bought a house in Wv.  I would still be working there. They have good benefits (best I've ever had). I worked both 2nd and 3rd shift. And I liked both of my supervisors.

good,"I enjoyed working there, the work was fairly easy. The hrs. were a little iffy around Thanksgiving and Christmas, some weeks I didn't even get 30, but that wasn't the norm, it was just the slow season for them. All of the trainers and supervisors were great. The only person I had a problem with was the dept. head in VAS. Very rude to the employees. Talked to people like they were totally stupid on a regular basis. If you attempted to speak to her, she would roll her eyes, turn her back on you and walk off!! Very unprofessional"
good,Colleagues are helpful and positive. I have been a temporary contractor for 3 years. I have interviewed for several permanent positions but have been rejected from all. It would be nice to get benefits one day.
good,Maidenform was the best experience I had working in retail. It was small and intimate. It was a great learning experience for me. I felt like I really excelled in that environment.

good,"Local acessível bons benefícios, ótimo horário de trabalho. Tive facilidade em aprender rápido a produção. Só tinha um ponto negativo trabalhar em pé o período todo."
good,A typical day at work included a very high inbound call volume. I learned how to stay in control of the calls while still remaining empathetic and professional. The management team was always willing to assist when an issue arose and involved me in the resolution. the workplace culture was diverse in the call center. the hardest part of the job was providing web support for a website that was experiencing many difficulties. The hardest part of the job was educating seasoned consumers of the changes that we were experiencing.

good,The atmosphere of Maidenform is wonderful. There is no such thing as a typical day at work. Everyday is a learning experience. Being able to multi-task is a key factor. My co-workers are wonderful. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help people.
good,"Work was very repetitive and doing it for 40 hours a week was exhausting, but in the end it was very rewarding because I was making decent money and providing for my family when they needed it. It was very hard to associate with anyone because of the loud noise from the machinery and we practically had to yell at each other to have a decent conversation. But what I was there for was not to socialize but to do my job and do it the right and safe way."
good,There is always something different going on which kept it fun.
good,"Like all organizations in USA today, the Job Security was constantly fore front in everyone's mind."

good,Hanes Brand is a wonderful place to work. Some people might can't handle the heat in the summer and the cold in the winter but other than that it was a quick pace job with lots of positive people & lots of help if or when needed.
good,"My typical day here would be to grab some paperwork and log on to my phone.  Answer calls coming in from customers having complaints with their orders/product.  Solving the problems.  Going to warehouse and get product that other customer reps needed to help solve their complaints.  In between calls, issued refunds or key in reorders."
good,"Easy job, sometimes boring because business was slow. But we had a great team and many things to do around the store so it wasn't that bad. Great company to work for but with economy and everything, the pay was all that but it'll get you by."
good,It Was A Great Job I Love working there people was nice. AND The Company Has Great potential if people follow rules. But Iove that workplace I did my job right and I was on time.
good,On a hole my manager and assist manager was really great to work for and I learn a lot about bras etc.  Most women don't know how to pick a good bra.  I stayed there 3 years but we were moving to Orlando so I had to quit.
good,"Maidenform has been a great company to work for. The experience at Maidenform has provided me with an high profiency of knowledge and expertise."
good,Great place to work at. everyone got a long with one another. the work wasnt really fast paced unless you had to ship something out right away. sucked that the plant location shut down.

good,"I actually liked working here while going to college perfect easy job to make money while in school"
good,The company was good to work there  fun and enjoyable coworkers  great atmosphere.  The supervisors  was nice and easy to talk to. They would do one on one to see what your  goals would be in 5 to 10 years which I thought  was awesome  and them showing a little consideration  for your goals.
good,Plant was new at time and enjoyed working there building it up as they closed their New jersey facility.  Location was great  and people were hard working
good,Loved working here. Hanes gave me up to 35 hours of work per week. They provide retirement. When the oil spill hit the gulf time was lost but they helped us file with bp.

We stayed busy which is a plus and got several days off during the week.

good,"I was initially hired as a Temporary worker when the Company was Sara Lee Corporation.  I eventually was hired on full time and it was the beginning of a wonderful adventure.  I was promoted twice during my tenure and was offered opportunities to travel and train associates at one of our facilities in Weston, Fl. that eventually shut down.  Hanesbrands became a private company with many changes to come.  I survived many cutbacks and downsizing until I was affected by a restructuring within the company in April of 2012.  I enjoyed working for Sara Lee/Hanesbrands, during my 17 year tenure.  I had the best co-workers, who I sorely miss. I enjoyed my job, and being able to resolve issues on any given day, and by being part of an organization that is such a powerful Brand.  I knew my job inside out, and I cannot truly say that there was anything that was really hard. We all encounter difficulties at some time, but we try to navigate through them, and move on to the next problem.  I was very proud to be part of a Company that values its employees and is such a giant when it comes to Corporate innovation."

I also had to help customers by measuring them to ensure they had the correct bra size and showing them which bra would be best for their body shape- so you need to have knowledge of the merchandise. And also needed to know how to work the register and clean the store at night because this store gets very busy especially during the holidays. The management was amazing they took the time to teach me everything and so were the co-workers I looked forward to working with them each day I was there which was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part was trying to keep up when it gets beyond busy and staying late to clean up the store especially during holidays and the summer."

good,"HanesBrands Inc. in Cabazon, CA can be a very fast paced place to work on some days. It is located in an outlet mall that is a tourist hot spot. Everyday we are faced with tourist from out of the country who either speak very little English or none at all, and we still have to make sure we provide them with the best customer service possible. I have learned to be very patient with customers and take my time listening to them as well as being able to explain things in a way they may understand. The management team here is great. They are very understanding and very professional. It is clear why they were promoted to be managers. All of the co-workers are a blast to work with as well. The hardest part of the job would probably be having to work through all of the different language barriers throughout the day.

Management always made me feel comfortable about discussing problems that arose in the department. Co-workers were very friendly and nice. I loved going to work and felt like I accomplished something. The hardest part was losing my job to foreigh trade and starting a new career after 24 years with the company.
good,A typical day at work would include assisting customers in their purchases. I have learned to be more social and light hearted. I am part of the management and we as a whole get along very well and the store runs smoothly for the most part. There isnt anything that i consider hard about my job. Maybe the occational disgruntled customer... The most enjoyable part of my job is the easy going staff and working with new customers everyday. There's always something different going on.

You get to meet new people one on one and get to hopefully let them leave the store with a product they want and a smile on their face. Managing a store of ten plus employees is not always easy but you have to be able to balance everyones wants and needs, and be able to deligate what needs to be done on a daily basis to each employee. I have learned along the way that there is no way you can please each and every person but you have to do the best that you can do, each and everyday."
