rating,review
good,"daily dealing with customers and freight, not much i didnt already know except specific policies for the company, management was ok most of them were cool, coworkers most were great some shady, the hardest part of the job was dealing with meeting the standards the management set for the frieght... they expected a lil much. sorry but if a pallet in 45 min of small items is not fast enough oh well. the most enjoyable part was the coworkers and feeling accomplished."
good,I was excited to start working for a big company. Did not like the facrt the first day I was alone at the register was the friday after Thanksgiving... when its crazy!
good,"I loved my schedule and my off days, everything was consistent. Even when management did make changes, they were easy to adapt to. The most enjoyable part would definitely be the customers. They kept our day going. The only thing I disliked were some of the managers and their unapproachable attitudes but I didn't allow that to interfere with my job."
good,"Working at Walmart was a focal point in my life. It was the first place to give me an opportunity to work. The environment there was a smorgasbord of good vibes and bad. The management had a mixture of those who knew how to run their employees, and others did not. Some were treated worse than others, showing that it seemed they like to play favorites. They expected you to put work before anything else."
good,"A day at work would sometimes be loud and busy, but productive and fast. I learned how to work with customers and keep them satisfied even when a disagreement has come about. My management at the beginning wasn't so strict but towards the end they began to put their foot down. I do feel they could be a little more considerate of their employees but thats a personal oppinion. My co- workers were overall pretty descent people and those who weren't I can not speak on. The job was very easy for me because I already have the experience and appreciation for my customers, that i know how to keep them happy. My most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a customer leaving with a smile."
good,- hard physical work
good,"decent work enviroment, an good co-workers, heat an weather was worst part for me, outside"
good,I was hired on as a cashier yet i worked in customer service and money center. I was not given any promotion.
good,My boss and co workers all worked really well together to get the job done
good,"Always understaffed, not paid enough, too much responsibility expected from part time associates, always hassled about the Wal-Mart Mastercard. Sometimes you get compliments from nice customers if you're pleasant. You need a lot of patience to work here. Most of management don't seem to care about average associate. It's hard to pick up extra shifts or extend shifts sometimes."
good,"I worked at three different stores and they are all the same. Safety was top priorty with the company, which I respected. It was fun at times working for Wal-mart because everyday was different. While working there, I learned how to be a customer service clerk, how to cash checks and perform moneygram transactions and how to be front-end supervisor even though I didn't become one. The hardest part of the job was trying to be promoted. Also make sure when dealing with the FMLOA act to do what the company requires, not what the managers tell you because you will loose your job if you don't stick to company policies."
good,This is a great job if you are a student and in school. They will most definitely work around your schedule.
good,"minus the different attitudes and personalities from co-workers and managers, the job was very fun"
good,I had a blast working for walmart i was always helping in other dept even tho im in that dept i really enjoy working thier
good,"It is just a typical retail environment benefits are okay, job sercurity is okay, not much advancement ok work life balance."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is a hand full. This cashier job consist of dealing with lots of different types of customers and employees. Overall, it was a fairly decent job to have although it can get hectic and aggravating dealing with rude customers. Hardest part of the job was having to keep my cool under frustrating circumstances. The co-workers were ""ok"" and I use that term loosely. It's always drama with the he say she say mess. The management was decent. Some were more professional than others. The most enjoyable part of the job was making money."
good,My daily task consist of
good,day at work was great
good,"always keep busy, advancement opportunities, descent raises(although the same people get the big raises all the time by the same managers). Able to relocate. Discount card for employees. Some management hired off street not knowledgeable of company policies and procedures to function on a shift."
good,A typical day at work was stocking shelves and running the cash register.I learned to overcome my fears.management was great.co workers helped and maintain a great work environment. the hardest part was not being able to get to no the customers.the most enjoyable part was meeting some good people.
good,Stocking shelves and making sure department was ready to be shopped.
good,Learning something new everyday is always fun when you have management who don't mind giving you a hand;co-workers are easy to work sometimes;hardest part of job sometimes is trying to finish something before the shift ends and the most enjoyable part is having a good feeling when you can finish.
good,"Working hard and making the day go by, how to do customer service. Managment is very strict but does a good job. Workers we very nice and worked well with each other. Telling customers you do have a answer for there questions. Hour lunch was the most enjoyable."
good,"A typical day would consist of several duties. Those duties most times did not always pertain to department you were designated in. I learned how to be more patient not only with customers, but with peers and myself as well. Also, managing tasks alone with out assistance was another major contribution I attained. My co-workers were all great, made coming to work worth it. We were all like family. Management i feel isn't the best, they aren't as involved as you would like them to be, but are really good about getting tasks done quickly as well. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were able to assist customers in their needs and them being greatful of the help provided. As well as being able to put a smile on their face."
good,"i loved making cupcakes and decorating the cakes and i learned the names of different kinds of bread, i loved my co workers and supervisor"
good,"working at walmart for over 5 years as a manager allowed me to use my customer service skills, as well as help and work with other."
good,ringing customer's purchases through all day.
good,"Not strong on custoer satisfaction, willing to settle for the customer getting less than perfect product due to them saying i dont think so, and poor product training."
good,"it was a good place to work, i got to meet new people, i loved to help customers when they needed help."
good,Good place to start a job. Raises come annually. Promotions are available.
good,I enjoyed working at WM as well. I enjoyed meeting others and had a great team to work with in any dept.
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart was busy, crazy and sometimes out of control, But it was fun and energetic. I learned alot about how to care for customers needs with a grin on my face, even if they werent happy. I learned self control and patience. The management was awesome most of the time. They would help out when needed and run around the store just as we were. I loved the people i worked with. They were so friendly and caring. The hardest part of the job was actually the most enjoyable. Dealing with the challenging customers and learning what we could do better to serve them better"
good,Scheduling workorders. I learned good customer service skills and how to complete projects in a timely manner.
good,Learned how to count money back the correct way.
good,greet customers
good,In a typical day at work i would greet customers scan their items and fix any price issues. i learned that customer service in a store is no fun! management was not very good. they tried to cheat me out of $1000! some co workers were great..others not so much. the hardest part of the job is trying not to lose my temper with a disrespectful customer. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting a great customer.
good,A typical day at work was at my register checking out customers. I learned alot about customer service. The management was ok could have been a little bit more understanding. My co-workers were all pretty friendly. The hardest part of my job was when we would get like a four hour rush. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking with many different new people.
good,Typical day is fun I come in and do my given tasks pull out overstock from different depts in the store that has available space on the shelves for the stockers to put out. By the end of the day I have to prep overstock and place in the steel by dept. I've learned that my job is an important part in customer satisfaction. If I do not properly track inventory in the backroom then there could possibly be an item available for the customer that is not pushed out to the floor. Overall management is bad that is what make the job not as good as it could be. The co-workers are great the energy in the store between all the employees are great. The hardest part of my job is when the stockers miss certain items and bring them back as overstock. It is my responsibility to stop what I am doing to go stock that item as well as know the places they go and be able to judge if it can go out or not. I enjoy most the co-workers they have became a family away from my family at home.
good,"Employees are often underpaid, yet not much is expected from them, so it is fair."
good,Taking customer's orders and handing food to them. Dealing with nice and friendly customers.
good,"a typical day at work was just ringing up customs. the management was pretty good. the co workers had to much drama, i kept to myself. there really wasnt anything hard about the job. the most enjoyable thing was meeting new people."
good,Come in and stock shelves. Assist customers. Learned to be a leader and show by example. Management always changed. Co-workers were nice. Hardest part of this job would be explaining to people that I would try and do everything possible to help them out.
good,"Walmart is at times an overly challenging workplace, due to the fact that it is such a high volume fast paced environment. There is plenty of room to grow and advance within many different fields inside the company, if you are up to the stress and challenge that comes with it."
good,"Typical day is coming in at 3pm and start working as soon as I come in cashing checks, sending money grams, receiving money grams, printing money orders, returning merchandise. My managers are always running back and forth dealing with other associates and customers so sometimes I would have to manage the front end while one of my co-workers would go to the service desk and do my job. The most difficult part of my job is doing a managers job running back and forth, dealing with customers, turning keys, handing money, counting drawers and the easiest part would be talking to customers and satisfying them."
good,good place to work. heavy lifting and flexible hours to be expected.
good,First time internship was available. Very unorganized but threw you into the issues and gave you the tools to fix.
good,"I start my day by balancing the CSM(customer service manager) cash podium, this contains cash needed to keep sales personal with change for their registers. By the time I finishes with that the first of the sales reps arrive and I assign them to a register. I then move back and forth between customer service and the reps solving problems, that range from price check to key overrides as well as handling customer needs and problems. I also make sure that the reps get their breaks and lunches in between this I also do register audits and employee reviews. I have learned to balance my time better and multitask more effectively to better help the customer and the people I work with. The people I work with are very hard working and friendly group, we have a great time working together in a very stressful job.I would say that the most difficult part of my job is the work schedule, it requires that you be available 24 hours, seven days a week with no set shifts or days off. The best part of my job is meeting new people and getting to help them with their purchases, to me its all about a positive buying experience."
good,"my co workers was the most enjoyable part of the job,the hardest part of the job was being accepted by my managers"
good,"Cut and prepare meat’s and cheese’s for customer’s, prepared frozen food to cook for the hot case, lifting heavy objects from freezer to prep table. Helping customer's as needed. co-workers were fun to work with."
good,"When I first started it was a great place to work for. The morale of the store was at a stable state. Many changes occurred within the company and has slowly started to change the way of life in the stores. Benefits have been cut, and employees have been diminishing. Workload is increasing and expectations are put to a barely achievable level. Customer service has decreased because of the employee morale being at an all time low. Turnover rate has increased in the time I have been there and it is sad to see this in a company that I will do anything for."
good,"Walmart is an ever changing, fast paced business that started 51 years ago with a company that had great values and the associates loved working for Sam Walton. Walmart has very smart executives that have grown Walmart to an amazing level."
good,"if you like working with the public and can put up with being yelled at then it is the right job for you,"
good,Great place to work with lots of benefits. flexible schedule with great managers to work with.
good,Wal-mart is a great place to start learning what working in the real world is like.
good,• Sharpened sales skills according to Wal-Mart standards
good,Overall I would say Walmart is a good employer. Benefits and compensation is ok for the job performed.
good,Many days at work where spent greeting customers and ensuring that their shopping experience went well. The hardest part of this job was dealing with so many different personalities and being able to enjoy my time at work.
good,I love to shop in Wal-Mart with my mother especially for grocery so working at Wal-Mart was great because I could not find a place anywhere else near home. The job was great and the customers were always friendly.
good,"Poor training skills, supervisors expected employees to handle claims without proper training."
good,liked working here a very family oriented company. I had the opportunity to learn alot.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart includes zoning the areas for which I am responsible and caring for clients. Management delegates duties which are to be performed and I do them. The moral is nothing to be desired as many are concerned with their lack of hours and low income. I feel the direct management does care about the day to day concerns of the employees but does not have the power to make changes, often making empty promises to the staff in terms of hours we will be given or policy changes to be implemented."
good,i was on strict orders from the doctor when i was pregnant to stay seated so i could not do much.
good,"Good Management, Excellent Customer Service, lacks proficient in employees"
good,I liked my job and liked what I did. Your higher ups did not treat people the way they should and when I was able to get a job at the Army base I left
good,I learned how to manage over 15 people
good,"I have learned a lot from the world's largest retailer. Some good things and some not so good. Most walmart employees are hard workers and most work two jobs just to make ends meet. Walmart has a lot of opportunity for advancement, but you do have to know the correct people in market management to get promoted. I do believe walmart could pay more due to the profits the make every year, but I understand it is a business. I have learned a lot of asset protection techniques working for walmart. I can operate on almost all camera systems now, due to what I have learned. I have also learned a lot of interview techniques for shop lifters."
good,Wal-Mart is a good company to work for. They just need a lot of improvement when it comes to the managers.
good,Hours and compensation are reasonable. Company values might be questionable.
good,Walmart is a company who ensures that their customers are satisfied. Their associates are able to receive great benefits and ways to advancement.
good,It was nice working there my friends I made while at walmart were more like family. Management was easy to talk to.
good,that time of was 2pm to 10pm pick and packer with the merchandise and order picker
good,I loved my bosses and pretty relaxed enviorment. I was able to show how much I knew my job by training others and working all around the store
good,Wal-mart was fine it was a little unorganized at times it was hard for them to schedule me.
good,"Huge store. A lot of items, you can find anything you want. Customer service is not too good. Prices are not that low."
good,"The staff is what made the job. Cleaning bathrooms isn't fun, unless you have someone to laugh about messes with."
good,Great work place with friendly staff and environment. Glad to be apart of the team.
good,i really don't have much to say about this company and I don't want to say to much. the benefits are ok if you are full time. it takes alot of hard work to move up
good,"I did enjoy working here, the hours were perfect. My only complaint would have to be the managers. They weren't as involved as they should have been at this particular store. Had to learn everything on my own."
good,nice place good pleople and evoirment for people very bussy and easy
good,Wal-Mart is a number 1 retail company in the world. Provide me opportunity to grow. Gave me support to develop my skill in customer service.. Give te opportunity to the comunity find a jobs.
good,Maintaining store cleanliness standards in a safe and efficient manner.
good,Plenty of work for people that need a starter job. A good place to gain experience for the industry of Retail.
good,Nice and friendly place to work. Can work flexable hours. Discount on items you buy. You wal-mart familly will teach you different things ever day. Anything from just dealing with a person who a bad problem and really upset to a person thinks you are the best person in the world. And if you cant handle a person you management to call and they will deal with it.
good,I really liked getting to go out to different doctor's offices and meeting the staff.
good,This company is ideal for a person with a full family support group. The hours are good for those who like early mornings. I had trouble finding daycare because my work day starts at 4am and daycares don't open until 6am.
good,"Great place to work for if you like to be sociable but stay busy. Never a dull moment, you get to meet new people and have the opportunity in helping others."
good,There was not enough organization. Management did not function together as one. Never knew what I was doing from day to day. Worked in different departments and under different supervisors.
good,"Managers seem to think that because they are a ""manager"" they are better than you and do not have to do anything. There were very few managers that were willing to get out of the office and actually do more than walk around and deligate tasks to people. Even though that is part of their job, they could still help out more. When there was a customer who had an issue with something and a manager was paged to come to Customer Service or another place in the store, the manager would always call and see what the problem was instead of getting up and coming to meet the customer face to face and help them with their issue."
good,"Working here was a little too hectic for me, i wish i would have waited long enough to transfer to another department tho."
good,Wal-Mart stores is a good place to work but I believe it depends on the location of the store in which you work. Some stores just simply out do the other and flat out crush the level of efficiency at the store.
good,Was enjoyable being that this was my first job that accepted me. It opened up more job oppertunities for me. Woudnt mind going back to work for them if they gave me that second chance.
good,"i liked working here while i did, but it conflicted with my schooling so i had to leave."
good,Enjoyed working for the logistics side of Walmart. Developed great relationships and friends over the years.
good,Gives opportunity to advance within the workplace. Gives you a chance to learn and gain more responsiblity and learn how to be a leader. Teaches you how to work with other people and give directions to help make the flow of work easier.
good,Had alot of trucks come in so there never was a slow time. It was fun to work there great people good team in the warehouse. People did get a little competetive but that just was a drive to work harder.
good,"they have a good work enviroment and good co workers, their attendance policy is good but not if you have small children that get sick often, their benefits are a little costly but can be good if you need them and management are good people"
good,This is a chance to view operations of the world's largest retailer. Lots of resources with a good bit of pressure to produce. Huge stores with many different jobs allow people to work themselves into jobs that suit their talents and tastes.
good,I had a great time working in the Accounting office at Walmart. I was able to learn some basic functions of Accounting while I was still in college.
good,"Company seems a little hard to please, but they do pay well. Benefits are alright can't complain."
good,"Walmart is a great employer, they look out for each other and make work an enjoyable experience."
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart for the most part. My fellow employees make the job worth working. A lot of changes have been made, however if your willing to work, they will work you"
good,Working here gave many opportunities and i really enjoyed working there.
good,"I really liked working at walmart, i really loved helping the customers and it was a fun workplace tho it would get really busy at times, you still have to keep it together and keep moving. They are understanding about medical issues and family issues if you need time off for a death in the family they understand."
good,I liked working at this company as a part time job but am now looking for something that I would like to do as a full time job. Walmart was a good company to work for during college but I am now looking to further my career. I would like to find a full time job now that I have graduated with a Bachelors in Business Administration.
good,working at walmart was a great experience for me. i loved it and would work their again when given the chance
good,"Great company to work for, lots of room for advancement, and great benefits"
good,"As an employee I gained good work ethics and made friends. I loved the job but hated the overnight hours. I found out that I just couldn't handle the hours, but I could handle the workload."
good,Its an ok place to work. The benefits are ok along with pay but work hours goes up and down depending on the time of year.
good,you get to meet a lot of people while you enjoy your self making money
good,Stocking and interacting with customers assure a clean and safe work enviornment
good,"Very fast paced and very demanding,strict,no fun at all,friendy coworkers"
good,Would love to have had the opportunity to advance in this company
good,"dealt with different people, worked with money,worked with friendly people"
good,I liked working for walmart because i liked working with people and like the work that i did
good,Good place to work and at times can be difficult. They need to hire more people.
good,It's not terrible to work here. It's stable and solid work with regular and fairly rapid opportunities for raises. But it is a retail giant and product knowledge is hard to garner. Work can get tedious but it's a fine place to work overall.
good,Most people there are very friendly. Great work environment
good,"I enjoyed being an employee at walmart because it was a fast paced and productive environment. Working at walmart has given me many skills in many areas of retail. I have excellence cash register expierence now. While working at Wal-Mart I had the oppourtunity to also be a customer service representative. While working at the service desk I learned to take calls, do returns and exchanges, cash checks, and do money orders."
good,not a bad place to work start pay is not bad the managers can be hard to get along with it seems like they accept so much from you paid every two weeks can advance as long as you want to and show interest
good,"The experience with customers was great,but the managers and other co-workers failed to separate personal and professional."
good,"While working at WalMart I was able to experience the changing of supervisors when a new WalMart opened, which was a rough transition from level headed supervisors to incompetent ones and in turn led to many people quitting or hating their job."
good,"I took a job at walmart when the economy went bad in 2008 because they were the only ones hiring at the time. I spent almost 4 years there and most of the time it was horrible. Always having to walk on egg shells because management is quick to fire people. The pay is VERY VERY unfair for what you have to do and put up with. When walmart as a company says they are competitive with other companys, NO NO NO they are not. Dont get me wrong if your ok with being paid peanuts for long hours then this is the job for you. My coworkers were good people and fun to be around for the most part."
good,Stable and innovative company. Consistently changing processes and procedures to meet the needs of its customers.
good,The people I worked with on a day to day basis were great but managment often accused associates of many things and played favorites among other employees.
good,You get a chance to meet a lot of new people & get reaquainted with old friends you haven't seen in years.
good,The job was fun. Alot of codes to remember but once you got them down it was good.
good,"I must say I do enjoy working as a cashier, I get to talk to the customer about many things and I found it exciting that so many people like to shop overnight unlike myself. You get to shop while you are at work so you don't have to make a special trip to the store."
good,I've been with the company for 8 years and I make decent money. They expect alot out of you and some stores are worse than others.
good,It a great place to apply your customer service skills. People are friendly and great.
good,nice place to work fast faced and has many oppertunities for advancement
good,Awesome place for employment. Generally employees are nice. Great customer service. Work schedules can be fit around school and family demands.
good,"Other than most of the management flaws, it was a good place to work and interact with people."
good,"Wal-mart is a great place to work great for advancment into management,managers are easy to approach with all ideas and concerns. It is a great place to learn all aspects of retail from cashiering to stocking frieght,unloading trucks handling money and working with the general public.I myself loved working in the fabric department i had excellent customers and loved helping them with their sewing and crafting ideas and learnig new things from them."
good,"Great place of business to start entry level work. Good people that are easy to get along with, along with great customers and customer service make it what it is."
good,I worked for 2 and a half years then a certain assistant manager decided to let me go due to personal issues but she put down as my attendance which i was there everyday. Other than that the workers are great. It has changed a lot since 2009 and not for the better. Since Mr. Wally died his kids took over and so many things went wrong in the company. Too many turn overs for wal-mart now. I hear so many people that work there are only there cause its temporary for them until they can find better. Wal-Mart is not the same anymore.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was fun, but due to the heavy hours given, it was difficult for me to handle because of my busy school schedule."
good,big on policy....and violations whether you know or not. ask about anythihg you are unsure of....then double check that.
good,With hard work and dedication you can have any type of career you choose.
good,They very flexible when it comes to schedualing around your chool schedual.
good,walmart is a fun upbeat work place you get to learn the regulars customers and you can know what there looking for whan they come in you nerver get bord and you can always satisfy a customer here
good,I enjoyed my time at walmart. Meeting new peolple working as a team. Learning from working in different departments.
good,"This job is job for most people especially for high schoolers after they get out of school. They are always looking for extra "
good,"Walmart is a Good paying job that offers A lot of benefits , but Needs Better management . Overall I Liked My Job As A Cart Attendant Because It Gave Me The Opportunity to interact With Different people"
good,Walmart is a good company to work for.  The associate needs to be diverse in keeping up with technology and with the change in shopping trends of the paying customer.
good,"Decent place to work. Good pay and benefits. Good opportunity for advancement with lots of training."
good,"90% of the managers and your coworkers genuinely appreciate what you do there and make sure that you know you're doing a good job. However, the few disrespectful people make the job slightly difficult to do. Overall I recommend working here because you will become friends with your coworkers and it's a pleasant work environment"
good,I worked for the company and would again i worked there for 6 months with the company as a truck un loader  and merchandise stocker  i worked from 3 to 11
good,"The job offers different hours...some good, some not so good. The work is droning,  but pay is decent. The raises are biased as to what department you work and it makes some of us feel less important.  Im not there to make friends,  just a paycheck, but there are some great people there. Senior management needs some restructuring,  but most managers understand their associates ."
good,I enjoy my stay at Walmart but had some other issues when it came being done right by the store owner. What I learn is to make sure you do your job. Don't be out doing stuff outside of work cause they can use that against you.
good,"I'm a friendly person, love to smile! I try to stay happy and make sure that my customerswere happy also. Great hours and flexible time. Co workers were also great to work with."
good,"Walmart was my first job and I only stayed for about 6 months. The work environment wasn’t too enjoyable, coworkers weren’t too excited about being there. As a teen working at Walmart, it just wasn’t what I was looking for. Other than that, if you’re looking for a first job to gain experience with costumer service and occasionally work with others, this is a great job to have."
good,While working at Walmart Global Shared Services I encounter Great People and a Great learning Experience. There was never a dull day there and I learn a lot there.
good,Wal-Mart is ever changing and often likes to fix things that aren’t broken. Management and other associates come and go so it is often best to not get extremely close to those you work with
good,They need to raise the pay . Some people do two and three jobs at the same pay. I don’t think that is right. In all I have work for Walmart for Over 10 years and I am getting paid $11.00dollars a hour.
good,As a cashier I can ensure that working at walmart will test your abilities. standing whole day and continuously working can make you tierd at the end of the day.
good,I'm the very  detailed worker.get along with others. Teamplayer. Help people in need. I just need someone to give me a chance. I am getting desparate. I really need ajob.
good,Working at Walmart was fun with the crew and the immediate management. Upper management was more difficult to work for. The job  is very demanding and at most times can be unreasonable. Can often be hard to keep up with and then management will come down on you.
good,"Es un campo laboral competitivo, en el cual se pretende sacar provecho de las condiciones del trabajador y poco considerado con el mismo."
good,It's a great opportunity for dire employment. The companies organization is tumultuous. Many employees come and go after a short period of working  at Walmart I noticed.
good,I leared alot about that job it was fun I was meeting new people I was trained how to use the cleaning cart and use the product I got to meet all of the people I was working with but ut I stayed to my self came in on time it was always alot of people in the store you'll grt rude people nice and sweet people the
good,"It's cool too work here in some areas. Some areas I think should be paid more then what they are getting. Some managers are nice, but most of them have favorites and treat them better then others. Easy work if you learn quick and fast. Some stores are more organized then others."
good,"I enjoyed working as an automotive technician, however I hated the people I worked with. Most people would not pick up and clean up after themselves which meant I was catching all that responsibility and manager would not help."
good,Friendly staff and management. The work schedule was very inconsistent and the pay was low but there's lots of opportunities to take courses such as first aid and forklift
good,"Assisting Customers, putting away stock, straightening racks,Managers will work with you on scheduling work hours. They sometimes will assist the co-wokers"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral,solo el salario no es bueno para el puesto que desempeñaba"
good,"Management was far better than expected from walmart."
good,I learn how to manage my time and meat the target or goals. It is a multi cultural workplace. The hardest part during peak season because lots of stocks coming. The most enjoyable part is our breaktime.
good,employé dont j'ai beaucoup apprécier mais quelque fois les gérants mettent beaucoup de stresse
good,Managers can be too expecting by giving you a time limit that is not possible to accomplish. It's a good job but they should be a little more lenient.
good,No room to advance without having to give up your life. Flexibility to work the hours you need is going away.  I work 8 to 5pm and  that will change very soon. Very diverse work culture. Management does work with you according to your needs. Does not pay enough
good,"Everyone is really nice and friendly but cart pushing is not the most fun job.  You have to be outside all the time unless there is lightning so be ready for cold, hot and rain.  They do allow you to come inside and warm up or cool off as much as you need.  Overall it is an okay job"
good,"Fairly decent workplace, not overbearing in any way. Respectful of your schedule as long as your adamant about it staying as you signed up. Just no real avenues of improvement are available as the only time a promotion would go to an employee is if they are fairly tenured in the position, and at that point it's just waiting for all of those workers to be moved or promoted so that newer employees have a chance."
good,"I have worked at this company for nearly 12 years and it has always been the employees that have kept me there.  When working with these people you gain at closeness, they become your family.  Though there have been many changes with this company, some good and some bad, the employees make it an enjoyable place to work."
good,Very community and family orientated...lots of job and advancement opportunity...could be stressful at times dealing with the public...down side always short staffed
good,"Es un lugar con buen ambientepara laborar entre compañeros."
good,Working at Walmart can be both good and bad. One good thing is the benefits as well as the dollar a day to go back to school. One bad thing: you are constantly being timed to stock the shelves no matter blogs busy the store is. Management can be unprofessional as well at times
good,"The work is easy and the pay is great, but the management doesn't care about anyone at all. The turnover rate is so great that they are always hiring. My fiance had to be airlifted to a neuro based hospital because he had a blood clot in his brain. I filed for LOA, but they took 15 days to send me the paperwork for the doctor to file and for me to send back. I have been getting points against me even though I informed work and called off for those days."
good,"Unfortunately Many of Sam Walton' s  principles seem to have gone by the wayside . respect for the individual , service to the customer  etc. "
good,"Working at Walmart can be okay but it is a lot to deal with sometimes, Can be busy a lot of the time and working fast is required. Dealing with customers can be annoying sometimes."
good,"Management isn't always the best but I had a lot of opportunities to learn different areas of work and amass skills, knowledge, and experience within the work area."
good,Walmart is it good place to work out coming right out of high school. It really gives you the option to work when you want to. Customers can sometimes be a little pushy but if you love people that's the job for you
good,Overall i like the job when i first started 5 years ago. Over time i saw people come and go and never understood why. As i got promoted i started getting yelled at and my job was being threatened almost every week. I then realized i should never be in a management position for Walmart.
good,They have a very diversified workplace culture which is awesome. I never worked a cash register until I was hired by Walmart and was happy that I learned how very well and fast.
good,I liked working at walmart.  helping customers find what they are looking for.  Advising customers on there selections. restocking the shelves.  help other employees find there to restock shelves
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, but often times you feel like a number and not an employee. Not uncommon for hard work to go unappreciated and feel unvalued."
good,"• In my own words working Walmart kept me productive and focus"
good,"So I've been an associate at Wal-Mart since May of 2018. There have bdefinately been some ups and downs. Some of the downs I've expierenced and noticed were deaaling with pregnancy, injuries and health issues. "
good,I believe that as a company they should do more cross training. They should make it easier to look for job openings within the facility online. We are not offered the same online career search.
good,Everyone was nice to work with but I couldn't stand in one spot for one whole shift because of arthritis.  I did love working with the customers and with the other workers.
good,"During my time working at Walmart the employees were very lazy and barely took care of the tasks that needed to be handled. The tying that I liked most about the job was learning, i learned how to do layaway sales, And I also learned to communicate better"
good,The job is very stable but the workload increases triple without adequate pay raises. The management varies and u get different job descriptions from them. Some demand alot other managers demand not enough productivity.
good,"Large company, Customer prioritized. I worked at a time where benefits were getting cut alittle at a time. Affordable insurance through the company. IF you take things serious and strife for productivity, there is room for promotions and advancement."
good,Usually my day would start of unloading then restocking most of the time. Obviously always work hard and smile. To give the best experience to the customers.
good,I was fired for letting customers sample food.  That was what I told when first started in the bakery. Customers can taste new food. I don't know why. Customers should be able to taste something new before they buy it. I think so .  All the employees sample especially Managers. The two that let me go was always sampling.
good,"It was difficult to change your shift. They were understaffed. It was difficult to get time off. The only shifts available for a stocker were very early in the morning, afternoon, or overnight."
good,"I tend to feel happier at work when I'm not talked to in a degrading way. I'm a happy energetic person but when I start feeling unappreciated and talked to like I'm a stupid person or I'm below them, I tend to lose motivation. It brings me down"
good,Walmart gives a student work experience. I worked here for 1.5 years. My experience was just fine not too good not too bad. Wages are good but the management in my location sucks. Would definitely recommend to a newcomer.
good,"Great learning experience, good character building. Met people of many different backgrounds, experiences, professions and styles. Walmart is a great opportunity of employment to progress within the customer service role."
good,It was relatively fun working at Walmart. I just hated the deli work. The hardest part of my job was being left alone in the deli for a hour. Especially when it came to cleaning up. The deli is too much for one person to handle
good,"Loved working with the people at this store.  Feel people are not paid their worth, while lazy people get paid the same.  Feel managers should praise work well done more, instead of emphasizing on only work not well done."
good,Productive place to work and meet new people and learn new skills. Everyday acquired better people and mechanical skills through opportunities presented to me.
good,"The job overall was good, just got a little much for me towards the end as they were short staffed. the job security is good there as they always need people to do the job"
good,It was a good job the first 5 mouths till we got a new manager and he didn't like me but I did all my work and helped people finish there work and I did extra work
good,"Be on time for your shift. Do not call off, only get 5 occurrences per year. Do your job to the best of your ability. Be will to be a team player, there is no I at Walmart."
good,"un día típico es bastante estresante, aprendí a mejorar mi palabra, lo mas difícil es aprender todo el sistema en que se maneja el trabajo,  y me gusto aprender porque es algo que yo desconocía"
good,"I love being around people, I love my coworkers,...what I dont like is  being super short handed and having piles of freight on top of other tasks to do with not enough people to help. We tend to sometimes not have anyone scheduled for certain areas of the department which makes it difficult to get work done."
good,Good place to be nice to there people and they make you feel right at home as should you when your at work great family to work with and I wished I stayed
good,"The production goal isn’t too bad, just be ready to work and be on time to the job. The work is constant, and the job isn’t easy, but if you need money and can only work a set schedule it’s the place for you."
good,"I had been a fan of going to shop at WM because the customer service stinks and then I worked there. It is pretty much the same. People are annoyed and do not want much to do with you. "
good,"Be ready to work, the Temple distribution center has no lunch break.  If you work the weekend shift it’s 10-12 hrs with only 2 breaks a 15 and a 20 that’s it. They expect u to eat and rest up all in that time. Hated every sec I was there. But the 3 work day and 4 day off was worth it. Until u get burnt out."
good,"Management will tell you anything just so you will go, you are just a number.pay and time off is really good for what you do.after awhile of being there you start to not care about the company just the money"
good,"It is good that they had raised pay rate and they hire frequently."
good,Depending on your position everyone has a separate set of rules. If your direct manager isn’t working everyone feels the need to direct you to work task that best suits their needs
good,You have to love the public Walmart policy is the customer is always right so you have to be friendly at all time with a great smile I don’t work there no more I’m on disability I am looking for a part-time cleaning position
good,They were very accepting with my school schedule but not so much about sick days even a doctors note is not a waver saying you are not liable for missing work.
good,It is a good workplace for young people who study or go to university and need to pay for their basic needs.  For them they have good time management.
good,"Walmart didn't really care for their employees, You would have questions and they wouldn't really help, as well if they wanted you to start a task they wouldn't clarify the task they expected you to know what you were doing."
good,"Good company to work for overall I have enjoyed my experiences, fairly easy to move up with good work ethic. Good benefits for example pro and management is paid well."
good,Wal Mart overall is a forever changing company with high turn over and high expectations. It's a reasonable flexible job with decent benefits and poor pay. Culture is based from store to store more so than company wide. There's great things about the company and there are terrible things as well.
good,The policy they have doesn't work for employers and they need to change there policy. I love working for walmart for 5 years but the attendance doesn't work for me we can't miss 5 out of 6 months
good,Well I really liked my job at first and I felt like I belong there but then after a week or so everybody started showing their true colors I felt like every day going into work I had to super self up like a sumo wrestler just to come into work.
good,As time goes on the company is working to increase productivity and decrease staffing while not increasing pay to compensate. Be prepared to work hard and not be compensated or recognized for it.
good,Lays off employees very often. Hires third party companies and outsourced jobs to India. Compensation and benefits are not competitive compared to other retailers.
good,"The production, distribution center is organized and compensation is competitive. Benefits are good when associates satisfactorily completes the probationary period, then transfers to full time positions if available."
good,The lafayette rd indianapolis Walmart have the menagement team not really good that time they have system menager never fix wor schsule and i have to over right clock in for work and they not care about employee
good,"Aprendí mucho, manejo de cantidades grandes de dinero, manejo de terminal, etc"
good,It's  a good  conpany   but after  Christmas   the hrs  go really  down for the hrs workers
good,Hardest part are the time limits other than that it's an easy place to work for various types of people working together and different attitudes clash but it's fun place to be
good,You will work hard and go the extra mile for little to no recognition. You can be punished as group for work not getting completed even though you worked by yourself.
good,Some mangers and employees and walmart can be very toxic. A person can get the since that their not wanted and if you want to talk to a manger you automatically get the sense that they don't want to deal with the issue. Employees get away with a lot of things that are unfair.
good,I am busy from the moment I arrive until its time to leave.  I get to work a variety of jobs and tasks.  I learn something new every day that I am there.  The management team are willing to listen and work with you as long as it fits within the Wal-Mart philosophy and policies.  Wal-Mart has systems in place for every job you do.  The hardest part of my job is how physical it can be.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the people I work with.
good,"backbreaking labour, a culture of backstabbing amongst associates and unrealistic productivity quotas."
good,"had some good days and bad days but its been good. some time feel over work.would like more hours.more help from management "
good,Walmart is an OK place to work. The hardest part of my job is listening to the complaints of the customers about things that were out of my control. The most enjoyable part of the job would be meeting a variety of different people.
good,"Had a great time working for walmart, other than some upper management. Taught me a lot about retail and about merchandising, sadly I was not a favorite to promote into salary and thus I had to leave the company. Was fully trying to make it into a career, but couldn't get past being a grunt even though management always came to me to finish projects."
good,"Was in the midst of the Wal-Mart as it was opening up, full of corruption from managers constantly getting fired for S.E.X-ual assault, (Considers S.E.X. inappropriate word in review) to employees being fired for literal ""Acts"" in the back room with a manager. Not the manager though, oddly enough. Regardless, the store eventually cleaned itself up more from the looks of it, management in electronics was extremely kind when I worked there, but literally every other department I saw would try to make people work overtime clocked out, or not take lunch until an hour before they leave, human ethics had to be frequently called before I eventually quit after being threatened by a manager. It's a nice place, but stay to yourself."
good,I enjoyed this job somewhat. When I started the store wasn't open yet. It was a little hectic for a while but everything came together. Most of the management for great.
good,Working at Walmart has its pros and cons. In the beginning of my career at Walmart it was good but I have since found that I need to move on which is why I have received my Emt license.
good,My review for the work there it was a good experience and a good job for my first time working.i got a little bit of experience there and hope to get more from another job
good,"I was a part of the remodel team, they’re a great company to work for starting out if you have no work history, they’re great with training and making things run smoothly"
good,"The most you would get from 95% of the employees was a head nod if you were lucky, not many people were friendly, the management was lazy and always all over the place, bad communication"
good,"Walmart  is decent company to work with you have to stick out  for better opportunity to come."
good,Walmart is a good place to learn about the environment and culture for newcomers they provide a platform to start your new life in Canada or the confidence to move further.
good,"I go into work, find out my assignment and work the entire shift on the task I am given. I stock all items and rotate the old items before the new ones"
good,This job pays well but they work you hard to earn that pay. I don't really like the point system and the fact they don't accept doctor's letters. Some managers are fair others practice favouritism.
good,I liked my job at Walmart because it offered lots of opportunities to cross-train in different departments. I also enjoyed meeting a variety of different people and customers.
good,It’s a good job but have to always remember you will have want to work too.. I mean you will live the cart associate job..But other then that you meet great people..
good,Ok company to work for. The benefits are good if you are able to get them. Starting wage isn't bad but not the top place to work. Management can be messy and so can HR.
good,It’s was alright working at Walmart but they focused too much on the bad and repeatedly reminded you of the bad but never the good. The bosses were fair but unfair at the same time. You get for who you work for pretty much.
good,Management needs to be more able and willing to help and listen  too much stress and pressure    Good benefits.  No good training   HR needs Availability for employees with ?
good,"Walmart,"
good,The good part about this job is I love to meet new people and the bad part about this job is the rude customers but I end up getting them the help they need in a respectful way
good,"There's never a dull day at work because of the new people you meet and work with. Your co-workers are the best part of the job, they become like family."
good,Overall a good place to work flexible hours and pay. Staff was always pleasant and managers usually always there to help you if needed. Great training program.
good,"You know what you need to do Walmart for 1 you need to pay more money enough money to actually get what you need done done, there's too many cutting corners such as cross training, it's meant for coverage of areas when somebody won't be there for a of timebut as most often used to train people and multiple areas so you won't have to hire extra people."
good,For someone who is first getting into the workforce. It's not too difficult but opens your eyes to the world of work and coworking. Definitely entry level job but I wouldn't recommend making a career in it.
good,They we’re good in helping me get to learn how to work in a customer based environment. However they don’t accept Drs notes. My managers were helpful when you could find them. The work environment was fast paced which was nice because I like being on my feet and moving constantly.
good,It was great the first few years but after Sam Walton passed away. It challeged the integrity of Walmart and their belief. Then it was all about the bottom line and not about the people that worked for the company.  They would rather hire a younger person and cast aside an older one. I'm saddened by the way they treated me and others not the same place anymore.
good,Usually when I first come in overnight I met up with the Assistant to see what all needed to be done for the night then proceed with the tasks. The time that I have spent there I have learn how to manage properly by doing a lot planning ahead in order for all of the tasks to get completed by the end of the shift. The culture at Walmart is really to get the job done by any means necessary.
good,"It is definitely hard to have a work life balance working in retail. Working holidays, working strange hours. I have met many great people working for this company and I appreciate the friendships and things I have learned along the way."
good,Walmart is a great entry level company with room to grow and promote. Working there has tought me many skills that will be useful not just in retail but any industry.
good,Often my hours were late in the night one day and early in the morning the next not allowing for much time away from work as well as making me work overtime in a part time position.
good,"I strongly recommend moving to another store when you achieve a promotion. You can then start with a clean slate and work towards you next promotion. There is always opportunities elsewhere. That said, the executives at walmart are changing things very rapidly and it's possible they ruin a good thing by eliminating jobs like department manager. So always have a get out plan."
good,I really liked being outside and working outside because I got to see friends while working and didn’t have to worry about anybody messing up my work pace
good,All job chores are written out for everyone daily..basically do your list of chores and start helping other associates with there stuff .. work hard be polite to customers and help any way you can
good,"good pay, good benefits, lots of advancement opportunities..BUT."
good,It's not the worst place to work as long as your not management you dont get paid enough to be one with how much bs you have to deal with. Good luck with all the stress.
good,Good things about working there is the vast amount of benefits and all of the customers you meet and make happy. The bad part is the attendance and PTO policies.
good,"Not happy with work environment. Management doesn’t treat workers good and pay should be higher. The benefits are terrible, and nobody should be unhappy where they work full time ."
good,"I first started this job with enthusiasm but the longer I stay the more I feel like the company and management don't appreciate its employees. I have been there for 3 yrs and is seems no one enjoys there job. management makes work harder for a simple fact they spend more time doing numbers than seeing the actual process of the job, employees left to figure out problems on there own, and are asked to do unsafe practices daily."
good,The job was overall good. Knew what I had to do when I came in. The management acted like you was beneath them. Especially the store manager and co manager. They would just talk to the assistant managers. Then the assistant manager would tell you what they said. Unless you was at least a dept manger then the store manager would acknowledge you.
good,I really don't have to much to say it's a job and a fairly easy one the get long and there restructuring get to be a pain  there rules are relaxed and they try to treat you like an adult
good,The first couple of years where tough but fun . Over time however the store began to feel more exhausting. Felt over worked with little to no aid and soon felt it was about time to go and learn other skills in the work place.
good,The assistant manager I have is pretty decent to work for.  She seems to care about our opinions and works with us if we have a scheduling conflict for the most part.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult and rude customers who do not want to show us their receipts.  The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be communicating with customers.
good,"It was fantastic to work for walmart, I was manager of the electronics department and toys department. A lot of work but it was great and at the same time being able to influence others was amazing."
good,"If you are planning to move up with this company, you have to go out of your way and do more than expected. If you are just a young person looking for a temporary part-time job, it might be better to look elsewhere, especially during the holiday season. It requires a lot of energy to work here."
good,"Excellent job for first time workers, potential to advance and great benefits, but scheduling conflicts and difficulty becoming full time to actually gain benefits. Customers range from polite and kind to unnecessarily toxic. Customer questions can be simple or somewhat complex"
good,Challenging and management played favorites. Lots of associates got away with doing bare minimum while management put a majority of the work load on a few people.
good,"I work at store 3529 and the managers there are something else. Grocery manager is always on your back. One moment they want you to do something and another moment she wants you to something else. Then complain why the first one wasn’t done. Then the manager that’s over Gm side did nothing for apparel. Like at one point, we had pallets, and pallets of freight. She just walked past us like it our problem. We have a new manager over apparel and we was able to get rid of the pallets."
good,I dont it cool ok hour you can get discounts not many benefits but you can learn alot have to stand on your feet deal with all different types of customers
good,Great atmosphere and always something to keep you busy. Lots of helping customers with taking heavy merchandise to their vehicle's and with heavy return products.
good,"its a fine job if you need income and experience, but not much more than that, unless you get on manager tracks you could expect leaving within a year or so"
good,Working from Walmart wasn't much of an opportunity to move up since the management had favoritism towards its employees like myself. Tho the people I worked with made my job more fun and easier to go by everyday.
good,"Training program is mainly computer based and is lacking. Associates are largely left to determine requirements on their own. Being retail, must be able to deal with people from all myriads of life and situations. Adequate staffing was an on going issue."
good,Es un ambiente regular depende de la persona con quién trabajes
good,"In all honesty the longer I work here the worse the company gets. The people I work next to are great people but the higher up people only look at ways to save money (which is not all a bad thing) but when it starts having a negative affect on the employees, it becomes an issue. If they would show more employee appreciation at times it would go a long ways."
good,Working at Wal-mart was a great opportunity. I am very appreciative of my team mates. Would work there again. Great staff. Great environment overall. Good place.
good,"Every Walmart department is different. Overall, working there was tolerable. There were good days and bad days. Be prepared for an assortment of retail experiences."
good,Making sure the customer has everything they need and are totally satisfied with their shopping experience at the end of the day is what the goal is. Personally for me helping the Elderly was the most enjoyable part for me.
good,A lot of opportunities for advancment . management actually cares. Can get boring. Customers are rude. Stocked a lot of stuff. Unloaded trucks. Managed and organized stock
good,"You will be trained to report things to Management, but they often will not listen, will brush you off, or will grill you about why you're not where you're supposed to be.  Workplace concerns will be overshadowed by sales numbers and short-term issues.  Management will NOT go out of their way in regards to Customer and Associate safety when a person with a firearm is involved, so do not rely on them.  Be prepared for needlessly irritable Customers at times--just do your best with them."
good,"A typical  day starts off with a meeting with the manager or manager's, you are giving instructions on what you will be doing that shift and what is expected of you.you learn more and more as you go Managers will be making sure that things are going good the workplace culture is what you make of it even if co-workers are dragging you down  hardest part of the job when your new like I  was is finishing everything on time ,I  I feel I was right there and would have been a great asset to the team,  a sense of accomplishment made me feel good about myself."
good,I worked at Walmart to receive higher pay from my other job but the time shifts were bad and the manage was nasty when asked to take days off and when asked if I could cover shifts.
good,"Working for Walmart is very interesting. Some days you feel like it is a good place to work at and others, well you digging through indeed. Management sucks. No one really knows what to do."
good,"It wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be, but it definitely did have some issues. The store I worked at had some favoritism issues, and the management was all over the place, sometimes good, and sometimes bad, but I realize that that isn't an indicator of every Walmart store. I did, however, learn a lot about the workplace. I learned how to communicate with people better, and people really enjoyed talking to me; both customer and coworker alike always praised me on my ability to make people happy with jokes or my general upbeat attitude. I think that was my favorite part about it: that I could talk to people and have friendly conversations while I was doing my job. It was really interesting talking to all sorts of different people. I was unfortunately eventually let go because we couldn't reach an understanding about my ongoing health issues at the time."
good,There's a lot of lack of communication when new policies are put into place making it difficult to assist customers properly.  Also training is an issue. New employees don't  get trained right and the customers suffer for it.
good,This was my first job when I started working and helped me grow to learn about the community around me. I was able to talk to my manager about anything I needed help with.
good,"A usual day was slow. I did trash, sweep floors, mopped floors, and cleaned bathrooms. The management was terrible. The hardest part was pleasing management. Honestly, the most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
good,"Promote hard-work with limited resources or employees available to complete it "
good,I feel like the associates here need to be noticed more for the work that they do. Communication between departments need to be a bit better as well. Other than that walmart is pretty good
good,"It’s a good starting job with good benefits but management needs to be improved on. It will get tedious at times, but if you show up, do your job right, the day is over before you know it."
good,A typical day was helping customers and learning about products and cleaning. Would've loved to stay working there had I not had a death in the family.
good,One of the best things about working there was the benefits.  Personnel department was always very helpful when I had questions for them and most employees were friendly.
good,"It's a good place for elderly to work so they can have a sense of self worth"
good,There was a lot of work I learn new things and my and it helps me better my people skillsThere are people friendly they told me a few things about stacking and feeling a truck
good,I would clock in and go to the office fill out my paperwork for that day and the come out the office and see do any cashiers need in money out the office and then I work around the store to see if and customers or associates need any help and go around the store and make sure there is nothing out of place and if it is I put the item back in the right place
good,"Was a great atmosphere to work in, not alot of guidance & learning opportunities unless you are chummy with management. The best part was my coworkers"
good,"This job was actually fun, the only reason I left was because I had received a full ride scholarship to Kansas State for soccer. Overall very chill job."
good,"Good part time job, not a great job for a new employee trying for full time. Lack of full time opportunities to be had. It does schedule 3 weeks in advance."
good,Overall good place to work but seem to not be family oriented company. Management at the time was only worried about themselves. Had great coworkers and actually enjoyed the work
good,"Walmart can be one of the most frustrating retail stores to work. Considering there are various departments, and pending on store size, a lot of freight. If you can work at walmart, you can work anywhere."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. My current position works with my home life. Walmart strives on being customer friendly. The management team is very helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"I was able to refine my customers skills, work under pressure, keep the line of customers happy, resolve problems, know when to call management."
good,Siempre encontraras personas en quien apoyarte con cualquier tema referente
good,The thing that i love the most about my job is meeting new people everyday hearing stories about there life and family. The company itself needs to have better management in scheduling so that we can meet the demands of our customers.
good,Its challanging to maintain a work home balance due to the ever changing needs of the retail industry. There is room for advancement in this company which can happen quickly and easily if you apply yourself. It all depends on the individual needs of each worker. They do provide affordable health care and some additional bonuses. It is also physically demanding for most positions.
good,I was so happy to start working here and it was everything I expected for the first 4-6 months then it was like I didn't matter anymore I was treated very disrespectful and just hated waking up and having to go to work I finally got out of there and now couldn't be happier at my new job where everyone is noticed and treated with respect
good,"I liked working for Walmart and I had open availability of my schedule but I still didn't feel it was right for me. The management is good and somewhat respectful, however some have a ""power high""."
good,They say there open to new ideas and they say all this great stuff when your hired but they pick favorits over people that actualy know what there doing i wish they wouldnt have thrown aeay such a great worker
good,It's easy manual labor that requies some physical effort and mainly being able to listen well while paying attention to detail. Management doesn't care for employees as much as they should though because they hire anyway. You'll be replaced by the nightshift.
good,Management are very hard on some people. I feel as though they shouldn’t believe everything that is told to them they should go to the source. They should put more faith in their associates.
good,I feel like the only reason I stay working there is because it is convenient and I love the people that I work with. It's my work family. They are awesome.
good,It was a good job. Management was not the greatest. Way more stress than they supposed to have. None of the managers are on they same page. They always assigned us something to do but would pull us off one task and put us on another.
good,I have learned alot working at walmart.  On a typical day at walmart I stock the shelves and make sure everything looks nice and clean for the customers. Help customers find what they are looking for.
good,"A good company to start and move up the corporate ladder."
good,"Walmart Super Center is a good place for anyone and everyone to work.  Some of us may get along with the job and keep going.  However, Sam Walton was a family and provided good benefits for employees."
good,this place was terrible the staff was not respectful often rude as well i enjoyed connecting with people in the parking lot helping people carry there groceries out.
good,"I have worked for Walmart 3 times now, and have worked for 5 different stores.  Corporate can be a hassle, but the biggest issue I see is bad management on the store level.  I've had very bad experiences with management, and very good.  Walmart is not for everyone, but it is a paycheck, and can be a great way to advance in the business field if you are able to get into a store with good management."
good,"Was a simple company to work for. Just do your job and you’ll be fine, but management wasn’t up to par, and often confused and misguided workers, they don’t train you , you learn as you go. It’s easy once you get the hang of it , but management needs to step it’s game up."
good,"Walmart is the largest employer in the world with benefits, expectations, and availability to advance in the company.  Your experience with the corporation can different depending in your excellent completion in the role and division.  I would exceed their expectation at all times.  Good luck!"
good,While working here i came to see the difference in the way most companies work and value they're employees. This company is different in many ways from what I've experienced in other competitors.
good,"Walmart is a good job for gaining work experience. A career could very well be supported, but its a better first step than a full career. Theres certainly options to advance but it takes time and may not seem worth it in the end."
good,"I've been working here for two months. "
good,"Walmart provided training & educational opportunities. However, the scheduling could be better. Coworkers were good at their job and tried to make it friendly"
good,"Productive and fast-paced, especially on holidays. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is trying to clean a mess while the customers are walking over the spot where it has been mopped, etc."
good,I felt Walmart was an okay place of employment. I don't feel that they treat their employees very well. Management is horrible and their is no communication.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was coming in and doing what Im suppose to do and working with my co-workers........................................
good,I enjoyed working for the company fellow employees were like family management was willing to work with you benefits were good how they give your paid days off is very reasonable
good,"Walmart was a great company to work for I do however think management should have more training with proper ways to deligate to employees and have some sort of advanced training with people skills."
good,"Walking into Walmart as a costumer is a normal thing. Walking in as an associate you have more things to look for and observe. Management for one was pretty good. Having a good supervisor and manager, but the team work was just not all there. You would help your group out, but would get told to go do your job even when another associate is asking for it. Walmart is a team company. Paying and benefits were acceptable. The one thing I will say is if your a team your a team, work as a team, sale as a team, help like a team. I would say the most enjoyable part of fresh cap was helping around the deli and bakery and the backroom when things needed to be moved. Then the hardest part was those busy days where you would have to stock one thing multiple times."
good,Fun place to work honestly depending on location and management team. But the pay is good and you have an opportunity to get a lot of hours and also pick up hours
good,Walmart is a great place to work at but it depends on what department you're in. I wish Bentonville would come down and realize how difficult and stressful things already are before they start changing things. Little things make a big difference.
good,"Working hard , being on time, good customer service, putting customers first, making sure the job is done , doing your best on the job making, making sure your customer happy and them to your best"
good,"Walmart is great first job and I am grateful to them, but it feels like it is all coming to an end. There are less employees and more work. Everything is changing for the worst and I don't know what to do anymore. If you want at Walmart it's a good temporary job; good luck."
good,Premium pay overall but you work extremely fast and hard lots of heavy lifting takes a tool on your body some managers are good and work with you and will help other not so much
good,Walmart is not too bad to work at. Everyone who works there is very nice. The managers don’t do much. You are expected to do much more than the initially tell you. The work is boring and doesn’t help you in life.
good,A typical work day dealing with customers makings sure they find everything or what they needed even though I was a full-time stocker. working there I learned that matter how rude or greedy people were to me you always have to have an smile on your face and prepare for the next customers in line.
good,"Walmart is a great job. I recommend this job to anyone who is looking for something, but you’ll have to have open availability that’s the only hard part about it."
good,"Stocked and tagged dairy products dairy for purchase. Maintained accurate inventory, flagging expired products for removal. But their were not never people to handle all the area."
good,"was stressful at times, but otherwise did not mind coming in everyday for work. For the most part was able to work alone with not a lot of management looking over the shoulder."
good,"My time working with Walmart began very very very happily those slowly over time it's degenerated into a monotonous and bitter experience. this cannot be applied as all the compassing to Walmart because my position was security more specifically customer host which means for the majority of my shifts I would stand at the front doors and check receipts therefore I was cussed at and berated by people constantly on a daily basis ignored them anymore and that was a cause for much of my bitterness. as with any and every job there are good managers and there are bad I have the experience of both multiple times working there Walmart can really only truly be rated on a store by store, distribution center buy distribution center, and corporate office locations - I don't think it is fair possible to give an all-encompassing review of all of Walmart based off of my experience and a few stores I was at so I will be honest and fair. I did leave this job for higher pay though and my pay was cut when I was wrongfully removed from the pharmacy due to discrimination, but the closeness to my house the familiarity with the community and the general more flexibility and greater job security and my position was enough for me to stay"
good,I love my coworkers but I am looking for a better job with advancement opportunities and to grow and learn new things and see where life leads me. I willing learn new things.
good,Management had favorites and that's who would get all the hours. Took out regular registers and put in like 20+ self checkouts. Which made the job more stressful.
good,"I've been at Walmart 31 years. I enjoy what I do. It's fast paced and I like that. A lot can be done to make it a better place to work , it's quick changing & you have to be mindful of customers as well."
good,Working at Walmart has its highs and lows. One high point is you to get to interact with a lot of different people IF you are a people person. Low point is all the different holidays hoy have to prep for. With tons and tons of freight piling up.
good,"Not the best place to work, but the compensation is reasonable. I have worked at several stores, and the higher up managers are out of touch with what really makes the company work. There is no accountability for those who need it and no reward for those who go above and beyond."
good,"Good place to work , team oriented, Good benefits, face paced friendly environment, I recommend to anyone looking for a good paying job. Flexible schedule."
good,Very fast paced you Will take care of  customers while trying to restock and organize and be across the store with items or others all at the same time  must complete all tasks and sometimes 8 hours is not enough not a job for someone not willing to work
good,Okay place to work with good benefits yearly raise is only 2 persent but there are a lot of different jobs to choose from and if you would like to move up promotion are easy to get
good,Company has computerized scheduling which allows for no work life balance. Breaks are good and the holiday is a rush which makes your shift go really fast. Be prepared to get crossed trained for multi duties.
good,"A typical day at work was unloading Walmart trucks, placing the merchandise on a conveyor belt, pallet, and stocking the store.  My supervisor was there to direct and instruct the employees.  Sorting and distribution was the key elements of this job.  There was some heavy lifting.  "
good,Job was fun... management was poor.. some people I work with was lasy I always pick up there slack I told manament about they did not do anything about it
good,Great customer service and manager over in deli and bakery was a department manager and bedding and furniture and work pick up online and stocking for grocery.
good,"It's an okay place to work at, I don't see it as a place to make a career at, there are a couple of supervisors who could take some classes on professionalism because they don't really do their job they just talk on the phone then tell at you for slowing down."
good,Its a ok starter job or part time job i did almost turee yrs there and i wish i had made more money but it is what it is. Cant complain too much. Pay just sucks and the hours too.
good,Overworked underpaid if you are desperate sure. Everyone complains about someone else not working but no one wants to do their job. Good workers get overworked.
good,En la empresa de Fajardo hay mucho favoritismo con familiares y no dan oportunidades
good,"Good entry-level jobs, friendly managers, but sometimes the customers may become tough to pleasure. Walmart always needs people and it has the flexibility for part-time positions."
good,"Stress, beaucoup de compétition entre magasins, gestion du personnel à améliorer."
good,Je suis assez satisfaite de l emploie mais il serait parfait s il y avait des ajustements
good,"When I was working at Wal-Mart, i was a department manager. There were times they (management team) had me so stressed out I would get sick. I ended up pointing out because of this. The management team was very indecisive. One person would tell you to do something, then someone else would come along and tell you not to do it."
good,"It was nothing too crazy or boring. Every day is different, depending on management and employees, you aren't sure what you're going to walk in on......"
good,"for those that want a job its a good start but on the other hand it can be a good place for a career move. Good area for military families for transfer is possible, also for college students because it allows them to work when they can and leave for school during those times."
good,They can change the way they treat there employees. And the employees can stop standing around so much and actually do there job. And open more check out lines!!
good,"Managers are seriously annoying but most of the workers are amazing.People for the most part are cool, but as soon as a manager looks your way he wants you to do this or that."
good,"The job is strenuous and tiring, they don’t care about your outside life. Everyone acts like they are the managers but don’t want the manager title. The lunches are as long as you would like."
good,I enjoyed my job at Walmart. I especially enjoyed the pay and the hours. The only reason I left was the poor management. There were many employees that would not do their job and the entire department would always be punished because of these select few people.
good,Some management mistakes with staff and labor distribution between shifts for cap associates. Overall had good intentions and a laid back work environment.
good,"The job skills are easy to pick up and it doesn't take long to form close working relationships with your fellow associates in order to work as a team. However, the corporate headquarters are prone to making abrupt changes that don't always work too well with certain individual stores that can't accommodate these changes. Which can cause disruption to the work/life balance and damage the morale of both management and associates."
good,Working with walmart I was stressed all the time.. my anxiety went through the roof as soon as I step foot through the door.. I would try my hardest to get everything done like I was suppose to and it seems like nothing was ever good enough.. Management was always on my case about one thing or another.
good,"This does not apply to all Walmart’s, however it was very hard for me to learn and grow at my Walmart because I wasn’t given the opportunity to. When I should’ve been full time I was getting hardly any hours. And wasn’t getting help from any of my managers either. As much as I liked Walmart as a company I just couldn’t stay."
good,"In my time with the company I had worked there for 16 years, it has been a journey, they moved me several times, it was an experience and teaching ways. if you made a career you definitely will understand what others go thru and why in some cases you feel customer service is not what it was 20 years ago."
good,"Not for everyone. Perfect for those who want a career that consumes their life. Salaried managers are expected to sacrifice all. Walmart must be first priority. Good pay, good benefits, good people.....bad management, bad work/life balance."
good,"This job have a large turnover. (Sometimes you don't need 150 letter when you can get to the point.) The manager have no power,  we have to wait for over and hour sometimes just to get and answer."
good,It was a pretty simple process when it came to the interview. Just be honest about your work and do the best you can. The hours are usually moved around a lot but pretty reasonable.
good,"There is a huge lack of communication and consistency at the Walmart I worked at, between the upper management, lower management, and employees. Also, the different expectations of work responsibilities during the shift when different managers worked was very hard to work under. The hours were inconsistent and shifts changed on a weekly and sometimes even daily basis. The hardest part of the job was the uncertainty of what every shift would be like. The people were my favorite part of the job. I especially enjoyed helping people find things in the store."
good,"Not bad for my first job. Being a cashier keeps you busy, management was helpful. Usually more busy on the weekends. Customers were friendly. Paid at minimum wage but didn’t work a lot of hours."
good,"Smooth and fast paced, friendly coworkers, wonderful management when I worked there, hardest part of the job was dealing with really rude customers, I am very good at math so working the cash register was really easy for me."
good,Walmart is a good place to get started in the mechanic field. They are willing to train and let you do more as you are trained and feel comfortable. not very challenging.
good,"Being a cart pusher at Walmart is a tough job. For me it took a lot of focus and motivation to get the job done. Everyday was the same, collect carts for the customers to shop with on both sides of the store. What was so tough about the job was collecting carts in the snow. My work peers were very helpful when things got hectic when suddenly your struggling to maintain carts on each side of the store because things can speed up really fast with customers coming in and out.Overall my experience taught me to push harder through tough times you've never been through when it comes down to certain situations."
good,I worked at the one on broad river and it was okay at first but ended up leaving due to personal matters. The one I worked at was not a very well managed place either.
good,"Great benefits, pay could be a little better. Management is horrible. Flexible schedule. Very strict call in policy. Training was extremely boring but did a good job covering everything. Fairly easy to work your way up. Pay was was something like 2% raise every year"
good,"I push carts and when the managers want me to do something else that would make me occupied doing something else , I would say i was busy pushing carts. They would put the outside work to the cart attendants when they know we have our hands full."
good,I honestly believe it is a good place to start your career or to make a decent buck. They are understanding about your life if things come up. Then you do have a chance for promotion.
good,"I've worked at 4 different locations in BC for Walmart. Retail wise. If part time work is all you need, maybe you're a student, or maybe your spouse works full time and you just need to work part time, I would certainly recommend Walmart over other retail places. I felt that I was given the opportunity to move up if I wanted to, I didn't, and that I was recognized for my work ethic and effort I put in the company, I just regret that it took like four years to get noticed."
good,Wal-Mart is a great company if you’re willing to work hard and has good opportunity for initial promotion. Once you get to ASM it is a little harder to promote and some of the policies are easily taken advantage of by associates. The biggest negative is the work life balance.
good,Its okay job if you like to clean but if you want to get an transfer to another job there It might take sometime. Its friendly that caring for there employees like a family
good,Working at Walmart was fun but after a year it got kind of boring and the manager was not always in a good mood so i never got a day of basically i was supposed to be off on the weekend and always had to work and never got vacation
good,"I've been working for Walmart for over 6 years. I've learned that Walmart as a whole is a fantastic company to work for. The company itself does strive to give it's employees the best work environment they can. However, being that it is a multi-million dollar corporation with hundreds of locations and millions of associates, it's not always the easiest place to work. Sometimes co-workers won't pull their weight. Sometimes it's hard to get recognized. I've encountered many managers that did not represent Walmart's values."
good,Mes supérieurs mettaient beaucoup de pression même si nous étions peu d'employés pour un si gros magasin.
good,"I liked working for Walmart at one point in time. Once I began to learn more and became more in tuned with the store I felt like they used my abilities against me. They never promoted me although I was asked plenty of times to cover the role or teach it. They’re a lot of drama in Walmart and the managers are very sneaky, they only help there own."
good,"It’s not a terrible job, however, they took away half of our benefits this year and our management team at my store has gone down hill and don’t seem to care about their jobs and responsibilities."
good,It is a good company to work for. Though depending on the store location u could deal with favoritism. As all jobs will have. As a company letting it happen is not good.
good,"Not a good place if you just starting out, they will work you to the bone unless you enjoy that kind of work, the management then was great but not sure of now, but if you upset anyone of management they will try to make you quit"
good,"In the beginning I was happy with Walmart, then they started splitting your days off and not care about the employees.  Most of my career at walmart I learned different areas of the store."
good,They work you to death and don't care about doing it. Too much mandatory overtime. Too demanding. Inside environment too hot. Breaks not long enough to rest your body.
good,"The hardest part of this job is I  can’t do what I supposed to do as department manager, most the time I’m doing others job,work freight, do the modulars or scan the bins and work it...some managers are very good and some of them are not ,but my new Manager and co-manager are very good leaders."
good,"Working for Walmart you'll acquire a variety of skills and be trained to perform a variety of jobs in the store but the experience you gain also might be Walmart specific. The customers, for the most part, are agreeable and compliant. The associates usually work towards their team goals well enough."
good,"IF you are an adaptable worker, you'll be fine. There is constant chaotic miscommunications and management does not really weed out poor performers, which can weigh down a team heavily. But the work is constant and always in demand so the stability and security is a plus."
good,"The management at my location isn't too fun to work with. The males in my area get pulled to unload trucks or move pallets more often than I'd like. If you have the right group of people working with you, it almost doesn't feel like work. My close friends and a steady paycheck are really the only things keeping me at walmart"
good,I would like to work there again. The employees were friendly and helpful to work with. Everyone was always on time. Seeing customers everyday makes you feel comfortable and needed.
good,I worked at Walmart for at least 5-6 months and it was fun at first but the management was horrible and they were very rude to us associates at the store I worked at store 2828 they were very unprofessional as well.
good,The Support Manager position can be stressful until you learn how to prioritize your workload. You work 4 days and you have 3 days off. This position gives you an opportunity to learn multiple positions.
good,"Management is not all bad but needs some customer assisting exercises. Very disorganized and can have overworking days. Schedules are not always set correctly , Job tools are very limited ."
good,"I liked the people there. Usually the trucks weren't that big, and usually had enough people. Pretty simple job not brain surgery. Open a box and put it on the shelf."
good,Walmart is a big company that's making money. It's a very stressful place to work depend on your dutie specially working at night  they could pay $14. They only give you $11 FIFTY/HR IT'S NOT FAIR
good,"Walmart has made a lot of changes since I started there 20+ years ago.  For a new person, the changes are great and will work to their benefit.  Good pay and benefits"
good,Very tough work  and they treat the employees very poorly  very bad management  skills  use to like working there until we got a new general manager..
good,"Walmart has fixed schedules so you know what to expect with your shifts, Management at all levels are accessible at all levels, and they attempt to show appreciation for staff at all levels."
good,Walmart waa a temporary position but the working environment was a more steady pace.  I would possibly have made a career but the hours I was working were cut down and eventually they just let me go.
good,"Walmart is a good place to find jobs quick. I applied, and within a week had a call for an interview. The work is steady, with busy times around the holidays."
good,Can be a Good place to work for. Very fast paced and always on the go.. changes happen all the time. Good pay. Good lunch periods and breaks. Make alot of friends.
good,I worked two different shifts at wal mart one not being a supervisor and one with so I got to see both sides of the fence and honestly it’s about who you know and how long you’ve been there.
good,"Honestly, I just wanted to use this job to pay for college, and now I am actively seeking a new job that works better with the skills that I am accruing in my classes."
good,One of the few things i did not like was the fact that they wouldmt send anyone to replace me for lunch even after my 5 hours and i will get in trouble for it even after it was their fault.
good,Well as for me skills person who done the dirty work into order the Management and Assistant Managers are very knowledgeable but didn’t promoted me up
good,"Management has too many 'favorites' and often treats the rest of the staff differently. Overall, the training is fair, paid and appears to be adequate for the jobs at hand."
good,Everybody at Walmart is on a different page and don’t know how to communicate to one another. But overall the pay is exceptional and my coworkers where great to be around.
good,"I feel like Walmart is a great job, benefits are good, hours are flexible but the only problem I had was the professionalism of the managers. I felt as if they were playing favoritisms & liked to pick on certain people if their choice & it effected the work flow & how things should be ran."
good,"Started off as a great job, but personally with my management the longer you’re there the more they take advantage of you. The higher up management does not care about you or your life outside of the job."
good,"Its ok to work at it has good benefits, it just doesn't pay overtime and don't give hire raises only 10 cents. Would like to have a higher raise for the hard work I do."
good,I came did my job and left. The co workers & some managers are cool but sometimes it felt like high school. It was a good learning experience for me I’d go back
good,I enjoyed the job itself. Management was not there when you needed them and did not treat everyone the same. I love customer service. I enjoy retail but also like to have family time
good,"Putting stuff on the shelfs, sometimes managment is helpful then other times they can be no help at all because of how to ladder works in the company they need to work on that heavily"
good,"Endless learning opportunities, you must ask the right questions."
good,It was a good learning experience and the work environment was comfortable.   Communication from management was somewhat lacking.  I gained a lot of experience with unloading trucks and stocking shelves
good,Working at Walmart was a good first job but it is not a good full time and or forever job. There are a lot of difficulties at the work place but a good mind set goes along.
good,"You get out what you put in. I rapidly promoted from a CSM, to a DM within 9 months, and then to a ASM role within 6 months. However, as an ASM Walmart owns you, and as a single father with full custody of two boys under the age of 9, there is no work/home life balance. I was basically told that my job was to take priority over my children, and that I should leave my children unattended at home in order to cover someone else's  closing shift."
good,Walmart isn't a bad place to work but it's not great either. It's a great place for your first job but I would not recommend starting a career here. Not a lot of room to advance and the pay isn't the greatest. The people I worked with were friendly but finding a manager could take ages when you needed something. The most enjoyable part was helping customers. Some people were so appreciative and making someone smile was the best part of my day.
good,"Coworkers were what made this job something I could actually stand through. Management was off and on when it came to CSM's and lower on the chain managers but higher ups were able to crackdown on any issue you had, they will work with your hours but no guarantee you'll get them."
good,The work was not always fully taught or explained to a lot of people but they still expected people to know what to do. People constantly complained working there and left very often on their own more then getting fired.
good,Fast pace. Work environment depends on your job. Not enough associates in some areas. Benefits are good. Not recommended for people just wanting a pay check.
good,"As soon as you enter the parking lot there is work already to be done, the flow of costumers is unlimited, employees are mellow, and the management is excellent in providing wisdom."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work with lots of opportunities for advancement.  Work life balance isn't very good.  They do off 401k, investment in company stock, vision, dental and health insurance."
good,"When I first worked there, it was a good place.  But sadly, over time things changed.  If they knew you could work, they'd run you into the ground to cover for those that didn't want to work."
good,"Precisa réspeitar mas os funcionários da mais auxiliar para resolução de oportunidades, e voltar com a política da empresa pois quando tinha uma política dávamos mais resultados."
good,In the time that I worked at walmart I learned a great deal of people skills. And was able to learn a restaurant like environment. I was able to keep up with the fast pace. So overall I actually liked it.
good,I dont recommend walmart as a company to work for.They do not value their employees.They will take advantage of u .Equipment is always broken.Managers do not acknowledge employees You are just an able body at walmart.
good,"Unloads times can be very difficult to meet and the negative consequences are much greater than the positive ones. Your position can be terminated after failing to stock fast enough 3 times. This is compounded by a lack of available equipment as well as some employees not being assigned the same department consistently. Management was very helpful at times, going above and beyond to complete your request or answer the question."
good,"As a recent pharmacy graduate, I can reflect over the past 4 years spent with the company. Retrospectively, I admittedly should have left when I thought it was best to. Which was after about the first quarter spent there during my first year as an intern in 2015. It wasn't all bad, and by the time I was laid off, I wish I hadn't been. "
good,a empresa passa por momento de reestruturação para retomada de competitividade
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is a high pace work environment that allowed few breaks and limited opportunity for growth. Wal-Mart did train their employees well on the machinery used to fulfill the task at hand. In addition, Wal-Mart have a strong culture and is excited to promote themselves. The most enjoyable time at Wal-Mart is the people and their positive attitude in an extreme atmosphere."
good,They are changing a lot of the management position. They make decisions for new associates not the ones that were there years. Got an management position to find out it’s going away.
good,Enjoyed workin there will refer if you don’t have many bills then it will fit but if live alone I don’t recommend working there cost of living in van nuys high
good,I didn't work here for long but i thought things seemed fair for the most part. the points system sucks but i guess its a necessary evil to keep people accountable
good,"Easy work, management works with you as long as you talk to them. Some management have no clue how to do thier jobs. But if you looking for one of those in the meantime jobs this it the one. Lots of discount and chances to get bonus money."
good,A typical day at work is me greeting customers and asking them about their day and trying to give them a great experience whole they are in my life so they will come back. I then sometimes go and stock the things people bring back as returns or push carts
good,"Get rid of the point system."
good,Walmart has a bunch of opportunities to move up in the company and learn a lot of different skills. I would recommend the company to anyone that is motivated and willing to learn.
good,"It's a decent place to work at. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow, but always busy. Starting pay is good, management is okay. There's always a lack of staff, but most are willing to help each other out. Insurance benefits are pretty good. Overall Walmart is 50/50."
good,A good solid company to work for.  The company is not afraid to try new things and new technology.  The company wants to improve it's image of customer service but seems to be hoping new technology will replace human associates working to take care of their customers.
good,They tend to want to switch up your hours last minute sometimes without choice. Managers don’t care about your needs in the environment. The times that are given to complete tasks are very stressful
good,nice place to work  co-workers are good to work with. You meet lots of great customers   who are patient and friendly.I left because you dont get a lot of shifts.
good,This place didnt treat there workers right. FIrst of my manager was a real jerk and made fun of every mistake i made. He made it really hard to go to work every day.
good,Walmart is all about advancement of their employees.  If you work hard every day and do this consistently you stand a better chance of being advanced thru the different levels.  Walmart does most of their advancement thru the people who are currently working their so do you best and you can move up in the Walmart ranks.
good,I enjoy working at walmart i really want to work for a company that values the employees and their family. They are not leiniant about call outs especially dealing with your kids even if you have a doctors note.
good,"Customer service to include fresh areas, Electronics, Sporting goods, etc. Fast paced, all day. Maintain in stock, accounting duties to include getting deposits ready for pick up."
good,"Online Grocery dept is a fast paced job. Days will vary on how busy they are with shopping and delivering.  Management is easy to talk to and get answers.  Paid time off is earned with time on each employee so if you get sick, you have a sick day paid while you recover.  Same with earning time off for anything, with approval from management.  They are very understanding if you have a family member who needs help or your personal time.  Very fun people to work with, and fun work, all work as a team for the store.  The position is a timed position each week on your pace.  Other positions at the store are not timed.  They help you improve yourself on time and experience at the job.  Advancement is available, or you can try another position there with the Human Resource dept to aid with the assignment of the position.  Overall it's a great experience to learn more skills in many different areas.  It's a job position that grows with you and the store."
good,"As a cashier, things are pretty routine and get old fast. Moving to a different department gives you better opportunities and more to do. Flexible with college schedules but the hours were cut and it made working hard with classes to go to."
good,"Some drama between associates and managers, but other than that it was good. The scheduling would be messed up a lot on some days more than others. We would be short on people or have to much."
good,I unloaded the truck. Some days we had two trucks in one day. You have to clean the trucks after you remove all the merchandise. Then we separated it by department and took it to the salesfloor.
good,I have learned as I go no one taught me anything a real relaxing and chilled enviroment some of my managers were cool and others were eeeeeh well I got to say the other ones need to learn some manners
good,Upper managerment has no accountable into the store issues. They will take your days off to prepare for home office visit. They will schedule you to work 6 day without giving it back to you. Salary managers don't get paid any extra for extra days and will get screwed for bad walks and blame for hourly assoicates not coming to work.
good,"A lot of opportunities, very fast paced and stressful, but always being pulled to other areas , opportunities for cross training and advancement.. good pay"
good,It was an okay job. The managers don't seem to care a lot about the employees well being and they are really strict on their rules even if they know you're a good employee and verbally say it.
good,"This job was pretty easy. I had a set schedule, but I asked frequently to be move to days, so I could spend more time with my family. However, they continued to just schedule me for second shift."
good,"Overall, a decent place to work. They allow enough support staff for the pharmacist to complete duties."
good,All of my coworkers were very friendly and helpful in my times of need. The managers did not communicate well with each other. One day I had 3 different managers come to me and asked completely different things of me.
good,They have good management. Some managers would bring personal issues into the work environment. I resigned due to a manager bringing personal life into the work environment.
good,Third shift maintenance.back breaking hard labor.  Responsibilities are more than job description. Advancement depends on availability and who you know.
good,"The associates were friendly. Hours were quite erratic. Optional benefits were great. The worst part was management communication. I did learn, however, the value of a good work ethic."
good,En ese trabajo aprendí a tratar con todo tipo de personas y tuve mayor facilidad de palabra y comunicación
good,I learned at Walmart how to move faster and getting the job done right in one try. These skills helped me a lot because I’m not going to be slow at what I am doing. I’ll be at a constant pace.
good,"Was an okay place to work. Worked really early hours. Had an hour off for lunch and had 2 breaks 15 minutes each. As long as you showed up on time and did what you needed then you have no problems. You had a team, but most was individual work. Everyone was extremely nice and management was helpful."
good,"It wasn't terrible. The job kept you busy and you got an hour lunch break and 2 15 minute breaks. The managers weren't completely awful, the people in your department didn't seem to really care about what you did or who you were, just wanted to get the job done and go home"
good,"Everything was pretty good, nice hours, nice lunch nice work environment. Welcoming, very useful. Overall i loved the job. All i did was unload a truck for3-4 hours then stock"
good,"My co-workers were a joy to engage with and the support management was incredibly amiable and productive. Company policies, however, left much to be desired."
good,An ever changing environment that takes a lot of patience and time management skills to work for this company. I have work at wall mart for 7 years now and it has been an interesting experience.
good,"All the processes change constantly, so you need to keep up with the One Best Way. The management are dealing with changes as well, so they have no time to help you. Some practices aren't entirely fair. To be exact, one person will get in trouble for one thing but other's will be doing the exact same thing, with managements full knowledge of whats going on. Some get promoted because they're buddy buddy with management. It's just an overall strange system. Pay is fair though, and training is constant and fresh. It's nice to have access to all that information, and its easy to use (WalmartOne or The Wire)"
good,Simple and to the point . It was a mass hiring event at that time and if you were willing to work and passed the drug test you were hired . And from there your job performance guided your career with them.
good,I have been employed with this company for over 21 years and on a day to day basis it’s good. Come in overnight to see what sales are and also see what tonight truck has on it and where will I put features at. I also manage the total store at night and just make sure that the store looks great in the morning.
good,"I been with Wal-Mart for 22 years.Worked as a cashier for 2 months, became a customer service manager and then moved up to lead assistant.Also worked in accounting for 2 years."
good,"I took care of customers all the time. I came into contact with many different people. One of the biggest things I learned was they do not have a tolerance for being late, and I also learned how to manage my money. The hardest part was dealing with customers who were different kinds of characters. learning that not every customer who comes in is friendly. I enjoyed just talking to people and mostly getting to know the store,"
good,Management and HR is the worst. Too many cheifs not enough Indians. Great for high school children or older adults who don't mind being be little by management
good,"No review at this time..... Still employed at this time... "
good,A typical day at work is stocking the shelves and helping customers. management is nice and responsive. The hardest part of the job is holiday be of heavy traffic in the store.
good,has a few different managers at different levels and the workplace atmosphere can differ by each ones personality.  at this moment I have a micro-manager who can put too  much stress on those under her. Some other managers do not.  Otherwise it can be a rewarding job.  You can get a small discount on your purchases and you can have access to your money it you use the money store inside.  Convenient.
good,"Start the day by pulling the financial and safety numbers for the morning meeting and to update the daily boards. Join other managers along with associates in the morning meeting. I present safety, shrink, and operational highlights along with hopefully something positive. From there go about my processes like daily reports, audits on managers, tools for tracking operations and sales, and video footage tied into sales transactions or theft. Follow up on any ongoing weekly or monthly safety or fire code and security item. Work with my asset protection associates and help them develop and assist in apprehension processing or contacting local police. Attend one or two conference calls depending on the day. Schedule and meet with contractors to fix anything within the store property that needs attention."
good,Remove trash from shelves and pushing all sellable items to the from for all to see and restocking if necessary. Clean up any spills or damaged products.
good,The work was hard on days that you had no one to help in your area but you could get somethings done to a point  management at sometimes could be hard to work with
good,Walmart is a decent first job or stepping stone for your career. They hire at part time but even then the scheduling can be odd. As a Cart Attendant I personally felt as though we were underpaid for the amount of work we do.
good,"I worked at Walmart for about a year and it was a good tool to widen my customer service background and management experience, it was really fun to work there and the customers were great"
good,A lot of stuff goes on at Walmart a lot of the managers are very understanding and care but the associates do not and such things of that nature. That is my main review on walmart.
good,"I worked for Walmart for 19 Years full-time and enjoyed most of the work I did.  Unfortunately Walmart has changed its focus and no longer needs a Human Resource dept. that is people orientated, so I have had to leave their employ.  But if you are a physical and career orientated person with little family ties, it is a good place to work."
good,"Good environment,good management but most of the time is stressful and you need to be quick.Slow raise is per year.typical day at work is nice just helping customers and zoning your area."
good,they can never keep anyone and management just cant schedule right so typically you can end up working alone most of the time even on busy days so it can wear you down along with being scheduled afternoon shift into morning shift so you get like 4 hours of rest
good,The management are rude and heartless. They pick all young people for management. Skip over the ones that have more experience. I was there a year and a half and took my management and pass. Three younger people that was there for barely 6 months became managers.
good,Walmart is a Good company to work for. They provide food benefits.  The insurance was great. The stock program was wonderful .Walmart's decision to downsize all workers to part time was awful.
good,Great workplace environment as long as you stayed busy. Had a hour long lunch and 2 15 minute breaks. Hardest part about the job was stocking frozen at night.
good,"Competitive fast pace environment that lacked support by the management, management did not help to build teamwork within the environment. No real opportunity for advancement."
good,Working at Walmart was a lot of stress bc someone is always yelling about something wrong you did. A lot of managers were really kind to me but other employees I knew would complain.
good,The work environment is relaxed and not overly strict. Poor management will result in a poor working environment. I had two great managers who made working there much more enjoyable. They ended up accepting higher management positions at different stores and the manager who replaced them didn't know what it took to run our department. We were constantly under scheduled/understaffed.
good,Very clean and happy people they helped whenever I needed it answered any questions I had and wanted to see me move up they are great to they're employees overall a great place to work
good,"The hourly workers are all hard working, yet salary seems to forget how to run the business. They change ideas often, and never leave time to run the processes to have the business run smoothly."
good,Loved working the public .And coworkers. learned to work with people management skills. The hardest part of the job dealing with disgruntled people. And finding A way to please them.the most enjoyable part was being able to please them.
good,"It depends on the store you work at honestly, some managers make work fun and exciting, then there are some like mine where they belittle employees and have hardly any communication."
good,"At this job i learned a great deal from my supervisor about general cleaning and other maintenance duties, however i found that the job can be very stressful, though the other associates were friendly and helpful."
good,"it was mediocre at my walmart (store 1999). it had its ups and its downs, but depended on what area you worked. CAP 2 had it the worst with  how they were treated and even paid for how much work they did. "
good,"I loved my co-workers at Walmart. They were always willing to help--even if it meant going out of their way to help me. The job was difficult though because of long hours on your feet, repetitive motions, and disrespectful customers."
good,Walmart was very good to working just had the time I was taking care of my mother is she a dimension. They did not have consideration. Is was ok associates is nice
good,a typical day at walmart was kinda slow but busy. stock over night. learn where thinfs go and how to use a scanner. management was great. the work place was really dramatized. the hardest part is working alone because some things you need help doing. the best part was being able to socialize with customers and co workers.
good,"I loved working at Walmart, I loved everything about my job except my manager. My manager was not professional and antagonized me CONSTANTLY ! I tried to stay there as long as I could in hopes things would get better but when I finally couldn’t take it anymore I went to the store manager for assistance and his response was “me feeling like they are doing things to me and them actually doing them are two different things” had it not been for this experience. I would be there to this day."
good,Really doesn't feel like the company care about the employees. It's hard to get a day off. Management isn't eager to work with you or help you grow. I recommend it as a short time job.
good,"Management seemed like they were overwhelmed at all times during the day, trying to locate a Customer Service Manager for a customer took a lot of time as they had many responsibilities that took them all over the store and the front was left alone by them often throughout the day. Being in self check-out, it would take them 15 minutes or more to come find me so they could address customer concerns involving price and many customers left without having their concerns addressed. My coworkers were all very friendly and easy to get along with and the CSMs were very friendly too, it just seemed like they were being pulled in all directions all the time."
good,"Wal Mart pays well but you will find that WalMart owns your time. Store Managers abuse their role and rule the stores through fear, making it an impossible place to work. With all the demand and little time and even less payroll you spend a lot of time worrying about if its all worth it."
good,Trabalho a 9 anos na empresa..e no início era muito bom..salário..PPR..abono de verão..aumento de sálario pelo bom trabalho..e agora acabou quase tudo..mas mesmo assim continuo..gosto do meu trabalho..além de ser uma segunda família..
good,"Like most jobs Walmart has its good and bad days, a lot of those depend on management though and how they interact and treat there associates. In my experience I have a good direct manager but not so for the rest of the store and dealing with them is where things turn sour."
good,I enjoyed working for walmart along time ago. It was a nice to work at because the company is unlike any other. If u had to work on holidays the company tried to do little dinners at work to show how much they appreciate us workers. Managers would dress up from time to time to show alittle fun. They did their best to show their appreciation unlike other companies. Out of all the companies if I had to choose to go back to it would be walmart. They actually care about their workers and they are always willing to listen to any problem you would have.
good,Good pay and benefits. 8 hour days You clock out for your hour lunch so it felt like a long day. Not difficult to do any of the work I did stocking and cashier. From personal experience because people from 16-80 can get a job at Walmart it's hard to get along with everyone and there are times people clash but if you're mature enough and have good management to keep everyone a team it's a good job.
good,Walmart need to find better solution when it comes to their employees.  Management need more training on how to treat their employees. Stool for customer service desk.
good,"Provides a great opportunity to learn about working in retail and sales.  Definitely gives experience working with customers.  On the other hand, it can get very busy, making it difficult to handle multiple tasks at once."
good,Walmart is a great place to start out in the working world. I would not make it a career. It’s a fair working environment. Not to much skill is required to work here.
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking with the help of a team some days as other days are more one on one to get the job done. I learned that if you work together, you can accomplish more. Most importantly you can gain some tips from your other associates. The workplace culture is average as any other place. The hardest part of the job is getting everything completed within a certain time frame. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the social interactions with the customers."
good,"If you are looking for a flexible part-time employer this is the place for you. However, management is pretty bad and you will get a lot of BS thrown at you."
good,They raised production on the RSR drivers. I witnessed several accidents from being rushed. They put TVs and dog food on the top shelves. That's wasn't  the brightest idea. I would never buy a tv from Wal-Mart after watching drivers knock them down from the top shelf. I was having nightmares about this place so I left. I really did not feel safe in this environment.
good,I worked in the jewelry or clothing area. I would assist customers. I also answered the phone. I cleaned the areas. I would go up to cashier if they needed help.
good,"A typical day at work would be a few unruly customers here and there. I learned that I have better people skills than I thought. Management could improve, however. They seem to just lay back while the associates are treated unfairly. The only hard part of the job is keeping calm while getting belittled by customers. Although, the pay makes up for any hardships with the starting pay at $11 an hour."
good,"Walmart is a good fast paced place to work at. They always have great customer services there , I always loved enjoying working there. The customers are always the first priority it was a pleasure working there I had so much experience I’ve been taught a lot of great things there."
good,"Walmart is not a hard job it’s easy, management is ok it’s in a great location I live about 10 mins away I’ve learned a lot about Walmart I believe I can work at any Walmart"
good,"My time working for Walmart was ever changing. When I first began the work experience and hopes for advancement were high! After working just a few short months we went into what they called “core hours”. I was hired on as full time working an exact 40 hours (I definitely couldn’t afford any less), but right before thanksgiving the core hours kicked in and everyone was dropped to 14-28 hours. This is difficult for people such as myself who has a family to provide for! Not to mention when I began working there we were on an 8 point system and in feb of 2019 that dropped to a 5 point system. At 5 points you were fired. I attempted a transfer when I was at 3 points and personal told me I couldn’t! That automatically showed me the company was changing too much making it nearly impossible for anyone to keep their position. Management varies per store and per person. I was on the night crew and had two managers. One of which lead by example and worked his tail off while the other could always be found sitting in her office playing on her phone or talking to other associates. I feel the company itself is trying to push full time employees out while hiring on more part timers. They are executing over night crews which is a terrible idea seeing as 1st and 2nd shift never finished their work and was left for us over nights where we could work quickly due to the lack of customers. Walmart; please reconsider your new protocols and business plan!!!"
good,walmart can be a good place to work. the paid time off depends on the hours you work. the salary depends on the department you are hired into. overall the experience at walmart is totally dependent on your experiences
good,Too much work with less pay and few people. The work environment and work cultuture is good. But they think always maximizing profit at the expense of associate!
good,"It was nice coworkers was friendly and nice Marta stop right in front. Managers LOVE me, I learn that you always gotta be humble and real talkative. Always stay constant at trying get to the top."
good,"The job isn't so bad, I am just ready to move on. Some times it was stressful, but that comes with the territory. Some days were better than others. The best part of the job is the people, the worst part of the job, customers coming in and talking down at you."
good,The experience can very greatly from store to store based on the district and store management team. I have worked at multiple locations with wal Mart and have had some great experiences and some that were less motivating. My over all experience has been Good. i had the need to transfer acroos country for family needs and the company was very accomidating.
good,"Wasnt fairly managed.  Work enviroment was dangerous with old equipment .  I learned different departments that were intersting."
good,"Easy shifts, during rush periods it can be hectic, otherwise on down periods, it is very boring. Management was decent, depending on your department. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the public. Most enjoyable part was working in the electronic's department."
good,Fast pace and very hard physical work. Little acknowledgement for going above and beyond expectations. Very hot temperatures during summer months with overtime during Christmas season .
good,It had been okay working for this company there are some things that could change about this company.  At first it was wonderful but it’s not always equal there
good,Nothing more to say. The company is going through changes that leave some out of the new program. All positions are changing and most have to reapply for the current jobs they already have. There seem to be a lot of politics involved in where people are going to be in the Markets.
good,"I had taken a pay cut to come to work with Walmart as apart of their management team, in hopes of less stress. After employment, I had no training as was promised by my wellness manager, and my department was very short staffed. I didn’t know what the procedures were for hiring and had to figure out department operations and hiring procedures on my own. First 3 months were very frustrating before getting help. It did get better after I got help. By then I was over the frustration and decided to move on."
good,"You willing some great fellow employees, and managers. Hours are really the main concern and problem you will encounter. In all the customers you encounter will be a mix variety."
good,Company is too large and needs to communicate better.  Training is poor.  Hard to advance even though you are highly qualified.  Open door policy is a plus and flex schedule is rewarding.
good,Wasn't always bad. I loved my coworkers and the job until they started to change everything. I left because I was offered a better opportunity. They need to pay more money!
good,"I don’t mind working at Walmart, the pay is decent and you can meet some great people. Always something to be done so work isn’t hard to find around there."
good,Walmart is so ghetto u can't even go shopping or work without someone doing the most unnecessary stuff some of the staff is cool some is mess starters and attention seeking not the place for me
good,"Good place to work , Great place to learn skills. Was given some challenging task but completed them in a timely manner. Even when not treated right by management I still worked to my highest potential"
good,All jobs are what an individual chooses to make it. Take the situation you’re in and make the best of it. Always stay positive and you will have a positive outcome.
good,"I want to work in a position where i can actually say i enjoy my job and not dread coming in everyday. If i have the opportunity to be passionate about a certain position, i will take it without a doubt."
good,"Great for students, flexible hours and availability that fits well with student schedules"
good,"No comments, you would have to work there to be able to relate.  Go apply as a manager their is no life balance. Their is no weekend rotation at it should be with managers. And sometimes 6 days which gives you no time to your family."
good,Was a great place to work at times learn a lot bout customer services loved helping the customers and seeing the smile I put on there faces management did there best to help us with what we need to complete our task for the day
good,At the moment we are with minimal crew most days and way under staffed for cashiers. Our previous Manager was fired so we are still waiting for the new manager to start when ever that happens. We need more help...
good,"The people were awesome, very caring and like family.  Too many managers telling you what to do.  Fast paced and very stressful.  Pay was not enough for work that I did, but there has been an improvement in that area since I quit.  Still wouldn’t want to go back unless I really had too."
good,"Fairly good company to work for. Employee opinions do not really seem to matter though. Very strict on attendance. Non forgiving in any aspect. If you do your job right, make the required production and never call out you will not have any problems there."
good,"Walmart seems like a friendly environment at first look, it seems like one big family, but once you try and work for the company you see the true colors behind it all. Constant changes with doesnt policies that make them have a big loss of employees."
good,"I have rarely gone through a week at Walmart without encountering or hearing about a technical issue with the cashier registers or self-checkout.  The managers also take a long time to respond when their help is needed because they are busy doing cashier work.  Apparently, the front-end is very understaffed."
good,"Easily learned and replicated job tasks are what I learned while at Walmart. While nothing was too challenging, every day more or less presented different obstacles. Customer service was the main obstacle to overcome. Every engagement with a customer can be different so you have to adapt to the situations that present themselves."
good,Management misuses their authority on employees they dont like and have too much favoritism over most that just waste time and dont care about the customers....
good,Working at Walmart was a good start for me in retail because while I was outside pushing carts I still had customers asking me about the prices of things and I had to figure them out any time I walked inside of the store.
good,A typical day at work here requires you to juggle countless customers in a rapid time period. Meeting the new people is pleasurable but you are required to have good people skills through it all
good,"When i worked at walmart some of the other workers were really nice and others were not so nice.The managers the at walmart could not agree on any thing but there were at least 3 managers that new what they were doing.The store manager comes across as friendly but thats only if your a customer shes not that way way works with some of the works .at least not the "
good,"I liked some of my coworkers and the managers were ok, albeit douches sometimes. The pay was decent for retail, and I liked already being in store after I got my check."
good,good place to work the work load varies. the management is ok they have their favorites just like another job.also there clicks so be prepared its just like high school over again you just get paid to attend
good,"Working at Walmart has been so so. That's the best rating I can give Walmart after 16+ years. It was relaxed at first, but several years later, it becomes more rigid with a new organizational system and structure. Even the managers at the store I've worked at has treated associates like they are slaves of convenience. Treating them like dice at a craps table, rather than partners. "
good,"Constant customer interaction, heavy lifting, dealing with coworkers, taking directions from management, and being on your feet all day are things you have to deal with daily.  It is hot in the summer and cold in the winter.  At times it feels like the work is never ending and can feel overwhelming most days."
good,"It was ok, Not a top notch work envioermrnt. very heavy work accompanied with lots of issues such as poor customer service, employee retention (high turn over) and poor management."
good,The job was very fast- paced. It allowed me to gain lots of customer service experience and time management. Overall it was a very useful and interesting job.
good,Good for someone who wants a career at Walmart and who is looking to be there 24/7 it’s mostly a full time job because you rarely get time off other than that it’s good
good,"very high to extreme pace work environment.  This place runs on the life boat drill.  Top 10 percent get a raise, bottom 10% get fired, everybody in the middle gets to keep their job.  Good luck."
good,I had to keep the produce department up to standards with cleaning and suppling the product for the customer. Being able to keep the department stocked and keeping the customer happy
good,"i worked in the back room which isnt fun at all, they had forgotten i was in the milk cooler a couple times which didn't help my morale or will to work."
good,Eu gostei muito de trabalhar la pois me deram muitas oportunidade  na empresa
good,Buena experiencia laboral debido a que logré aprender sobre el oficio todo lo que necesite para convertirme en un técnico del área de servicios.......
good,I liked working there.  The job was mixed between fast and slow.  The managers were all different rules never followed. Working extra hours was never open to do so.
good,"It is a fun environment.  However, there are ones at the front-end that should not be there because of their work ethic is poor. CSMs are time on their response to associates questions and the good CSMs are being overwork because of the ones that disappear when they are needed most"
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for for the most part. They have good pay. Most of the managers are willing to work with your schedule. If you're a student looking for a flexible job with decent pay, Walmart is the job for you."
good,I've worked for Walmart now 2 different times. Once right after Sam Walton and the last 14yrs. There was more staffing before then there is now. The expectations that are put on different job areas are not possible with inadequate staffing. Our store usually pulled through. Moral overall is not the best store/company wide.
good,"The best part of the job was working with customers in need, providing them a service that they simply couldn't do without. It was helping the old woman who didn't know how to use a phone contact a loved one, it was showing people that one small act of kindness can truly make someones day."
good,"Productivity expectations were high. If you didn't get good freight your whole shift, it was impossible to meet production and it didn't matter that you worked hard the whole time. If you were family or good friends with management, you were given better treatment. You never knew week to week if you had to work OT on the weekends until Thurs or Friday and if you were 1st shift, OT was night shift on weekends. They don't tell you that in orientation! I liked working 4 straight 10 hour days, pay and benefits were good."
good,I have worked at Walmart for 6 years. One of the biggest issues i have is management not taking associate’s concerns seriously. If they did things would get resolved and associates would feel more valued as employees. My other concern is always being short staffed and thinking everything will get done correctly and in a timely manner.
good,Management is great! I have learned to work in a fast pace environment and learned to multi task. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with the customers and making them happy
good,"I’ve been at Walmart 10 yrs, and have for the most part enjoyed the positions I have been in! "
good,Walmart is a good place to work except you are always hearing about job elimination so the stress is way up there. Currently they are working on eliminating many assistant managers so I feel there is no job security. However if you keep your management job the benefits are excellent.
good,sometimes as a cashier you have to remind the CSM to give you your lunch break. It is almost like you are chained to the register. There is no real freedom when you are a cashier.
good,The work place can be very difficult and very fast paced. The workers there can be great to work with. The managers can be the hardest people to work with.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work, it was relaxed...quick paced, you worked at your speed. But you still had to get the job done at a decent time. I liked that they trusted us."
good,"As CSM  is was the front end management you were always running around. Good weight lose. Cashiering was fun too, you really got to know the cashier's better. Being on their level which came a lot respect."
good,I feel I need a job change because I know I could do slot better in a company that's organized that have better management I feel slot of people really need training in customer service
good,Constantly updating policies and routines to become more efficient with less people.  Management has a tendency to be inconsistent and forgetful when dealing with employees.
good,Training was excellent. They also allow you to be independent and productive on your own. The benefits are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone who is searching for the benefits. I am not for sure if they have improved their pay rate. I would hope so.
good,"Walmart is a business concerned with customer satisfaction, but not necessarily employees. I was shifted to close and open the next day so I had little time to rest. I worked outside in high heat and got in trouble for trying to cool off or refill my water. Management was not great and talked to my shift manager about my schedule and got blown off. The company as a whole was okay, but most employees didn’t care about their jobs."
good,It was a interesting place to work for got to meet new people each day and was able to learn basic skills and how to talk and count money also life skills
good,"Great experience, most difficult of job would be dealing with customers but you get the hang of it, breaks are provided promptly and work place environment is good."
good,Walmart is a fair employer if you are a hard worker management could be better to help boost employee morale. Walmart continues to evolve to more of an online business this eliminating a lot of jobs causing job losses itheir retail stores
good,I enjoyed my job at Walmart I was there for 12 years then was displaced. There are so many changes in place and more yet to come. I've also heard from several employees
good,It was not a hard job but still very fast-paced. I guess it was a bit flexible with hours. I did get lots of good training. They consistently retrained for certain safety precautions. They always let you know about changesin the company.
good,"Personally it was just kind of heartbreaking, learning that to advance in the company, you essentially just had to know people, or just suck up to people, it’s more or less people let their friends advance and leave others behind even through the work they do."
good,"You are getting no help from management, no support to put away freight unless your one of the select few. And you are expected to fit eighty hours of work into forty."
good,Benefits are okaii work can be hard and stressful because of poor management they want you to work several.Areas with no help they can have nasty attitudes and mistreat and lie to workers about pay and promotions just to get you tondo more work
good,walmart was an amazing first place of employment and taught me most of the costumer skills i have today as well as time management with multiple tasks
good,"After working there for the four months prior to my injury, I was highly content with the people I worked with, and the area I was located at. However, after the first month, I was constantly being located to different departments and outside to pull in carts, which ultimately led to my knee being injured."
good,"The work at Walmart wasn’t bad at all. The pay was excellent. The hours was good. The management wasn’t good at all, they had there people pick. No advanced at all."
good,"Walmart has a good foundation. However the oversight to make sure the basic beliefs are practiced is missing. "
good,"Typical day was manager meeting in the AM to go over numbers, then to our departments to assign task for the day.  As well, customer service calls were handle by myself and my colleagues. We were often understaffed, but I made things happen and ensured customers were happy and task accomplished."
good,It’s an ok environment. Not everybody is friendly and not too much interaction with others unless you’re in the same department. Management interaction is little to none and overall just a bad place to work.
good,"I enjoyed working with the other lube techs was give the tasked the new employees. I worked there for a year and never had a write and after was backing out a co-worker out of the garage he hit a parked delivery truck he understandably got fired but, I got a double write up for not telling him it was there. there was other issues that made me leave in the end but, don't like talking negative and in the long run I guess the grass wasn't as greener on the other side."
good,"The typical day consisted of engaging in group stretching and a little speech. Afterwards we went to the computer to see where we were placed for the day. The management of the workplace needed work because one shift's unorganized work caused delays for our shift. This made the managers (four managers at that time) stressed and had to stay late. Since they did not want to stay late, they tried to push us harder. I learned how to work efficiently and in a timely manner. My favorite part of the job was the satisfaction of completing my work and being able to help others."
good,It was a good place to work and it was a on going movement were you did not have much time to stop because helping customers and stockings shelf's you all ways keep you really busy doing your shift working there for the company
good,"Depends on the store you work at, first management crew was great, they moved on to bigger things, and now were stuck with the 3 stooges. The pros i would say are better pay than most, and if you truly excel at your job, advancement isn't impossible. Benefits aren't the best, not until you advance up the ladder more, which sucks in my opinion. You need thick skin period, you will see first hand what the term moron really means, and that covers from the customers you'll encounter, to management you'll have to deal with, to the very people you work with and have to see everyday."
good,Walmart is okay to start out for a first time job. It is a great chance you can move up in the company. Good benefits. Personally I would Not go back to the company just because management was a pain.
good,My first real job was working for the Walmart company and getting a chance to really understand what it means to provide proper customer service no matter what. I was trained by talented managers who knew how to help new workers develop into strong capable workers. For many years I had the chance to work for Walmart both full time and part time and both times they always accommodated my needs within reason.
good,I usually start my day at 4am get my equipment get my cart ready and start picking items that are dropped into our system. From my point on management some know what they are doing and how to do it they have been with the company the longest as for the others they do things in their own way thinking its better for the company. the hardest part of the job is the management your working on a project one manager says change it the other says put it back sometimes it can get overwhelming with freight and trying to keep up with no help just doing projects on your own. The most enjoyable part of it is your co-workers you can help each other with the projects and freight when needed but most of the time it depends on who is at your store that day some days are better then others but it usually is not all that bad depending on the day.
good,managers are nice and good to work with but corporate rules and policies are constantly changing making it harder to actually do your job proficiently
good,"The managers were pretty decent. One of them wasn’t great but another one was extremely nice and encouraging. 401k plan, options to buy stock after working for a certain period of time. Only issue I had while working there is I was never given a store tour, which is pretty important when it’s part of your job to help with customer carry-outs. For example, I needed to go to where the grills were being sold at once in order to help load a grill up for a customer, and I wondered around the place for 10 minutes desperately trying to find where the grills were at. It was embarrassing. But that’s what happens when they don’t give you a store tour and you have no idea where specific things are. Beyond that, they start people above minimum wage and they offer flexible hours."
good,"Walmart was a great learning experience, I learned how to stock, use cleaning machines, and how to do mods. Walmart has great benefits that helped me a lot"
good,"I like my job, but I really need a part time, I have other things to do and my full time schedule at Walmart just doesn’t work me."
good,"Start in the morning till lunchtime"
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you are a High School / College Student. They are flexible with school schedules and life schedules as long as you put in the time off request in advance. Would recommend for part time work as well."
good,"Is a great place to start working or if you ever run out of job options. They’re always taking new people more often than not. But some Walmart’s are worse than others, keep that in mind."
good,"This environment has room to improve and can be helpful to use associate and management ideas.  The thing that makes a business successful is the people behind the scenes, remember them."
good,very repative day in and day out i learned how to deal with a mass amount of people all the time management was poor but understanable considering the age group of managers. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a smile on someones face  that you put up there.
good,Working at walmart was okay. The people were amazing and I enjoyed the management. They were easy to approach and we're very social. The pay was barely minimum wage and lack of advancement was very concerning.
good,"I am someone that has never been good at sales, so when I got accepted in night crew I was very happy. I slowly learned its nearly impossible to work nights with a toddler, especially because I was a single mother at the time. "
good,"Long days, breaks are basically shortened, once you max out the cost of living raises do not meet the cost of living. Mandatory overtime during summer and holidays"
good,Was a learning experience enjoyed the work as a customer services/money center. Good people to work with is hard to come by but there it was an easy and good experience.
good,"Managers are very inconsistent, take their time to help customers. Never work around school schedule prefers you to figure it out. And the pay is absolutely terrible seeing that Walmart is a growing company."
good,"Working at Walmart was not hard at all, the issue came in when it was time to deal with management and rude and annoying customers. After a while, it can become wearing on your mental."
good,"As a customer service manager, there was no training offered. Everything was learned on-the-job. Once you get the hang of the daily responsibilities it was enjoyable. Good coworkers."
good,Very good work environment. Friendly and welcoming managers who did not micromanage you. Very flexible with the work hours and you feel like you belong in a team.
good,Not the best place to work so managers are very rude not all of them tho some was really nice and they give too much of a work load sometimes so it can be stressful
good,I started at Walmart as a CAP 1 and 3 months into my time there I was promoted to dry grocery department manager. I was never trained correctly on how to do that job correctly which lead to overwhelming stress so I stepped down for my own health.
good,Job was simple and paid fairly. I personally didnt have high expectations for Walmart but it was a nice side job. The best thing I liked working there was the breaks being sufficient.
good,"Very long hours , you never really know when you’ll get off because you don’t have a set schedule. Sometimes I went in at 3:30 in the morning and didn’t leave until 10:00 that night you just never know."
good,Working retail is never really a fun job but if you need part time work and are younger it has decent starting pay. They can stick you with some bad hours depending on what area you're in.
good,"It's an okay place to work. There's no guarantee of job security, due to all the rapid changes. It depends on the store what kind of work environment it is. It's dog-eat-dog when it comes to climbing the corporate ladder. As a supervisor, I always seemed to lack people to supervise, either because of vacant positions or people calling off for the day."
good,The work load asked and required exceeds what they initially ask and put more on your plate as you go. Management ignores request for help. But have no problem taking myself to help others
good,"El ambiente laboral era algo tóxico que llegaba a ser incómodo, debido a que no todas mis compañeras o supervisoras se llevaban bien."
good,depending on what manager you work with will make or break your day some will make time for you others will not. some managers do not have respect for their employees
good,"I really enjoyed my job while i worked there. Only problem i had was some management issues. I was fired over the phone while be rushed to the emergency room. I was given 3 points for snow days that were supposed to be covered, that management told me was covered. I was verbally abused at work, while my personal information was being spread to other workers in the back room without my permission on days i was not even working. Any of the good managers we had, even quit. We only had two managers left when i got fired wrongfully. The district manager refused to help anybody with anything. Management would make employees cry and force them to do things not under their job description. There was a cockroach infestation where I worked and they refused to fix the problem. Expired food was always being sold and the supervisor for the food department refused to remove the expired food. We received many customer complaints almost daily. A co-worker of mine received an injury on the job and they refused to let her write an incident report. Then proceeded to force her to work with stocking carts that weight more than twice her own weight, while on crutches from the work related injury. When i was fired, i filed a report for everything that happened, and corporate treated me just as badly. I hope one day all these problems are fixed and people get the justice they deserve."
good,Good people to work with/good wages and benefits/good hours of work/strong support culture/fairness to equal opportunities for employees/unfortunately an office restructure ended my employment
good,Have to get seniority first (6 months of being there at least). When there is no more online Grocery orders to fill they make you help them stock or help with anything else they choose.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart, I just didn't like how uncooperative the managers were about fixing my shift hours. On the bright side, Walmart provides great benefits for their employees."
good,Great learning environment and very diverse with the types of people that worked there.  I would recommend anyone starting off as an optician to start at Walmart.
good,Management is slow and there is less associate in the store and more work to get done. Worst of all is we all get less paid for what we have to work hard.
good,"Has it perks, but can be very stressful dealing with management and customers on a daily basis. Has it perks, like receiving a discount card after your probation period."
good,"Friendly Co-Workers, clean and friendly work environment. Customer service was very easy. Had most needed equipment. Management  was present when needed at a fair paste."
good,Walmart is decent especially if you like talking to other people some of the employees were nice and lots of the customers like to talk. Although if you are not used to fast paced it would probably not be a place for you
good,"Set up the backroom to make space for the items and pallets being unloaded from the trucks. Unload 2-3 trucks a day and have to stock the items as well. Provide customer service if one needs assistance in receiving an item. You receive two 15 minute breaks, a one hour lunch break, and have to be back on time before your supervisor looks for you."
good,It was a decent place to work. I was young and unappreciative. My managers where great and coworkers where very nice. It was a fun atmosphere to work in.
good,My managers were very understanding. I was pregnant while working there and they really made sure I was comfortable. If I needed a break to get water or anything they understood. I loved my managers.
good,Very slow and relaxing. Always was something to do. Also very friendly environment. A lot of kind people. You also had someone around every corner that you could talk to.
good,"It’s is a good place to work they have pretty good benefits, the associates are pretty helpful.Its needs improvements in management area but what place doesn’t."
good,"This job in not physically strenuous but mentally it is. There are sales goal that you have to meet every week and I understand that completely. What makes you stressed is that if you don't meet those goals your hours are cut drastically even if you all are going out into the public promoting the business and doing health events. Market still blames you and tells you consistently that you are not doing enough. It is also stressing when you are constantly learning that there are new optical businesses opening around you. Also, the golden rule of Walmart ""The Customer is Always Right"". Most of the time they are not but we have to take a lot of insults because we cannot deny the customer/patient.  The co-workers are great."
good,"Depending on upper management if they want you to advance or put a inexperienced buddy in. Most evaluations are pre-script, just employee name is changed."
good,"Walmart is a good family oriented work environment.they will work with you if you need time off for family business, or medical reasonsthey made it easy for me to stay for as long as I did"
good,"I was told there would always be something to do but once our friers broke, that became a lie. Without the hot bar, all we could do is clean, and once we finished the deep cleaning, we had nothing to do. And it was like this for over a month. I would close almost every night and the amount of stuff needed to be done couldn't be stretched long enough. So for a large part of the day, we would pretty much just be standing around waiting for a customer. And of corse, we got in trouble even though all the managers knew the hot bar was our biggest seller, and it was broken. It was still broken when I got let go, so I just wish my old coworkers well and hope for the best."
good,"The atmosphere is the biggest issue with this job. I understand jobs don't need to be fun, but it certainly is a bonus. My role in the store was consistent and there was always a job to do. It was nice, yet intimidating because not matter what I did I could never say ""I'm done."" There was no foreseeable goal."
good,"Walmart is sometimes a great place to work, depends on who's in charge. A lot of managers really not interested in us unless its something they don't feel doing."
good,Walmart is a nice place to work if you can get hours. It has a nice management and the coworkers are great. You also get a 10 percent discount on certain items in the store and online.
good,"at my store specifically, management was a joke, rules were lax, and you got blamed for everything. hours got cut for no reason, and if you weren't a friend of a manager, you didn't move up."
good,It is a fast paced environment that was needed for me to sharpen my time management skills. I learned to be patient with irrational customers while maintaining my composure.
good,"Working at Walmart was okay, I enjoyed cashiering there, the most because it was a 24 hr store, they got you in and out. The breaks were great, two fifteen minutes 30-hour depending on how long your shift was."
good,"Ellos me dieron mi primera oportunidad laborar la cual agradezco. Sin embargo, el salario era muy pobre. "
good,I enjoy working with the associates at Walmart and I do my job very well but it has lacked decent help for a long time. I can handle most anything that is put on me but sometimes gets to be a little much without the proper help
good,I love my place of  employment.  I love the  atmosphere .i love my co workers this is a great place too work long term. Great benefits . Great 401 plan
good,"Department manager and bay managers didn't have much knowledge on vehicles.  most of the time the environment was relaxed, did have some hectic days when short handed"
good,It was a lot of work. You had to assist in your department as well as others. If you cant be on your feet for an extended period of time it is not for you.
good,Pouco atraente o pacote de beneficios oferecido pela empresa.
good,"Walmart is overall what you would expect. If you shop there you have a pretty good idea of what it would be like as a worker, except you're always on your feet and it isn't as much fun."
good,I enjoyed working for walmart you have the good and bad customers but just seeing them smile because you helped them made me feel good but as far as management they were horrible not on same page basically lack of communication
good,Most of the people i worked with were rude. There was a lot of drama that went on between coworkers. It honestly wasn't a good work environment. It is interesting to learn about different medications.
good,Management changed constantly but coworkers stayed consistent and were great to work with. Closing duties are the worst tho management threw everything on the closers! Tip: say u can’t close on ur availability
good,I have been with the company for over 5 years and they have been worked with my school schedule over the years. Some of the management team are nice and then there are few that I transferred departments in order to get away from them. I now work in the pharmacy as a technician. I work hands on with the pharmacist and it is a really good experience. In the past I have also been a manager of customer service for over 2 years.
good,Getting full-time hours is nearly impossible. The pay was decent. Benefits are good BUT do not start until 12 months of service. When I left for medical reasons at 10 months...things didn't pan out
good,It can be very stressful at times but what job isn't? Co workers can be friendly/competitive and its a privilege to work with walmart company since its very demanding.
good,The problem is not having the people in department to get the job task of a department manager done in 8hrs .  The upper management pushes you beyond you pushing yourself to complete your list of task they have given you through out the day.
good,decent place to work for. other employees are nice. Management is easy to talk to. Ok benefits package. flexible schedules. paid time off. ten percent discount on walmart purchases.
good,"Working at Walmart was like working with family, we were all very close and very productive, although much of the time the staff was underappreciated, which cause negative feelings."
good,"my days at work for the most part were good i enjoyed seeing my coworkers everyday and i loved interacting with the customers"
good,"It’s a hot ware house whatever the weather is outside it what it’s going to be inside, fast paced and friendly environment. My experience at Walmart was a good one"
good,i worked for walmart for many years at first it was a great place to work but as time went on and things changed so much now there is no room to even get sick without being told about the point system
good,"I loved working there it was fun and something I’ve always wanted to do! "
good,"Communication among employees, busy days, multi-tasking, fast paced work that includes keeping up with customer's orders. Learning to communicate and handle stressful situations with the customer. The most enjoyable part was problem solving"
good,Walmart offers employees a large amount of benefits at a good price.  Promotes within and encourages a Team building environment.  Hard work pays off!
good,"Walmart was a decent company to work with because they provide many benefits, and the hours are variable. Very strict management but not too controlling. Moderate place to work. Days can be very slow or very fast."
good,It was okay vety fast pace always goung goof lunch vreaks no drama members were all nice very helpful and very minding best community eveyone was nice and very welcoming
good,"They had awesome benefits and insurance. I felt their customer service managers, lacked the drive and dedication to their positions to help their associates succeed fully."
good,I have learned so much from being with this company for 14 years.  The benefits are great for my family.  I love what I do and Iam good at it.  However scheduling is what has me seeking elsewhere in hopes that I find a company that allows me to have a consistent schedule for my family structure.  I can't raise my children (10 and 3) the way i feel they need with the schedule that Walmart has given me.  I stepped down after 6 years of being salary to be a mom to my youngest and now its not much better.  No homelife structure.
good,One of those places you work that would replace you the next week if you died . Management is very cliquey however employees get along like a workplace family which was honestly the reason behind why I stayed for almost a year .
good,Wal-Mart is a decent store to work at with decent pay and wages but there are times where management could have been better. The stress can be unnerving some days depending on the day and often than not it's as if the day drags on with no end in sight. Although the friendly associates will sometimes make the days pick up a little faster. Customers as well can have an impact on the day. Wal Mart just recently underwent a new system and attendance policy so make sure to review that closely as well.
good,At Walmart you rely so heavily on your coworkers. Teamwork is the only way to be successful here. Promotions can be tricky it really depends on who your manager is and how much they are willing to teach you. I happened to be very lucky and was promoted twice in 6 months.
good,Walmart has a great culture and great opportunities if is run like a Walmart but the Hesperia location these past months is not close to being run as a Walmart. Most of the Management team  that is recent were less knowledgeable that my training as a supervisor is a shame people get moved up with lack of skills or integrity but not the talent that have portfolios to back them up
good,I have work at Walmart for two years and like the law suits they had have it's the same here employees being setup for failure and managers not taking job serious
good,"For the first 2 1/2 years I worked at walmart as a cashier from (2014-2016) I enjoyed it, I had funny and cool coworkers along with some nice managers which made working there good regardless of some customers. Then towards ending of 2016 to beginning 2017 when new management came everything went down hill, walmart started to change some of their policies from attendance, uniforms, cutting hours. But working where you don’t speak or understand spanish is difficult! They were rude and disrespectful and some of the managers had favoritism towards some of the employees. Certain holidays or days they would feed us food, desserts and treats. Depending on the manager if you need to change your schedule or get days off you can. When it came to holidays is when you can take advantage of overtime or times when the store was pack with customers. Being a cashier was stressful at times when the lines was super long, customers would bring up things that didn’t have a price tag on it, customers card didn’t work, or saw a different price for an item which had to get approval from the csm. When the lines were long was a hard tasks when you needed management where there were sometimes like 2 available and like 5 cashiers flashing their light. The occurrences for late or no show was I think 9 and they weren’t so hard on you. Fast paced but it helped time go by quick only if you had straight customers coming through your line. Sometimes having a long line made you take your breaks or lunch a little late"
good,"For the most part it's fine. However, management never agrees with itself and the customers will suck the life out of you. It's the type of job you like at first, then before you know it you are begging to be let go."
good,This was my first job. Truly I learned I learned  a lot. Wish I was trained properly  had to learn on the job. Then management has a high turnover rate
good,Una empresa internacional en la cual adquieres muchos conocimientos y experiencia en el área de Retal. Sin embargo a nivel gerencia es excesiva las horas de trabajo y falta mucho equilibrio entre varias da laboral y personal.
good,The people are great but the manager screamed a lot. It's a good job for its benefits. I learned how to work with tools and it was a bit of good exercise too.
good,"Everything was going great until they decided to switch the managers, the new managers for fulfillment didn't know what they were even doing and it became frustrating when they would blame the employees for not completing the jobs on time, they should have taken a better initiative and should have actually helped the team instead of bossing them around, and the new store manager has a disgusting attitude, feeling very entitled to everything, treating most of her employees as if they were peasants"
good,Management needed some serious readjustment . Everything was perfect until we switched store managers. She was good at being a manager but would only listen to her own opinion
good,Nice people to meet while working there. Low management. Great place to start your first job at. Paid very well depending on your position. Very competitive.
good,I've been working at Walmart for about 7 months and I need a new job because they started cutting my hours and I need the money to live on and it didn't suit my needs
good,"Walmart is a very strong company that has its eyes set on an enduring future. With that, Mgmt gets paid well, but treated rather poorly in my experience. They are expected to work long hours, manage operations over large areas, and stay current on all company initiatives--which is to be expected of any mgnt role. What makes it unbearable is the language. No one will admit it, but there is a lot of fear-based language and subtle threats directed at mgmt. It the implicit ""or else"" clause, and sometimes blatant ""career-decision"" verbiage that keeps mgmt so frantic. Everything is a ""Big Deal"" to the extent that a lot of times work goes home with you. Many ASMs confess to developing anxiety and other health issues ."
good,"The managers are a little rude and their expectations are a off compared to the work placement. Overall, I did learn a lot by interacting with customers and helping others."
good,"Aunque las políticas de cultura son muy claras, los líderes las corrompen y hacen difícil el ambiente de trabajo"
good,"Greedy company, this multi-million company can definitely pay more to their employees, and they expect too much from us too much work and to many bosses."
good,"A typical day at work is usually very busy always something to do or get done, always doing your best to provide the best customer service you could while still getting all the freight to the sales floor and worked"
good,"alright  but the way management take to you was just horrible and the way the customer behave was just sickening, you really learn a lot by just watch how people act when they believe there above the people around them. p.s as cap 2 you do a lot of other peoples work"
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed my time with the company. The training courses got a bit tedious, and the CBLs seemed never ending, but honestly, it was the staff that made the job anyway. I loved my ASMs and the associates I worked with were like family. Sure it got cliuqy, but that happens everywhere."
good,co-workers  were great to work with. Only problem was not a set work schedule.  Most of time customers were great and management was always available for assistance
good,"Constant customer service "
good,"Overall Walmart is a good place to work although that varies from store to store with management."
good,Working for Walmart was a great learning experience. There are some managers that shouldn’t be a manager and some that are the best. I’m glad I got to experience working for Walmart it taught me how to be a manager
good,"Alot of the managers are unorganized, customers are disrespecful alos. I feel the pay coming in should be higher , and also for the price there insurance is bad.."
good,"Working night-shift as a Stock Associate, was very stressful. If you had experience in customer service, it would be easier to some. As someone that never worked in a grocery store before, it was overwhelming at times. It's hard work too because you have to pull the crate of products to your designated aisle, distribute the boxes to each section of the aisle, and stock the shelves. What stresses me out is trying to finish at a certain time that the supervisor wants you to finish."
good,"Between department disorganization, lack luster work ethic from team members, and constant technical malfunctions the typical day at work could be stressful. I learned better organizational, and time management skills. This job also helped me improve my teamwork skills because it was a requirement. The workplace culture was sometimes competitive and hostile, with co-workers constantly being pulled aside by management to discuss disputes."
good,"Really,  Walmart is not a bad place to work for, it's just the red tape involved with everything. It is such a big company. There's so many rules it took a week to go through orientation and they actually taught you how to sweep. But I understand.  For alot of kids it's her first job. I really have no complaints. Wally world is a good place to work. Black Friday is something to behold, holy moly."
good,"poor management. refuse to accept doctors notes. you will get occurrences for calling in, even if you’re sick. no absence is excusable don’t care about employees"
good,Productive and professional work environment. Gives you the ability to work on communication skills. The department is serious about getting the job done in a timely matter
good,Working at Walmart wasn't a very good experience. I was a part time sales associate and was only given 4 hours per day. The management didn't listen to feedback at all and for some of my full time colleagues there was no room for advancement
good,"Can be a fun place to work if you can get along with coworkers and great way to help out customers and gain the customer service experience, good work place"
good,"I would assist customers in the electronic department by activating new phones, repairing service and directing customer movement. The job taught me a lot of problem solving when helping customers with their phones. It was an easy going environment with lots of opportunity."
good,They discriminate me when I wanted to talk alone with my store manager but overall it’s a good place for catch up your first job experience. They have a lot of flexibility.
good,"Cashiering or having to collect garbage/ extra hangers or helping check nightly money amounts."
good,"It use to be a good company to work for, but has been steadily going down hill over the last few years. "
good,I liked helping the customers and working with my coworkers ...its always busy ...they always had a problem with letting you go home if you were sick on certain days ..holidays especially everyone has to work no matter what lol
good,I enjoy working in the pharmacy and helping customers. The management is helping and friendly. The money is not enough though. Kroll system is brilliant.
good,typical we throe 2300 hundred truck but i make it fun with my vibe and things so everybody there was cool i liked it i just think the management wasnt on the same page they was not working together
good,"Walmart uses time and money to educate the pharmacists on changes and requirements. Walmart is a large company.  With that being said, the managers must show a caring side that a large company cannot."
good,I honestly feel that Walmart is really unprofessional with poor management. Management played favoritism with employees and were unprofessional with poor leadership skills.
good,"Chegava reunia meus funcionários que eu liderava para fazer uma reunião para passar oque tinha que fazer no dia, passava as metas de venda as quebras o estoque oque estava vendendo mais."
good,"The title says it all."
good,There are advancement opportunities but the wage scale is below cost of living until you do make it in management. Overly demanding considering the wages.
good,"My store manager was excellent. However, the new market manager is a joke. Surprisingly good benefits. Long hours every day and week you work. Not exactly rewarding emotionally. Your homelife will most likely suffer.  And the longer I work here the more I hear about corporate not caring about associates. Lucky for me my store manager genuinely cares about his people, but he has been punished for it. They don't seem to embrace that lifestyle anymore it seems."
good,Walmart leadership and hourly associates enjoy great compensation and benefits. There are opportunities for growth and promotion. There are a variety of new positions added annually.
good,Great company to work for...employees and staff all friendly and helpful.definitely room for advancement ..Walmart is a constantly growing company with competitive wagea
good,Basically you have to make production with your load per trailer and make sure you have a brick layer load. You also have to make sure your load high and tight to prevent it from falling down on you or other co-workers. What contents that are damage needs to be removed and reported to your manager.
good,"While walmart prides itself on the core values Sam Walton set out to achieve, working at the place shows different between the unorganized work spaces to the limited work equipment. Some days at work can feel like a bigger task than need be. The job is simple however lack of materials to do the job makes work hard."
good,"Not much to say really, it was a job that paid the bills while I attended school. I enjoyed the people there and was good at what I did. I left for personal reasons as it was my one of two jobs i held at the time."
good,"Well, this was at the time i was working and I heard the manager got fired so that's fine. However, when i was working there my manager thought it would be appropriate for him to give my evaluation to my neighbors. I was in the military as well and even though i kept giving them a schedule because thats what they told me to do, the kept ""losing"" it and then said it was my responsibility to put in the days i wouldnt be there. Yet, id still have trouble with them and my days."
good,"it was fun, but hard you are always on the move and always having to do something that has to do with the place you are working at. managers aren't too friendly due to having to be on top of all the work amount."
good,"A typical work day you show up to work you clock in you do your task for the day clock out."
good,Cashier and restock.  The other floor employees and customers are great. I learned that it is a job.  The job was not carried out as signed off on when hired.
good,Although the management could have been better Walmart pay is pretty good they give you decent benefits discounts they also working a lot but it pays off once you receive your check
good,I was able to move up from over night stocker to department manager after just 6 months.  Their policies for medical LOAs in Tuscon AZ we're definitely not right.
good,It was nice place to work they valued your performance benefits are good bonus was nice people are good I love working there management was not so good butbits ok
good,"Encarregados e Gerente prestativos."
good,"Management needs to all be on the same page, communication was horrible. Countless times I was set to work on a task by one manager and was interrupted by another manager of the same rank telling me to start on another task. Needless to say, this caused alot of confusion and resulted in nothing getting completed at all."
good,Walmart has always been a company that never been about the workers. After working there for almost two years there is more they need to improve. They need to give other people chances to move up in the management chain. They also need to increase the pay more because of the amount of work the employees do there they are not getting paid enough. Walmart has a long way to go if they want to compete with Amazon.
good,"I had a great time working at Walmart and the employees that I got to meet were really nice, and if I  didn't know something all you had to do was ask. The pay was good but sometimes they would cut my hours. But my biggest concern was management, they always took too long to help their associates resulting in angry customers. Even the front end supervisor was really rude and had his favorites which ruined good vibes in the workplace."
good,It was an ok place to work but everyone has thee picks and chooses as to who is a favorite and I was working in the money center for about a year and was not getting paid to work over there
good,the csm where very awsome people and i work very had to help the customers.I would also get help when i asked and very up beat and fast work place to work in
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-mart and would go back maybe in the future. I would say that the only thing I had concerns with while working at Wal-mart were the work schedule and hours. I just feel that everyone should have an opportunity to work both day shifts, night shifts and have an occasional weekend off. Instead of certain people getting to work only day shifts and no nights hardly. Everyone should have some weekends off."
good,"This was an OK place to work dif not have many problems with management or coworkers, okay pay and management will help to adjust your schedule to fit your home life, but could result in low amount of hours u work. But management did have their favorites. If you are not one of their favorites don't expect advancement."
good,"Working at WalMart is very simple, you're not expected to do much outside of what you're told to do, the problem is the never ending amount of customers and the fact that you'll be sent out of your role many times."
good,I loved working at walmart the only hard part was working with my schedule. If they worked with more people's schedules they would keep employees. Being a single mom i have to put my children in daycare.
good,The job is ok but management does not. Are about the employees needs. They are more 8neterested in making mor ens d ore money for themselves than their employees.
good,"Walmart wasn't the job for me, I do not like being disrespected in my job. I learned to use a cash register, build and move product modifications, use a TC Scanner, and how to use time clocks."
good,"My workdays start way too early..so I'm always exhausted. "
good,"Walmart  start the week on a Saturday, which is strange. The pay is not enough to pay your bills. You have to be on time and don't every not show up without calling in. With that being said I never had that issue but if you need a job is OK."
good,"I think every Walmart is different. I worked for a location that is high shrink meaning it has a lot of theft. There is a mix of good customers and sketchy ones. It is not uncommon to see a fist fight in the binging of the month when the store is super busy and everyone wants stuff. The management is okay. Some of management is fair and reasonable and others are very draconian. I think the work experience also depends on what department you are in and the manager above you. For me again a mix of good, bad and okay. I think working for Walmart is a great beginner job for people. I am honestly feel I have seen the good the bad and the ugly of the company and am grateful for the employment. I feel underappreciated at the end cause the company has changed some policies that make it harder to work for them long term or get bonuses. There are to many caviots that are meant to keep employees in their good graces but life happens and you can get in trouble for it even if not intentional. I got an acurance for missing work cause I had to miss work to go to the ER and guess what? If you have an acurance for you attendance you get less of any bonuses if it not excused and that is what happened to me."
good,"A empresa no geral é boa, e adquiri muitas experiências, como foi meu primeiro emprego trabalhar lá foi um impulso e tanto para entrar na vida adulta com o pé direito."
good,Extrapolam horas extras. Imposição de ritmo exaustivo.  Falta de confiança nos colaboradores. Sobreposição de inúmeras tarefas e atribuições para funcionários.  Gerencia impositiva e não colaborativa.
good,"The workplace culture was the only reason i stayed as long as i did. They did not pay well or let anyone get very many hours or overtime at all. The customers were alright, some really were amazing and others were not. The job entitled a lot more than my own job title and that frustrated me a lot seeing as though i was being paid minimum wage. The management was pretty decent. there were great managers and there were not. a typical day was pretty busy and horrible when it was extremely busy."
good,"typical work day consist of unloading and stocking product. had a lot of great customers interaction, also had contact with people that weren't so nice. This including the managers. The hardest part of the job was not the work or the customers, but management. They would literally avoid you all day to keep from having to addresses any issues that the store or workers are having, unless it was a customers whom they didn't want giving a bad report. The job is good if can overlook the major elephant in the room."
good,Core hours are pushing me out of the job in have enjoyed. Plus the treatment by store manager towards others under him. The stress is bringing the moral of the story down. Some people are going to looking to leave.
good,"Had a bad situation with understaffed cap 2 (Stocking) position. The ""support managers"" weren't much help. By the time I had left the company, the role of ""support manager"" was terminated. Along with a whole mess of things I just said no to and left.."
good,"The maintenance dept. was OK but needed some equipment to do the job proficiently such as a mill/lathe. Seemed to have some issues carrying all the necessary stock of parts to keep critical systems in operation.  The associates on the other hand were treated poorly.  Disciplinary action for any accidents. Exceptionally hot in the summers with the floors sweating so bad that the footing was hazardous and the lifts like to slide due to the moisture. The rate was raised and many had issues making it. Breaks were very short and started from your location instead of when the break room was reached and some people had a long way to go. Ten hour work day you received a 20 min lunch and 15 min break that was paid for but again, kind of on the ""cheap"" side. Most places give you 2 breaks and a lunch period for 8 hours. The insurance was substandard from most places I have worked."
good,My hours started out at 32hrs/week as promised but now I’m only getting 20-24hrs/week. I do like having the two 15 mins breaks and an hour lunch. But just really wish they kept my hours up and not cut them so much... My coworkers are nice and helpful and managers are also helpful.
good,"A typical day for Cap 2 associates begins with truck offloading. Freight pallets are pulled via pallet jacks, both electric and hand crank to holding areas. Then any and all loose freight is taken out via sorter where it is placed onto carts and spare pallets to be sent out to the sales floor."
good,"When I first joined the company, the environment was mentally and financially healthier. Recent cuts have increased the work load per person and reduced full time availability. Management team changes often in Charlottetown, PE because it is a Management Training location which can cause some disruption from time to time. Must be able to lift heavy items and work is physically demanding. "
good,Fun place to work.  Employee interaction and customer interaction was great.  Management not so great. Worked long hours on salary pay.  Hourly employees made more money than management employees.
good,"The company was fun to work for, but cut back hours for associates. The pace never stayed the same and the expectations were never the same from one manager to the next. Communication was not a strong suit."
good,Customers were kind of difficult but that's is at all stores. Co workers weren't always the best but that is also part of the job. Had lots of difficulties trying to talk to any managers. I was only there to do the thing that I love  (Cake decorate) and make money.
good,"When I Started I Was Cashier In The Day or Night Shift. I Moved To Overnight Crew. Which I Thought Would Be Easier, But Even Though You Have Good Managers, One Always Messes It Up For You. (Harrassment )Employees Make It Enjoyable.Beautiful Lunchroom With T.V. For Relaxing, & a Birthday Board, To Acknowledge U."
good,Overall working here it was a good first job experience. I made lifelong friends while working there. They were always nice about the times that I needed off for school. This is a good place to work despite it being retail.
good,"Customers may be stressful but overall the management and employees are all down to earth and fun to work with, competitive wages and various benefits"
good,The employees are fun to work with you get two 15-minute breaks and an hour unpaid lunch the managers are unprofessional dress code is casual Long's your clothes don't have logos
good,"I worked here while I was in college.  They did work with my school schedule  but would make us stay until closing knowing I had class at 7am the next day. Management was okay, they were all over the place and didn't communicate very well."
good,management was not the best but you could get your work done. sometimes it was overwhelming to a point. it could have been better but it was not as stressful
good,Walmart has lost its characteristics pride. The upper management team here are not a team. They talk to employees any kind of way. That store is a walking ethical lawsuit.
good,"Es un trabajo esclavizador, no hay tiempo para la familia o la vida en pareja. Pocas posibilidades para estudiar porque los horarios son rotativos"
good,I loved my time with Wal-Mart. It was a very fast-paced but easy to learn job. I loved my schedule and the free time it allowed me while also balancing a social life.
good,"Empresa fantástica, treinamento, benefícios"
good,"The pay is good! But Walmart will suck the life out of everything you are and do! 10-12 hours per day, 60-70 a week! If you can't perform you will be replaced and at the end of the day your replaceable."
good,It’s not the same team oriented company to work for money and advancement is the only incentive anymore the customer is an afterthought................
good,my walmart experince was great.it was an good oppounity for me to try something different with my work skills.i work cap 1 4am-1pm 6 days a week. all though it was an great experince i am ready to try something new and more upper for me.
good,"Fast paced, meet new people all the time, Opportunity to move up in the business. Learned so much working with a great company as Walmart. The people that work there are amazing."
good,"When I started at Walmart, it was very employee-oriented. They were very understanding of life issues and commitments. Recently, they really that messed up. We are constantly short-staffed with a high turnover rate and there is no more leniency unless you have children. I am constantly struggling with scheduling conflicts because my manager overrides my schedule to make me work more than I say I can which really hurts other aspects of life (school, family, health). Therefore, I am constantly getting in trouble for not coming into work. In addition, since I work in the pharmacy, no one outside of the pharmacy wants to deal with these issues. There are many other complaints I hear from other employees including, no leniency for weather, family commitments, or health issues. Lastly, Walmart got rid of Personnel so we have no one to hear these issues. It is a real shame."
good,"A typical day at work is the typical customer service job. You unload trucks, put out/stock freight, and assist customers with a set salary. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers and the easiest is that its a team effort. Walmart is all about teamwork, which is good."
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart they just wouldn't work around my school schedule at the time. I love working with my coworkers and the manger was some what understanding
good,I loved  the employees and environment at  Walmart the problem was the customers at times. The customers could get very disrespectful and rude. As an employee you aren't allowed to say anything back
good,Flexible hours and days made it easy to a full time job along with working here. Great relationships built with team members and some management. Christmas time was busy and they at times would schedule a lot of extra hours.
good,A little bit of nonsense to deal with but not bad. Good people and most of them are helpful. Even the management will help get you through those not so good days.
good,"I interact very well with all the associates and management.I enjoy working here .I am wanting paid holidays off because as of right now they are not offered,the only paid holiday off is Christmas day."
good,I had so much fun working at WALMART!  I started out as a cashier and was asked to take the management test on my third day.  Within 2 weeks I was moved up to front end manager.
good,I have an excellent assistant manager who makes sure that his department is taken care of to the best of his ability.  He truly cares for the people in his department and shows us regular appreciation.
good,I was constantly on the move stocking or cleaning shelves. never had anytime to slow down. constant flow of customers.It was very fun and exciting meeting new people on a daily basis.The hardest part was the physical strength you had to have to lift things.
good,"The policies of the store are not reflected in its actions.Orders for items are often wrong. People assigned to jobs and tasks are routinely taken off of them in mid-stream to do something else, causing confusion."
good,"I have worked with the company for about 11 years and I have learned many changes have happened through the company.  Policies have changed along with the rules and how things are done.  Positions in the store have also changed, added or removed.  The biggest thing I learned is the people in the company make the job and some can ruin if for those that try.  "
good,"Walmart used to be a great company to work for. They took away holiday pay , extra pay on sunday’s everything . They have become very selfish when it comes to taking care of there associates."
good,That had to be one of the craziest jobs ever worked at. So very fast-paced so critical and political. Always someone looking over your shoulder. Very very structured. Often times our customers were rude. But a man just got his job done. And then right. And that was a satisfaction.
good,"It's an ok company to work for, but u have to put up with a lot of favoritism and unnecessary bs. Training is all computer based and next to noon existent with hands on."
good,Typical work days was graveyard hours. learned ways to make job duties quicker.management was attentive.diverse culture.standing long hours.the pay was good except wasn't able to change scheduled shift even if in emergency until after 6months .
good,I had the privilege of working closely with a small very friendly team in the photo lab.My direct manager was extremely personable.Most customers were easy to deal with.
good,It's been a while since I worked there. I had fun and I enjoyed the bonus system they had. I also liked the meetings before the shifts began. They kept everyone in the loop. Overall I  have nothing bad to say about them.
good,They tend to use the fact that you’re part time when you least want it. My bonus means i work less and still get paid the same average check i always get whenever we don’t have a bonus. Use your customer service to play them and get to the top of bank
good,I would recommend Walmart for young people just getting into the job market.  If you start there young you can build a good career.  It is a very eclectic work environment that is not very forgiving.
good,They didn’t have vacation you had pro hours and sick time they gave 4 ever year.   There was no team work. And always hated to hurry and thing done they had time   Limits on everything they did.
good,"I love my job, you just never know how long your going to get to keep it. I seen situations where someone has worked with Walmart for 23 years and hasld always been known for outstanding work ethic and then be told that they are doing away with that job title and had to either step down and take a pay cut or be given a severance package. I just dont think Walmart cares about the individual people anymore. Even the exceptional ones."
good,The 6 months i stayes at walmart alme days were okay and other i drained.  Only because i was working 3-12 almost everyday even on weekends. I was tired of it they rarely gave ne day shifts
good,It all depends on where you go. Produce is the hardest department at Walmart which is the reason I enjoyed it but when I was a cashier it was to slow.
good,Don’t work on the front end do anything but that and you’ll be okay. Also just know that they attendance policy is ridiculously stupid so don’t call off of unless necessary
good,"Upper management (Store Manager, HR) was super responsive to employee needs/concerns. Middle management was very aggressive for recognition and advancement (the ""atta boy!"")"
good,Walmart Inc. Associates will have to perform various jobs within the store itself. Part-time associates do not receive benefits. They will have to have a full-time status.
good,"The best part about working at Walmart are the people, everyone gets along, but people are have their own inner circle of friends. A lot of people that are in the department manager or any supervisor position have been in those same positions for years, making it very hard to make your way up the ladder."
good,Store manager is bad. Most assistant managers were rude as well. Department managers are cool. I was constantly moved around the store and told to do jobs I wasnt trained for. They can be tricky with your schedule.
good,Certain managers were AMAZING. Others were so bad they made you want to quit every day. Very inconsistent hours. The only really good thing about working there was the discount especially during the black friday time frame.
good,"Wal-Mart offered me the opportunity to advance rather quickly for my hard work and loyalty.  I felt like there was no limit to my potential until I transferred to a store that was known for poor hiring pools and a rough area to work in.  After  a year and a half of spending most of my time at work (12 to 18 hour days) with maybe one day off a week due to store conditions and the inability to keep management staffed both new hires and veterans of the company.  I could no longer put up with the constant threats of ""coaching's are coming"" and the incessant undermining of my authority to manage my people, I had to leave the company I spent nine years with."
good,"Working at Walmart, I've invested a lot of my time and consideration in helping customers, fixing merchandise, and overall- ensuring the satisfaction of others. I intended to move into a Marketing position, but later changed my thinking. It is pretty easy to move up, as long as you show your worth and drive towards the company."
good,"My typical day would consist of watching and helping customers either on the self check out lanes or work an actual register to ring customers out. Most days i feel appreciative of what i do, but sometimes, management shows little appreciation for the  job we do."
good,busy always and short staff mangagment can sometimes be over the top... hardest part is understanding its not enough hours in the day to do all that is required
good,"My day at work starts by coming in and working with my team guided by a department manager. I usually am in charge of overseeing the Electronics department by helping customers one on one and holding the keys to lockup. I also keep track of stock, changing prices, and helping customers in the photo lab."
good,Overall my experience was good but work and pay was not balancing at all. They were cutting huge amount of taxes and not giving benefits accordingly. Culture and environment of work was good.
good,I ended up leaving a little early at the Russellville Neighborhood Walmart because of my manager. She tried to fire me for going over in points but when I asked her to pull it up in the system it shown I clearly only had one point. She couldn't fire me so she tried to make my life sucky at work.
good,When I worked there I really liked it but now they have everything changed around. They do not have a 1st 2nd or 3rd shift any more and I wish they did or I’d go back
good,The day started with a truck than end with stocking grocery in shelves. I have learned how to unload trucks and deal with a customers. The most enjoyable part of this job is we all working as a team.
good,Wal-Mart is a stepping stone for college students. They have a high turnover rate and most supervisors don't care to much about there workers. Hard to advance.
good,"Walmart has recently renovated their Store Support Centre, it's a bright open plan office and offers casual dress code and work from home once a week."
good,"You can grow at Walmart, I do see that play favoritism here but I am new to this country so I fully don't understand why. But you do get opportunities"
good,They have great leaders that will give u an extra push. The best part of the job was satisfy costomers. I think the worst part would be the lack of staff sometimes altering positions.
good,"I believe Walmart is not a terrible place to work, I do not like the scheduling they have right now. They now have set my schedule to 16.5 hours, and I can not have that with trying to afford a place to live and a car. A typical day at work for me is being spied on by fellow older associates for no apparent reasoning, I have told management and they do not do enough because it keeps happening. I have learned how to be a good customer service representative because I am friendly. The management at Walmart can be friendly, but I recommend you stay on their good side. The hardest part of my job is when there is only 2 people working and we have over 6 big areas to finish by ourselves, and with the amount of people getting their hours sliced in half, that happens most of the time. The most enjoyable part is being able to work with friends."
good,I loved it but i just wasn't getting enough hours a week. 8 hours a week isn't going to do me much for 5 weeks. I regret leaving in a sense of me loving it but not needing something better.
good,"I was an intern. I did learn a lot about management. I also learned that I do not like working in retail. It was a very competitive, but also the atmosphere was stressful."
good,Management doesn’t care about anyone but themselves. They always want you to do their work on top of what you already need to get done. They get very rude when you are sick too.
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you dont mind things changing every few months. They have great benefits. The pay isn't bad. My only issue was that overtime wasnt allowed.
good,They don't keep their word when dealing with associates. They go back on things they have told you. very wavering on there thoughts and actions. Uncaring & uncompassionate.
good,Major projects are not given enough time or assiocates to finish the job correctly. Being forced to work the night before inventory until 2 am and return at 6am. Also being given our review during inventory day.
good,"The first 6 month's or so it was great. As time went on, I started to get to know some of the other cashiers and other employees and I found some like to gossip.  I understand you have that everywhere so I kept out of any negativity I ran into in a friendly manner.  "
good,Fast pace jobs must be accurate comply with safety and clean as you go. I have worked in every department so I could get my hours. I have learned it all for job security.
good,Mangement is annoying at times hours aren’t that consistent sometimes request things that may not be possible there are some lazy people you maybe stuck working with
good,"structured workday same thing every day"
good,"Wasn't that stressful or anything just VERY fast paced. Most managers were fair and competent, to me at least. Seems like everyone had a different opinion, though. Co workers were nice enough. A good job to get your feet wet but don't settle on it. There a great deal of better options."
good,"You have to be the fit culturally now, it was a completely "
good,"It was fun working there for awhile meeting new people an making friends. But the managers didn’t handle things well. I would be pushing carts by myself no help when one of my coworkers called out it’ll be raining, snowing or hot sometimes I would be out there alone even one a busy day"
good,I did not enjoy this job that much. The people were great. Some of the customers not so much. I worked 3rd shift which was okay at first but it got boring and annoying real fast.
good,"If you like straightening up shelves, being rushed to empty return carts, sweating like a dog unloading trucks, or getting yelled at to gather carts in the parking lot because the people who were supposed to do it never showed up for work then this is your place! Management there was a joke, they'd yell at you for not working fast enough. Nothing was ever good enough. Alot of work for the pay. When they hire you on they don't tell you you'll be doing 50 jobs. Only work there if you need experience otherwise find someplace else."
good,"Listen don't want to work there again. They are unfair, dont care about employees, they change the schedule n not tell you then you get in trouble for it."
good,"We had alot of good days at walmart because we worked as a team to get things done in a timely manner.It was fun because we made our job fun and friendly for coworkes and customers,"
good,Depending on what department you work in work at walmart can be a good experience. The pay  and hours are not enough but otherwise it is good employment. Most managers and supervisors are good to work for. As a corporation I believe they could and should pay more.
good,"I moved up from an hourly entry-level associate to a salaried manager in under two years. Sounds great, right? I talked with the market team about advancing my education. They told me it was best to leave and reapply when my degree was done. Two years later, degree finished and in hand, I reapplied and went through the interview process only to be told that I am not qualified for this position. Let me be clear, they told me the position that I was applying for, the one that I had *already* been employed as, I was under-qualified with a college degree. So, be ready for whatever politics or whims are at their hearts."
good,When you arrive you have a meeting for 10 minutes finding out where you will b working that day. when you go onto the floor you down-stack pallets while putting the items on the shelves. After two hours you take a break for 15 minutes then go back to work. Four hours after you arrived you clock out for lunch and clock back in after an hour. you work for another 2 hours and take a break again work for an hour and 30 minutes and start cleaning up for the final 30 minutes you work
good,Based off my three years of experience at Walmart the company is a good company to work for . I like the benefits that the employees can receive as well as pay.
good,"Cart pusher was a very easy task, if management put you there with at least one other person. My co-workers and I always found our selfs working alone and a lot of the time it was on a Saturday or Sunday."
good,"Basically for Electronics, you stand around and either wait for freight to come in to stock or customers to help. Most of the time, it's tedious and there's nothing really to do after one point."
good,I assisted in completing and filling out customers orders for cakes and other types of desserts. I decorated and frosted all types of cakes and doughnuts
good,Walmart is not a place where you learn all you need to know in training; instead you learn something new everyday at Walmart. My role is in the Photo Lab department but I typical ends up in the electronic department each work day.
good,"Generally, I would say this is a good place to work.  I would like to see managers receive more intensive training.  I also believe while respect for the individual is important, it needs to include both sides of a story for an incident, and associates should be discouraged from wearing their feelings on thleir shoulders.  They are starting to focus mainly on part time, and this is due in part to people demanding high wages, and part to the belief that 3 part time people can do more work than one full time which in their view helps create jobs.  They do hire at greater than base minimum wage to start which is a plus and your experience plays a part in that which speaks to their wilingness to recognize accomplishments outside of Walmart.  Associates are at times asked to perform to standards which are not possible to reach, such as one cake decorator being asked to do 4 wedding cakes in one 8 hour shift.  I would also like to see them go back to a uniform-based dress code.  I believe uniforms help customers recognize associates no matter which direction they are facing, and lends an air of professionalism.  They also need to consistently adhere to food safety practices, specifically the rule about eating and drinking in the food prep areas.  I understand about tasting food, but this can be done by putting a sample in a sample cup and moving away from the prep area.  Gum should never be allowed, neither should candy or cough drops, since you can't guarantee you aren't dripping saliva on the food or that the gum/candy won't fall in the food on accident.  The hardest part of the"
good,"A typical day at work could be draining or relaxing. Depends on how busy you keep yourself and if keeping busy gives you any internal satisfaction. I learned how to opperate a walky-stacker whitch is an electronic pallet jack that can lift palletes of goods to and from storage. Management did their best but I was sometimes left wondering if they were all properly communicating with each other. Work place culture was an odd mix of Youngens with no real direction, Old folks with no options left, and extremely introverted individuals. The hardest part of the job was probably just dealing with the cold fingers you would get from handling frozen items. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually completing your goal, in this case how many pallets broken down and stocked before your shift ends."
good,"Walmart is a great starting job if it is your first part time job, but not one I would stay with for more then a year. It is extremely hard to get hours, and management is not always easy to talk too."
good,"Ringing up guests, restocking, handling cash. "
good,It was a fun environment but very stressful it was like a highschool to much gossiping from management and coworkers. And the managers played favorites pretty bad
good,"My typical day at work would be 1. Customer service 2. Stock 3.Cap 4.Slot 5. Restock"
good,"Pharmacists shouldn't have to tell you what to do, if you aren't taking initiative this isn't the job for you. Technicians work side-by-side with pharmacists--staff and floating (pharmacists who fill in for the shift from different Walmart stores). Getting acquainted with software called Connexus and Tasco, follow which queues need to be tended to. The organization, attention to detail, and inventory/stock are heavily weaved into the position. Provide excellent customer care for patients with their medications. Walmarts target demographic is for low-income patients who are usually elder and need extra help with understanding their medications."
good,Dealing with a hostile work environment where nothing will be done to the individuals causing issues.  The only thing keeping me here is my insurance.
good,The company pushes process work with little to no recognition.  The company preaches work life balance but does not live by that motto.  The company does push one to do the best they can but little comes out of it.
good,"I would prepared myself to go and push some carts, then I go to my current supervisor and let him know that I am ready. I was isolated from the rest so I didn't experience the culture that much, but I really enjoyed the view the parking lot had for me. The hardest thing was the weather outside to push carts. I learned discipline, leadership skills for my mates, and the value of professionalism has for oneself in a the workplace."
good,Depending on your mangers wakmart can be a fun place to work for or it can be a hair pulling out experience. Good money but not flexible on sick days .
good,First time job.Good place to start........Like the job T MY storeAZ.... Oregon stores are different..Not much for listening to what matters.Iny opinion..
good,"I loved my job in the deli/bakery and worked with great people but management could not follow a steady schedule and, even after having my manager ask, write down, and me giving my availability in at least 7 times, I was constantly scheduled to work on days and during hours that I was in class."
good,"When I first started I was on the floor as dry foods/goods stocking. After being there for about for about 5 months, I helped train in new employess. I was not limited to a certian department, so I stocked shelves throughout the whole store except in automotive, dairy and frozen food. In December 2013, I accepted a position as Inventory associate, which is where I did picking and binning merchandise using the inventory management system. In Feb 2014, I ended up getting put on medical leave of absence due to neck and back issues. I was absent until August 2014 and I took training courses for Cashering. Before I got to be trained in, I ended up resigning dur to continually having neck and back issues."
good,I dint get the hours and my manger was rude but I still enjoyed working for walmart it was am ok place to  work and I would recommend it to someone first starting off not a career tho
good,There is a lot of drama between associates. They say you can move around in the company but it’s only at their convenience. Work has to come before family.
good,Its great pay for the work required. Daily work is fairly easy although certain times of the day can be more busy than others. Only downfall to working at Walmart from my experience was the management team lacked empathy and interest in employees.
good,I loved working for Walmart pharmacy but I believe the  other areas of the store could have been more friendly toward the pharmacy and tried to work more  as a team
good,Good pay and benefits but horrible schedule. Working in the cold for ten or more hours. Lots of lifting. There is really no good schedule you have nights or really early mornings.
good,"good people,management needs work ,management is more worried about who to coach, than taking care of customers and correcting store problems and running the store proficiently"
good,Very positive work place. All though training and learning was very difficult . learned myself on the hand held devices. Was always short of help and always had a work load bigger then you could handle.
good,"Great for a starting job, but not ideal for raising a family on. Enjoyed the work, and loved the fast-paced environment. I really enjoyed assisting customers."
good,"I would say that a typical day at work consisted of me clocking in, going to my post and possibly conversation with another customer host while we both do our duties. Then wait till lunch to clock out then clock back in to do the same thing till my shift was over. I learned how to be patient with others through interactions with customers and some employees. I also learned to stand around for a certain amount of hours and finding interesting ways to pass the time that wouldn't conflict with my work duties. The management I dealt with was kind and understanding to me. When I first got the job i expected uptight bosses but what I got were kind and understanding actual human beings, which I still appreciate till this day. "
good,"Enjoyed working there when I was younger. As a manager, it was hard to balance family and kids working a lot of hours, weekends and holidays. That was the hardest part of the job. Enjoyed co-workers and customers."
good,"Lá é bem ruim os horários, salário e rasuavel mais trabalha de segunda a segunda"
good,"Overall working for Walmart is a great first job in my opinion. On the other hand, the job has continued to become more stressful with not knowing if you will receive the hours you need to make the cost of living. Although, it is manageable just barely able to make ends meet. Management overall does what they can in order to work with you and your needs. Consistent policy changes can go either way good or bad usually is a mix of both. In the end, Walmart itself makes the job harder then what it is at times, but the experience you receive is very beneficial and the people you come to meet usually is the best part."
good,Not really a place I seen myself moving up. A lot of corporate views that interfered with my values and beliefs as a logical human. Good for job experience and social exposure to a lot of out of the box individuals.
good,"CAP 2 is okay if you are willing to work, it just takes a little bit to learn the process. After Learning unloading and stocking shelves, your daily routine is easy, and repeatable. The only problem the workers constantly had was having 2 trucks to unload, once or twice a week, which effectively doubles the reasonable workload; that coupled with not having enough workers on specific days was terrible. Overall, I would rate my working experience there as a 6 or 7 out of 10."
good,Manager in my department was never around. Most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made in my department. Worked very hard on busy days because the buggy machine on the other side of the store was never fixed making it hard to keep up with the amount of customers.
good,"A typical work includes, but not limited to, people calling in a lot, inconsistent help, incompetent co-workers, lazy co-workers, etc.Be prepared to go above and beyond for management that doesn't reward much and constantly changes expectations."
good,Empresa presta um bom relacionamento com os funcionarios
good,rude customers poor management poorly planned scheduling of associates the point system for attendance is pretty fair and flexible its a fun work place.
good,"Working as a remodel crew member involved transitioning the store from its old style to the new one, while helping customers along the way. We had four sometimes five different managers at the store providing us with daily tasks. Sometimes one manager's request would conflict with another's and this created issues. Overall, working here for a temporary amount of time was enjoyable."
good,Working with customer gave me a sense of accomplishment. My manager was a great lady. She tried to accommodate everyone. My co-workers were very out going and fun to be around.
good,"I assisted with local pickup and curbside service throughout the day. I was responsible for finding the product on the sales floor and staging it for the customer to pick up at a certian time. We were supervised by an assistant manager to maintain professionalism and speed so that we are on time for our customers. Sometimes it is somewhat stressful for us when we are required to help all customers. However, it is an efficient way of getting your groceries."
good,"The work /life balance needs great attention. When I first started at Walmart everything was great. As I started building my career it seemed like the further I made it the further the company steered away from its core beliefs. As management we were supposed to uphold the values of ethics and respect for the individual, but it seemed like everything turned into the complete opposite."
good,Go to the inventory in the back room & start scanning for items that need stocked on the sales floor. Load up items on cart take them to the floor and stock. Scan out of stock items to get them reordered. Do price changes and labeling.
good,"Can be hectic and stressful at times, but learned management skills. Management not always on same page as associates. Job culture not the greatest..."
good,"It's not too bad, the managers were okay, I just don't like the scheduling since it conflicted with my school schedule. It wasn't the worst. The work was easy."
good,"Since I am a cashier, I am one of the main gears for making sure the company functions correctly. Learning how to operate the registers and following in accordance to store policies was taught to me through two eight hour sessions of online courses taken on a computer. After working there for almost a year and a half now, I am confident enough to say I know how to operate the register expertly, as well as being able to learn other departments of the store such as self checkout and in-store pick-up.  Of course since it is retail, I will encounter many difficult customers at times like many other jobs out there, but besides that it is a relaxed environment to work in."
good,"Started off good, worked in a group and most people were very fun to be around. team leads were excellent and our manager was a decent one. fast forward to manager rotation(i guess they do this to see if other managers would do better elsewhere) new manager wouldnt work with my hours(was in college so if I needed to not be there for school related things she would basically say ""I don't care"")"
good,The pay and benefits were good but the overall impression I got was that profits were more important than people.  In the department I worked in we were usually understaffed and there was quite a language barrier between the manager and employees.  Upper management did not seem to understand this and often pressured the manager for better and faster results.
good,great place to work. we were like family here. we are sad walmart dist ctr is closing. we had right at employees175 working here. we hav had a few relocate to bentonville .
good,"I have been with the company for 11 years, it has been a good and bad experience, as many jobs, you run into certain management who feel they know more than others, and then you get management who are skilled and are willing to teach and train and actually roll up their sleeves and get dirty. but overall it was a good retail experience."
good,"The job itself is not stressful, but the people can be very dramatic and overbearing. Management is unbalanced, with some members being very helpful and knowledgeable and others being not so. That being said, the benefits are great, and there are two 15 minute breaks along with an hour lunch."
good,".a typical day at work was long consistent and fast paced"
good,Walmart was alright. I didn’t like some of the managment and the job was tiring and put a lot of straint on my body. They expected too much out of us but didn’t have enough people for the job.
good,I enjoyed my job as a TLE Technician and learned some valuable skills that I can use at home. The only improvement I would make would be to upgrade the tools available to us in the shop for changing oil and tires.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if you are a people person and hard worker. Walmart also gives opportunities to move up to higher management and you can learn a lot  on a retail perspective, product management, and inventory control."
good,"an ok place to work great career advancements decent coworkers, ;"
good,"En general la empresa es buena, pero en la practica hay muy mala organización, mucha rotación en personal y poco apoyo para los trabajadores."
good,"Clock in and go to cashier line , stand there all shift. Except for breaks , very busy, lots of rules and things  to remember, changing constant, difficult and unruly customers."
good,"Walmart provides challenging and varying work in the IT areas to meet operational business needs.  Balance depends heavily on management and if your area is on leadership radar for key deliverables in the fall and winter, expect the needs of the business to prevail."
good,"enjoyed working here was just stuck and was not allowed to leave the freezer areas, other then that I liked working at walmart would work again but not in freezer"
good,"Checked in freight and distributed accordingly, whether it went to sales floor or in showcases. Assist customers with their sales purchases and special orders or repairs. Maintained the aesthetics of the jewelry department as well as working cosmetics, softlinks, shoes and grocery areas as needed by management. Was not always able to complete work tasks within the jewelry department due to management pulling you out of your area to work other departments."
good,"Walmart has been a good place for me to work. I have good benefits and I believe management has treated me fairly. No room for me to grow unless I chose to climb the company, which I do not. Looking to further my career with more opportunities to better myself for my family and my employer."
good,"My store manager was the reason i quit. I greatly enjoyed what I did at Walmart, but the managing staff make working there frustrating. Our entire department kept being told we were lazy and didn’t know how to do our jobs even though we had THE highest rating in our department in our state."
good,"Not much that hasn't already been said about working for Walmart.  The pay is below average for a management position, but they did provide me with the opportunity to advance, which will always be greatly appreciated."
good,"It's an okay place to work, management isn't the best "
good,It is a fast pace work place. They want you as a worker to get the stocking done and move to other projects in the store. When this get done management is happy and does give you a thank you and a pat-on-the back. If you work doing the day shifts remember you have customers you might have to help also. Over all its not a bad place to work.
good,"Long hours. To many Managers, I left for medical reasons. And now they pay higher Wages. $12 or more. Very busy store. And I think there should cashiers checking out customers."
good,Empresa boa para puxa saco não para pessoas comprometidas
good,"The jobs good if you don't have any kind of social anxiety. The only reason why I didn't stay was because I do and it was taking its toll on me, especially when I was yelled at by the occasional costumers. Other than that it was a great job. Co-workers were friendly and it felt like there was always something to learn."
good,"There's not much to say about this job, so to be able to finish this review i am just going to type random stuff. Have a good day and thank you for taking the time to read this."
good,"management was terrible which is one of the reasons I left, and second they don't compensate for you if you are sick. like atleast allow someone to bring in a actual note from the doctore especially if they never call out."
good,"Busy, stressful, people yelled at you for just doing your job, may it be management or customer. But on good days it can be very fun. you just don't know what your walking in today."
good,"Pretty good company to work for. Lots of pressure for not much reward.  Yearly raises. Quarterly bonuses. Full health care. Good retirement benefits. Matching 401k to 6%, I think."
good,The people you meet on the daily is the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part of my job is that it is very stressful because everyone does not work together to make a successful outcome. Lack of teamwork and managers show poor communication skills and lack professionalism.
good,"The job is one of constant movement to accomplish 300-400 prescriptions a day on limited staff.  The most rewarding part of the job is counseling patients on their medications and giving change of life suggestions in order to prolong life and possibly reduce medications. There is always work to be done including counseling patients, putting away medications, processing orders, calling md's for questions, talking to patients on phone and taking orders, insurance issues to be solved, recalls to process, schedules to be made for technicians, ordering medications and supplies, giving vaccinations, and running health clinics (a1c, cholesterol, blood pressure, fasting glucose and bmi).  Most days lunch is hard to take because there is to much work to accomplish especially when help calls out sick.  This happens quiet often. I am an older gentleman but have the health profile of a 30 year old missing only 1 day of work in my 40 years of practice. Also Walmart requires up to 4-6 computer based modules per month usually done off the clock since time is so limited."
good,Wish not to speak bad. A lot of work and sometime over whelming. At times Wal-mart life is good until the people / co-workers became unhinged then it's hard. Not a work team place at times.
good,"During the almost 8 years of employment at Walmart, I have found the Associates to be severely lacking in Customer Service."
good,"The typical day at Walmart is processing and working freight. As a department manager, that is not the process but it is what we spend the first 3-4 hours doing. The management is wonderful individually but need some communication lessons as a collective. The hardest part of the job is doing beyond what is expected of us (without proper equipment most days) and not be appreciated for our work and efforts. Not speaking for all employees, but I do not need appreciation every single day, but at least more than twice a month. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers."
good,"When I started walmart I was a sophomore in high school and it taught me a lot as far as jobs go. I dont regret working there, but I'm glad it's over. If that makes sense."
good,"When working here you would most likely get very rude and entitled customers. Due to trained customer service, they’re easier to handle and curate to. Management will expect you to work hard regardless, but with communication management will help you when you are having trouble."
good,If you don't mind working for a company that is known for continuous rounds of layoffs and restructuring then its not a bad place to be.  Some areas are a lot better than others.
good,"An overall productive and team-based workplace, who's main focus is to provide a safe and helpful environment for the customer. With more focus on praising workers for their hard work and schedule flexibility it would be a much more enjoyable place to work for."
good,"it was my job to fill the vestibule with carts for the customers. i started in the middle of June. about a week into the job the mule broke down and i had to push carts by hand. i lost a lot of weight actually. I wasn't directly supervised, but I still didn't get along with management. so they moved me to morning shift. 4am-1pm. best part of the job was when there was no people or cars around I would make trains of around 30 some carts at a time. making the tight turns was a science and it was satisfying hard work."
good,"For the time I worked at Walmart, it was very fast paced. Some good people I worked with. My job was to unload trucks and distribute the merchandise throughout the store. It was riveting and sometimes exhausting."
good,"Although it was hard to get hours, over all it was a good place to work.you received regular breaks, and co workers were easy going.our department manager was very attentive."
good,Walmart is a very set work environment.  Some days are more fast paced than others. They really don't have very much of a hands on approach to teaching new accociates. More like thrown to the wolves.
good,Just lookin for a job that’s not temp that’s all it’s was ok you have nice people to work with and that’s a .…so I would love to find a job that’s permanent
good,As with any job there was good and bad but overall a good place to begin a career. The family like atmospher that Wal-Mart has also made it an enjoyable place to work.
good,Fast paced place to work. Very under staffed. Walmart only cares about customers really don't care about staff. Always short staffed. Which makes it difficult for associates to care to customers needs. Walmart has 35 registers and they will open only 10 that there tells you how in organized management is.
good,"good job if you need to get by. no the best environment but also not bad. if you go there to work and not goof off, you'll do well. not many raises. management doesn't handle things well."
good,"My job is, or was at the time of this writing, simple. I swept the floors, maintained the bathrooms, cleared the cardboard and plastic balers when necessary, even scrubbing the floors and taking care of the trash. I did maintenance projects such as this, but I find myself unhappy with my work. There's just, no teamwork in my current department, coordination for most nights is practically nonexistent. Ontop of that, the equipment used for scrubbing the floors constantly breaks down, and this, ontop of everything else, makes this current job of mine very stressful."
good,Walmart have pros and cons and  they feed you and sometimes have some  activities  And you get good hours and some managers is cool and some or not ..
good,Like most jobs it all depends on you what you get out of it. If moving up is what you want to do Walmart can help. Just be prepared for everything that comes with it.
good,trabaje duro y completando todo mis trbajos y de alguos que lo dejaban incomplto la manayer no beia lo que hacia y siempre brgaba mas con otros empleados mas que con los que le demostraba sus trabajos
good,the managment was decent the coworkers did theri jobs and the store was runned pretty smooth only problem was that we were understaffed and the workload was immense
good,"Walmart wasn't my first job and wont be my last but it gave a lot of chances for advancement if that's what you plan on doing their if retail is your thing. Generally the supervisors are  not good at their job and dont do much to help but bark orders and stand around. Its all ways under staffed for my department and you have to do the work of two people some times you might have to run the whole area you cover alone. If you want them to fix your schedule to work around your college schedule be prepared to beg , and beg because their not too cooperative when it comes to something you need."
good,Walmart pays decent but the management there isn't the greatest . Wish they would let you take vacation time when needed not on their time and days they want.
good,"Summer job, hard word but got me by. Days were routine so everything that was expected for the day was set. Bit unfair as I was moved to be in charge of the grocery freight in the evening so felt like double the hard work for the same pay."
good,"Although Walmart was decent pay for a high school kid like me. It has a lot of tough aspects with it. Management fails to communicate a lot, and customers and other fellow employees can be tough to deal with. You need a lot of patience and self discipline in order to hold a sales associate job at Walmart."
good,"Customers would steal items, and trying to tell the loss Prevention management they would just blow it off like it was nothing. And some customers be caught and they would just let them go."
good,I worked here for a little while and I can honestly say I did enjoy my time at the store even though my hours were all over and never had a set schedule. its still a great place to work and shop!!
good,Great job but compensation sucks if your not in Management. One of the lowest compensation package provided and the recruiting process was a nightmare.
good,I had a great experience with this job and it was currently the only one so far I wasn’t dreading to wake up in the morning to go to. I was constantly busy and never had nothing to do. I loved my coworkers and have now made life long friends because of this job.
good,"Great place to work with great associates and great managers, but  there are too much favoritism that makes it to hard to advance.. Also very slick ways of cutting hours."
good,Work your way through school here. flexible hours and management is understanding of that. They will schedule around your needs. Environment was nice while I was still there.
good,It was overall a pretty good work environment. Unfortunately one Assistant Manager like skewing the rules and ruined the whole experience and made me have to leave the company.
good,It's a ok place to work for people who just start out working . I'm just ready to ready to move on and better myself and income. i really never had a big problem there.
good,It offers quarterly bonuses. You earn paid time off daily according to hire date and employment status. You receive an hour for lunch and two fifteen minute breaks.
good,Good place to work. Communication between employees and management needs work but for the most part walmart is a decent company to work for. Good benefits
good,No weekend off. I have learned a lot with new career in retail store. Workplace are different cultures.This job is hard for face with different peoples and most of them are rude.
good,walmart is a good job .just like any other job its a fast pace job . sometimes unorganized and poor management  which can be really stressful. But overall as long as you are handling you part and being reliable you'll be great
good,"stocked shelves on the display so people can grab what they want ,, i also helped out the cashiers with getting more people through the rush hour and busy nights"
good,Morning shifts go by fast and closing shifts are nightmares. I learned to be straightforward and higher tolerance of being patience. There is a lack of management which is one of the reasons why I left this company. The workplace is always busy with customers which is a great sign for sales. The hardest part of the job would be getting treated differently by management. The most enjoyable part of the job would be giving a customer service and great to see that they are pleased that you helped them.
good,"Not all are the same, but what they have in common is poor management. finding a manager is to find a needle in a haysack. hard to deal when a problems occurs"
good,"Really casual atmosphere, fun to work there. The work was sometimes difficult but most of the time it wasn't that bad, and you have a lot of individual freedom with what you want to do."
good,The management could be better. The people that are the front in CSM's could be picked better. In all honesty working at Walmart was a pretty good experience and the coworkers are what make the job fun and enjoyable environment.
good,Receiving trucks unload trucks stock products. Clean the areas dumped the trash helped out in other areas. Looked over employees put customers first..
good,"Main reasons I left were 1) the management and 2) there was never any hope of advancing. Walmart has a habit of not advancing hard workers, instead they like to promote the people who they tend to favor."
good,When I was an employee the managers didn't value your hard work or input when it came to customer services. And they took out there frustration on the workers.
good,"Walmart orientation was about a week long and thorough. I worked in one department but as I became familiar with my job of customer service, stocking, zoning shelves, returns, shrink, setting up  displays and end caps,"
good,"Until Wal-Mart pays for the cost of living in your area and provides vision insurance (instead of just a discount at the vision centers), just don't do it! I would only work there again if I was paid for my worth and if I was working for the people who actually cared (they have since transferred to other stores or quit all together)! I loved the people...just not the atmosphere!!"
good,Walmart was a good work pla c e but the pay was nor enough for my liking I thought I could do better and the people were nice bug all they wanted was drama and I wanted to work and have fun nto a high school lunch room you know? I just wanna grow work and engaget my knowledge and become something more then nothing.
good,I work in an environment where everything is driven around productivity with tight schedules. It's a very fast paced area with flexibility to the whole work life balance.
good,"Management is great"
good,"I believe that the night stocker position is a secure position, however, I think that they compensate unfairly.  I also believe, atleast in my experience, that management often makes poor decisions."
good,"· Greet customers as they arrive at Walmart and ensure customer service."
good,It’s good place to work. They have  opportunities to advance.  They are willing to train you so that you can adavance. I liked working for the company. You don’t have to work there long to advance either depending on the  department  you worked in most of them was within six months you could take the training to advance.
good,good starting point job for those that need experience.Management is not bad give you alot of opportunity's to move up.Benefits not bad and quarterly bonus are good
good,It is a good job in the beginning but then it starts to go somewhat bad when they put production on you with no freight to back up the production rate. They tend to be unappreciative towards their workers and tend to overwork them without the compensation.
good,"Lots of drama in this workplace. Felt as if I was in middle school again with all the drama occurring between workers. Managers aren’t very qualified in my opinion, and there are definitely favorites."
good,Walmart turned out to be a complete waste of time for me. While some staff members were nice most were very rude. Management doesn’t treat those in a lower category fairly or respectfully.
good,"I was a cashier. Was taught how to use a cash register, how to use the scale on the register and when to check for ID's. management was good, really nice. Workplace culture was different. hardest part of the job was adjusting to the workplace not everyone was friendly or helpful. the most enjoyable for me was that it's fast pace and the different people you get to meet."
good,A typical day working at Wal-Mart is a fast paced environment.  You'll always have something to do. I learned how to operate the cart machine so I could bring more carts in at a time. The management team was good for the most part. Most employees were enjoyable to be around. The hardest part working for Wal-Mart was when the store would get extremely busy and most employees had a difficult time keeping up with customers needs. The most enjoyable part of working for Wal-Mart was that the store allows their employees to take several breaks throughout the day that are paid.
good,"I spent a whole year at Walmart, and while that's not as long as many others, it was plenty of time to get a good feel of the workplace. "
good,"Up until my legs have me trouble, I would say that Walmart was a great place to work, but once I had issues  with them, everything went down hill. I loved talking to the customers as they did to me. I have met some pretty good people out here and I wouldn't trade them for anything."
good,"The associates I currently work with are pretty alright but, everyone is different. Walmart is pretty good at working around school schedules and the single parent schedules or busy in general. The hours are decent and the pay is good for the work that is being done."
good,Few hours and poor management when needed. Managers were always in the back and when they were being called they would ignore it. Personnel was no help whatsoever. They would constantly give you the run around.
good,"Working at Walmart is great if you are young or retired and need extra money. But if you are trying to live and pay bills, it is nearly impossible. You need to work at least another part time job to make ends meet which means no quality of life."
good,My favorite line I think is that the store manager tells the co manager to tell the assistant manager to tell the customer service manager to pick the piece of paper up off the floor....lol
good,It was a good job for the four years I was there.I was just ready to move into a position that did not require working weekends or evenings. Due to injury of my knee it got to be more difficult to do my job effectively.
good,"I worked for Walmart for 5 years, and I can honestly say, unless you're desperate, you don't want to work here. I only stayed 5 years because I wanted to do all I could to get promoted, and when that didn't work, I left. I trained 3 of my direct supervisors. They didn't even understand why I was asked to train them and not just given the job. Walmart does have good health insurance, which was nice. They've also made it easier to call out when you need to. It use to be that you had to call, hope someone answered the phone, wait for a manager to care enough to talk to you, then you'd be guilt tripped for whatever you called out for, before being abruptly hung up on if you didn't fall for the guilt trip. Now you can go on a website and tell them you won't be in. That makes it much easier. I think Walmart does drug test when you get hired, but that didn't stop us from having a high number of stoners working there. Didn't blame them though. Most of the employees were either stoners or raging alcoholics. That's how we all dealt with working for one of the largest companies in the world that still can't pay their employees enough for them to survive without public assistance."
good,"If you're fast one person can do this job, the problem is that if someone calls out they don't call someone to do their shift, they expect others to pick up the slack."
good,"It was a job that allowed me to continue my schooling and make a little extra cash while doing so, I enjoyed the customer interaction and made many friends. My main concern was the management was not always fair towards its employees. I was often having to pick up the slack of the workers who did not care about there job. I received very little thanks for doing others jobs, and often found myself frustrated. Overall, it is a great beginner job and helped me form great customer communication skills."
good,Walmart was a fast and slow pace environment depending on the day or season I usually enjoyed when it was crowded around the holidays because it was a fun environment.
good,"This job was almost 20 years back, it was my 1st real job.  I had great experience.  Management was great at the time.  I had promotion to Jeweler department."
good,"Work was good “ had fun got alone with others “ "
good,"At Walmart the work isn't really all that hard.  Honestly the hardest part was the inconsistency.  For the majority of the time i worked there, i never knew when my next shift was going to be.  some days i would work until 11 pm and then start up again at 7 am.  It was not easy with how few employees there were, and the workplace was just bleh.  There were very few people who you could talk to and really get to know, and they were gone before you really got the hang of things.  I was never trained, i had to figure it out on the job, with a line of customers getting more and more frustrated."
good,Great benefits but lacking in acknowledging hardworking associates. I learned how to use professionalism in dealing with an irate customer and making sure the customer leaves the store feeling good about their shopping experience. The hardest part of the job was having an irate customer who wanted the associate to go around company policies and procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting praised by a customer for great customer service.
good,It was fun place to work at first in 2006 to 2010 I would say .bad management  no kind of organization  they open the door to theft it's just a bad place to work
good,The command structure makes so many mistakes due to lack of communication between managers causing confusion between employees causing stalls and undeserved reprimands.
good,Great job for someone coming right out of college or someone looking to get a couple of extra hours. Early morning start (4am) so you can do your shift and have the rest of the day to do other things.
good,"I was a Auto Technician the job included; Tire Rotation, Balancing , Oil changes, Battery & headlight Installation, and customer service. I learned how to change oil and oil filters, replace batteries and headlights and install them and use 2 pier auto lifts, had a Tech A and Tech B with a supervisor. Only issue was not enough hours for a full time job and my store specifically did not like to give overtime."
good,"I did not work directly for Wal-Mart only in the store as a demonstrator for a marketing company."
good,"* Typical day of work"
good,"In small towns this company is usually a better paying work place. Retail is a labyrinth with no clear path, but it takes people from all walks of life to make it work.There will always be good and bad when you work for someone else."
good,"I enjoyed customer service, but unfortunately the job was not the right fit for me and it ended. I enjoy jobs where I am constantly learning and I feel this did not meet my needs."
good,the jobs has its up and downs. i really only recommend the place for high schoolers wanting to make some money. but unless your goal is a manger or a supervisor its not worth the pay. of all the bs you go threw.
good,If you enjoy a quick pace workplace with heavy customer service then this is the place for you. Lots of changes have happened over the years and continue too as the business grows.
good,"The management was alright in terms of having that occasional manager that actually gave a care about their associates, but really the only reason I stayed was that the people I befriended there made it fun sometimes."
good,"I appreciate the education and experience wal-mart gave me. But it was a hard job due to politics, compensation, and work life balance. Moving out of the company was a good move for me as I felt there was more important things to focus on then whether I was sitting in a chair with all my work completed"
good,"Good for students and people just taking a leap year. Crazy busy all the time, no down time, It gets tiring, get ready for LOTS of coffee. Management is cold and dismissive."
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work for. It don't have good communication between management an workers. They do discredit employees on there work when they are working hard to please management and doing things correctly. Some feel they can talk down to you as if your a child which is mis management to me. I have had some tell at me if I ask for help cause they will give you a deadline with no help an expect you to get it done regardless l. An.if you don't they want to write you up an when you do a great job they want to take the credit for your work.
good,"Fast and slow paced throughout the day, Mainly each day consists of the same thing but there can be occasional surprises or changes in the daily routine."
good,"Ok place to work for but are constantly changing policies  and not always  good , management like to play favorites,  and the open door policy is a joke that ain't suppose  to be retaliation when you bring something to management  but that's not always the case"
good,I did enjoy my time at walmart. I did have some issues with the shift supervisor that were not resolved. For the most part as long as you do your job you were ok. I wanted to leave the night shift and could not relocate to the day shift Hours as nothing was available.
good,"Walmart was a stepping stone back into the workforce after the death of my son.  I enjoyed working there with the wonderful staff and customers.  It is a fast paced environment.  Walmart offers various computer based learning courses i.e.  WHIMIS, Safe Food Handling, Health and Safety Courses, Customer Experience etc."
good,"Overall Walmart is a great place to work,  teamwork is a plus, My days were great! I enjoyed everyday, patient and integrity was a big plus for me good."
good,"It was awesome until big lay off, schedule changes. New management didn’t help either! They took lunch breaks away even on a 12 hour shift! They used to do fun things for the associates, they no longer do anything like this! It’s like they sucked all the enjoyment out of it!"
good,When I was working for Wal-Mart a typical day for me was getting everything I needed to decorate cakes and to do any orders that were needed for the next day. While working there I learned to decorate 2 and 3 Tiered Cakes I have never done one of those before. In the work place you get to work with other departments and costumers. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with production and the orders. The enjoyable part is the people you meet.
good,I was younger and advancement was easy. So if you are looking for a job where they see potential and give you chances to move upward I think it is a good job to do so.
good,Managers would threat you with your job on the line if a single mistake was done. and would get coached easily for no reason. co workers are the best part of the job make it feel friendly.
good,"I have worked for walmart a few times, even in management.over the years the management style has greatly deteriorated from supportive and helpful, even encouraging, into simply checking the boxes on various daily, weekly, and monthly reports. they're so completely micromananged by the home office, that they have lost sight of what got them where they're at, such as CUSTOMER SERVICE, and arre too busy chasing amazon's numbers, and having late reations to market changes, that with the rise of dollar general, they've become nearly irrelevant"
good,"Too fast paced and stressful for the amount you get paid. Not enough recognition for associates and lack of concern thereof. Great starting job, poor career option."
good,Wal-Mart is A Good place to work I liked. The important thing people I work with him make u to love the place .but the problem in walmart the in come and there is no over time in this campny that that bad thing sometimes .uyoy can't find more shouts .this the big problem in walmart but walmart is good place to work ..that why reason make me to looking for another job to me push and to help me more
good,"Meeting and register assignment."
good,"Walmart was better to work for years ago - not so much anymore.  There were more incentives, management was more relaxed, the culture and environment was fun and enjoyable - all of that has changed.  Senior management seems much more concerned with cutting expenses and increasing productivity than with how people feel about their jobs and if they like working there or not.  Working with the logistics side of the company has been decent.  I would NEVER consider working for the store side of the operation."
good,Trabajar en Walmart es una buena experiencia en el sentido del contacto e interaccion con el cliente aplus y la experiencia de roles desempleados.
good,"I worked at Walmart for about 6 months. I would have worked there longer if I didn't tell them I had a child on the way. I was fired because I was inconsistent in clocking in, up to 2 hours. But once video evidence was recovered, it proved that I clocked in with the rest of the Cap 2 Team, the unloading crew, at 2 pm. I found out that I was fired because I had a child on the way. For 3 months they tried alienating me and trying to get me to quit, but I needed the job because of my son. But they decided to stop waiting and just fire me on false accusations."
good,"it is hard for people to keep up with the production quota, especially if you are a smaller person. they change their expectations often and the enviroment can sometimes be uncomfortable"
good,"Stress is high, hours are often inconsistent. Co workers are great. Customers can be demanding. Advancement is possible with hard work. Hiring is flexible in who they hire as long as you pass the drug test."
good,"i pretty much just worked here for cash to save and work experience, learned a lot about my self and met a lot of interesting costumers. found out a lot about the company good and bad"
good,"My time at Walmart was a new experience, a pleasant change, after working many years in a bank. My coworkers were all very helpful and the training modules, I found were applicable to most areas of my work."
good,"Cashiers doesn’t get paid enough for what they go through. It can be cool sometime , but this job wouldn’t be good for a teen because it’s very cut throat."
good,"Employees are like zombies sometimes, they stumble around while I'm there (late night) and they put things on the shelves.   very untalkative, if you ask. most of them are new aswell.    high turnaround job in that area,"
good,"Flexibility is the key to being successful at Wal-Mart.  Daily priorities changed hourly.  Given the high amount of sales volume at any location, there may be days where you will work outside of your department."
good,"Limited benefits, fired easily due to attendance, long time before breaks are given, managers don't care about your health, sacrificed my health..almost passed while working to keep from leaving and getting a point against me so I won't loose my job"
good,"Overall not a bad place to work if you jus wanna make some money. Management will get annoying and job will get annoying as well, however, if you wish to not allow it to get to you youll be fine."
good,"Typical work day is 8 hours with two fithtenen minute breaks and a thirty minute lunch, I learned how to make deposit and loans. The management team is very knowledgable and hlepful. The workpalce culture is laid back and friendly. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with rude and mean customers. The most enjoyable part is being able to help cutomers."
good,Management was personable. I liked what i did at walmart. I was able to learn the different departments and how they worked. Met different types of people.
good,It has good days and bad days. A typical day consists of being on your feet up to 8 hours a day. The people are the best part of the job. The hardest part is the standing around all day when you have nothing to do. Then there are times its so packed you don't know what to do.
good,It’s a fast paced always challenging and changing job. Customer and associates interaction. Quality work place always something different to do. Each day is a different day
good,I felt overworked and underpaid. I worked there 15 years ago so things have probably changed. I was only part time but I wanted to advance and it never happened so I left
good,"Changes to policies a lot. No OT allowed at all. Schedules never the same. I loved working here at first. Things changed pretty quickly. Management consistency changed a lot. Lots of employees left, and new ones come in all the time"
good,Walmart was good i like the working enviroment the people there were very helpful. I learn alot and i have trained alot of people there . Great work .
good,Wal-Mart wasn't a bad place to work and the only down fall was management they didn't know how treat  the employees and the pay could have been better.
good,typical day was okay not a lot of management to help guide you. It was hard to get shifts if something came up and you couldn't work. It was stressful and unfulfilling.
good,Management swapped too much management that had no clue about area gm with no experience too many changes unfriendly people hated working all night not the parts or tools to do job changed were not for better a lot of red tape too easy to get accurances training not like it use to be mandatory overtime
good,"atendimento ao ciente, aprendi trabalhar em equipe, uma politica excelente."
good,Walmart was a stressful job because nothing was never organized. It was always low on staff everyday I came to work.  I could never find a manger or nobody was never in personnel to help me. I hated it.
good,Enjoyed working for walmart.  Poor management needs to train employees and  management.   Store managements that I've worked with weren't good.  Store managers pick and chose who the y want and don't want.  The store managers needs training as well.
good,"An overall good place to work. Hours were good, Management would talk with you when needed,  Favoritism played a big part of your employment. If you didn't fit a certain category chances of advancement were a bit difficult."
good,"I worked on the Sales floor as well as the fitting room. It was a stressful job. I usually came in in the mornings and had to zone ladies department, make sure items were off the floor and returns were back on the shelves. I often did mods and used the rolling racks to put out new clothes or to stock items that were already out. I helped customers out the best that I could."
good,"Working for the distribution center is your typical warehouse, but what really set this apart is the atmosphere, people, and the work schedule. The schedule really helps with school and balance life outside of work."
good,This job was a very important stepping stone to me.  This was my first job in retail type store.  I pushed carts in parking lot and helped with general maintenance as in janitorial.
good,"This was a temp job, setting up the store for a major renovation.  I learned how to stock shelves, high-impact cleaning, inventory and cash register installation (using my computer skills and knowledge from previous employment).  The culture of the workplace was very diverse with people of many different nationalities.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with extremely irate customers (you had to handle them with kid gloves so as not to upset them further).  The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with pleasant customers (showing them around when they're looking for a particular item or answering questions about a product)."
good,"the company has horrible management , the people you work with on a day to day basis have great personalities but messed up attitudes at times other than that the money is great ."
good,"from the beginning it was good to work for them, i don't mind working hard, because i am a very hard worker but when you get push to the edge enough is enough"
good,"Sorted requirements made my job more interesting, the people were friendly and  were willing to aid as much as the could. I enjoyed the various locations I had to work in learning new and different task."
good,I work in Customer Service and has been working there for a year. I make the less amount of money out of everyone working there yet my manager always tells me I am the best worker she has.
good,"I worked there for 4 years.  I learned a lot and had some fun, as well as some times that were not that fun.  Oh well it was a positive experience overall."
good,Management was constantly changing and many times more was expected than could ever be completed in the time frame. Treatment was different from person to person.
good,"Completing daily task also helping customers as well as unloading trucks, I had to maintain counts and completed logistics as needed. My role was suppose to be stock person but I showed a level of customer service that was noticed and I was given more task to accomplish."
good,"At walmart i use to come in, get straight to work. When i was working there i was a cart pusher so all i had to do is collect the carts and bring them back. It was a very easy job"
good,Walmart was not exactly the best place to work for but I still enjoyed it because of the people I worked with and the overall environment was fairly comfortable.
good,Fast-paced environment with short staff most of the time. I enjoyed not having a supervisor consistently over my shoulder. Wal-Mart does not offer benefits to employees until after a specific probationary period has ended.
good,"It’s a great place to make money with plenty of benefits and plenty of great associates, however management there can be a little bit edgy. Managers tend to blam a lot of their issues on associates that are below them and will sometimes treat certain workers unfairly. Some managers will also lie about certain rules to ensure that you don’t succeed or will get fired if they don’t like you."
good,Loved walmart because am a good worker good round others i was a cashier for them did a little bit of a lot tho it was fun very fun hours was good pay was wonderful will love to go back
good,"The job itself is pretty easy. The hardest part is working with people that hate their jobs, it makes it harder for new hires to train. The management I dealt with were pretty blunt and careless about employees problems. But the Store Managers are really nice and caring."
good,"All regular full-time employees are eligible to accrue up to __ paid vacation days during the first year of employment. These paid vacation days are accrued on a pro rata basis – that is, you will accumulate one paid vacation day for each ___ months of uninterrupted service"
good,"Wage compensation is decent for an entry level job, duties can be numerous so that quality customer service suffers.Work hours are sporadic and typical for a major retailer. Overall, a good company to work for if you are seeking an entry level position or are in between jobs that are more skills orientated."
good,Great people good pay comfortable environment easy job understanding supervisors I love it here customers and co-workers are really nice and great to work with
good,"I was an unloader. Job was easy yet active (we got our sweat in every day). Main duty was to unload the merchandise off the trailers (usually 2 trailers non-grocery goods) onto pallets, separating them by department. This would take roughly 2 hours, an hour at max per trailer. Then we pulled the merchandise to the sales floor for the stockers to stock. We would do the same for grocery and frozen merchandise that came on separate trucks. Afterwards, we would help with cleaning the backroom and store picks. It was a pretty simple job."
good,"Customers aren't the friendliest but the environment is stable. No overtime, requested to cut overtime on breaks because somehow it cut into the higher ups pay. If you went over your hours you were sent home early the next day. Lack of workers."
good,Walmart is a great place to work recommend this place to a friend . Some managers do need to be talked to by home office others are better they help all associates with problems they may have and assist with work .
good,The location I was at was overall bad experience I’ve worked for Walmart many years but this last time showed me I hated working there if you like feeling unappreciated be my guess in work there but I can’t speak for the whole company just my last one i worked I’m speaking on
good,"Could become a career, but don't count on it. The pay is minimum/slightly more than. Benefits package has become quite good, if you stick around 6 months to a year to get it. I was part-time status but scheduled for 40 hours. Other complaints, but still better than some jobs I've had"
good,"Walmart Sales Associate must be able to work smart, safe and efficiently and while also working under various management that will switch task throughout the day."
good,It’s on okay place to work but definitely wouldn’t make a career out of it. There’s a lot of conflicts with the job make sure you always stay on task. There’s Always someone willing to help you make the right choice
good,"I would recommend Walmart to kid coming out of school or in college. But if you want to do more In life you can’t stay at Walmart. It’s a great job but the people I work with is all girls, and they think they own me. If It wasn’t for that Walmart would be a great job. Walmart has great  associates and great management."
good,Simple and easy job just the fact that I’m not getting the hours I want. Some weeks I’ll get a normal amount others barely any just really inconsistent with random work days then having to many days off.
good,"as a cashier my duties were to check out customers in a courteous and fast manner, while being vigilant for any customers seeking to steal or provide fraudulent information. I learned customer interaction skills and expanded on basic manners"
good,I was bumped up to a customer service manager quickly. I liked my job. I had my first child while working there. It was a fast-paced store especially during holidays.
good,I learned a lot from working here. The most enjoyable part of the job was repeat customers. You quickly build relationships with coworkers. Hardest part was favoritism.
good,"Walmart is a fine place for a starter job, but unless you are willing to put in years of your life you will rarely be able to move up. Would recommend"
good,"My time at Walmart was good until the change of management. The person they chose to over see tle had always worked for Walmart and never worked in the actual tire industry so had a lack of training in actual policies and reasoning the industry standards (ie. why they were set,equipment used to set standards and team practices). He catagorically would fail as a leader in the real auto industry."
good,Good place to work but need better on boarding for how their process works.  More communication between department management and staff and open door policy without fear of retaliation
good,"The policy for new employees are crazy... Their point system is ,well interesting.... 4Stikes within six months and you are out... I just had a child going to college so I had to take days off... That was a problem.... No compassion...."
good,Not a fan of working here currently trying to find any other job. Insane amounts of drama backstabbing and general douchebaggery but i do love my manager she is awesome aside from all the drama not a difficult job at all very easy if you just do what you need to.
good,"To start off, I love my coworkers they have always been very helpful and hard working. The customers on though are a handful. At my store, they steal, curse,  and are always very unpleasant."
good,"it is nice to work with people that fair for treatment, but sometime you will not get that, that management be aware of work schedules to be fair to everyone."
good,A job you enjoy.I learned a lot I learned to set up machine.I learned to read measuring tools I learned to drive a fork truck or lift.I learned to manage the work and the people under me.I learned to use office machines At walmart I learned People of all kinds.I liked interacting with people.I was taught a honest days work for a honest days pay .
good,Working here wasn't to bad. There were some things that got annoying in the work place like I was pulled from my department to run register or to cover another department that I knew nothing about
good,A typical day consisted of checking in and going to the back to see what all had come in overnight. Then we would get the handheld computers for the daily inventory reports and to see what all needed to be checked. I learned how valuable taking count and keeping track of inventory was. The hardest part for me was dealing with management. Because it seemed there was miscommunication and every manager told you something different. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people i worked with. They kept the day light and doable.
good,"It’s retail....it’s not for everybody, customers are crazy with no consideration management is  ok but when stressed they break and fold with no regar"
good,"As a department manager I was constantly moving which I did enjoy. Unfortunately, we were always understaffed with a huge workload causing high amounts of stress. I worked overtime, weekends and holidays (neglecting my family obligations) with no incentive to keep doing so. I did work my way up from a cashier in less than a year due to being motivated and looking for more responsibilities. I enjoyed training new associates and meeting new people and mostly having my own team of associates to inspire and motivate. I also enjoyed the challenging, fast paced work environment but being understaffed 90% of the time and forced to pick up the slack of other's was very undesirable."
good,Honestly the management at a store can make or break the way a work day can go. good management can make working here a blast or a nightmare. I personally didn't like the store I was at.
good,I loved working at Sam's club. I was able to further my career with the company fairly quickly. the opportunities are everywhere and as long as your willing to do the work you will be recognized and promoted.
good,"This was a great place to work. Really easy to work at, You get plenty of breaks to compensate for the work you do. You get two 15 minute breaks each day"
good,"en mi área de trabajo en cajas tenia compañerismo y ayuda de mi encargado de cajas lo único inconforme era las personas de recursos humanos que no eran flexibles ante situaciones de los colaboradores, mi trabajo era manejo de dinero con responsabilidad a grandes cantidades de clientes, era un poco estresante debido a que eran clientes especiales"
good,"My review is based on the fact I work at an extremely busy Walmart. When driving past other store locations, mine is considerably busier."
good,Being a cashier wasn't my favourite job in the world but I really enjoyed the people I got to work with and the managers I had. They were always willing to show me how to do different jobs in different areas of the store and were accommodating to my hectic school schedule
good,My overall experience working here was okay. I would go back to working here. I just wish you got paid more here. But the work environment isn't too stressful.
good,"A typical day at work is standing at the front either at the entrance or exit door. As a Customer Host you greet, provide great customer service, check receipts throughly, and check in all returns. Within the time I've worked at Walmart my communication skills have gotten better and I have learned that the hardest part of the job are the customers. As a customer host you will encounter a sufficient amount of confrontations, but you have to have self control and know how to deal with certain customers.  And let a manger or even security handle the situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to put a smile on a customer or the over way around after having a bad day and also spending time with co-workers, who become family after spending hours and hours with them."
good,"It's a good place to learn how to do more advanced jobs, there is a lot that a sales associate does and it helped to develop a lot of good, useful skills."
good,"I honestly don't know what to say, I enjoy working at Walmart, my fellow co-works make the job more fun, the managers are some of the most understanding managers I have worked with. I am disappointed that my hours have changed but they gave us enough notice to allow us to adjust. Wal-Mart is a fast paced every growing company they strive to make themselves better to serve there customers better."
good,"I worked for Walmart for only a year and a half and when I first started as overnight stocker It was good, management was good and they trained me good. Because I worked in diary it was a pretty heavy job but I loved it. A couple month ago they moved working in dairy to the morning and I wanted to stay overnight so I got moved to grocery. it was a litter easier but I only stayed there until school started. After I got into school I had to switch to the day as an unloader, which was different. I had no training at being an unloader but with remembering the product locations I started to get better around 2 weeks later. As I was in school my hours dropped and for some reason after I got into school the supervisor and managers started to act different like if they didn't really know you existed."
good,I really liked the people there. We all worked as a team. Also got done unloading the trucks in a timely manner. Also the hours where always good and I liked it
good,"I got transferred to the dairy/frozen area so I would take crates out, and make sure the milks and eggs were full and we had enough out on the floor. I learned FIFO which you have to follow closely so the customers don't get sick or anything. the people I worked around were really good people it was just the new management that came in and started to be rude. the hardest part of the job is unloading trucks. I unloaded trucks for 1year and 2 months before I switched departments its so exhausting. the best part about the job is there are a lot of employees and you meet really cool people."
good,"Working for walmart is a good job for those in high school or retired people, or even those that just need a quick job to pay bills. Learned that is could be stressful as times. Hardest part of job is dealing with all the different customer personalities."
good,"Overall the job isn't hard but when you start bringing in change after change before the associates can figure out one they have put three more on you. They are getting away from being the family friendly that they used to be to more, and going to everything about the business. I think change is a good thing but when they bring out some of the things that have changed and can't explain what to do with out telling you to go on the computer to read what they changed."
good,"I learned that not everyone is a fast worker like me..Management was great! Walmart is an international place to work at, they hire all types of culture around the world!"
good,"I overall had a positive experience here, my manager had a good handle on getting things done. Balancing doing everything you need to do food wise, along with the stocking and dishes can be difficult. Customer service being the priority, I always worked hard to get everyones' orders correct and be as fast as possible. A fair amount of the time though, it can be really stressful with the customers and how they can act towards you. I enjoyed it, and the paid me decently enough."
good,"If you're looking for something that is part time and earn some extra money, fine.  Anything past that, I wouldn't recommend.  They are expecting associates to do more with less, as well as their dept. managers and eventually, it won't work."
good,"They need better management . a lot of managers had a lack of knowledge about the company. Some did not know how set  a proper schedual, They seemed confused at times."
good,"With the right management and supervisors you have room to work your way up in Wal-Mart. The pay is minimal as it is an entry level job. However, with a good attitude the work is easy and does go by reasonable quick."
good,"J'ai occupé cet emploi durant mes études et cela convenait à mon horaire. Cependant, les salaires sont très bas, les avantages sociaux pas très bons, les horaires variables sont moins intéressantes que les horaires fixes, jour,soir, fin de semaine, les horaires changent chaque semaines."
good,"Feel there is some favoritism in my area or co-workers are not held accountable."
good,Manager was always yelling other then that it’s a nice job. I really liked the job but it seemed like the manager didn’t like me I tried to make it work but couldn’t.
good,"Very nice place to work , high on culture and ethics and customer satisfaction."
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading baskets and stocking shelves. I maintained my work area. I measured and cut fabric for customers. Management could have been more involved. The hardest part of my job was not understanding the unloading of the freight truck, and not having proper training."
good,Good job to work but the pay sucks. If we were paid more money then it would be a great place to work. Personally Over night is the best shift to work because you can make your life appointments without having to miss work.
good,. Never enough hours in a day to get the job done.Team work without enough workers. Good benefits such as PTO 401 Health Dental Vision and Tiition reimbursent.
good,"Managers are working more than 50 hours a week on less than $50k a year. A lot of part time “managers,” who don’t work hard and leave slack for others. Follow up wasn’t great. I enjoyed how fast paced it was, but wasn’t making enough."
good,"I have learned a lot working in retail. It is fast pace and change is constant. The hardest part is adapting to multiple changes at once. The culture of the company is built on teamwork, thats the only things can get accomplished as a whole."
good,"It is a good job to have if you are needing money to get by, I would not recommend it as a career but is good to have as you try to find out what career to have"
good,"A cultura é linda, bastante oportunidade de crescimento."
good,I was thankful for my time at Wal-Mart as they were a fast growing company who was very successful. The company was growing rapidly and had lots of opportunities for advancement.
good,I like helping the customers when they come into walmart needing helping finding certain items. Overnight stocker hours would be 10pm-7am.  I like walmart because they know how to treat they employees. Working at walmart you get a discount card an the card covers just about anything walmart sell. If  I got back to walmart I would work on becoming a manager.
good,"I enjoyed working at walmart simply for the people I was able to work with. I also enjoyed the type of work; however, management sucked. I got treated like I was nothing, ignored, or belittled at all times. They don't care about personal issues and are not willing to work with anything which is why I had to quit."
good,"The job was not so bad. I mostly stocked milk and eggs and the sometimes stocked left over items."
good,"I've worked with Wal Mart for quite some time. I worked a few different departments officially and close to 10-15 departments unofficially. So when I say customers and your coworkers make or break your day, they really do. The job itself, no matter where you're located, is relatively mind numbing work that isn't usually difficult. The real fun of the job falls on who you interact with. Most days you will have a fantastic day with nice people who come to chat or ask for help. Other days you're running around like a monkey trying to help and you may not be rewarded with pleasant company if you can't complete miracles i.e. not having X thing in stock, which is the only thing Y person came to your store for."
good,"What makes walmart sorta a fun place to work is the employees. It was a great experience to advance your customer service, learning retail skills and working with great people. Some Management staff is ridiculously rude,pushy and always have attitude. Some are favoritism and only help which ever associate they want to help."
good,Even though dealing with the rude customers were not the highlight of my Walmart job but having to deal with them and getting the satisfying happy ending was a very great award!
good,"Walmart, especially the GHS Department, is all about people. And sure, you may say ""I love people! I am so friendly and understanding!"" ...you won't be. I'll tell you that much. Starting out, you'll find the pay decent, if you are a 20 year old such as myself looking for a place to reside for school opportunities. But mark my words, the people thee will make your life a living nightmare."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is taking care of the customers. I count myself lucky to have experience in multiple departments within the store. As with any job, there can be stresses, but I always count myself up to the challenge."
good,"I’ve learned to communicate more and better with customers & other co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy, it’s hard to try to provide customers with carts."
good,My job was stocking shelves of course that also means helping customers to locate groceries that they've haven't been capable of finding  themselves. Over all a relaxing job that was still worth doing.
good,"High standards with acceptable pay."
good,"A regular sales associates can make almost as much as a manager which I don’t find fair. Also, upper management should take more consideration when it comes to their associates. Overall Walmart itself isn’t a bad company it’s just if you actually have people that care or not that works within the company"
good,"A typical work day is pretty much a roller coaster of stress and boredom. However, the pay is good and so are the people you work with. We split into two teams, one unloading freight from the trucks while the other team works older onto the shelves for customers. I've learned how to give great customer service and also how to unload and stock merchandise."
good,Trabajon en el que hay que tener una gran paciencia ya que se lidia con todo tipo de personas de diferente carácter
good,"Work hard and have your integrity is bring you far."
good,Its good in all to a certain extent. Its really meant to be a job till you find a better one.No career advancement in the picture. Although the workers are interesting makes up for the dissatisfaction to a certain extent. It's up to you though to who cares what I say.
good,"Good paying company, but no lunch available and Management is not available on production floor to address emergency issues and can only be reached at beginning of work day."
good,"Lo que más sobresale de esta empresa es su cultura laboral, misma que insita a mejorar cada día"
good,They have there good managers that actually care about their employees they are getting rid of the bad ones the store manager is always on vacation so it’s hard to speak with her
good,That updated and changed their policies like every single week and just expected employees to know which rules were current and need to be followed...confusing
good,It was a nice place to.work. I love meeting new people  so that was a plus. They just have alot of rules. And they don't play when it comes to customers but that's a good thing
good,"Getting used to how busy it is because it can go from not busy at all to very busy in a matter of seconds so you have to be ready. the hardest  part of the job would have to be when customers are paying different ways, by checks, wic transactions, pay stubs"
good,"i worked the graveyard shift so idk what the typical day at work would be cause i only worked a month there. and i learned that i had to be fast paced and that i need to stock the shelfs before the end of the night. the hardest part of that career was that i didnt have the right type of comfort ware to be the fast pace employee that they want me to be, but the enjoyable part of that job was the company of the other walmart employees and conversating with them."
good,"The management is focused on providing the new models and working so hard on demands of store  that they feel stressed out and very long hours come with it,  communication with employees is horrible. They are little change in everyday operation but no room for error in employees when a circumstance occurs"
good,Loved working here. Loved my associates and co workers. But management and some customers made it difficult to have a want to work each day. Communication between managers was awful and you would get told to do 5 different things and they would all want it done right now.
good,"I like working at Walmart but the hours were inconsistent,  and the a/c units where to low making it very hot in their stores. The black Friday where fun"
good,"Trabalho agradável, vendas externas, adquiri muita experiência no setor de vendas e negociações."
good,Great job for someone starting out in the retail industry. There is opportunity for respect and advancement. Typically you get an hour break and 2 paid 15 minute breaks a day which is needed because the job can be a bit monotonous
good,"Management isn't always the best, I feel as if they don't treat there employees well for the hours you work, not a lot of benefits are given out to regular employees. I enjoyed the people I would meet and the knowledge of excellent customer service. The hardest part would be the non understanding management."
good,"The most enjoyable part to me was when ever I got to work in the electronics and you got to see the new electronics  come out in store."
good,"Depending on what kind of facility you're employed at."
good,"A typical day at work starts when you walk in the doors.  You hit the ground running.  You start with staffing your area, communicating with other areas moving help around the building to run as efficient as possible.  To accomplish the goal for the day, you run your area as lean as possible to meet CPH Goals.  We have a staffing meeting, a quality meeting and housekeeping meeting (walk the building with brooms and dustpans) daily.  As far as the culture goes, the three basic beliefs are still in tact along with integrity being the foundation.  The hardest part of the job is completing all of your manager daily task and spending enough time on the floor with your associates.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working side by side with the associates and building relationships."
good,Nice staff n good working environment. If u need a job fast and don't mind retail go for it. I really like the ppl I work with. I like that their really chill with our uniform.
good,Good place to work with good pay but management lacked a lot not the most team oriented place even tho your told you are a team training lacked  quit a bit and was never good and really high turn over rate so every day was a surprise depending on how many showed
good,I enjoyed having full time hours and retaining knowledge. They help you move into manager if you want.  When I left Walmart I had full benefits. When I went back to Walmart to another state there is no full time benefits
good,"Working as a cashier at walmart is pretty much like working as a cashier at any other place. You stand all day and scan items. Sometimes, if its slow, they'll have you do other little tasks like stock nearby shelves, or help the managers with a display. "
good,It was a little more fast pace than for my liking. My hours would possibly mess with my school work and other things. The management was okay and some of the customers were nice but occasionally there was some customers that weren’t satisfied with my work place.
good,"Management seems to have favorites.  Been there for a year and won't be given a chance for CSM...2 other guys were trained, only been there for a few months.  Always a long line at customer service.  Badly needs a remodel for that area.  Stor Manager is pretty fair and understanding with personal situations"
good,"they could pay there employees more, have better insurance and treat people who have worked a long time with thg hem bettter, like give more opportunities to grow and succeed"
good,"You are always understaffed yet, are expected to move mountains.  The scheduling is terrible, the turnover rate is high because Wal-Mart expects you to do the work of two people."
good,"Good most days, but the worst for the rest. Occasionally some food is provided, for the holidays and safe work place bonuses, but the attitude towards the workers was horrible."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is you clock in, get situated, and then you go to your manager to see what you are scheduled to do that day. I learned my customer service skills at Walmart. Management is a mixed bag. You have your good ones and your bad ones. The workplace cultures is pretty good at Walmart. It's very easy to make work friends there. The hardest part of my job was making sure that the customers were satisfied and the easiest part of my job was scanning the items that the customers wanted."
good,It not so often we get to do mod because they take us to pack out when there are short Staff. But we have mod to do. Also never any equipment to work with. No printer or Tc70
good,very demanding and they work you hard without any recognition. low pay could be better for what they expect of you. lots of lifting and pushing and pulling
good,"A typical work shift at Walmart is 9 hours, which includes two paid 15 minute breaks and one unpaid hour long meal. I was given good on-the-job training for my position, and the management was kind and nice to work with. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast pace of the deli, as well as having to work early some days, and late others. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. They were consistently kind and understanding."
good,The most enjoyable was getting to see and socialize with some of the other hourly associates and the customers who came in during the shift that I worked.
good,They change around management too often it is hard to get a routine.   I had 3 different assistant managers within a matter of months.  The last manager was never present..I saw him 2 times over a month. This was during a very back to school busy time. It was frustrating and definitely makes you feel like the company could care less. Upper management was very unorganized. The company would have guidelines  for you to follow and submit plans but higher ups would toss your plans out and say they were just required for corporate.  It would result in chaos and stress.
good,"It was very busy stocking, facing shelves, and getting the store ready for the day.  While working there I learned about different parts of the store. I enjoyed working with management and learning from them as well as interacting with customers, The work environment was enjoyable. Minimal opportunities for advancement in the company."
good,"I've learned that the only person you can rely on is yourself. Don't get stuck in a job where there's only one of you. Always have a back-up plan. "
good,"It was once an great job, but company has gone a direction in which demands big workforce from a small work pool. Half the time workers have not confidence in what there assignments will be day to day."
good,"Hard work, and very difficult tasks to sometimes reach. Always moving and using a lot of muscles and cardio. It will keep you in shape and can lose some weight! Best things about working here is 3 days off and the money is good"
good,"A typical day would be to read your emails, meet with your managers and plan how many units you were going to receive or ship on that shift.  You would define cases, units and hours to meet a UPH goal that would be in alignment with the companies monthly budget goal.  You would go over safety and production call outs from the previous day.  "
good,"The experience was great but at time the managers  woud get overwhelmed time to time. "
good,"A typical day at work is like any other retail pharmacist job, though from what I have heard from those coming to Wal-Mart from other retail chains that Wal-Mart gives more help than they received at their previous employers.  In California they are strict on the no overtime rule as pharmacists are considered non-exempt hourly employees.  Market Directors seem to change between 2-3 years, in which those higher up decide to redraw district lines and change the other stores that are considered part of your market.  When you have good technicians that know what they need to do then things can run smoothly, but when you have stores with new technicians expect to have to do a lot more to try and pull things together."
good,The job was easy.  Stocking merchandise overnight.  Couldn't handle the hours with having a 2 year old at the time. Employees were nice and easy to work with.
good,"I loved working at Walmart for the first year or so, but towards the end they just kept switching managers and updating so much, it was like you couldn’t give customer service anymore."
good,Poor company to work for in regards to caring for the employee.  Pay rate was not efficient for the cost of living in the area.  Managers were very accomodating.
good,......it is a good place to receive income busy all time if you. Like  working in retail  this is the best one to work for great benefits good 401 plan pto
good,"The atmosphere is pleasant and the job is pretty simple to do, but the lack of competence from management and the hiring staff has created a mass of problems with the fluidity of the job process."
good,The jobs at Wal-Mart are constantly revised as to standard operating procedures. This often causes confusion and a lack of new direction motivation. It is a place that can be fruitful with diversity.
good,"The only flaw in this Hub is that your not allowed to have OT. Work 5 days a week & barely get 35 hours a week, I have kids, bills, rent, & need more $"
good,"I worked in a department where the department manager initially had a lot of power to run the department as a SWAS and we had great positive sales records, tons of happy regular customers, a wonderful workflow, and a team environment. My department members and adjacent were like family and I still keep in touch with most of them after many years. I was given every tool needed to be an expert in my section. "
good,Working at Walmart you have to be adamant about not being run over and intimidated by supervisors. You have to demand you breaks. As long as you are given your scheduled breaks you can have an easy day. But you have to be willing to assist guests at anytime while in uniform.
good,"The work is tough and stressful, and some days the goals management gives you for the day are very difficult to reach, and sometimes they're not even reachable, but it's good work. Walmart also offers decent benefits if you stay there long enough, but with their occurrence system, if you happen to get sick with anything more than a cough or cold within the first six months, it's almost guaranteed that you'll get terminated, because you can't miss more than three or four days of work. So, if you decide to work for Walmart, be sure you are willing to work hard and not let yourself or your family get sick."
good,It keeps you on your feet the hours are flexible but the pay is not so great. I worked the early morning shift it was not bad for the hours to enjoy the rest of your day but it was the pay that made it not the best along with having to use PTO to gt payed for the holidays.
good,Working here straight out of high school was a good life lesson for me.  It taught me how small we really are when the corporation is so immense.  Leave work at work when you go home.
good,I enjoyed working at Wal Mart because of my co workers. I worked with a great crew. The work in the bakery was not difficult but product need to be out in a timely manner. Pre packaged product needed to be rotated and stocked daily. Keeping a clean work area was important. Being flexible was important.
good,Some people dont need to be managers. Some have anger issues and other dont know what their doing. They are very nice and somewhat helpful. The good ones step down.
good,It’s a big company with sometimes unrealistic expectations. Sometimes I feel the company thinks about sales more than the associates and their needs and families.
good,it was a nice starter job for school kids. The hours you get are base on business needs. If you are an energetic person able to handle stressful situations for most of your shift then this is the place for you.
good,Good place to work mangers are ok pay is good having the discount card is really good at Christmas time and if you don't have kids it's great to work over nights
good,Wal-Mart stands as a company of fast growth and development practices. Wal-Mart continues to seek and implement technological advances that supersede it's competition. With competitive wages and benefits definitely a decent company to work for.
good,Loaded and unloaded trucks. Must watch language as foul language isn't allowed. Not climate controlled. Diverse atmosphere which is great. Discount in the stores or online
good,This is a nice company to work for. This job helped me provide for my family. I was able to finish school. I hope to continue my growth in the company.
good,"I received education in Retail Link, excel, excel, PowerPoint and all their proprietary programs.  There was always more work than you could complete in an 8 hour day.  Management pushed their responsibilities off on the support staff but took credit for the work."
good,"unload truck ,put in vault and then start by loading  a cart .take out to floor and stock ,help customers when needed. when finished with truck do back stock and keep work area clean. I learned how to  unload a truck and stock shelves in a timely manner. the department manger I had was great help me with raises, when i was moved to another depart the mangement was so so , was a cost department and wage where to go up but didn't. didn't keep the same management to long always changing. loved working for the customers. my hours where always changing. the people i work with became your family."
good,"Turn over is great because of upper management not being honest, and treats employee terrible. Uses employees in a wrongful way. Very crooked  actions upper mgm"
good,"I worked for Walmart for 3 years and at first it was fantastic, coworkers were great and so were management. Then management changed and they got rid of the good workers and hired unproductive ones instead. I have a medical condition and it sometimes requires me to call in. We’re allowed so many call ins before you get terminated. I was below the limit and a manager called me in the office and fired me. When they fired me, the manager said “I know you have your issues, and honestly, it should’ve been taken care of a long time ago”."
good,Alot of walking but it was workable. The supervisors were cool with you most of the time. Plain and simple. Straight to the point and to the job. Usually chill as long as you were doing what you were told
good,"Customer Service"
good,"I start at 4 am and end at 1 pm, with 2 fifteens and an hour long lunch. I pulled pallets, remove and label all products on pallets, loading them onto appropriate storage shelves or carts for distribution on the floor. I do inventory, pull the carts, clean, stock, assist customers and more."
good,Chez Walmart l'esprit d'équipe semble important. Les employés y prennent exemple alors que les supérieurs manquent de jugement envers l'égalité des employés.
good,"I start my day by setting up the back room to unload trucks."
good,Good company to work with.  Has room for career advancement. Able to learn different departments and job skills.  Benefits are affordable and good to have.
good,"There's worse out there but there is better. I am a 4 year vet. It took Walmart about 3 months to hire me,but only 2-3 weeks to hire this 18 year old with no car and living with parents. So vets, dont bother."
good,When I first started with the company in Everett WA it was a great experience but moving to a different store 200 miles away it was very different not so family like and it ended up being pretty drama filled at the new store I was at.
good,I enjoyed everything except that they had their favorites and I could never advance even when I was promised. I did get to work in a lot of the departments which was better than staying in one place.
good,Decent hours & work environment. Did learn a lot working there. Met some friendly people while working there. Nothing hard about the job. Our bonus was enjoyable.
good,Its an ok environment the workers are helpful and the job is easy .everyone was helpful the store was always cleaned the shelves were always stock i dont like how some of the managers talk to the employees or treat them sometimes as long as u do wat u need 2 do there shouldnt be a problem working for the company
good,"Walmart offers a pretty flexible work environment. Lots of advancement opportunities. Quarterly bonuses when goals are met. Pay rate  is acceptable.  Honestly, can’t complain about my time working for Walmart."
good,"Wal-mart has lots of room for advancement. However, at times the leadership/management is questionable on how they promote. Pay was fair, and competitive. Lots of changes within job culture."
good,walmart is a great place to work if your not in school and thats your career job. I didn't have much time to study for school. your work 5 days out of a week and they will cut your hours down but not your days.
good,The store have friendly in helpfully people all around the store helping everyday. The store have plenty opportunity around the store if you looking ford better opportunity.
good,Many opportunities to upgrade into a higher position. many training and free course such as first aid training and power training opportunities if working in the back room.
good,Nothing to say  bad it’s a challenging job due to who manages your shift. I go in get the job done to my best ability for the company and prepare to to do better or fix anything that was done poorly which never happens.
good,Lost a lot of weight unloading stuff off the trucks and pulling heavy pallets around. Overall was a very dull and boring work day. About the only time we had any excitement was when we were trying to catch a thief stealing off the shelves.
good,I was very grateful to be a part of the Walmart team after the hurricane of 2005 Katrina. I was able to work closer to my home as time had gone by and required less to travel.
good,Nice place to work at and everybody very respectful I just get the job done keeping acsmike on everybody face and also making sure the customers don’t forget they items.
good,I like working here it's good money and good hours. Just not very big on the hours. Waking up at 2:30 every morning to be at work at 4 is sometimes difficult.
good,"It was an okay job for the pay. The customers were horrible and we were overworked for the amount of money we're paid. I was working 40+ hours a week and never brought onto full time, meaning I got zero benefits. Getting time off was impossible and if you did get time off, it was in the middle of the week."
good,"Nice place to work overall, not to many problems, or anything the common person can’t handle. This job is nuc but not something at all that I would retire from or anything like that."
good,"un trabajo bastante bueno en cuestion de tareas el tiempo pasa demasiado rapido, la convivencia y el aprendizaje es bastante bueno, pero en la cuestion social laboral dentro de la empresa es muy acimetrica"
good,I feel workload was challenging with less workers in my area. two to just myself for dry grocery on the sells floor. I was crossed trained and was up for a potential management position for grocery for different departments within the store but grocery i felt needed the most improvement. compensation could be improved especially with workload being high in demand. backroom stock could have used help also.
good,"Working in a retail environment is its own monster, but to Walmart's credit they do what they can for the employees. Your store is defined by its management team, and my management team for the most part were exceptional."
good,walmart es como una universidad de vida. Buena etapa para aprender mientras se continúan los estudios.
good,They will work with you on something but not all things be careful on how you do your work schedule walmart do drug test but only for certain jobs you apply for they will hire anybody as well
good,"If a job is what one wants, Walmart is always hiring. However, moving up in the company is a task in itself as many in management do not continue to move up. This keeps the hourly associates locked in their current positions unless they relocate. The company tries to keep its employees upbeat and yearning to help customers."
good,"Its not a bad job,  I've worked for Walmart twice. 1st time from 2003-2010..  And done everything from sales associate to unloading trucks,  to being a department manager.  Ended up relocating & the drive was to far so I left the company.  Ended up coming back in 2015 it wasn't bad in the beginning,  my hours were okay,  and days off were mainainable,  then changes in policies happened,  and my schedule went in a direction that did not work for me.  So I tried a different job."
good,"if you're looking for a job to get by, then Wal-Mart is the place. If you're looking for a career i would not recommend it because it is very hard to move up and no matter what, most of the higher ups look at you like you're nothing"
good,"This place is great to work, flexible hours. Steady based environment. Not the friendliest employees or customers but other than that the work is easy and organized"
good,A challenge sometimes. A good place to start.  You learn at a fast pace speed.  Benefits are good. Hours can be  hard to balance life and work.   The hiring wage is good.
good,Have worked in a few different walmarts and it all depends on the management. Lots of changes for the better all the time but poor moral for associates and management changes to often.
good,"Wal-Mart has a lot of benefits and gives advancements from my experience. I appreciated Wal-Mart as a hole but, the huge turn away was extremely poor management. Management for me would only do what was needed, rarely gave group speeches in the morning, MC40 wouldn't be turned in properly and no one would get punished for their actions."
good,A temporary job for first job employees. A job like this should not be made out to be a career. An employee should find something better or further their education.
good,"possibilité de grandir dans l'entreprise "
good,"The apparel departments have employees that are completely evil doers. If you aren't in a click don't bother working at Wal-Mart in Chillicothe Ohio. I started out as a zoner; a person that helped with fitting room, putting clothes back where they belong and keep the apparel departments maintained and organized. The job was really good, the employees were not so good."
good,It was a good place for me to work at for awhile. The company needed to be more organized and well staffed because there was a couple times where they moved people around and it lead to having departments understaffed.
good,You are standing at a register your entire shift. But that is the only con. The pay was enough as a high school student and they were flexible with hours.
good,Wal-Mart is a good starting place for someone that needs to build up there resume and work experience. There was not alot of advancement options when I was there but they are present just have to look for them.
good,"Clock in. Check in with manager or supervisor on what to do. Work truck. Help customers. Cashiering when lines up front are backed up. Answer phone calls. Put stock on shelves. Zone, which is where you fix up the shelves for good presentation."
good,It was overall a great place to work. Management needed to be replaced though. The store manager was the worse amd corporate won't give them more hours tp help keep the store running properly.
good,Management not the greatest nor is the pay. Scheduling is flexible and environment is decent. Coworkers make it better working there. Usually fast pace but it gets slow every so often.
good,"Walmart is a great place for students, older workers, or the disadvantaged. They offer employment to those who likely would have no other opportunities. However, you can't expect to ever really get ahead there. But you just MIGHT be able to eep your head above water."
good,"Actividad y crecimiento constantes, participación para eventos altruistas , evaluaciones de personal, juntas comunicativas y no discriminacion"
good,"was pleasant working there but not enough help. worked 3 depts. and was asked to help with more when and if I finished the 3: hardware, tire lube and express (automotive) sporting goods"
good,"In my experience with Walmart, I have come across many types of people. Most are laidback and productive, others are stressful and lazy. For example, I had a department manager who caused stress and drama within the workplace and often had people do her work for her; however, most of the people that I had worked with and for have been helpful and willing to be productive with our time. The environment can be stressful due to the amount of people, customers and employees, coming in and out of the place. With this being said, I have heard many other people talk about how stressful their job is compared to mine, so I have learned not to be concerned about the type of job that I have."
good,"not a great place to work,tomany bosses not enough Indians.they were always on for anything they can find.assoicates there are not very happy there,just go in one of their stores."
good,Typical workday could be slow-paced or fast. The most challenging aspect of this job is the costumer interaction; different personalities requires different approach.
good,"It just had a poor management. I try to find my supervisor to ask questions but I can never find them. They had me as Cashier in my job description, but they had me strung across the whole front end. first I'd be at the register, then I'd be at the door, then I'd be over in self-checkout. By the end of the day, I never wanted to see the place. Even if I needed groceries, I didn't want to see that place."
good,"Walmart's not a bad job,it's easy work with lots of opportunities. I enjoy working there due the fact that I love people and I love working.This job has taught me lots,it's how I gained most of my retail experience and skills. I've seen many come and go and end up returning to work for the company again. In all the years here,it's been ups and downs but it's an all around good job to have."
good,to go in to clean restrooms. after break take trash out from store and parking lot. sweep store floor. than check on restroom supplies so we dont run out
good,Worked temporarily as a holiday helper. Was terminated the week of Christmas via phone with 3 shifts scheduled. Was told all temporary worker were let go. Was hoping for more notice and to be able to finish my scheduled shifts for extra Christmas money.
good,"The hardest part of the job is management, other than that associates are friendly and helpful when you have problems with completing tasks. I learned how to work multiple positions around the store as needed."
good,No los evalúe muy bien ya que algunos trabajadores son un poco envidiosos y la rutina diaria se hace complicada...pero trabajo es trabajo y yo lo necesito
good,"There was rarely time to stand around and do nothing at my last position at Walmart, there was always something to do when my main tasks were completed. Additionally I was often asked to complete tasks outside of my department, which I was fine with when it didn't impede my primary responsibilities. Management tried their best but was at times not available when needed, and it was occasionally difficult to get the tools required to adequately complete my primary responsibilities."
good,Good job for me to start at but now it is time to move on. 30 minute to one hour for lunches. At least one 15 minute break in 6 hours. Safety is a big deal in walmart.
good,It’s not the best job based on the pay but sometimes it’s a very relaxed environment. There is not much bother from supervisors as long as you are doing your job.
good,"El ambiente laboral es bueno, aprendí varias cosas estando en el departamento de electrónica, entre ellas cosas sobre los aparatos electronicos, atención al cliente y varias cosas mas"
good,"It was a laid back job but I need something different, something with overtime option and more experience in another field. I liked the people I worked with and the manager was a nice woman."
good,"Good job for those just getting into the workforce, or those unsure of what to do in their careers, and just need a temporary source of outcome.  Rules, attitudes, and expectations vary by location."
good,"As long as you do what your supervisor ask of you, you will have a good experience.  You also have to be able to adapt to changes often throughout your work shift."
good,"Antes de tudo quero deixar claro que tenho poucas lembranças do período em que trabalhei nesta empresa, porém o que obtenho me permite passar alguns juízos de forma firme. A estrutura da empresa é boa oferece um conforto ao funcionário, a organização do trabalho é eficaz, além de propor um suporte direto ao funcionário no que tange a questões burocráticas, todavia o exarcebamento de alguns lideres influenciava um clima ruim e até uma pequena produção de uma parcela dos trabalhadores."
good,"good company must meet criteria,KPIs etc., Long hours.  work holidays and weekends. Discount program. Good health benefits. Promotions are highly competitive, however you can work anywhere within the company if you choose to relocate."
good,Not as bad as people think it honestly just depends on which one you work at. There is a lot of responsibility involved. I think the rules could be enforced more thoroughly as far as return policy and all that because some managers say one thing while others say another.
good,"Wal-mart has a moderately fast paced environment, and being around the pleasant co-workers makes it a pretty good experience at most points.  However, with customers following the stereotype and store management seeming to have little to no idea how to prioritize or distribute work-loads, it can be a bit more stressful and aggravating than it feels like it's worth a lot of the time."
good,As an Associate I was in Housewares and given alot of support of the management team. I was praised for my efforts in my department and was regularly given new jobs to perform.
good,"Relaxed but at the same time fast paced, quickly moving but not overstressing or overworking yourself.  Assistant management wasn't too keen on giving associates recognition where it was needed, department managers and store manager were though.  Scan and picked items with a TC-70 and stocked items on shelves then made sure they were neat and organized and set up for the general merchandise truck and stayed longer to help when needed."
good,just a lot to do not enough staff and time to do it but you better make sure its 100%.  Some days are better than others but lately things have been slowly going downhill.  They are trying to make changes to make things better and easier for everyone but its a slow process.  It doesn't help that the managers keep changing the process.
good,"at this location, whenever we were faced with problems we could not resolve ourselves, things that only customer service managers, and head management could do,they were no where to be found, leaving us cashiers to improvise and make distractions for our rightfully irritated customers"
good,"Typical Day: Depending on staffing, customer numbers, and management, the typical day is fairly relaxed and mundane. Sometimes you feel overworked and like you're trying to do the jobs of multiple people on your own, other times you wish you could take your phone out to distract you during downtimes."
good,I do not wish to bash or promote Walmart I no longer work there and have no comments about the company as of right now I do intend on going back in 6 months if I'm allowed to come back to my job
good,"too many irate customers "
good,I have had many issues with people there that had no consideration for people who have anxiety or depression and tend to treat you like trash for having these issues.
good,You showed up to work and were expected to perform the job you were hired for. Didn't really learn much as my occupation for them was pretty straightforward. Management was terrible at my last store and honestly they didn't seem to know as much about their department as their subordinates.
good,I worked there for nine and a half years and to not be givin a second chance.i think was not right and i will never work for them again.i did work for this company for many the pay was good so i could support my family and the people i worked with were awesome to work with i was good at my job as well able to do multiple jobs if needed to i was trained in quite a few positions.
good,Walmart was a fun place to work at. I made a lot of friends there. I helped unload trucks every night and kept a count of the inventory in the back room and the sales floor. We would often finish early and help out stocking the shelves or help in other departments. The culture was okay. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with nice people who work hard and the discounts and benefits were nice too.
good,"The people I work with are awesome, floors kill my feet as some days I walk 17000 steps and can't afford new shoes. Walmart also does not support me and my two children. Pay is very disappointing for me as a single mom. We need more people to work at our walmart so its not so much work all the time. I am exhausted alot."
good,"Hours were set, and strictly enforced with no overtime. At the time there were many manager changes in the photo lab. It was a fun job, with decent pay and benefits."
good,"open freight and stock it in designated areas, filled orders and put in shipping boxes send down a conveyor line to be sent out to stores in the D.C.'s it can be hot no airconditioning"
good,Great company to work for however the pay was below average. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships I was able to build with my co-workers and the rapport I was able to build with the customers.
good,"Be very clear about your availability when you start, it will be 6 months(though exceptions have been made) before you can change your availability. If you can't demonstrate patience in stressful situations I wouldn't recommend a position here. Make sure you get as much knowledge as possible about policies but also keep in mind that upper management likes to adjust these policies according to their needs. Overall a good job, pay is okay, depending on the position though hours can ebb and flow."
good,It can be a very fast working environment. Great management. Stressful at times. I work in fresh area it's crazy and most days it's always different. People are nice.
good,"El ambiente es agradable,ademas de que puedes obtener la experiencia que necesitas aunque es un poco complicado adquirir un crecimiento"
good,poor management... not good customer service..... i enjoyed meeting and greeting people.... not enough inventory ...... coworkers didnt get along.....
good,It paid well and a good job but some of the managers didn't listen to there employees when things wasn't right. I loved that u could move up in the company
good,Excelente empresa para aprender y desarrollar habilidades solo que incentivan poco el desempeño que realizas
good,Walmart will give you your full 40 hours and paid time off and some benefits. They are also very flexible when it comes to second jobs and school schedules. They are understanding of time off but your leave an also get denied so that is a 50/50 shot when it comes to leave unless you take a leave of absence. Overall good experience there with my coworkers and management team.
good,"fair treatment with advancement oppertunities very good.fast paced in receiving department.good coworkers,and manegment.not so much for overtime. overall okay place to work if you like retail."
good,"a typical day at work was sometimes stressful, enjoyed working with the associates and with the customers, i learned more about the process behind filling prescriptions"
good,El ambiente laboral está agusto es una empresa donde puedes crecer fácil siempre y cuando tengas la actitud laboral.
good,"I loved the benefits and being crossed trained.  The benefits they offer employee is excellent. I did not like my schedule. Aft3er working there almost 3 years, I was still unable to get decent days off."
good,"Pay as a new employee is good but people who have been there for a while is not good.  That is my biggest complaint.  Working conditions are ok.  Opportunies to move up are ok.  High pace working company.    I have learned a lot about managing people, vendors etc. At my job.  Your work day is never the same."
good,There are some good things at Walmart but what overshadows the good is the fact that to move up in the company it depends on who you know and if they like you.
good,On most days working for Walmart can be pretty hectic. It really depends on the flow of items and coming in and how people work. A lot of management does not want to be bothered with whatever concerns you have.
good,the hardest part of the job was dealing with managements constantly changing. I also got tired of not being able to transfer to another shift and feeling like I had no options.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart because I gained retail experience, however, the store I was located at was brand new and management had no clue what they were doing half the time and then each month or so they would rotate management for each department which did not make things any less confusing at times."
good,"Had good and complicated (mostly complicated) managers, lazy and or annoying co-workers then there were the fun ones. Because of the lack of staff members, a lot was expected and some of the managers were unapologetic about it. Overall it was an okay experience."
good,"To be fair, I will clearly state that I was a contractor and not an employee on Walmart's payroll. I worked in the department adjacent to Sales, so I heard telephone conversations from our cubicle that caused me to have an unfavorable opinion about how they do business. The culture at Wal-Mart is extremely competitive. They demand exclusivity from those who would like to do business with them, insisting that they NOT sell to their competition. If that was not agreed upon, then Walmart would not agree to sell their product."
good,It's a good place to work at but if you want to advice you can't because it cant be at your own store. They also give you 2 paid breaks which was good and helped you if needed.
good,"I have worked for Wal-Mart for 20+ years, and have always enjoyed my time there. I have always enjoyed the relationships between employees and customers."
good,They want you to do your job and once you’re finished with your job. Manager want you to go and help other coworkers in different departments. Once you’re by yourself they don’t try to get you someone to help you
good,As you walk into the Moorning its nice theres some customers shoping. While you get ready to start your process makeing sure your area is stocked and theres no left over merchandise from the night. helping the cusomers find the product as you finish stocking or start pulling the product upfront for the customers can have a better shoping experience.as the day goes by you the most enjoyable part is helping the customers and your associates have a good day.
good,"I didn't really like working there. I didn't like the work environment,  because some of the managers where not very nice. However other then that it wasn't to bad."
good,I loved this place of work I just felt like they were picking ang choosing the workers they wanted to pick but over all I met and worked with some very nice and blessed good hearted people
good,"This company has good benefits, however, since Sam Walton has passed away management of the company has changed.  Management and employee relationships seem more disconnected in the daily work requirements."
good,Started working at Wal-Mart at a early age. Great place to work. They company offers benefits and vacation time. There was always a competition to win prizes.
good,Although the company offers good benefits certain locations do not have respect for the individual and lack in a positive communication in the work environment.
good,"If your not apart of the casual groups, you have to watch your back. Just know all rules and procedures and follow them even when they are being pushed to the back."
good,Pay was good because you get decent raises every couple of months. Sometime it's busy and other times slow.  Fun people to work with and mosy customers are nice.
good,"I enjoyed working there and the people I worked with.  I worked outside in extreme hot and cold environments."
good,"It seemed to me that the regular employees and first level supervision were almost invisible to the upper level. The first level of managment outside the stores seemed to seldom want to interact with the first line folks.  Prehaps that's by design, but a lot of good will could be established if the (market managers) were to communicate with the non-management group."
good,"Change is good is when it's helping the employees not hurting them. Taking away paid vacation, taking away evaluation raises and lying about raises and taking away sick time accumulation is not good."
good,"You are required to stay at a steady pace with how fast so the conveyer belt can keep running. The workplace was more of a plain type. Sometimes if you had a heavy truck with 8,000 items coming down the conveyer belt within the shift hours it may get a little hexed at times."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. good hours and pay. the work is normally easy and regular not to many surprises. My only complaint is the management i was a hard worker and was told by one. that i was there for a free paycheck. because i had a look on my face when told to do another employees job. Witch i did just the look was wrong.
good,This is a great job if your going into your job career or going to school;because they are very flexible with your work hours. Every month they give you paid time off for personal uses.
good,Honestly I didn’t want to leave but basically the members of the team I was on were  mistreated by upper management. Me were understaffed and expect to work twice as hard to cover the fact that we were understaffed. Normally we should have atleast 6-9 schedualed to unload a truck but it got to a point were there was only 3. Management didn’t simpathize with us the just degraded us and mocked how “slow” we were going. I didn’t expect much being a Cap team 2 member but it felt like I was a slaw not an employee. The only thing that made it manageable was my fellow associates.
good,"Hard work and strict but very friendly. A bit disorganized at times and often pulled from one job to go do another, then still have to complete original job even if you need to work past end of shift."
good,I learned working in the customer service field you have a lot of rude people. The hardest part was the rude managers. Most of the customers were friendly. Customer service is a interesting field.
good,Management is very poor and Walmart is not a very fun place to work. It is a very fast paced environment and you have to constantly deal with changes.
good,You have job security at wal mart as long as you show up for work. That's their biggest problem with new people starting. After working those long hours people quit showing ups.
good,"It started out as a good company to work for. As the years progressed so did the environment. Hours were cut, positions were cut all to turn around and repeat past hiring."
good,"The company excels in paying their employees, but the changes that are being made lately have taken away from the employees and negatively affected morale."
good,"Many task a day to complete. Sometimes more than many of us could do. Team players assisted others with task. I learned many skills there which consist of inventory control, how to become a leader, planning, being efficient, adaptability, dependability, integrity, how to manage associates through the success system and time management."
good,"I enjoyed this job, but found myself being pushed to areas I did not enjoy. (Store & an assistant Manager tried more than once to move me to sporting goods from front end). Left the job due to moving out of the area."
good,They have to do better with they point system. A lot of people have kids and when the school calls that parent have to leave or when they have a family emergency come up they can’t come they get points.
good,"It is a good job to start if you want customer service experience or experience in stocking in a fast paced environment. There where times where jobs where assigned that required more than one employee however there were not enough staff."
good,"Deixava a desejar a avaliação salarial, era abaixo do mercado e quando se era promovido sempre vinha em parcelas os aumentos de salarios, dependendo demorava seis meses para receber o salario prometido para a nova função."
good,Its pretty grueling work. Not enough manpower the the amount of work you're expected to produce. Its kind of hard to get cooperative help unless you know them on a personal level.
good,"i worked here for only a few months and it wasn't so bad my job was pretty decent. i did my job cleaning the floors and making sure everything was clean and as long as i did that i was not bothered by anyone in management just customers looking for stuff they could not find or asking for stuff in the back. you can l;earn a lot about the departments you work around as long as you ask other employees and keep that knowledge stored in your head. pay is what is to be expected, minimum wage, and maybe a bit more but not much you can advance through the ranks as much of management has done but it takes dedication to the job and learning more departments and how they operate."
good,"I didnt mind the atmosphere of walmart, it was not by my choice that I left. the managers were good and the coworkers were nice to be around. i would recommend this job to anyone."
good,I like that sometimes we get free food. and two paid fifteen minute breaks with a non paid one hour lunch break. we can also switch shifts. we also get to have more than one position.
good,"The work days at wal-mart are busy and fast-paced, constantly moving. I learn how the manage under stressful situations, while completing various task throughout the day. The hardest part of the job is to stop moving once you get going, the adrenaline get flow in the high-pace work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is team-building aspect, everything is team work oriented."
good,"Was a great place to work, meet people, make friends.  Although I had a great time working there it was hard for me personally to stand for 8 hrs a day due to some back problems."
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you’re looking to have a career in retail. The training you receive will greatly benefit you in that field of work.
good,Walmart was definitely an interesting place to work. The various jobs I did really challenged my management abilities in all the best ways possible. It was just the leaning experience that I needed to be where I am today.
good,"I really enjoyed the job. I was there for six years and enjoyed it. I enjoy the customers and the fast paced position. Would have stayed on the job, but was let go because I had three points. Was told they would hire me back in six months, but decided not to pursue it."
good,Working for Walmart has many pros and a few cons. Very easy to work for and quickly move up in the company if that's what you aspire to do.  Customer service is a must.  Patience is key and always smile
good,"great job not not enough staff, not enough hours .A typical work day consisted of standing behind the register and answering phone calls to assist customer with any questions they had. I learned how to adapt to different personalities good or bad."
good,"I personally loved working at Walmart. I loved the people and the work. It wasn’t hard to do and others made it clear what they wanted done. I do believe that people should get another chance at Walmart after they get fired for something like occurrences. This is why nobody can get a job around here. I think if someone worked hard then management should at least think about it.  I was working, trying to go to college, and taking care of my dying mother all at the same time. It was difficult to do everything and still be on time to work. So I stopped going to college. Then, I lost my job at Walmart."
good,"At Wal-Mart there is always a room for the growth of Association and a lot of benefits. But most management treated Associate like beasts, no respect for Associates."
good,"No room for promotion unless you are doing the job already.. They don't care much for you, just that the work gets done and aren't willing to hire enough people to cover the workload. Managers are mostly nice. Culture in other departments appears to be nice as well."
good,"so much potential to be greater. "
good,The people i worked with were nice and friendly. I waslucky and had nice department managers as well as assistant managers all the way up to my co-manager and GM
good,Fun place to work but need it better security equipment as well as managers that is willing to work with you and situations or need of security help but good with local law enforcement help.
good,over worked and under paid.Had to do more than my job description and wasn't getting compensated for it. I learned to work fast. Hardest part of job is doing more work than required and not getting recognized for my hard work.
good,I would come into work and get with my crew and let them know what they will be doing and as they are doing there task im walking around and checking there work
good,I enjoyed working with the people in Silver City. It gave me the biggest smile to go to work everyday knowing I was there to help people. It was quick-paced and they are definitely on you to get your work done quickly. Learning different departments is almost a most.
good,"Day starts with the plan to unload and assign the stocking of the product arriving on that days trucks. Working with the team in the unloading and stocking process, guiding them in the correct process."
good,This company has very little concern for its employees especially females that are a high risk pregnancy. This company was reluctant to allow me to seek needed medical attention while I was at work ill.
good,"management sucks , store manager not very helpful and always rude. always threatening to coach and blame alot on different people just to cover the assistant manager. alot of favoritism."
good,"An average day at walmart for me involved clocking in and immediately going to retrieve an MC40 which we need in order to do our jobs properly. Afterwards walking the floor and zoning and making sure customers are taken care of. On certain days there would be a truck to unload and I would go retrieve the freight and work it while marking it off of our prenotification sheets. Usually at this point I'm the only employee in my section from about 5:00-10:00, but that just depends on who made the schedule. At 9:00 I would shut down photo lab, zone, retrieve cash registers, return my MC40 and clock out."
good,overall Walmart is a nice place to work. The most important good think I can knoweledge by working at Walmart is the flexibility  of the schedule which is great for a student like me. The manegement will always work with you to get your schedule right .
good,"My experience at Walmart grew me as a person. It only got tough when management seemed like they couldn't help you or just didn't want. My typical day at worked required me making cakes and sweet goods for the company, so I really took a lot out. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is enjoying the money you've made and last but not least satisfying your customer to their highest expectation. I learned to ALWAYS give your best."
good,The hardest part of the job was not having a steady work schedule and always being on the evening shift. The people I worked with were very nice and not a lot of work gossip.
good,"I love what I do, but it is the management team that tears you down. They are usually always angry and they demean you in front of other employees. They are a very members that are kind and care about your climb in Walmart l."
good,Great people with positive attitudes.  Every profession available within the company. Never a dull moment.  Family environment.  Expanding markets internationally.  Global company.
good,"I have been with wal-mart for almost 4 and 1/2 years. I've had multiple titles and rolls in the store. I truly love my job but we were just informed of some changes that are about to happen. With those changes I've decided it was time to start looking for something new. The store manager likes to manage from his office, doesnt listen to real concerns and awards bad behavior"
good,"It was fast paced with minimal breaks,expected to do work that was impossible without any help. Had no benefits of anything for seasonal workers. And had you doing things that you were not hired for."
good,Walmart is a great place to work with lots of great opportunity however very stressful as you advance.  Job is always challenging and company is constantly evolving and on the cutting edge of retail to deliver the best customer experience possible.
good,I didn’t want to leave the company but they refused to transfer me to a location that I moved to. the manager was not willing to comply. I didn’t understand why so I had no choice but to leave
good,It is a good job and good opportunity for advancement. The only real problem that I had was the inconsistency of the management and they were bad for picking favorites. I think I would have liked to stay given the chance to move departments or shifts.
good,seems that no manager is on the same page and constantly blame the subordinates very pro drama area for everyone including management the pay was good but they wouldn't give many people good hours
good,Advancement is very easy at first not the best time to go up the ladder with the current layoff culture.  Hours are less flexible than ever before.  That's all I have to say about that.
good,This place can be good if you are willing to work. There are some very nice people management is difficult at times. For me hardest part of the job was nights. The good part was the workers.
good,hard work  a lot of cleaning  moving things  helping store  to remodel did zoning set up displays  also  did some painting unload trucks and did some stocking
good,Walmart gave me an opportunity to experience a different side of the work force. I had never worked in retail and was used to doing the more labor oriented side. It was a great experience but not one i would be interested in growing in.
good,"Photo used to be really simple and fun until they mixed it together with the online delivery then it became a freaking mess. Lack of staff to do it, the orders were all over. Just wasn't fun."
good,"It is a very routine job, you do the exact same things every single day over and over again. Management doesn't care for the staff as people. My coworkers were a very negative group of people that I would actively avoid. It was not a difficult job to learn and began to get boring after the first week."
good,the work sometime can be very hard. Management could be very unpleasing. I was able to work with other people with know problem. Cashiering is not eas
good,"I really enjoyed working for al-Mart there was room for advancement. It was hard sometimes, but there was a lot to learn. The not accepting Dr's note as reason for absent is unfair."
good,"Honestly I loved working at Walmart because of all the great people you meet and work with and you end up creating long lasting friendships. But the worst experiences I have had while working there was dealing with management who treated me and coworkers like garbage on a regular basis. There was even a manager that would constantly flirt with the Dairy Associates and made everyone uncomfortable which caused a female employee to quit. Overall, Walmart is a great place if you work in Store Standards or any position that doesn't involve a lot of contact with management."
good,"When I was working for Walmart I was on Cap Team 2. Which we either unload trailers or stocking product on the shelves. They always put me stocking product, but they would come by and tell me to stock faster or you terminated."
good,"hard working job with a lot of great employees as well as many terrible ones. the job takes a lot of hard work, more than most people want to put in. pay needs to increase a bit."
good,It was okay of a job with great people working it made the environment friendly for all people that was working for the company and a great place for teens
good,"Compensation is better than industry. Poor work life balance."
good,I like it because I got to decorate cakes and I learn from it. I got to bake a lot of delicious sweets and try them especially when they are new in the store.
good,Fast paced work environment. Managers are helpful. Training questions answered in a timely fashion. Managers back up decisions made by the cashiers. Breaks are given as store and corporate policy. Every Friday is free donuts in the break room.
good,Lots of learning opportunities within the company. Consistent track record of positive results which means good bonuses every year. Some company policies aren't great for exmp you need to stay 2 yrs on a certain role in order to move to another. Like in most places it depends on the team but if your coach isn't very supportive of you you might get stuck in a position for a long time.
good,"A person can try to have set hours, but management doesn't really understand what it means when a person needs a day off.  And if someone has to have a day off then all the others are expected to be alright with that person no calling/showing up for their shift.  There's barely any communication with management and it would easily drive any sane person with a sense of pride in their job insane.  It would be a good place to work if they actually bothered to have people on the clock instead of a skeleton crew all the time."
good,"It was a good job as a student as it was a secure job and the managers were willing to work around my classes and accommodate my school life in most cases. It was extremely fast paced during peak hours and holidays, but the management did try to get all employees the breaks they needed in a reasonable time and worked to get everyone out around the scheduled time which was nice. It was a very good first job and I enjoyed my time there as well as the experiences I had."
good,It was a difficult task with very little pay for what you're doing. Your job is basic but it's extremely unreasonable the tasks they want you to perform.
good,"You'll go in expecting to make a difference at the management level. However, you'll end up being an overpaid stocker. They don't care about your personal life or your family. If you make a mistake, they will write you up in a heat beat. If you just work your scheduled hours (55 a week), and leave on time, you'll be called an hourly manager. They want you to work your days off. There is no work life balance, as you do two 7-5s, one 8-6, and two 12-10s. Then you get a day off. You get two days off together once a month. They have a great open door system and you can take your concerns to the CEO if necessary. It's a thankless job with mediocre pay."
good,"A typical day at work would be processing returns, exchanges, domestic, and international money transfers, bill payments."
good,"At Walmart, employees are expected to provide excellent customer service, as well as complete daily tasks in a timely manner. The work was often doable, and when requested, help was given."
good,Great staff and good and safe environment enjoyed working there while it lasted wish they had better uniform and more departments in the store or more like a warehouse
good,"My experience at Wal-Mart can be summed up as tiring. For months I was working some days by myself maitining the entire store, another time i was working 6 days in a row but scheduled in a way where I was still getting 40 hours a week."
good,A typical work day is stocking and cleaning shelves while protecting and selling merchandise. It sounds easy until you realize that during the summer and winter months Florida is a tourist location. therefore you tend to be swamped with customers with demands and questions. If your not patient and friendly you might feel overwhelmed.
good,"Good experience for beginners in retail. "
good,"A Hand Full Of People I Worked With Were Nice But The Others, Especially Upper Management Were Not Friendly At All And Expected Me To Do More Than I Could Even Tho I Was Already Doing 2 Or 3 Times The Amount Of Work More Than 99% Of The People There. But Some Of The Managers Were Really Nice In My Department And They Saw How Much I Was Doing."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job here was when things were busy and there was not a lot of down-time. You got to know your customers, help people in a timely manner, and get things checked off your list for the day. The hardest part of the job had to be the amount of stress some days put on you, with customers being unhappy or belligerent, management either speaking down to their workers, the feeling of being easily-replaceable after years of dedicated and hard work, and the time required away from your family during special times of the year (holidays)."
good,I can't review Wal-Mart as a whole as I've only worked in one location. I dislike the new scheduling program and the management can be lacking at times. The associates are fun to work with and we have a lot of laughs.
good,I recommend Walmart if you’re fine with working with no weekends off. Walmart is a well paid job you get good hours but the workdays are what will get you.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Wal-Mart. Fast paced , friendly co-workers and management. They basically worked with my schedule and were flexible. Pay rates was reasonable"
good,"A typical day at WalMart  would be arriving to work, having the shift meeting and getting to your duties until your first 15 minute break. In the middle of the day, you'd take your lunch, 30 minutes required but you were offered  an hour. The last hour of work, I would zone the areas to make sure they were nice and tidy."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart for over 10 years has had its ups and downs. Great compensation and benefits, but is it worth the toll it takes on family life. Your position will only be as good as the store manager you work for....."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you are going through school or just need a part time job for some extra cash. However, Walmart does not provide steady hours or enough hours for a permanent job. It is extremely difficult to get a set schedule and it is highly difficult to successfully request time off. Also if you are sick, not even a doctors note will excuse you from consequences."
good,"Whether it's good or bad day, this job will make sure you work and not sleep around when you want to, especially dealing with customer service managers on the side. Other than that, very decent job for the money."
good,I worked at Walmart right out of high school. It was good for the timing for me. I really liked my bosses and co workers I just got a better job option with more pay and first shift.
good,"Enjoyed the other associates that worked at the facility."
good,working the weekend shift was great having 4 days off each week and the starting pay is pretty high with raises every six months. very fast paced work trying to meet production.
good,"It's an okay place to work. It pays the bills. No i don't think you get paid enough for the price of living here in Panama city, Florida unless you plan on living at home for the rest of your life. I enjoy being able to get everything i need to get done and go home. The job isn't that facinating and with management it can get quite stressful."
good,Walmart was my first job and I liked working there it was fast paced and pretty busy. The coworkers are nice and helpful the managers are ok some have bad attitudes and some are very friendly.
good,Over the years I have learned many things working for walmart. Before i came to walmart i was truly a quiet person but i have became someone that talks more and brings smile to customers and coworkers as well.
good,"well you clock in and go to a meeting, then you find out what your tasks are and you go start on your task. I have learned that when you need help there are lots of people to help, most of the time you keep busy with the tasks that are given to you. management on nightshift is great the work super hard to make sure they not only get there tasks done but help others if needed, one manager I had when I worked overnight was fair but firm she was willing to help you out if you needed it or she would provide you with help. I think the hardest part of the job was when I first started working there and customer's would ask me where things where and I wasn't sure but being there for a while you catch on pretty quick and are better able to help them. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team at times there would be an off night or two or there would be times where work load was over barring but with the help of my team it was great."
good,I only worked here for 3 months and I felt like they made the job sound super cool when in reality you just worked in the electronics department. I hardly actually worked with the printers or photo department which was disappointing.
good,"easy work, just have to do your job and stay on top of it. Don't talk to managers much because I work outside. Breaks are nice when you actually get them because you aren't working during the busiest part of the day by yourself due to poor scheduling."
good,"Although you try to get the sense of inclusion in the facility, a feeling of alienation can be felt when you are the only one not to only further your goals but try to better the lives of your associates.  Make sure it is the right career path for you before making a decision to work in this environment."
good,starting the day is easy the issue is some managers make it stressful when its not needed. i have my good days but its time for me to start something new
good,"Walmart you get to meet alot of different people and cultures. "
good,"It was always fast-paced, never boring, a family orientated company, friendliness and teamwork were the premier objectives, as well as customer service."
good,"I was a cashier at first then I moved to the backroom because I wasn’t getting enough hours ! Working in the backroom is very hard work! It can stressful but, its a job"
good,"Walmart was a fun place to work, especially cashiering and meeting new people every day.  Once you get to know a customer, the job is so much easier. It was fast-paced at the front-end, so a lot of energy was needed.  The workplace culture was very diverse, and it was nice to meet people from different parts of the world."
good,"Fast and friendly service is what i gave to all my customers. I always upsell and give the best prices imcluding discounts for certain items. I was doing management job for a little. I was also a lube technician changed oil, to tires."
good,"as a cashier, the work is routine. I learnt how merchandise is handled. Management uses a micro-management style. The workplace culture is friendly. The hardest part of the job is standing for an extended period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers."
good,"Long work days and worked most holidays.    They made improvements to salaried managers time off but it still had many ""black out"" dates as well as individual store managers still had their assistants work often on days off and didnt want to give allowed time off."
good,"Walmart was an interesting place to work, the people that you work with and help as customers each day are all unique and interesting. Being a cashier i was never short on opportunities to work"
good,"It was stressful at times, had fun working with different people, meeting new people. My job was steady. I would recommend if your looking for a quick job."
good,"The key duties undertaken by Walmart cashiers upon hire concern various aspects of customer service. Primary roles include scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers."
good,"If you are flexible and willing to learn, you have many opportunities. There are various job areas with new things to learn and do every day. Huge opportunity to work with many different individuals."
good,Very fast pasted and hardworking. Showing enthusiasm will get you overworked.  Very nice people but many don't last long. Graveyard shift is very tiring and will overwork your body.
good,I liked my job at Walmart. I was very good in the Quality Assurance Department. I was working too many hours a day without any adequate time to sleep and rest.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you don't mind customers complaining. Too few cashiers, shelves not stocked. But, managers are willing to train you in other areas if you desire. Also, being friendly and outgoing is a plus."
good,This is the only job I was set up to fail everyday. There was always more work to do than time to do it. Management didn't seem to talk to each other. Always a different directive from each manager above you.
good,its a job to  start off with but you cant take care of your family with this job i would not go back because my family has grown so much but it is a layed back place to work if you are young and in school .
good,WalMart keeps me on my toes. I work fast paced through out the day and attempt to complete my job to the best of my ability. Its a great stepping stone but im ready for more...
good,"Typical Day at work; unload the truck, brought freight the sales floor, inventory control with integrated computer system."
good,"Pay is good, co workers are mean I was harassed alot working there which caused me, to feel like i wasnt wanted there at the willow grove location. The managers also lhave favorites.  I wanted to transfer but became uncomfortable and stopped going."
good,Started working in may 2016. The atmosphere was alright the managers were friendly. Loved coming to work. the time was going fast. Hope to come back to work .
good,"Walmart is a job i would recommend to someone starting out"
good,"Trabalhar no Wal mart e bom, tem beneficios bons, e crescimento profissional."
good,very busy no help left alone from 7 to about 2 by myself I have to help out with money center doing customer service helping out with lines on the registers
good,Working at Walmart was fun but stressful. Some of the managers was rube and disrespectful but I never once disrespected them back because i am better than that. What I did learn working at Walmart was to have patients with people in general.
good,i love working at Walmart. however I hate the way management treats the workers and how some things are so disorganized. I go to work and come home and that is it.
good,"From the start to the end of they day you are busy working."
good,Laid back. Easy going atmosphere. Always something to stock or someone to take care of. Willing to work with your schedule and your needs. Friendly staff.
good,"greet people, people enjoyed talking with me. management has to many people at the head . part of job is not being able to progress in the company. visiting with people."
good,Terrible hours. Lack if compassion no  advancement bad work environment.  No understanding in unexpected circumstances. Lack if acknowledgement when a job us done well
good,"This job could be stressful at times you have to be versatile. You sometimes had to do different jobs.  Sometimes changing roles immediately.    The job was fastpaced, having to deal with customer issues along with employees issues.  Rollover was a with employees was constant."
good,I interact with both coworkers and customers politely. I get all my work done then I leave with no conflict.  I don't have any basic problems. my day runs smoothly and everyone works together just to make time and the work process easier.
good,"Madison East Side Walmart is not the worst or the best place to work. It is usually busy and customers are not always friendly. The shifts are flexible, but the store is generally understaffed."
good,"Good managers and co-workers"
good,"*The most important and enjoyable part of the job is the customers"
good,Going into management makes you see an entire different side of the company. When first started with company loved it. Then as years went on the culture started to change. They got away from the Sam Walton culture.
good,Salrios bajos y pocas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,This company was good about placing me into another department when corporate cut my hours back in the department I was in. They are strict in their attendance policy and stand firm when it comes to protocol and policies in regards to attendance and tardiness. They recognize hard work and dedication and reward their employees that are good in their performance.
good,"My typical day at work is mostly about customer service.  I work in a pharmacy setting, so I have learned a lot about prescription drugs and many over the counter medications."
good,"A typical day would be getting clocked in and seeing what things the supervisors would need us to do. We would then gather around 7-8am to go over today's announcements and do our store cheer."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work for someone without young children and can have open availability. There is no sense of seniority. Job is based on performance and availability. Employee appreciation is lacked by some members of management. Working in produce is one of the most easiest jobs within the store; but, requires heavy lifting. My coworkers are a pleasure to work with and I generally enjoy my job."
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work. Me personally the only thing I highly dislike is the amount of hours a day you work. One week you can work 6 days and then the following week only work 1 day, but within those 7 days you may only have 4 hrs per day depending on what they schedule you for."
good,It was very interesting to work for them and it takes a lot of patience and care for customer service work.I would work for them in the future if I could.Appreciated  the time I was employed there.
good,"I work as a pharmacy technician for Wal-Mart. It's not a bad job however it takes a great amount of patience, understanding, and passion for taking care of people in order to make the most of the position."
good,"Work life balance is non existent."
good,"I enjoyed the benefits and work that I preformed at Wal-Mart. The biggest concern that I had with working was the people I worked with. Almost none of my fellow coworkers were concerned with helping customers or performing quality work. I know this experience is different from Wal-Mart to Wal-Mart, but my Wal-Mart had bad employees."
good,"Great people to work with. Helpful managers, coworkers worked as a team when needed. The hardest part of the job was putting out product and there was no room for it. I learned to problem solve."
good,I have worked at Walmart for three years and will continue to seek transfers to make more money. The people I work with are easy to work with (still unskilled work).
good,"The 5 week Academy training program is better suited for those who have already worked for the company for some time."
good,Walpeoplemart was a very good place to be employed.The management were reasonable with the work force.The hardest part was the physical work and because i am a people person the relationships with the people were the most enjoyable part of my experience of the job.
good,"Wal-Mart can be a great place to work.  A typical day at the store begins with everyone getting involved during the morning meeting and chant the Wal-Mart Cheer.  Once disbursed each employee go to their perspective departments and begin zoning (finding ways to maintain the store appearance and department layout).  You can learn a lot at Wal-Mart and get things accomplished by working as a team.  It is a lot of work though to maintain each departments sales floor.  But, it can be enjoyable being surrounded by all the friendly faces who suppose to be there to provide shoppers with the best shopping experience and practicing the 10 foot rule.  I've seen the management team come and go.  But with a reputation like Wal-Mart only the most warmest and friendliest will do.  You must smile all day everyday.  If you're not doing these things then you will be ousted faster than you can say I quit.  So If you ever get a job at Wal-Mart just remember to always put the customer first."
good,Very solid environment. They should raise there pay rate and help employees do much better. Very safe environment and they depend on employees to work
good,"Walmart was a great learning experience and helped me to develop and broaden my HR knowledge . It gave me a sense of security , as well as, strengthen my communication skills. It was a great building block for my career and helped me to discover my passion. PEOPLE. Eventually you outgrow your position and when you decide to leave you are almost punished for that decision."
good,"For me Walmart is fine for a part time job but, i wouldn't recommend making a full on career from the company itself though. Its a decent place to work at but, its all depending on what type of management you have like most jobs."
good,"Working at Walmart is often times stressful and exhausting as a cashier. This Walmart is the only one in Charleston while most cities of comparable size have 2-3 Walmart stores. It leads to a busy store where you will scan purchased items 2-3 hours straight  between breaks with no gap between customers. You are standing the entire shift and floors are tiles laid on concrete so it leads to body pain. Management is disconnected from the staff somewhat completely and has the expectation that employees work at all times and even if no customers are checking out a cashier must clean, fold clothes, and/or recruit customers to cash out at their line. The work environment is very often toxic and discouraging with poor to no communication between management and staff as well as multiple social cliques that are present in the workplace. Lateness and absenteeism is scored on a point system where even a proper call out using a sick day in many places of employment is accepted and understood, but Walmart penalizes the employee regardless. Many cash registers have broken belt switches and scan guns and the plastic bags provided at point of sale are very difficult to work with and lead to lost productivity. Walmart does provide each employee a discount card after 3 months of employment, quarterly profit share based on sales, provides frequent online training for store policy, offer career and education opportunities for those who are interested and occasionally provides some shifts with a holiday meal or promotional items, but the number of provided material is limited so most do not receive."
good,It was ok. Sometimes there was not enough people working.It was fast pace. I loved it because I was always busy! Management kinda sucked at times but they helped in the deli too.
good,The Walmart is a great place to work in Canada. It is one of the top 3 retail chain in the world. Nice supervisory and managerial team always able to help workers.
good,"its was ok, transfered from texas to florida walmart and things, for the most part was the same. i like to customer interaction. small conversations help pass the time at work from different people."
good,The industry was a little overwhelming. If i could go back I’d definitely would consider. The employees were friendly as well as the customers. They’re all about teamwork
good,"started working with 9 hour days (minus an hour for lunch) but have gotten cut to 4 hour days, lower management would be great if they didnt have to take so many orders from upper management. if you get sick and miss more days than your allowed a doctors note wont save you. breaks are nice and the discount can be helpful, if the product youre buying is covered by the discount card"
good,"Pick up returns, make sure they get to the right department. Work freight sometimes, help unload trucks. Make sure there carts for customers, make sure there is no long lines for check out."
good,"Breaking down pallets & stocking meat case..I learned inventory, Management was fine, culture was good, Down stacking pallets . Seeing that all tasks were completed."
good,"My walmart that I worked at was great! I met good people, and it seemed like management were real human beings and not robots. Customers were okay but other than that I got to goof off a lot."
good,"I learned to work at a fast-paced, and developed time management. Also learned how to deal with customers and managers. I learned to sell products based on the best options and quality."
good,"I was on the cash register the entire shift, 6-8 hours. I would stock the counter by my register when I had no customers and had to keep the area clean."
good,be careful who you trust and what you do because when it comes you and higher management they will sacrifice you to help themselves. And if you live in a small racist area I truly say be careful and mindful because depending on the nature it could mess you up for life things they may do. As for the most part it is a decent honest job. the work is easy and pay is more then most.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was great. I love fast paced work environments and it gave me that. It also let me be creative at time which I like. I really enjoyed being able to interact with the customers.
good,"There is no typical day.  The position is fast paced, exciting, and challenging. This store is very high volume, and requires adaptability."
good,I worked for Walmart for 11 years. I been in several positons with this company and the overall conclusion I got from it is more. All they ever want is more nothing is good enough for them.
good,The hours you work are kinda ridiculous especially if you work the weekend shift. Either AM is 3:00 AM- 3:00 pm or 5:00 am to 5:00 pm. Or the night shift is 3:00 PM- 3:30 AM or 5:00 PM- 5:00 AM. Very rarely do you actually get out and go home at those times which can be very stressful. But having 4 days off is very nice if you work the weekend shift. They do have a 3 year rehire period if you leave so be cautious because I learned the hard way.
good,"You work 8 hours a day, sometimes you matter work 40 hours a week, sometimes not. I feel we don't get paid enough for the work we do. Management is not good but ok though, could be better, the people you work with are cool. Have to unload trucks every day."
good,Days at work vary from day to day. Communication varies depending on the manager you are working with. Policies and procedures are pretty much standard for retail.
good,"too much expectation on workers, almost no room for errors. must be religiously punctual, too early for days shifts, pay is good, hours re not steady,"
good,"Every day was full. I was always busy."
good,Working for Walmart is a Great Company to move up in and develop a career if desired. Always  interesting and enjoyable environment  for the most part.
good,"It was a fun experience, I made some good friends, built a good relationship with managers but I wouldn't want to stay for long term though. It was a humbling experience."
good,"Walmart isn't too bad of a place to work.  Most of the employees are nice and helpful.  The main complaint I had, during my time there, was that they would pull you from your assigned job to run register and not allow you the needed time to finish the duties you had in your area."
good,the managers were pretty nice and help you when in need. the people in the town however were not so desirable to work with. They were rude and obnoxious .
good,"Walmart is one of those places where you are expected to move a mountain with only a shovel while on a unicycle. Add angry customers (there's always angry customers) and you have yourself a really frustrating day. That being said, I personally think that everyone should work at Walmart at least once in their life to learn extreme patience and overall learn how to work with the general public. That tool has helped me personally through life and taught me to keep a level head when a customer is in your face. I've learned to not engage in their argument if you get the sense that their soul purpose of being at Walmart is to complain to someone. It's a good starting place for those who don't have employment, and I have high respect for those who have worked there for years and years. It is a thankless job. But, there can be some really nice people who are very appreciative of the work you do. And you look at those people and think, ""this is why I do what I do."" I have made some amazing friends who work with me. There is a family at Walmart within the coworker atmosphere. Management can be very inconsistent, or expect you to know things there's no way you'd ever know. That being said, overall I think Walmart is not an easy job, but it can be very rewarding. The hardest part is doing the same thing day in and day out. It's hard to stay. But if you do, you won't regret it."
good,"The management at my particular wal-mart is terrible"
good,"Overall a positive place to work with great benefits; such as health care, dental care, and 401K. Management typically works with you and is willing to hear all concerns. Pay and hours are great if you're looking for a place to work that has guaranteed fulltime hours."
good,"It's not really a job I would say I really enjoy but you would like it if you are a people person.  Management at our store isn't the best but they will work with you if necessary, you just have to find them and keep on them about what you need.  Customers can be rude at times but nothing too serious.  I would just prefer to work in an area with not as much face to face customer interaction."
good,some store and markets have a good ol boy mentality.  If you are not liked then you will not succeed.  They are not loyal to the associates the way the associates are loyal to them.
good,Never enough staff.  Long hours for management.  Work almost every weekend including holidays.  Lunch is not given. The people are good people and you make a lot of connections.
good,"All employees can get benefits after 3 months. Pay is minimum wage plus 0.50 for every year of work you've ever worked. "
good,"Has some wonderful people that are willing to go above and beyond for the most part.  A good day was made of good conversation, People working together to get timely tasks done, and Customers being checked out with no waiting and a good overall shopping experience."
good,"Management went downhill as time passed. Poor decision making and lack of discipline where it was needed. I'm sure other Walmarts are better run, but at my store the management was lacking. Alot of unrealistic expectations of workers."
good,Buena empresa excelente oportunidad de aprendizaje
good,"Es una buena empresa para generar experiencia en cualquier ramo logístico o de ventas. "
good,"Met alot of good people, loved the customers as well. Fast paced work most nights and learned something new every night. Management could have been a little more helpful and alot less rude."
good,Work is consistent. Benefits are good. Pay at the distribution centers are good. A lot of policy changes have been made over the past year. I feel it is time for me to move on.
good,"A typical day at work included the store was clean, the store was stocked with carts, and the washrooms were clean. I learned how to do more physical labor easier, and quicker."
good,"Show up for work and get paid a low rate of pay. Opportunity for advancement. Profit sharing and stock option very generous. Less that great medical. outside of low pay, job is satisfactory as a part time position."
good,Fun place with growing career opportunities fast paced work environment with multiple tasks to keep you busy throughout the work shift. Great people with enthusiastic personalities
good,A typical day would be shopping for the customer and dispensing their order to them while providing good customer service.
good,It was an okay place to work. It’s retail so you have your good days and your bad days. For the most part I was able to get along with management pretty well and was able to move up pretty easily. If you work hard and network you can move pretty far up in the company.
good,"it’s a good place to work for but no overtime 🤦🏻‍♀️ even if your on the clock past 40 hours you won’t get paid for the time you work . that’s pretty much my only thing about walmart fr , but other than that it’s ight"
good,"My typical day at work is stock freight, help customers, and do anything that the manager says needs to be done. What I have learned from my job is dealing with all sorts of different people."
good,nice place to work you just have to be willing to deal all sorts of different people. hard work goes a log way but you can advance with this company if you really want.
good,"While I enjoyed most of the people there, and I personally never dealt with a difficult customer (not that nobody there hasn't), the management was poor, with people that didn't belong as managers. I had confirmation that one such manager only worked the job for a paycheck, and that kind of person is horrible for a company, and unsurprisingly, this particular manager wasn't liked by hardly anybody at the Wal-Mart I worked through."
good,For your first job are after retirement . But its hard to support your family just being a associate other then that its great place to work . If i could advance up in management it work work out for me .
good,The job itself is very manageable and even pleasant with outstanding co-workers and a team building environment. The only drawback is I could not afford to live with the amount of pay received.
good,"Some weeks I would work maybe 10 hours, others close to 30. I wanted full time work and never got it. Great co-workers and decent enough management. Would recommend."
good,"First day on the job I was immediately thrown into a trailer with a guy who was explaining the job very poorly to me and another associate. it wasn't until my second week there (3rd day on the dock floor) I was given a new associate to work with, and he did a whole lot better of a job explaining what to do. The management is terrible, it took me 3 weeks until I got my own login info and when I did, it didn't work for me so I had to wait another day to receive my documents explaining how to set up my work profile. Honestly, the only enjoyable part of the job is working and talking to the associates who have been there longer than I have. Now, the worst thing about this place is that I was hired on with another associate at the same time, and went through training together, and yet he was able to get his login info and is now being trained on heavy machinery and ready to be working on his own. I have yet to get confirmation on when my training on the lift is."
good,Due to working seasonal it's was. A competitive work place. Although it's such tight movements in the stock room hard to find product.Stocking should better organized
good,"The store manager ruined the store after he took over and after I left he and his immediate management were fired by corporate. Besides that work there was stressful do to the overnight needing to do the stocking, customer service since it was a 24 hour store and clean up the work day shift had left"
good,"Great Benefits with Walmart"
good,"Typical day will always keep you on your toes, because you never know what kind of load or loads you have to unload for that day. Fun place to work if you like to be on your feet and be more active."
good,Walmart as a company needs some adjustments but overall the company could be better with policies at hand. In the right direction but needs refinement to suit customers and employees.
good,"Great job to get experience , but no pay raises based on performance, only yearly 2% raise. Managers try to help you all they can to move up, but it is not up to them to move a person up the line."
good,"Customer service and cash handling of customers.  Keeping area clean and presentable.    Hardest part of the job was obtaining consistent hours."
good,"Everyday was not the same. It is a easy transition once you get the hang of it. The employees attitude can be aggressive but, you just have to stand firm. You must know how to adapt to your environment and customers shopping habits in other words know your community and people."
good,Who is a courtesy associate so it wasn't bad it just when it was cold and snowy people were nice to me because I help them take stuff to their car also picked carts from parking lot
good,My time so far at walmart has been ok. Management is so strong out and it's hard to learn how to do your job. When you need management you can not find them anywhere.
good,It was a good work place great employees to work with if I could go back i would. But just looking for something different that's gone benefit me with more money in my pocket.
good,"I enjoy a fast-paced environment but sometimes customers can try your patience and when the store is low-staffed we are expected to put in a heavy amount of work. They do not care if you take your brake or not and if you get your work done early they place you in a busy section so there is incentive to not work efficiently. I loved my co-workers and managers, but it can just be a lot sometimes. The customers do not make it any easier but the pay is somewhat worth it now."
good,Walmart makes a good first job with moderate job advancement. they teach basic job safety as well as some power equipment its a good place to start till you get something
good,I was able to balance full time enrollment at my local community college with an average of 35 hours work time per week. It's a good job for a student that doesn't have their degree yet.
good,Great place to work the pay was great the customers and the associates was really nice cleaning moving helping others is always something to do very interested
good,"Typical work day was clock in then meet with manager to give tasks."
good,This is a good place to work at. I like working with different machines. There is good work life balance and good compensation. There is a lot of skills learnt.
good,Its an ok place to work. Worked with a lot of great people. Guess one of my main concerns with the store that I was at was that most management didn't seem to care.
good,"The typical patient that comes into the pharmacy here are low income. There are a lot of complaints when insurance issues arise or when they don't agree with the price of a medication. Some patients are extremely inpatient, and there are some customers that you have to turn away when they come with certain types of requests."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart for the time that I did, did not enjoy the atmosphere but the job was easy. Strict rules around coupons in which they would get mad when you mad an error."
good,A typical day at work is busy and stressful. Management will expect more than can be done in a reasonable time with a lack of reliable associates. Favoritism is common with lower levels of management. But pay is decent and work isn't hard. Morning shift is probably the calmest and least toxic when it comes to experiences with coworkers. Management is more than willing to help answer questions and concerns and teach associates new processes and new tools.
good,work can be fun. It was fun half the time. Some people got away with not doing what was required of them. While those who did work were reprimanded for not doing more.
good,Wal-Mart was  nice experience I had no issues .i wish them  all the best because i have learned a lot from them  and the upper  management and good luck
good,"Definitely a demanding place to work at as you are constantly expected to do more with less. Generally the employees have a distaste towards how much they get paid for the amount of work they put in, but if you are working here just to make ends meet then you are doing it completely wrong. "
good,"It's exactly what you expect working for Walmart to be. That's about all I got for you. I like helping people out, and this position provided that outlet."
good,"too inconsistent; will change schedule with very little notice sometimes causing you to miss work and get into trouble; they also cut hours without notice thus it is hard to make any type of plans. there are some very nice people working there but there are also some rude, noncaring people working there.  It all depends on the persons at the location you choose."
good,"Dealing with customers easy and difficult.  working with associates both on teaching, training and assisting with any other questions they have.  Culture is there just have to look for it sometimes.  I loved my co-workers."
good,"Being at Walmart has taught me a lot about working through adversity.  The culture at Walmart is quite diverse, working with and meeting associates and customers.  The best part of being at Walmart is the people that I work with.  The associates make the business that we all work for."
good,"Great pay and hours. The management could have been handled better. There were too many managers running the store, made it difficult to know what was to be done. The job hours were great, however it was a hassle to get days off."
good,good for kids in school or someone for  part time job not a bad place to work but they do work with you about you school schedule and try to work aroud yiu school activitys
good,Good place to work but not paid enough I think for the work you do in the position that you might have to do more than the position that you got hired for
good,Walmart is trying to over achieve competition with amazon and establishing stricter rules. Managers are decent as they try to be on your side but try to find everything to write you up for but other employees are easy to work and get along with.
good,"I have worked for 5 different Wal-Marts, all very divers in clientele, co-workers, and management. I have had both good and bad experiences in all stores. Over-all, it is very good customer service and working experience. As for the management, I had only a few managers that actually cared about me as a person, (instead of a body to stock shelves) and saw the potential management qualities I possessed. I did enjoy a few things about my employment, I was able to put my organisation skills and willingness to learn new tasks to good use in several different departments. Also, although the customers were generally very difficult and rude, a few were a pleasure to work with. Over-all, I learned several valuable lessons in customer service, and co-worker/management collaborations."
good,Working at walmart can be a great thing. I do know that if you are full time the benefits are great and you can relocate anywhere. The place I am currently working there is no growth there and I am looking to leave
good,Walmart is stressful because of management I learned more from previous managers or my associates as oppose to my actual manangement team. I would always receive complements on my customer service skills because I had come to conclusion that even though you can not satisfy every customer I was going to try and help everyone the best I could because the customer is always right
good,"> unloading the Walmart trucks and organizing the boxes according to each department"
good,"Walmart is a good job to work for, but not lots of benefits and high raises. The pay is to low to be working as a stocker with lots of loads and weight daily."
good,Most jobs there are quite simple to complete without messing up however you can never do a good job unless you profit Walmart. You may have done something incredible in your department but unless you made Walmart money or you got someone to apply for their mastercard they won't acknowledge it.
good,Not much I really can say about Wal-Mart. It’ll teach u patience and time management. It does require a hard work ethic. I worked overnight so there was always something to do.
good,"Wal-Mart is a very fast pace, competitive working environment. It pushes you to your limit to get things done. Although management and supervisors are highly strict with rules."
good,"Walmart was my first long term job. I learned that working with the public is a mentally taxing job and to always be professional even if the customer is not. Management at Walmart, is like everywhere else, it is a hit or miss. Some mangers are awesome and you love them, while others promote favoritism and laziness. The hardest part of this job is working with the public and the most enjoyable is usually, the people you work with."
good,"Walmart is a great job for a young, high school/college student that is just trying to make an extra few hundred bucks every two weeks. It is not a job that supports a family financially long term."
good,"Empresa coprometida com os direutis do trabalhador, paga certinho e na data,  oferece benefícios e oportu idade de crescimento profissional."
good,"stocking, pulling, helping customers, making sure everything is right.  Being a manager isn't hard I loved my job but the higher up management doesn't follow their own rules."
good,Half of management is good and half is hard to work for.  Very strict on attendance.  Expect too much from employees.  Always pushing to work harder and faster.
good,"Try to look for a job that you can advance towards, and do so quickly. You can go to another position after working 6 months. Do not hesitate to take advantage of the climbing program. Expect management to be poor and pressure you often."
good,The atmosphere at this Wal-Mart was very family like. The drawback was not enough hours. The hourly pay was fair but if you aren't getting enough hours it doesn't matter what the hourly wage is. You are kept low hours so yoh don't qualify for insurance or too many vacation hours.
good,Handling freight all day long within Walmart's time restrictions. That can cause stressful times at work to make production. The management staff are supportive with certain situations but are strict to adhering to the guidelines for production.
good,"Never listen to what others have to say about this company.  Everyone has a different chance and time with Walmart.  As long as you listen, ask for help and do your work you will have chances to learn and grow."
good,Easy job I just wish they gave consistent hours. The only tough part of it is sometimes there are moody managers and hours get cut but if your full time or don't really need much money its not a bad job.
good,Walmart is a good place to work They have great benefits they’re a great company to work for. If I had to I’d work for them again. They have some good managers. I cleaned bathrooms. I took care of the trash. There was a diverse workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was staying busy and trying to balance different tasks.
good,Working with the customers and providing them with fast and courteous service.  Answer any questions that they have concerning where an item can be found or serving suggestions.
good,"Working at Walmart, one will likely encounter many faces both friendly and angry, relaxed and stressed. Standing in one place for most of eight hours when cashiering can be tiring especially with repetitive wrist motions. The number of customers is the biggest determinant of job pace."
good,"It’s dull but easiest job you can get, as long as you can handle the heat, rain, snow. Customers treat you like dirt. The managers treat you well it’s just they don’t know what they’re doing most of the time."
good,"I would come in do my job and go home, occasionally some days you would have managers always on you for no reason even if your job was being done right. The associates especially the csm's were very nice to talk, i considered them my second family"
good,"Walmart overall is a great company with ways to advance, through my employment with Walmart I was treated fairly and with respect. I would recommend anyone looking to work retail to apply at Walmart."
good,L'emploi était très intéressant malgré des conditions de travail compliquées et des clients pas toujours satisfaits du magasin en lui même.
good,I spent half of my time in the lawn and garden area and the remainder in electronics. My time in lawn and garden was nice as we worked indoors and outdoors with friendly coworkers and management. I moved to electronics for a slight pay raise and it being something I enjoyed working with. The management in this department was good depending on the level.
good,I worked at Walmart for a year and a half and have noticed that a lot of people there have problems with drama. THe managers sort of knew what they were doing. I loved the breaks every two hours.
good,"Stressful work, though it was during the holiday shopping times, so perhaps moreso than normal. I wasn’t around long and didn’t talk much to anyone. Hardest part was the constant standing, and I can’t claim to have “enjoyed” any part of the job, as it was mostly boring aside from the people and I’m not a fan of small talk."
good,hours can be a plus or minus depending on the shift. inconsistent management with constant management rotation. fast paced and hard on the body. strict and unforgiving rules and regulations. pay and benefits are good. you are a number who is easily replaceable.
good,Working quickly and remaining productive is essential. It is important to remain positive and try your best at all times.  High customer count and hourly employee turnover.
good,To clean bathrooms aisles to make sure that the customer have clean bathrooms and a clean place to shop at. Clean bathrooms restock toilet paper  paper towels
good,"This place is fun and I had some awesome coworkers, however the management was terrible and would ignore all requests.  They call you slow even when the work they gave out was naturally going to take a long time to finish."
good,"Potential quarterly bonuses for hourly associates, potential yearly for management. There is plenty of opportunity for advancement but you have to want it in order to be promoted."
good,"Wal-Mart is an okay place to work. Management is not flexible; regardless how big of an emergency you have you will still be pointed if you have to leave work (even if you only have an hour left of your shift). However if you are in school or have strict times you cannot work they will not schedule you on those days. Good co-workes, and you get paid fairly."
good,Walmart is always cutting hours United you are full time but thats hard to get.  No medical coverage unless you work an average of 30 hours a week. If you are sick with a dr note they still count it against your occurrences
good,"Typical Day-Long shift, very busy and always on the go, Fast paced"
good,I had a tough time working at walmart personally. They underpaid me and my boss wasn't friendly. The employees are friendly but It's difficult for me to work with supervisors who stress out over the silliest things that could be fixed. I won't return there my time was brief there for a reason. It's a good place to work if you are a stocker or working in the warehouse area. but not as a cashier or customer service.
good,"Daily tasks changed constantly, by the end of your first year you'll likely know how to do half of the stores job and be expected to do it in a single shift."
good,"I thank Walmart for allowing me the opportunity to grow with thr company, developing in my role as a Asm. The company has allowed me to develop in processing,working with people and lead inventory control."
good,"It's an okay place to work.  The managers probably vary.  The company is probably like most others, focused on making money in the narrow ways that executives think."
good,"Not a hard company to work for. They do not usually offer full time employment. They usually schedule 5 hour shifts and the average person gets about 20-30 hours a week. If you clock any overtime, you are sent home early during your next shift, so you don't get overtime. You can take time off or call in sick, but I don't remember them paying your when you were out. Performance reviews are completed annually, and usually lead to a cost of living increase of 10 cents an hour, and the company has very little chance of advancement."
good,"loved working on the floor, the people are great. The Managers are easy to talk to and try there best to make you happy.  There are a couple of Managers Female that make you feel really small, and have made some cashiers cry. The thing I don't find fair is Associates who just start get paid more then Associates who have been there for years."
good,"None of the managers and associates are on the same page."
good,they change your hours without notice management is ok and the benifits are good but other then that its ok if you like working in a fast pace envierment
good,More intense the higher you go up the ladder. Pay is good but you earn every dollar a lot of hours. Supervisors change a lot some are really good to work for and some are not.
good,En si no me gusto esta empresa ya que es muy sacrificado y no te pagan bien en lo que es sueldo mucha rivalidad y agresión en el equipo
good,"Overall good workplace. i have learned on how to properly handle workplace situations, how to take care of the customer, I've also become type adapt at working in conditions of heat and cold. A day at Walmart used to be been smooth everyday because we will have the whole staff on deck making things go smoothly up until schedule problems and bad management. Led to a lot harsher days, but working at Walmart i learned to become pretty good with dealing with customers of all sorts."
good,"When you do everything in your job right, they give you an evaluation. My evaluation was very good but the customer service manager said she had to put one negative thing on it so they don't get on my case. After that I still didn't get any raise."
good,I work 10pm to 7am. I enjoy working there. I enjoy stocking shelves and cleaning up after myself. Good benefits and time off. Nice and clean work environment
good,"Walmart isn't bad. The only thing that I had a problem with was that when I needed time off due to some family issues, they tried to get me to come in and work while I was approved for a few weeks off. There was a lot of miscommunication on when I was going to be back."
good,"A typical job for someone who can’t find themselves a prolonging job. Benefits starts around six months after you start working. A lot of diversity, public interaction and customer care is needed."
good,"Each store has its own different pros and cons depending on the staff and the clientele of the community.  If you work hard and show up regularly you have plenty of opportunity for advancement.  It is not difficult or complex, however it is not easy.  It takes hard work and effort to be successful, but easy to grasp and understand."
good,"It was a good place to work just not enough hours . It was fast paced , and the people were good to work with. Being a cashier I did not like standing in one spot for too long . I would have much rather being on the go more."
good,typical day assist and produce learned accounting management was supportive multi culture hardest part losing employees enjoyable customer service helping with selections assisting with deliveries
good,Walmart was an okay place to work not many benefits or advancement opportunities to grow or further one's self in this work environment but it was steady work.
good,"Come in a couple days and that's it, basically. You don't need to learn anything more than that. Store's differ greatly based on your management team and your co-workers, though."
good,A typical day of work here for me is usually helping every other department in the store. The management is not bad but they do not seem to be all on the same page. Overall the workplace culture is good because there is usually good people to work with. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep what all the managers are telling you to do straight. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers find what they need.
good,"I personally found it hard to stand in one spot all day doing repetitive movements all day, until I was able to move around on breaks. I liked most of the management."
good,"Ouvrir mon départements, compter les caisses, déléguer le travail à mes employés, faire l'inventaire, les changements de prix, placer la commande recue, développer lers négatifs, faire sortir les photos, répondre aux clients , aux téléphones, conseiller les clients sur nos produits (appareils photos cadres numériques, batteries, etc....), aider les gens sur les stations photo autonomes, nettoyer la développeuse à photos, nettoyer le local, compter la caisse et fermer le local"
good,Very fast pace work environment daily. There is some slow times of day. Very diverse culture. There is 3 shifts that you can work on to help with work/life balance.
good,"At the location I work at, I've always worked my full 40 hours and hardly ever had my hours cut; that's the positive part. The negative part is that there is hardly ever any career advancement for anyone wanting to work their way up. I've been with the company for nearly 4 years and I've worked several different positions learning as much as I can. I've even taken pay cuts when I moved between positions in hopes of learning from my training to move further up. However, somehow every time an opportunity comes up where I can take the mantle of a department manager or something similar, a member of management informs me that the position has either been given to a transfer, it's been consolidated with another department (which happens a lot with the group B locations), or it requires an individual with more familiarity with the One Best Way (something that is hardly discussed with us in our meetings). The lack of communication between shifts is a major problem, and it all begins with management. I'm not saying the problem is entirely them; it's just the way it's handled. Unless this changes, guys like me who want a chance to advance will never get far."
good,Wal-Mart is going down hill fast. They only care about $$$ not the employees or customers. Management has double standards and has clear favorites. You get pulled 50 million directions and never in your area.
good,"Durante mi estancia aprendí muchas, es una empresa donde vives muchas experiencias debido a la convivencia que llevas con toda la gente que ingresa, aprendes de todos un poco y es muy exigente"
good,"The pharmacy I worked at was fast paced with a workload of filling between 430 and 500+ prescriptions a day during on Mondays through Fridays. In this pharmacy there are often multiple people who are still training and learning, which means not working as efficiently. More recently there has been more of an effort to train properly and make a better experience for both the employees and the customer."
good,Hayneedle was acquired by Walmart in 2015.  Hayneedle has a good work atmosphere. They are one of the top online retail companies. Hayneedle executives are forthcoming with company objectives. Benefits are decent.
good,I worked as an overnight stocker so I have very little contact with other people while stocking my own zone. It paid well but third shift definetly isn't ideal
good,"Walmart was a good place to work but the employees never got along, Most customers come in rude. They will always pressure you to finish your work or ask you to do 4 or 5 things at one time."
good,"it was great working there. for the whole 5 years I been there. I have gotten a lot of experience working at Walmart super center. It has helped me build my leadership skills, and has help me communicate better with others."
good,"Managers have their favorites. They don't treat everyone equal, "
good,"A typical for me involved checking what task I was being assigned to work, helping unload delivery trucks, taking freight to the floor, stocking shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job, for me at least, was the customer interaction. Overall, management in the store is decent, despite having recently laid off two of their best and most experienced managers in my store. The biggest thing that I learned while working there is how to be a more confident communicator through my interactions with customers."
good,"Start up culture. Need to be self motivated to advance in your career."
good,"management was unfair, and the room for improvement was never an option. I liked the job as an experience, but I wouldn't recommend working here to a friend."
good,Everyone was taught fast and expected to perform well at the first attempt. Due to effective teaching this was successful. This company is always willing to help others find a job to support themselves.
good,Employees must show up 5-10 mins  before shift so you can clock in on time. One thing I learned about Walmart is that there food is always freshly stocked. Also that the deli will swap foods if asked. Management needs improvement just a bit. Diversity does not apply here everyone is treated equal. The hardest part of the job is sports and fishing gear. The most enjoyable part is stocking your aisle and getting it done.
good,"A typical day consists of either working freight and then zoning or working carts, top stocking, and then zoning. I have learned a lot about being productive. The management is very respectful and understanding. The hardest job for me was the physical demands. I enjoyed the job as a whole."
good,"As an assistant manager for Walmart I enjoyed the overall work and experience. However, it is not truly recommended for someone with a family. I made good money but I didn't see my family a lot. You work at least 12 hour days some times more. I enjoyed being there but I am glad I am not there anymore."
good,"Not always able to work full time hours. Enjoy work in the photo lab, Its a great place for hard working employes. And had a great time during the holidays"
good,"I was extremely lucky to work at the Walmart that I did. My managers were amazing until the end of me working there. They were always kind and they pushed me to do my best, for myself and the company. I had great coworkers because my Walmart hired the best of the best that applied there. We were a very efficient team. SO much so that other Walmart would send employees to train with us. Towards the end of my days at Walmart, a few new mangers were promoted and hired and relations were not so good throughout our store. Corporate was changing a lot of rules and regulations. The main reason I left though was not poor managers, but so I could pursue a college degree again."
good,"This position was fairly new at the time and no one was clear on the true description of what we did. It’s a position that requires true patience since you are an offshoot of Asset Protection. We had no radios; only scanners for returns. I felt like we should’ve been more secure than we were since we do stand at the entrances and guard them. Customers can be rude and they feel like you have no right to do the job you’re paid to do. It’s not an easy job being involved with theft. It’s a very “gray area” job. If your management is good, you’re good. If not, you’ll suffer and it shows as time progresses. Every employee felt overwhelmed and were quitting left and right. But if you do your job and go home you’re fine. No friends at this job and a lot of people you can’t trust. It can be a drama filled environment depending on location."
good,"Starting off was okay, until you stay there longer working there and cut your hours. Take half of your bounces. Don’t want you to move up and don’t care"
good,"Arrived in a timely fashion. learned their computer systems and procedures. Customers service skills, problem solving, how to deal with disgruntled consumers. I met a wide variety of different cultures and ethnic backgrounds. IT was difficult to complete required tasks in allotted time frame. I truly enjoyed interacting with customers some became almost a daily visit to see me."
good,"My first go at Wal-Mart in Lumberton, TX was wonderful had room to grow I loved it, even got to act as a department head.  My second go seemed like it was going to go the same, but like all jobs it's all in the location."
good,"One learns to be flexible, since tasks change quickly.  Benefits are fairly good.  Management expectations are high.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes being able to meet those expectations.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside good people."
good,Years of overnight work will affect ones health and overall well being.
good,"I worked at Walmart for nearly four years and have had minimal problems with other associates or customers. My biggest problems came from select managers that would ask of just too much from one person while others would spend an entire shift doing half the job. I was fired for excessive occurrences while half my crew had already excessive occurrences before I had topped out. The job was easy for the pay and I'd go back over and over again, I just think sometimes certain workers are accused more than others who should be looked at long before the hard workers."
good,drama fake people management expects way to much you are rushed and pushed to your limits to get work done . favoritism.  blah blah blah blah blah blah
good,"it was relaxing being able to work alone and not feel stressed, just did not enjoy that the main manager was almost never seen helping or even supervising."
good,Es un empreza donde se puede crecer y es agradable trabajar llevando a cabo la cultura walmary
good,"Working for Walmart pharmacy is hit or miss. I worked for a supercenter. I had an incredible manager and excellent coworkers. I was located at a super center. This specific super center was known by other Walmarts for tension between high fill volumes and higher customer expectation."
good,Walmart is good part - time work that comes with decent hours and good people everywhere. they have great customer service and have and treat their employees well.
good,"Ever increasing tasks and responsibilities without sufficient resources to accomplish. Member services touted, but take a back seat to expected procedures."
good,"working with good people, they give you a lot of hours ,they give you good deals around the holidays, I just don't like that they make you work for holidays"
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is when the whole cap 2 team go to lunch together. the workplace culture  was friendly and a sense of togetherness,"
good,Deverian de tomar en cuenta los descansosos en fin de semana .
good,The pace was very fast with 95% production rate.  Production was major with less concern for safety and personnel.  The day was very focused with everyone attempting to meet their production rate to keep their job.
good,"You get to work with great people. Teamwork is a key factor in getting thru your daily routines, the company culture is flowing anywhere you work. The hourly associates really make the difference."
good,Im ready to work im more then open to learn something new in work when every you need me im open to work when ever you need me im hard working in definitely a team player easy to get alone with to .
good,High energy and high stress environment. Many opportunities to promote for those that take initiative however sometimes hard to get noticed. Company is so large at times the individual perceptions rule the situation versus fair review.
good,"A good company for someone who has minor to moderate expenses, depends on your location as to how they treat you I worked at one in NJ and I loved it and worked at one in NY and hated it. Upon completing training you will make $10 an hour"
good,The amount of work each day varied. Management was great for the most part. They were very upfront most of the time. Co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some difficult customers.
good,Manager stand up for the employers when they're right. When your in the wrong they will hold you accountable for your actions. Company have soon good training courses...
good,"It pays the bills, if you will work the hours. Management in my experience was basic at best. Many seemed to be learning as you were. But over all a job is a job"
good,Not a bad company to work for if individuals worked together and communication amongst managers had a better structure. If you find a Walmart  with these qualities good things are bound to happen. Only thing to look out for is randomn company changes which may alter your balanced lifestyle.
good,"The management at Wal-mart was good, they worked with you. Didn't just tell you what to do, while they did nothing.I know that some of my co-workers said when they got hired there they really didn't get any training, and that they had to figure out how to do things by there selves. I was trained fine, I was showed what to do, and how to do it."
good,"The benefits are good. It probably differs store to store, but management could use some work. Favoritism and treating employees differently definitely exists. The working environment is stressful and takes a mental and emotional toll. Not worth the pay."
good,Good place to work for a starter job and easy to learn new skills with right teacher and fast pace to learn and fast pace to work and some times the management will drive you crazy sometime but that's their job to make sure you do a good job
good,The best part of working here is the benefits. Work/Life balance is a bit of a struggle as an Assistant Manager. Great family culture but being open 24/7 meant a lot of missed holidays.
good,"-There are not enough employees on the sales floor most of the time."
good,"Walmart was very understaffed, due to Corporate office not the individual store.   Too much on selling of their mastercard and not enough on customer service."
good,"Can be a tough job, odd hours 50+ every week, very long days, tough work life balance.  Salary pay is just above federal minimum. Management is very store specific, mine have generally been very good.  Corporate changes come down with little to no warning."
good,"Fun overall experience, always a busy day, never a dull moment. There's a lot of opportunity to grow within company. Typical day was stocking shelves, zoning designated area and assist consumers, fairly easy"
good,"Intermittently busy and slow"
good,"I enjoy the work that I do, unfortunately the pay is not the best. They expect a lot for what they are willing to pay. Most of the people are decent and make the work environment enjoyable. I would recommend this job for someone starting out looking to gain experience."
good,"The only good thing was the coworkers they act like family, Poor managment especially co managers. Otherwise great benefits but thats pretty much all."
good,start shift with every day routine staff was fun and knowledgeable customers were regulars and friendly work was steady but the breaks make it better not over whelming but kept me on my toes
good,"Management works an average of 12 hours daily."
good,"Over all Walmart my experience at Walmart as been fairly good. I managed to move up quickly, and the pay increased significantly at first. I learned what it meant to be a strong supervisor and how to manage peoples time efficiently."
good,"My shift star at 10 pm and finish at 7am. In this job I have the opportunity to work in fast and active environment. Where I have to finish tasks in certain time. I have to check, rotate and stock products."
good,"A typical work day was just a mess of running around and getting yelled at to do way too many things at once"
good,"They expect a lot out of a store that was understaffed. Biggest retailer in the world, and still can't find a way to raise wages. Walked around every half hour making sure we did our job. (while they did nothing)"
good,"The company is fair and straight forward.  The compensation is fair and at or above region average.  Corporate changes their mind often, be willing to adapt to change."
good,Walmart was a good place for me to work for the last 24 years.  It provided me and my family with benefits and income as well as promotional opportunities.
good,"If upper management worked together customer issues would have been lot smoother and easier to handle. Seemed management would contradict what we were taught or each other so it made for some sticky situations between the employee and the customer. The work was ok, they made sure we had lots of training. The schedule could be crazy sometimes unless you worked n a department where you had a set schedule. Depending on your department manager and co-workers, it could be fun at times. The owners of  Walmart .company need to be ashamed of how the employees are treated and taken advantage of as a whole. Not a bad job but not a good job either. Had it's good and bad days especially dealing with customers. Seems that Walmart customers can be mean and cranky most of the time so that in itself was challenging but you the nice and pleasant customers made things even out so you just focused on the positive till your shift ended."
good,"most streesful job I did but mostly management  was horrible at times it was like nit worth it, but you might meet some interesting co workers that make the work day not so bad"
good,"It was pretty stressful, cause I was sort of in a rut, couldn't get use to the schedule, the job was pretty easy, staff was alright, nothing very special."
good,"Walmart is an OK place to work. The jobs are not too stressful, but some of the managers can make things harder than they need to be. This place is not a bad place when it comes to the hiring process because it doesn't matter what race or religion you are they accept and welcome anyone."
good,When I worked at Walmart my only job was to push shopping carts. They did give me other opportunities to go work in other departments but I was to busy with school to take those opportunities. .
good,Overall not a bad place to work the pay could be better for long term employees. The training is not very good and sometimes there is too many managers giving directions and can be really busy during the holidays.
good,"A typical day of work at Walmart is sort of family oriented. It's easy to make friends. Out of 5 years of working there I've learned to always do your best, & that there is always room for growth.The hardest part of the job is trying to rub your kindness off on customers sometimes. But you still should have a positive attitude & always be willing to learn something new. The most enjoyable part is constantly being able to meet new people."
good,The job was very medial and got repetitive and boring but it is just what the job entails. The people were nice and it was a laid back work environment.
good,You are constantly busy and running around so the job was never boring. The managers gave me a brief description of my job and sent me on the floor with little knowledge of what to do and what not to do. The store was overall unorganized and little communication between managers and other workers out on the floor. However they provided great benefits and the co-workers in my department were very helpful and friendly.
good,a typical day would include me coming to do pick rails or returns all day. through out the day we would also zone. The environment was okay. Management was not so good. Liked how relaxed it was.
good,"Worked in produce stocking the shelves, I learned customer service at all times. My manger was great, good place to work at. Not a hard job, I enjoyed the people."
good,"I work in the produce department and made sure shelves were full at all time."
good,"Working as Asset Protection, you see a lot of things. Customers walk in and out, go about their day, but that's not the only thing. I remember one fine work day that will always scar my memory."
good,It take a little time to getting use to but once u there it will be the best.try to stay calm and work great people to work make sure u can come in do a good job on the floor
good,"enjoyed workin with some of the people.....bein in a small town ,I had regular ppl that preferred comin through my cash then others"
good,"When working at Walmart as a cashier, you get what you expect. Some days are really good, some days are bad, some days are boring, some days are exciting. All in all, it's what you make it."
good,"Overall, not a completely bad place to work. Hourly managers under-paid in my opinion. Some events are held for employees that allow good food, etc. If you're in a Walmart where not everybody gets along, it won't be a good experience. When the upper managers have better relationships, business runs smoother."
good,employs are great and fun and like able. lots of fun things to do to raise money for children miracle network easy to learn the jobs in different areas
good,"I have medical issues and they want me to keep my medical supplies in my locker due to the area I work in, this does not work out in my best interest and management is not trying to help or make exceptions to my well being."
good,"I enjoyed the work experience with my co-workers because we knew what needed to be done everyday. In addition, we made sure that we complete our workload collectively as a team. Management does a great job of informing the associates of whom are needed in each department."
good,"What I enjoyed the most about working at Wal-Mart was the fast-paced, changing environment, which challenged and developed my skills and adaptability."
good,If you are in desperate need for a job this is a great place it's nice that they take care of you and make sure you get breaks and that you get full training the employees can be fun to work with but management sucks here they are always coming and going so no one knows how to do anything it bothered me that the store manager had no training as a cashier had no idea how to use the tills when we needed help she had no clue and was a pushy store manager who never listens to you when you need certain days off and just really disorganized store plus no one could take over for supervisors so cashier's we're expecting to know the customer service position with no extra pay
good,"Was responsible for safety and compliance for 165 drivers and 30 shop associates. Responsiblities include DOT and OHSA compliance, driver hiring and training."
good,Walmart has a good culture and is a fast paced work environment. They have locations all over the country and the world. Which if you want to travel gives you a job most any where in the world.
good,"learned so many skills at this job. learned a lot about people too. working at wal-mart gave me a great foundation for a career in retail. I have been able to apply so many things for every job I have had, whether it be customer service, inventory control, or manage employees."
good,"You start everyday with a quick 5 minute meeting before splitting to unload. Most everyone is nice if you can keep up. The management doesn’t really interact with you or your group so no problems there. Your team is your lifeline, they are always there to help or if you have a bad one not help."
good,The people you work with is awesome. The management was a pain in the rear because the were so indecisive about what they wanted to be done. Other than that its a great company to work for.
good,I didn't give Walmart 5 stars mainly because of management.  There are at least 5 different tiers of management working at the store at the same time which means communication is horrible.  The jobs are typically easy and not so stressful and they give you a lot of hours plus over-time when available. Human Resources will help fit in school and any other jobs you may have so they can be very flexible with that in mind.The environment reminded me of high school at some times.  Employees would talk about each other and there were secret relationships going on. But the company would be great if they would figure out the whole management situation.
good,"Well maybe not every Walmart, however the Walmart I worked at had poor customer service, and poor management. Also it was a drama filled environment , definitely made it hard to stay focus and work."
good,"Working at the company of Walmart is very uncertain at times and more likely uncomfortable because of the registers into always switching with another person due to break, because of not being sure of what that person is capable of as in stealing."
good,I enjoyed the fact that Walmart always kept us busy with work to do.we would first unload the truck and separate items on different pallets.then after the truck is all unloaded we bring all the freight to the sales floor and stock the items on the shelf and in the bins.
good,Walmart gives everyone opportunities for a successful and save work place. I've worked there for a year and a half and the only problem i had was it being to cold to push carts outside
good,Wal-Mart was all ways about taking care of are customers. But depending on your location it can be really stressful at times. The culture at Walmart as very negative were I was located. Management lack following up an teaching an training. The hardest part of my job is getting management on the same team. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team.
good,"A typical day at the job consist of coming in on time and making sure you make it to the floor no later than 5-7 min after clocking in. Its making sure once you hit the floor you are in uniform and ready to assist customers. My first day on the floor i did not know it means exactly when you walk thru the doors a customers would need your assistants. I didn't know the work place very well so i had to teach my self the ropes at first. Management was poor at the time of me joining the company. So most of the things i taught myself and some things my co-workers help me understand. Its was a very diversity place to work because you dealt with different cultures hands on. I think the hardest part of working there was not being able to get your job done and be able to assist customers because of the poor management , and in  need of there assistants because they were not in place or lack of work ethics."
good,"Expect you to get things done in an unrealistic amount of time, however will not pay you overtime to complete these tasks, they will make you stay and then have you cut that overtime the next day"
good,"I worked at Walmart on the front-end as a cashier. Also worked at the service desk and in managing inventory levels in the backroom. For the most part I enjoyed working at my store location and appreciated the work ethic of other employees and managers. Overall, it was a positive experience."
good,"had to set receiving room to unload trucks, bring items to the floor for overnight to work on."
good,Loved working for walmart until they came up with new program ..Department  managers do not have there own depts anymore in which we took pride in .now there is no pride ..hours of work are horrible .I didn't apply to work  nights ..store standard ..cashier .. many dept.managers have stepped down as the new work load is not fit for most of us as we are all over 50 yrs old and are long time employees. The Depts are .not zoned ..dirty . Empty shelves ..am embarrassed  to work there as we don't have enough employees  to do our job right .no security theft is just about a million dollars a yr so not good for our profit share .
good,"Had job during high school, great job good pay. Very flexible, willing to work with your schedule. Willing to train for every job your willing to learn"
good,Typical day: I stand near the Self-checkouts and help any customers who need help. I also make sure that my area is clean. I greet and thank customers
good,I was underpaid for the things I knew and how quickly I picked up on other things. Even with job position change I was told no pay increase. Others in same job position made more than me.
good,"Walmart is a vert relaxing place. Not too stressfull, can only be if you allow it to be. Not the hardest job but its definitely not the easiest> Just have to know your way around."
good,If you're 16 and looking for your firsts job this would be perfect for you. If you're looking for something long term I think you should find different options. Some people make livings at Walmart but you don't apply for any insurance or benefits till being employed to 10 years.
good,nearly impossible to get chirstmas or black friday off. Good on requesting schedule changes and are lenient on requestin more hours. very strict on customer service
good,"Could be very stressful at certain times of the year like cough and cold season. Answer phone, wait on customers, solve problems with patience scripts and insurance companies."
good,"it is an ok place to work at, it pays you ok, the job is alright as long as you get paid for it. the management is good, I learned a little bit of stuff from Walmart."
good,"Walmart had excellent technology to help you accomplish tasks.  Some people in upper management did have a good concept of what was actually occurring at store level.  Work was sometimes hectic, yet productive."
good,Wal-Mart offered a great opportunity to me and I don't regret working there however if you have other options that don't require you to socialize with co-workers or customers that are intolerable then you should take it
good,There’s a lot of stress working in the deli. Most of the time management don’t care to help. They just expect you to deal with whatever comes your way
good,"A lot of people already assume a lot of things about retail. Wal-Mart ultimately isnt terrible for employees, even if the management isnt entirely compatible."
good,"not a bad job for what it is, they have well placed crew. however, the management at that walmart and time. was very poor and two management where fired."
good,it was ok nothing special the people are cool and you get an hour lunch and 2 15 min breaks the lake of communication is real bad and a lot of favorites
good,"I was a pharmacist technician and we filled 700 plus prescriptions daily. It was very busy. I loved my job there but honest to God I felt over worked and underpaid!!! I was so unhappy I had to put in my two weeks notice. They are very hard on their employees. I honestly feel their technicians deserve $15-16 hourly with that work load and with the cost of living the Technicians honestly deserve that ! Instead, the pay was horrible it was more like $10-$11 hourly..... Wal Mart is a Billion dollar company there is no way they can’t meet the demands of those who desire and deserve a higher wage/salary ! It’s a great investment because most employees there spend the money they earn from the company right back into the company!!!! Do better wal mart ..... if a pharmacist makes $80,000 a year then the technicians should make half $40,000 !!! Hands down.... that’s only fair. I couldn’t live off that $10.40 so I quit."
good,"Good work environment, and important place to have a career advance. The hardest part of the job was the lack of good leadership and subsequent lay off from the company."
good,"I was hired to do a totally different job than what I ended up performing. I was actually paid $2 more than others, based on my prior experience, and while it was still worth what they had me doing, it was not what I was hired to do."
good,"5 am to sometimes 3pm.  get the bread and donuts ready for mornings.  make cakes, break down pallets, stock the sales floor, clean up area leave.  I did not get along with the manager of department.  she would not order the things that we told her was out and that we needed.  would go to higher management about issues and they would not do anything.."
good,Have to have a hard shell to work there. Managers don't know how to treat people. They ask you to perform task and set an impossible time frame. They show favoritism with the most laziest of employess while over looking the hard working ones.
good,"I loved working here, even though the hours were long and the pay wasn't AMAZING, I felt it was fair. The only issue was that one manager had a massive power trip and actually let me and several others go in order to hire the family of her friends. "
good,At the bottom level they intentionally keep employees under full time employment so as to not pay out insurance and benefits. however their human resource office is well versed in the local welfare options and how to apply for them. Also working to miniaturize work force as much as possible (self-checkouts). Although customer service was top priority they actual ability of the employees to maintain the store is difficult to keep in timeline. Some other practices like trying to build a store every 5 miles creates too much competition between for employees and customers. that kind of over saturation destroys the stores competency.
good,"On a typical day at work I collect returns from the night before. We also scan our merchandise to see what is available on the side counter due to the previous days sales increases or decreases. As a manager I also work on on-hand reports, price changes, feature, and assisting customers to make their shopping experience a great one. The management at Wal-Mart is undeniably absurd. At our location our management does not listen to their associates on many different matters. The hardest part of my job is dealing with management.The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers, meeting different people, and getting to know the other associates."
good,"I was pretty much all around Wal-Mart, The job was common since also its a team effort working at areas. The only thing I didn't like about the job was the managers was showing favoritism to their family members and I believe that was unfair!!!"
good,"Walmart was the first real job that i ever have, 3 years of working their is been alright. Some days are and some days are bad. Management can be okay, but majority of the times they don't know what they are doing. Especially working overnight maintenance, we get a new maintenance and they don't last long because of management. But overall, i am grateful that Walmart worked around my school schedule for college."
good,"Worked there many years and education, experience, and work ethic do not often matter for promotion unless you accept some unethical work practices. Overall not to bad but you work hard and get paid well."
good,"You get great pay but horrible management. They truly don't care about their employees and look at everyone as replaceable. I was told by 2 different managers and 2 different stores I worked at, I was replaceable and that's a wrong way to run a store and/or company. Great customers most the time, and great paid vacation and raises. Just bad management. Oh and the discounts are bad. 10% off only a few items. Not everything."
good,"very challenging learned how to run an department , take care of orders , customers, prep for inventory , scan bin in back room and how to keep up with freight count."
good,"Clock-in, Sign in to a register either for returns, cashiering, or on some days I was a back up manager so there was no typical work day."
good,nice friendly place to work people are nice and really helpful a typical work day is a slow start then the pace speeds up later in the day i learned how to be a cart pusher and how much it can provide customer service to people and there are times where there isnt enough people on the cart pushing crew that make it difficult to keep shopping carts stocked up for the customers makes it a hard part of the job.
good,"It's a good place to work, come in do your job, joke with other associates, help each other out, and you will fit right in with everybody else. I will recommend this job..."
good,Was good to learn experience with talking and knowing how to present yourself along with being able to understand duties that are giving on a daily basis.
good,Working for Walmart is okay if you have a go-getter attitude and aren't afraid to stand up for yourself to your management staff and let your voice be heard.
good,"It was a nice job. I enjoyed working there although I wasnt able to stay, it was a great experience and I would do it again if needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers."
good,"Workplace has its good days and bad days. My only concern is that they are very strict when it comes to overtime. If you get overtime, they get it back by letting you go home early."
good,"In bakery you need to stay busy or else you will fall behind.  Those who care about their work will succeed."
good,"Breaking down boxes, loading product and pulling expired product is an easy job when everyone helps, but when some put in half the effort as you, it doesn't really make for a comfortable or fair environment. Management should be sure if they put someone in a section, they need to be able to follow through with the job thoroughly."
good,Management need to be more on the same page when giving employees tasks. One manager would demand something be done rite then and now while another manager would do the same thing.  Hours are good and vacation time can be earned. Lots of people to go to for help or questions.
good,"Walmart expects you to do more than you are capable of but they pay well. It took me 2years to realize I can only do what I can, and not to stress about it, but by then i had missed so much work due to being overstressed, litteral anxiety attacks just thinking about going in to work, that i got fired for missing too many days. Now that I can just do my job without stressing about it, I would work for them again."
good,"Learned how to work better on fast pace , customer service, multitask , team lead , forklift , & working as a team "
good,I would arrive at work and go onto the sales floor and list the items that were running low in quantity and locate and restock items that were running low. I learned how to make the best use of my time such as keeping backroom clean when I had free time. The hardest part of the job was working in the meat room which was kept at a constant temperature of around 35 degrees. I put in for transferring out of the meat room (because of the constant cold) but was never given any chance of moving to a more satisfying environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that my lifetime of working in fast paced jobs made me able to meet and accomplish any challenge that I had to overcome. I went home feeling proud of my day of work that I put in.
good,Hardest part of job is balancing working and home life as well the number of hours you work a week. The best part of the job would be the benefits and pay.
good,"Was a fast-paced job, stressful at times, but nonetheless always fun. Meet people of different backgrounds and lifestyles and build work and customer relationships with them."
good,"Wal-mart has been a place where I was able to develop and hone skills.  The environment is defferent per department, the managers typically revolve quarterly.  Sometimes you get lucky sometimes you do not have competent managers.  There is room for advancement but I personally did not see this as a place to stay. Coming into Wal-Mart part time it can be difficult to become full time for those that want to."
good,Nesta empresa você tem oportunidade de crescimento ao longo da sua carreira.
good,"Tranquilo, ambiente normal y de buena dispocision."
good,"Walmart tends to be a highly stressful place to work.  In a successful retail environment, everyone has to be on point.  Sometimes the people who work the hardest are least appreciated.  That tends to foster negative feelings among associates and management alike."
good,I was a stocker and completed any tasks required. My hours/days were changed without notice to me. I was given different information from each of the managers or other staff.
good,Needs improvement. Should care about their employees more. Rate of pay should be more based on the worker and how much experience they have. Should get more for working nights and weekends.
good,"The job itself is decent but the management currently lacks communication with their staff. Some positions make more and so employees are offered competitive opportunities to advance once a higher paying position opens. However, some positions with more demanding aspects are stuck with base pay. While you do receive a small annual raise, it is not retroactive and so doesn't adjust with increases in minimum wage."
good,"A day at walmart was good i enjoyed working there the employees where great . i  learned about my job was learning how to put up fraight on the shelves the proper way . managers where nice to help out. The hardest part of the job was trying to put up alot of fraight when there was not enough help , some nights we had a big truck and hard to do .The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people learning new things"
good,"Customers can be quite numerous and make it difficult to complete assigned tasks but are generally excusable due to the company putting customers first. There's always something to do, even if you have to ask what needs to be done. Can be a bit overwhelming during busiest days. Attempts are being made to improve the scheduling system this year. The call-in system was changed last year, though it still has its flaws."
good,"They had really lax policies on things such as tattoos, piercings, and hair color & in fact I was told in training that they ""encourage individuality""; very cool. Such a diverse group to work with. The CSM's were all pretty great. Breaks are scheduled & they're usually pretty good about keeping them, but know what time you go & if it's more than 10 minutes late speak up, because they probably forgot about you. Customers are usually easy to deal with BUT I feel sorry for you if you get assigned to the customer service desk. Self checkout is the easiest place to work & having to be door greeter bites."
good,"Fastpaced, ever changing direction, to be successful you just have to roll with it. the associates are great, management lacks communication. i loved working at walmart."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart the changing of responsibilities I was able to learn and adapt too.  I enjoyed the customer service work much more then just cashiering because I had more contact with the customers and to satisfy their needs.  The culture at Walmart was very outgoing and they appreciated their employees and showed that.  The hardest part of this job was turning customers away on exchanges or refunds because it was past the ninety day limit.
good,"typically busy day at work."
good,you start your day fast dive in get it done before you know it the day is over. its fast pace a lot of fun to help customers and fulfill their needs .everyday is filled with new challenges and goals . job security everyone shops at wal-mart at some point
good,"associates were cut-throat, short-to-no breaks given as cashier, worked harsh conditions and expected to be able to do it day after day with little to no breaks or relief."
good,The people that I work with are very nice and that’s one of the things I love working there. The pay is pretty good and benefits are good as well. The management team is nice as well except for a couple people.
good,"Walmart can be a nice place to many new contacts and earn money. It's never calm, a very busy environment. Management is not bad, but most of the times you will have to do independent work. Hardest part of the job involves dealing with the customers and their service demands."
good,Go to work stock floors if I have a food truck will properly put it away go to the daily meeting.  I love some of the associates that I work with .  Management need some work when it comes to association with other employees. Hardest part of the day I really don't have one because I love what I do. Most enjoyable part is working with others and seeing costumers smile at you.
good,"Management either is awesome or horrific. There is no in between. The pay is decent but nothing to brag about. benefits are eh. Except for paid time off, which is pretty decent."
good,"typical day at work will be restocking shelves pulling skids.  i learned to speak some foreign language, Workplace is pretty diverse and enjoy much working with other people"
good,"Good option for students to start working and grow. Fast paced and friendly environment, as well as a good place to develop teamwork skills and a good attitude."
good,Overall a great place to work. Coworkers are great and management is fair. Benefits and bonuses are great and work is very positive and fun.I would recommend anyone to work there.
good,Many roles and responsibilities. Helping staff and pharmacists with work flow and ensuring patient safety is primary issue. Being part of the team and helping others to move forward in knowledge base.
good,"The work that I did was freight unloading. The backroom was always a mess when we started in the afternoon. And pressure was always heavy to hurry and get everything done even though the first hour or more was cleaning up messes left by others overnight and in the morning. The work itself was hard, which I didn't mind. But it was also poorly organized for quick unloading and movement of freight to the floor. We were often short people. My manger was fine, and so were a couple of others. But several seemed to think screeching at people is the right way to get things done. I finally left when the backroom lead quit and one of the other managers came in and started threatening people's jobs and everything else to get everything done when we had been moving at the usual pace even after the lead quit. In fact, most of the people there didn't know the lead quit until they wondered why they were being threatened. A lot of workers in other departments didn't seem to be much happier. Most of them acted more resigned to putting up with abuse than actually enjoying what they were doing. They told me when I started to give them 6 months before making up my mind. That's what I gave them, then left."
good,A typical day at work is very eventful and fast paced. I've learned how to communicate with other people and helping other when needed. The management can sometimes be difficult to talk to but they are very nice.
good,Great job when learning how to branch out in the working field. Not much job safety but I would recommend this job for someone who is new to working. You learn lots of skills for jobs in the future
good,Ok at times  but Walmart took over and took out 4 on 4 off. No more laughing at work. Just not th same. Looking for a great place to work now.  Just just
good,"I am able to work at my own pace. I have guidelines, but I am able to work them as I want. I think the communication between an associate and management needs great improvement. They don't have voice mail or email as a way to communicate with any of the mangers."
good,Great place to work for temporary employment. Great opportunites only if you can advance. The store I was assigned was very  hard to advance and took longer to get $.50 raise.
good,"Good place to work, or as a first job. Depending on your career aspirations you can work long term and become a manager but long process and not recommended for university graduate."
good,"Good money, easy work environment, vast job opportunities, advancement is possible but not easily. Good management, hour lunches and two breaks during shift"
good,"It's hard to come across an actual manager that wants to work with you and develop your traits, it's mainly about who you talk to and who you're friends with.  Not the skills you possess."
good,A good job but can be cutthroat when management from headcourters show up. Management at the store and is laid back. Little room for invastment but over all not to bad
good,all I do put up stock and put clothes up and zone the areas. how to hander customer better. how to deal better with your coworker hardest part not getting enough hour to help to paid bills the most enjoyable about the job is talking to the customer and help them out.
good,"A lot of work for the pay they give you, but the benefits can offset it you can afford them.  Majority of the managers are very helpful if you need help."
good,Didnt enjoy my short time working for walmart the managent seemed to have a problem with everything no matter what i did.I actually used to go out of my way to do thing and nothing was enough
good,It's a good place to work at but I wish I made more money and co-workers is nice. We work as a time and help each other out. The managers are understanding and they do there jobs.
good,"Good job for stepping stone, managers need to step it up and communicate better with associates, no need for team leaders to be wondering what their roles are on holidays."
good,Work is not hard but can be continuous. Meet a diverse group of people. Learn a lot about how to deal with the public. Maximize customer service skills
good,"Graveyards stocking freezer.  Inventory management. Store level management was fair, individual manager could be inconsistent.  Expectations not consistent for all employees.  Working nights.  Satisfaction when expectations were met for clean and well stocked freezer."
good,I was allowed to work at my own pace outside. The manager really didn't harass me on the job I was doing because the corrals were empty and the customers had carts to use on my side.
good,Management needs to work on communicating more effectively. co workers are fun and work well as a team.  Need to be more flexible by working with people lifestyles.
good,Its was ok but lack management. Guess because it was a new store but i been there for a while and it still didnt change but if you want a job then walmart is nice for you. Just dont be mid 30s and cashier. Do something in management
good,Wal-Mart is a nice job to start your career. It's noting I think you should try and make a career out of but it is a great stepping stone in the right direction.
good,"overall it was mostly an ok place to work for, most of the management team were really great, and majority of the other associates were fun to work with. No place is completely without its problems though and when it came down to it, I just felt that I could do better for myself and my child elsewhere"
good,"Fairly good place to work. Get free food on holidays, management wasn't the best but managers were very fun to be around. Benefits were okay, co workers are awesome."
good,"Customer's tend to look down on you because of the company that you work for. The starting wage is nice, but just the atmosphere of such a large corporation wasn't pleasant at times."
good,"If you can provide customer service with a good attitude and be available to work flexibly you will do well at Walmart. Typically you can expect to provide customer service in person and on the phone, run a register, make merchandising decisions, and stock shelves. I learned time management and teamwork there. Management is there to help you in anyway they can, though sometimes lack of communication makes it difficult. The culture of the workplace is friendly, though at times can be demoralizing. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a good attitude during stressful times of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding a customer exactly what they need and sending them on their way with a good experience."
good,Great place to work  just needs to be more understanding when you are having trouble at home and you ask for your hours to be changed look and treat everyone the same
good,"I started in loss prevention and was trained in that for 2 days.  After seeing a woman stealing and the employee not do anything about it, I decided to go to overnight stocking then Inventory Management."
good,I enjoyed opening so that the morning customers could race to the clearance isle. I liked getting to know people and seeing them after work. Seeing the usual customers made the job more interesting
good,"A typical work day is going to the back room and scanning inventory, stocking, lots of customer service, forklift operating, lifting 5-100 pounds alone"
good,We are not allows to take no money from the customers . Not even if they offer or tell us is okay . We only can help them and make sure our help make them happy
good,I would recomend walmart to others.The pay and benfits there are very competetive. Production is very high and can be stressful at times but it is doable.
good,Prepare and fill prescriptions. Restock medications on shelf's and the over the counter medications. Help customers with questions and help at the cash register.
good,"tons of positions available, a twenty-four hour work place, can either be a very slow or very busy work day, management was decent, work culture is very diverse."
good,lots of favortism and some unwillingness to work around family schedules.  You can get training for many positions throughout the stores different departments.
good,"In the beginning I had no issues with Walmart, when I started I had a good manager and things seemed fair. After being there 8 months I moved to the Deli and we had a new manager over fresh also. He wasn't a good manager. He belittled us and was very ungrateful, I tried my hardest but he just put us down. Also the scheduling was inconsistent and I believed to be unhealthy."
good,"stressful day all the time"
good,"Good opportunity for career advancement with company and pay is above average. However, because most Walmart stores are open 364 days a year don't plan on spending most of your holidays with family and friends because someone is going to have to be there on those holidays."
good,"Easy place to work, but they don't pay you what you are worth. You won't have a set day off, and your schedule will be all over the place unless you work over night."
good,"I can't really say there's enough to say that there's a typical day at work. Somedays we have many carts stocked outside the bay, other days we have very little carts inside and outside the bay. It was like a dice roll on how challenging the day could be. I didn't get much interaction with the management, but I did often hear other workers complain about management. The hardest part of the job, for me, was trying to get everything done in time. This didn't happen all the time, but when it did, I did get afraid that I wouldn't get enough done in time, but I usually would do just fine. The most enjoyable part of the job, for me, was getting the electric carts back inside the bay, because it gave me a second to rest my feet and legs, and I could ""use"" the electric carts without feeling bad."
good,Uma empresa que da chances aos associados de crescerem na empresa.
good,"organization"
good,The key to having survived at Walmart was working with the quality coworkers that I had. Working together helped make the job more efficient and better overall.
good,Working with this company can be fun. it is very fast paced and you can learn about retail. You have to learn how to work every department in store because when they are short with staff you may get pulled to cover someone else's position.
good,Buen habiente de trabajo con compañeros y líderes de departamento
good,Every Walmart is different. The one I work at shows favortism and is not consistent in how they award promotions and write ups. The management expects a lot from you and you are not fairly compensated for all that you are expected to do.
good,"I met fun people working there and learned how to decorate cakes,  unfair supervisors and not very professional. Was alright for a first time job. Two paid 15 minute breaks and an hour for lunch"
good,"When I started working at Walmart, I really enjoyed my job. Eventually, it became hard to manage between school, work, and a social life which they weren't very accommodating of. I needed something with more flexibility which the new assistant manager was not willing to do for me."
good,i wouldn't work for Walmart because i didn't really enjoy working there.There was a lot of favoritism going on . But if you work hard and become good friends with the managers it's easy to get promoted
good,"Walmart is not for everyone, depending on the position you apply for will make you or break you. The pro thing about Walmart is the appointees to move up in the company"
good,Hard work no advancement and low pay. Unorganized hard to get work done some days but always did my best to get things done.used computer physical and heavy machinery to complete tasks
good,"Not too bad but not too sure if it's the right job for a long term career."
good,"The garden centre was fast paced, ever changing. The set up changed almost weekly due to changing seasons and holidays which kept the job interesting. They don't work around your schedule very well. Management is always changing so it was hard to get certain things accomplished because each manager had different ideas and there was no communication between anyone. Wage was ok, comparable with anywhere else."
good,It a good work place to learn how to work different departments work with alot of new people help customer service put stuff up answer the phone help customer find what they are looking for
good,"Managers were a little slow when it's time to come to you.  Overall, the place isn't a bad environment.  I made some friends and the customers are nice.  Would reccomend to a friend."
good,I loved working at Walmart. Got to meet new people and work great people.Some of the customers were inpatient when it came down to taking their order when it was busy. I didn't like working a shift by myself it was very nerve wrecking had run from one end to the other then had to clean the whole work area by yourself.
good,The pay was great the hours were ok but having to work holidays and getting a deferred day was not so great if you have kids. The bonus pay was nice every 3 months.
good,It was a decent job but rude associates. I had a horrible time with people I worked with. They were racist and rude. I was always talked about because of my color.
good,"The location at which I was employed had quite a few issues with providing good customer service and the managers.  Managers should be required to take some type of training before becoming a manager. Other than that , I thoroughly enjoy working with Walmart ."
good,"management need more people skill training,need more people on each shift to give better customer service,need a better health care package,walmart can a great job"
good,"My typical day at work opened at 7:00am and took customers at first come first serve after opening and setting up for the day. Brought stock in from inside, and restocked storage area. Changed oil, batteries, and tires. Mounted and unmounted new and used tires. Had lunch from 12-1. Got off at 4:00pm."
good,For the most part the job is easy and the people are easy to work with. come customers can be hard to handle but in the end its easy to find a way to deal with it.
good,it was indeed fast paced and could become stressful at times every now and then we would have a slow day but other wise it was constant work almost felt like between breaks and lunch there were not enough hours to get all the work done.
good,Walmart is great for experience. I don’t reccomend trying to advance to salary. Communication between management is tolerable to an extent depending on their shift rotations. Walmart is great at promoting the ability to grow and earn Management positions however the politics are disastrous
good,Had many other job opportunities to advance. Become higher up in the company of how well you work your job. Fast paced. A lot of work. Get as much done in a day as you can.
good,I love being at this Job and my coworkers but at this particular walmart management do not care about their employees. You clock in for work to work just your department but you end up working another department that you weren't trained to do. Lets not forget the attitudes that they have
good,"Overall Walmart is a big community of stores and lives up to the customers best interest Thank You Walmart I have not been happier with Walmart , they always have everything organized"
good,I really liked working here. Its a great place for job opportunities. I advanced in positions within the first month. Salary is great with the hours as well.
good,Learned a lot about retail and what is needed to keep a big store stocked and running full time. I have a great appreciation for cashiers because customer service can be difficult or it can be wonderful. I learned a lot about cashiering and customer service. I worked nights.
good,"Fast pace workplace for frontend."
good,"I was not satisfied with the work or how it was being managed, thinking outside the box is frond upon. Rules and paperwork ( some that was unnecessary) made the job harder then it needed to be."
good,Not a horrible place to work. Pay is decent and opportunity for advancement is definitely there if you show ability. Work-life balance is the only thing really holding this job back
good,"I stocked shelves at Walmart in their grocery department. Everyone was pretty laid back-me and the manager got into arguments sometimes but that's because we had a very different approach to work. In the breakroom we were best friends. Not a very demanding job, it was easy enough. The biggest problem I had was a breakdown in communication between management."
good,"overall the job was not that at all, i really enjoyed working there! The only negative thing that I would have to say about working there was that they liked to show favoritism."
good,"the culture at Walmart is a family atmosphere where everyone works together to accomplish objectives to drive the customer experience."
good,Walmart tended to require employees to work more for less. Advancement within the store did not always equate to advancement in pay. Management tended to not understand how jobs under them worked and would not provide adequate support for staff. Hard workers were treated poorly and bad workers were coddled. This was an adequate temporary part time that turned full time until I was ready to find a better job but it was not a career for me.
good,"A typical day of work was providing premier customer service, including greeting them and responding to questions. The most enjoy part of the job was being able to be creative and working with great team members."
good,"I learned the basics in what is happening in a supermarket. i learned to perform merchandising, receiver and inventory associate. Advancement is slow if you can not speak french."
good,"There is quick room to move up into a management position, but you are often over look by your manager for these kinds of opportunities. And favorites are often played, creating an issue when it come to promotions."
good,"Waited on customers, bag their groceries, count back change, answer any questions they ask you.  Help them throughout the store if necessary and they ask you for assistance.  Thank all customers with good eye contact, good customer service, and a friendly smile, so they will likely to shop in your store again."
good,Its a good company with benefits. Lots of hours and work. The customers can be trying sometimes. Lots of physical work stocking and warehouse. They like to hire people from within with experience.
good,"I had never held this type of position before, so I am grateful that they took a chance on me. I really liked working with the public, it was fast paced, and a new learning experience. I needed more actual training in some areas, but, since it was the holiday season, it was a learn as you go type position. I was impressed by the store management, because during busy times they were on the registers,helping where needed, and seemed to really care about their employees as well as their customers."
good,In the world of Walmart there is no communication between management and supervisors. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customer. I have learn to deal with irate customers.
good,"Empresa que busca a excelência em seu seguimento, ótimo para pessoas sem formações profissionais, que queiram aprender algum ofício dentre os da classe comercial de alimentos."
good,"Managing the front end means taking care of the guests and the staff which can get a bit overwhelming at times, you must prioritize the problems that pop up as they come and deal with them one at a time."
good,Mgt has change big time in this company. They us to care about there people. District mgt was not a nice person at all. There are 3 other people that has left because of her
good,Walmart is a very different job depending on the job type you hold there. As a cashier it is fast paced throughout most of the day. The customer service managers that you closely work with are typically friendly and very helpful to complete your daily tasks.
good,The jobs were easy it was just the low wages and some of the attitudes of the managers who treated me like I don't know anything. They tried to make me the leader of our department but would not allow me to become a manager.
good,Management team does not work well together. Expectations are set high. Have to come in on days off for meetings that last about two hours. Associates are great.
good,"My job at Walmart was working in the pet department and then later on in the deli. In the pet department I helped customers, stocked the items fed and cleaned the fish tanks. In the deli I helped customers at the deli food sliced meat and cheese cleaned and helped in the bakery."
good,they hire you for seasonal and when your good they keep you. real easy to get a job their. they always looking and wanna make people do better and promote them.
good,"Fast paced typically. I've learned, merchandising, their computer system. management for the most part have been very helpful to me and kind. hardest part about my job I would have to say would be customers. I never know what kind of mood they will be in and they can be very unaccommodating at times. the thing I like the most about my job is seeing everyone who works with me and getting everything done on time"
good,"Everything depends on the managers and how big the store is. Can be slow, can be very fast paced. Can be a great college workplace. Thankful for my time there, no matter what!"
good,"It's a job for the faced paced people for sure. It's not a bad one, you just can't be slow. Walmart is a good place  overall to work, I'd go back again but maybe not a stocker. The only problem I had there was the faster you worked the more they would add to your list while the slow, slackers would be doing half the work you do but for the same pay....If you slow down they get pretty upset but still let the slackers slack..."
good,"Depending on the department that you work in, the average day consists of stocking and organizing your department. Managers may pull you to assist departments that are short-staffed but most of them stay short-staffed. As long as you stay on task, the work is usually not too overwhelming. Potential to climb the corporate ladder is available but they won't always choose the most qualified people."
good,It's a job that pays better than most starting out but they don't allow overtime. Which means when you have stayed over at all you have to cut that time within the same pay period on your lunch break.
good,"muy buena predisposición laboral, buen grupo humano, colaborativo."
good,Worked as cashier in a large retail conglomerate. Highly skilled in providing behind the counter services to retail customers.  In depth knowledge of operating cash registers and adding machines. Hands on experience in balancing cash drawer and receipts. Able to perform clerical tasks effectively.
good,It was my first full time well paying job. I worked in 5 different departments some very manual labor heavy some more machine heavy. I enjoyed the work schedule always had three days off.
good,"I work at Walmart part time.  I work another full time job."
good,"Overall the job isn’t terrible but it can be very stressful at times. Inconsistent scheduling can cause a discrepancy in staffing therefore associates are to take on multiple roles to keep te store operating. Service areas are often left unattended due to lack of associates in other areas, which in turn, hurts business."
good,"would be great but had some issues with management some days are better than other, and for the amount of stress it wasn't worth it minimum wage and no benefits"
good,"I was only a part of walmart's team for 2-3 months. Everyone was sad when I left. I enjoyed almost every part of it. One of the biggest problems that I had while working here, is that I never got any of my check stubs sent to me via email, or mail box."
good,productive work environment....Great environment to learn how to balance work and life.... Managers could have taken out more time with associates to learn what was needed in the store. Associates were great to work with! I would recommend the job for various reasons but the main reason is you can move up quickly in the company!
good,It was an okay place to work. It was somewhat stressful at times but it was great work. The company was great at offering discounts for its employees.
good,"Job was a little heavy duty in the deli & management is very strict storewide. However the pay is decent for skill-less labor. Benefits are only for full time workers and my only wish is that scheduling would be more considerate and balanced for shifts as far as their workers lives. It makes it impossible to have two jobs at once, not to mention getting off at 11 and being back at 6 is no joke for the tiring work, especially if you live far."
good,It was kind of up and down for hours because of the employment ratio most times and the holidays especially Christmas and black Friday. It was a different experience.
good,A typical day at work would start out with clocking into work. Then I would start with cashiering for awhile until it got later at work then if business was slow I would re-stock and organize items on the shelves near my register. The night would be like that most of the night until my shift was over.
good,I was on third shift so you would get all types of people coming thru your line. At times it was not that busy so you would have to stock to keep yourself busy.
good,Fairly easy but hard work. I've been there all together about 8 years and am still just a regular employee. Every promotion requires experience which I don't have because I haven't been given the opportunity.
good,"I have been working at Walmart for almost 15 years, in  the beginning it's a ""family"" oriented store, now it's about the money, and it seems that numbers matter and sometimes not the people.. they cut hours and people new hires are making almost as much and the 'old timers' and that's not equality, nor fair. If you put in your time, then why not give those hard workers a raise.."
good,"Clock in and get carts ready to unload the truck.  Some days the truck would have 2500 boxes and other days much more.  If not unloading the truck, you are on the other side doing large box pallets and getting items stocked before carts from the truck have to go out to the aisles.  They have increased the pay quite a bit and the managers are good at this store for the most part.  There is a strict no overtime policy and scheduling was terrible.  Days off during the week were scattered and not back to back days like 99% of most businesses so this is very inconvenient.  The managers always took the weekends off so be prepared to work weekends.  You get two paid short breaks but are required to clock out for an hour lunch which was nice.   The hardest part was not knowing where things are when customers are always asking for where things are.  The store has high turnover so most days we were short handed."
good,"I enjoy what I do and the people I meet. Your job is what u make it, I choose to enjoy it. I do my best to help my customers, follow the rules and respect everyone."
good,"it's a comfortable place to work & you get adjusted to your job very quickly. however, don't expect to make any money. everything you make goes to your bills, not your dreams. i started when i was 17, i'm 19 now, and the whole time i've been with walmart, i've begged and pleaded for full-time so that i could pursue post-secondary education. but alas, you always get the same answer: ""we're not hiring for full-time."" this is because they really don't offer full-time unless you're a manager or store standards. although i like the company, i'm quitting because there are better wages and better hours out there that don't require a degree or 500 years worth of professional experience. work here if you just need the experience to build a resume because they'll hire anyone, but for the love of GOD, do not stay here if you want to build a life."
good,The company is not what it us to be lots of changer have come about. The company try to control what is important so you don't get approved days off nor do they except doctors excuses.
good,"The job was easy for the most part, I went it and knew what I had to do and when it had to be done by. I stocked the shelves as quickly as I could then would help others if they needed it. I did my job well and quickly so I was well liked by management. However, I could see why an individual wouldn't be well liked by management if they didn't perform their simple tasks to their standards. My managers were nice, easy to talk to, and really liked me so it made my overall experience better than expected."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart had its ups and downs. I was working at a Wal-Mart supermarket that unfortunately had very bad management. They spoke to you in a tone where they knew they had more authority over you and there was nothing that you could do about it. A typical day at the job consisted of cleaning, and stocking the products wherever they belonged. Once you were done stocking, you had to zone(basically arranging the products so that they are neatly organized). Working here taught me a lot more about the needs and wants of customers. You have to be very patient with customers and make sure that their needs are the most important, keeping the customers happy keeps them coming back. There was not really a hard part about the job because it was really relaxed, just do what you were told and everything was going to be okay."
good,"but lack of communication between departments causes stress on other workers, working in other areas. the lack of communication will often be leaving employees no answers to some unforeseen problems."
good,A typical work day is assisting all customers that come through the door and making sure it is done with a smile. The management called people out their names and treated them unfairly. The co workers were the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part being able to keep calm and just do my intended job at hand.
good,"I thought Walmart was a pretty good job to start out with. It wasn't too stressful getting into the work and once I understood my role and responsibilities, it became a lot easier to accomplish the tasks given to me."
good,"Management sucks. They don't care about anyone but themselves and their bonus. They don't even care about your bonus, just theirs. They throw lots of associate parties though."
good,"The day starts checking the stock room for carts or pallets full of merchandise which you must transfer to a cart for your department. "
good,Walmart is a highly stressful workplace in salaried management. You have good pay but the hours and time away from family takes a toll on you overall health.
good,"Clock in, get assignments, do the work, and during this I learned to work site to store, customer service, cashier, and electronics. Management is ok some are better than others but can deal. Hardest part of the job is when we have too many chiefs and not enough indians. the most enjoyable part of the job is when customers leave with a smile and knowing you did right by them at the end of the day."
good,Lack of communication between shifts and none at all between departments. Total disconnect from upper management to associate. Decent company overall.
good,pay was good. People nice to work with. I would still be there if it wasn't for tranportion problems.working for them was fine.the Mangers were good. The deptment was fun. Would work there agine.
good,"A typical day started out clearing the truck for cap 2. there were a lot of very kind understanding management in the building there are also some pretty non professional management but that's ok,"
good,"Management all around sucks. Can never find good managers that stick around. Otherwise, benefits are great and the environment is quite fun and the people are nice!"
good,it a good place to work and hard but as long as you try and do all you can it will get better and it is a fun place to you meet alot for good costumers and workers
good,"I started as a Temp during the Christmas season and have now been here 3 years. I LOVE the people I work with but the customers can be impossible. You can't blame the company for the general public's behavior but the pay is the worst."
good,"Good place as a stepping stone, very fast paced, most coworkers are friendly, some customers more difficult than others. They are flexible with scheduling and giving requested days off. they also are good about giving you extra hrs"
good,"It was okay, you never knew when you were going to have heavy trucks or easy trucks the hours were very poor at wal mart some weeks id get 14 hours and no one can live on 14 hours. The work was simple just put the items on the shelf and clean your mess."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart but it was only a temp job. I wanted more experience elsewhere so I decided to apply at a call center job and moved on. It was a good experience.
good,In the store I worked in everyone had each others backs. The more things each other knew the more we could help each other. The upper management outside of the store did not seem to care about the store employees needs though.
good,It was an easy task to learn. I enjoyed the job but I didn't get enough hours. Plus the pay didn't add up to what was a liveable income. I was unsatisfied.
good,low overnight staff makes job stressful.benefits are great. hours are good but scheduling and request days are terrible and very hard to get and there is no holiday pay
good,"Yes there are opportunities for advancement.  However, the pay is minimal and the demands are extensive for a cashier.  Apparently, sales has become a part of the job."
good,"Although providing great work experience and benefits to their employees, the upper management team has a corrupt inner politics battle among themselves with the exception of a few. With a high turn over rate of employees they hire and then provoke older employees into becoming eligible to be fired it is a game of keeping the cost of the employees down to save the store money so the upper management team are able to maintain their large end of the year bonuses. However the lower management team is far more relate-able and realistic in their approach to customer service. The teamwork among the base level employees is fair and just with only one or two small exceptions."
good,"Simple work place. If i didnt have bigger goals financially id work there again. A break every two hours, which you didnt really need since your not dying working, unless your unloading the truck. And steady hours."
good,"As long as you can keep up with the high demanding tasks and can complete them quickly, walmart is a good place to work. Good benefits offered and decent pay for someone in school or a temporary job. Difficult to advance, not a career."
good,"I am not anti Walmart, however, when one works there it will be obvious that you are working for a large corporation and very little control is exercised at the store level.  Therefore changes that would make the work routine better cannot be made, especially in the area of inventory control."
good,The management at walmart i dont't know about the rest of walmart store but the very one i worked at was very poor. They lack collaboration amongst themelves
good,Poor management in my particular role but otherwise a very friendly work environment. Benefits are good and compensation is fair and competitive. Discounts are also a plus.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. The company has flaws and not everything is agreeable. But any typical day you learn a lot about the sales industry, as well as how to run an area in accordance with the evolving industry."
good,Management needs better training. They are not train properly. I think if more training was available it would be less stressful for all associates and better organize.
good,Walmart is a standard minimum wage job that can get you ready for bigger and better jobs down the road. good customer experience opportunities and job habits.
good,"The company as a whole wasn't so bad. The management at the location I was were messy. They were two faced, discussed associate disciplines and other personal info with other associate's. They cursed the associates and wouldn't let you leave.  They weren't training the associates or department managers at all. The management team just delegated their notes to the associates without properly going over them. They sat in the office and I would watch them walk in and out the door to smoke. I would say in an 8 hour shift, I've seen them do this 6-10 times daily. The associates were great but got little recognition for sales or anything for that matter. The company would be so much better if only they really saw how their management team operate. The employees were pretty much running the store. They always say they won't retaliate but that's not true. If you report a manager for wrong doing, they turn around and try to coach or terminate you."
good,A typical day at Walmart consists of prepping the backroom for unloading the GM truck.  Afterwards we are assigned to our areas for later stocking and assisting customers whenever I'm able to.
good,"Walmart was my very first job and it definitely helped a lot with learning how to interact with customers! I was a cashier and felt it was a very quick to learn, good job. The day would go buy pretty fast, management and training were good. Flexible hours, set breaks, good pay. Overall a very good learning experience and first job."
good,"Besides management, working for walmart was great. I enjoyed working with the customers, and I was one of the fasted cashiers there. I learned that if your provied great customer service, the customers will respect you and your work."
good,"Walmart could be a lifetime commitment with many benefits and perks including PTO (Paid time off) based off of hours worked and time with the company. Yearly raises and the possibility for a bonus quarterly. Stock options. 401k. Health benefits are an option. Discount card and discounted membership to Sam's Club. "
good,"nice place and break-room, pay is to low to be competitive though, I do a lot that is others responcibility, I don't complain, but they just keep dumping on me"
good,Even though working in the front end of walmart was very fast paced and tedious in times it's still a pretty decent place to work.  I would recommend this job.
good,"A typical day at Walmart could be pretty slow business early in the morning.around noon business usually picks up .assisting customers,stocking,price changing,also cashing out purchases for customers."
good,"Assembling merchandise in a fast pace,go backs and zone toys,check products at door,push carts if needed,accept or deny bikes at customer service.Productive workplace."
good,Its very face pace and never slow I worked in a super center the employess were great and friemdly just like every job everyone has issues I felt the company can care more
good,"Bom benefícios ,carga horária média, gerenciamento médio"
good,WALMART is a established business with a long term reputation . Benefits we ok.  Some what of a relaxe work environment .  Company became a micromanaged .
good,"Use to be a great company has went downhill in last few years"
good,Very Fast Paced but friendly. I enjoy working with the associates and everyone is very friendly.  I have met and made many friends while working here.
good,Oversaw several different departments as a Assistant SM.  I also oversaw the entire overnight shift of the operations.  I assisted in 100 plus employee scheduling and staffing.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. I loved seeing my coworkers and the customers. I had regular customers that came through my line. The management could use a little work, but overall it's a good place to work."
good,Walmart was an ok place to work at the management and co work were up and down but all around good to work with. The only downside was the upper management were not understanding when it came to your personal life if a emergency arose.
good,I would not recommend to work at Walmart because the higher management over the whole store does not see what actually goes on in each department. The overall management does not care if you have a availability they will schedule you anyways.
good,"The pay is base above minimum wage, good coworkers are fun, so are good customers. Worst part for sure is bad management, they look down from on high."
good,"I would not recommend anyone to work at the location I was employed with. Manangement is very poor, and they didn't try to get better help. If they would've disciplined the employees who refused to work I would have stayed. They only promised to talk to them not actually help the situation."
good,"Depending on your job, it can be anything from easy to highly stressful.  Hours can be erratic and getting full time is hard unless you move up to management."
good,"Old drivers are being driven out, new drivers are being hired in at the lowest rates ever seen. Not the quality of drivers that used to define wal-Mart. If they still have a private fleet in house in 5 years, I will be surprised."
good,"A typial day at walmart would be great, layed back quite dont have to worry bout to much if u did your job. and most people did. some management was bad but most worked with you"
good,It was a fast-paced place. I would have enjoyed the job if my management was better. I worked self-check and my managers yelled at us if we didn't check the customers out ourselves on self check.
good,"wallmart tiene algunos beneficios como la tarjeta de salud, perotiene uyn defecto malo y es que tratan a los trabajadores mal y le gritan mucho y casi siempre es el turnode la noche. gracias."
good,Your immediate supervisor has a huge influence on how enjoyable your job is. Walmart is an employer that definitely has diversity and willing to give advancement opportunities. The hassle of working every weekend and holidays was too much for a good work/life balance.
good,the work place was great until managment changed everything and cut the transportion dept and cutting our pay and taking us seniors driver and doing away with them
good,Overall the culture is calm and productive but the turnover rate is high and the amount of call-ins is also high making some days more stressful than others. Overall fair wages and a good place to work.
good,Not a bad place to work. Many of the co-workers were kind and it was enjoyable to work most days. Only complaints i have ever has was the knowledge of product and processes by management. Due to rotating managers every 6 months we were faced with teaching managers the processes of daily work in the department. Unfortunately by the time they would get into the rhythm of the job it would be time to change out. that was really the only frustrating part of the job the rest was easy. Do your job and do it to the best of your abilities and you should do fine.
good,pay sucked great people u meet while unloading small breaks most of the time u have to figure things out on your own theres no help most of the days jus u and your coworkers late lunches some trucks no being unload due too packed warehouse
good,"Walmart as a company is a great company to work for. However, at the store level, there tends to be drama between management and the employees. As far as working in the Tire center, there are many rules that get in the way of doing certain jobs well. Granted they can still be done but if certain rules were not in the way, the company would be able to finish work orders faster, while still remaining within OSHA regulations."
good,"A day at work is set at a good pace.  I learned how to use both Outcomes and Mirixa with this company and learned the importance of adherence.  I did not get along with the store manager, and this made it difficult to open a new format Walmart Express from the ground up, but it was an opportunity for growth.  I think the most enjoyable part of my job was putting together a grand opening Healthcare Event with the team I put together and providing services not typically seen in a small community.  The most trying part of this job was working with a store that did not seem to appreciate what the pharmacy brought to the table."
good,"Unless your goal is to work your way up in order to one day be a Store manager then this job is one only for college students and high school students. The pay is pretty low almost at the same level as other retail and fast food. The best thing is that you get an hour lunch. Managers don't seem to understand what autism is or how to work with an individual with aspergers as they don't ever deviate from their regular approach at correcting people, but the good managers will be your best friends. Definitely NOT a recommended job for those with disabilities or that aren't highly receptive of body language."
good,"this was a great job for me, i would have stayed if they could work with my school schedule but unfortunatly they could not, i would go work part time with them today if they had the positions opened !"
good,"Walmart is not a bad company, although our store lacks the leadership, and discipline other stores grasp. although i do enjoy the work i do. thats when noone bothering me."
good,"Like many places of employment Walmart is competitive and highly demanding. You never know if it is going to be a typical day there of taking care of your responsibilities, or if upper management sends a push down the line and the store goes into a frenzy to get what home office wants done. The only bad things Walmart has against it is the current owner has lost the vision of what the company was to be, and the terrible wages it gives its employees."
good,Cashiering or being a sales/floor associate is a fairly easy job however working in customer service/money center is not for the weak. Not only do you have to work in stressful conditions but there's also carts/buggies full of returns that must be sorted and then the items that need to be returned have to be put on the shelves with no one coming to get their department's returns. Customers are yelling at you and throwing hissy fits when they don't get their way and management tries to tell you how to do your job when they don't even know how to do it themselves. It's a decent job and you can make great friends there... It's just not for the faint of heart.
good,Walmart offers good benefits. It’s a good job if you are willing to work in a fast paced environment. Walmart offers a lot of positions once you get in that you can advance up to.
good,Great place to work. It all can depend on your management and your availability. Wal-Mart is only really for their money at the end of the day. It all depends on the person.
good,"When I was there, typical work day was the same everyday. learned several skills about taking care of a department. Management was spotty...some good some bad. Over packed each employee with tons of work"
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company to work for. I have worked at a couple different Walmarts, but I don't recommend working at Conroe Wal-Mart. They are understaffed in several departments, poorly trained new assciates, and very bad upper management with lack of communication between managers. The only benefits were the pay and the friends I made while working there."
good,Working for this company isn't the best unless you have no kids and don't want a set schedule or set days off every week. I wouldn't recommend working here.
good,"Fast-paced environment, assisting customers with grocery and products. Assuring the customer have found everything they needed. Giving great customer service. Wal-Mart is a nice place to work."
good,Management often will talk to you like you are a child. Very disheartening to work here as a department manager and will eventually make you doubt your self worth. Recommend Walmart as a short term job to start a career. Do not spend a long time as a department manager; everyone ends up looking dead inside and loses their sense of humor.
good,The employees that worked at Walmart all got along great because we were mostly all in the same boat. Almost everybody got along well with management and there were never any issues that became public knowledge among the employees. The actual labor that went into the job was very monotonous and could quickly become boring. That is to say the job was preforming the same tasks every day. Overall the job was not satisfying but was an important experience in learning what it means to work in retail.
good,"Poor management, favoritism in the work place, always cutting everyones hours, needs better pay, its a easy job but managers need to provide better help when it comes down to working and they need to do more instead of taking a break for the whole shift when you know your team is short-handed but Walmart does provide good benefits"
good,"capacitación de lo necesario, cuenta con una buena cultura, solo que no se aplica, lo que mas me agrada es la responsabilidad y las personas que tenia a mi cargo"
good,"A challenging workplace that has flexible work hours"
good,"While at Wal-Mart I worked in the produce department. I typically stocked vegetables, fruits, and things of that nature. The most enjoyable part was associating with my coworkers and also helping customers who couldn't find their way. I enjoyed my job so there was no hard part. I learned people skills, organization, and work ethic. This was one of my favorite jobs and I enjoyed it."
good,The day very fast-past and leadership skills grew with management. The workplace is family based and fights do sometimes undermine this precious bond.
good,"In all honesty, it's not a horrible place to work. If you're a people person you will love it. If not and you are just looking for a paycheck then it doesn't matter I guess. Your coworkers will make the job fun, but from what I've also seen there tends to be a lot of personal dramas going on between associates. As for the management team they can make or break your experience as well. If they lack communication skills you're just going to have a terrible time. So all in all it's a roller coaster of a job."
good,"I enjoyed my position, it was a very fast paced environment, always something to do. There was no break or lunch coverage. Breaks were taken as soon as I could sneak one in."
good,"Hard to get time off, they never give you the hours you want unless you are younger then 18, great discounts, sometimes the coworkers are good (depends on the store), and rude customers."
good,"When you come in to walmart you go to the back where associates are"
good,"It would be a good workplace if the work was recognized through pay. It's great to meet different though, I loved that the most. Management is OK, it could be better. Some have discriminated"
good,"A usual day is great. The work keeps you busy, however Iv'e noticed that most of management have a lot if anger issues and they don't seem to enjoy life."
good,I worked in the department that did online orders. Management wasn't very good with schedules so I went without breaks and had to work a lot of overtime to get orders out. The pay was decent. Would have been better if we were allowed to accept tips that were offered to us.
good,The only thing bad about walmart is the management sometimes.. they take their title to their head and when you try to go to them according to open door policy it seems everyone knows your business
good,"A typical job for Cap 2 is unloading the truck, organizing shelves, and stocking shelves. Management is very positive, and the employees don't tend to be mean. It is repetitive though, and the customers (although usually nice) can get pretty mean. It doesn't happen very often, though. Overall, not a bad place to work at all."
good,Fast clean friendly do your job and your fine great with people you will do fine don't back talk have a smile on your face talk to people show them where things are
good,"I learn how to be more polite to people and how to attent to their needs. I lean how to be more patiend and efficient to them "
good,"A good place to work, nothing wrong with the people and management is very understandable. It's a great place to work but I just need to broaden my spectrum."
good,I was working the night shift and they have done away with it. No warning. I now have to works days with a cut in pay. I have changed jobs twice and had to take a cut in pay with that also
good,"They not to professional in the case when they going to talk with associated  and no overtime  not even 40 hours...  "
good,"As with most retail jobs, this one too will require you to work a varied work schedule. Evenings,weekends, and holidays. This company only shuts done 1 day a year. Not even for a full 24 hours."
good,"I had a lot of great coworkers and managers that always made sure that you were ok. Were always there to lend a helping hand. But some of the upper management was power hungry and would fire employees over thing that were poor communication on there part such as the policy on sick days, days off, and pto."
good,All about money&& not the employee.  You have room for advancement outside the pharmacy. You can't on management.  Always cover your tracks && handle your own business.
good,"Walmart was fun while it last. In the temporary time, I spend learning new skills about what should be stock and full. The management and customer relationship is noticeable and nice to work with."
good,"A typical day at work is picking up cases and putting them down on a pallet. I learned how to work as a team. Management helped when needed, sometimes only when it helped them. Culture can be stressful at times because of the lack of professionalism. The hardest part of my job is just mainly the wear and tear of your body from constantly moving and lifting objects. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I become close too."
good,"fast paced, motivated workers, dealing with customers, coworkers are easy to deal with, management would listen to employees ideas on situations, most enjoyable part of the job was associate appreciation."
good,"A typical day working at the Black River Falls Walmart starts with clocking in. After that, I would immediately head to My area or Lawn and Garden. I'd either start doing tasks based on our notes app or do what our manager or department manager wanted to be done."
good,Overall I would say walmart is a good first job for someone to have. I believe  everyone in their life should work retail at least once. It teaches you alot.
good,Working at Walmart isn't a career path I would recommend anyone to have unless they did it for a year or two. The company is going down hill and so are the customers. Some of them are just so hateful that they don't even realize your a human being too. Only do this job if you need some quick cash or need flexibility other than take I'd look else where...
good,It was a great experience and I got to meet and work with a lot of great people. It helped me grow more as a person as well as a worker. But policies and too much change was ruining the company and work place. As well as seeing what my own superiors had to deal with on a daily basis was getting too hard for me to handle. The company it's self does not treat their employees well anymore like they used too when I first started.
good,Walmart is a great place to work at. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. The managers are always sweet and know how to get the job done.
good,It's an alright place to work I did nightshift and it was great I love to work in a fast manner definitely if your good with your hands.working in the freezer was kind of tough because your hands would get really cold. But overall the pay was good and you got an hour lunch! But you don't get paid for it.
good,Even though job pays well management makes the job not good never been at a job where management they talk down to you and then bring up how much money they pay you.
good,"My personal management was great. The rules were strict but for a place that large it makes sense. Customers could make or break your day. The culture was ""I need this job for the check."" The hardest part of the job was telling customers they could not get medication they needed. The most enjoyable part was helping individuals use the tools they already possessed to get what they needed."
good,"Always moving. Keeping you at the top of your game."
good,"I worked for Walmart for 2 years and had thoroughly enjoyed it up until I moved my way into upper management. Each day came with different challenges, but you start to deal with the same type of issues over and over again. The most difficult part of working for this company is the hours, which can be very ridiculous at times. Salaried managers will often pull of a 24 hour shift because of the expectations from the managers at corporate. If you are looking for a job with work/life balance, this is not the company for you."
good,"The management team does not do their job. They are very stuck up, careless and unprofessional. I would find myself running the entire front end of Walmart by myself while at least four of my co-workers were nowhere to be found on a daily basis. I would find them doing things like sitting in the office doing things like straightening wires. I mean like all four of them, in there straightening wires."
good,No estoy satisfecha con mi sueldo porque ya llevo muchos años trabajando.
good,Its a very fast paced environment. Pays not very well and work is very hard. Heavy lifting is required and can be hard on your back sometimes. Management team is very good.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work for your first job.  There is always plenty of work to do so it makes the day go fast.  However, the management is terrible.  People placed in team lead/management positions needs training on how to communicate with staff. Management tend to take advantage and talk to teens any kind of way.  Work schedules change on you at any giving moment and you are expected to look at the schedule daily after the schedule as been giving out for the week."
good,Working for Walmart I got to worked in six different departments over my seven year employment. That was the only way my salary increased over the years
good,"A day at Walmart for a cap team 2 member typical starts in the back room unloading trucks and then to stocking product during the day we learn to use organization skills to stock more efficiently and electric jacks to move loads of products."
good,Being a college student I worked every single weekend and was there until almost midnight most of the time.  They would never schedule enough help and then would forbid you to get overtime but everything had to be done before you left.
good,I really enjoyed working with my fellow associates had a lot of fun working with them. And I enjoyed meeting and helping all the different customers that come in.
good,"Was weird, joined on when WAL-MART went to a Superstore. Hardest job of my life. Surprised,  they did not get sued. After 25 plus days it was up and running (grocery)."
good,Doesn't respect certain hours. To many clicks. Favoritism. Management doesn't discipline correctly or talk to employees correctly. Hardest part is getting use to the constant changing of hours dramatically. Doesn't actually have team work.
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, not necessarily the people I work for, just like alot of jobs, you have your good and bad parts. Overall not too bad a place to work."
good,"The hours and pay were impossible to continue working there because of my financial needs. I felt that I was not a valued employee, a statistic.I was hired as a cashier and spent most of my hours standing at the door as a greeter."
good,"I didn't like Walmart that much because it was badly  manage, people didn't care about the  customer. Only good thing came from Walmart was the people and the job experience"
good,"It's a decent job. Your experience will be different based on your immediate supervisor and department. In hindsight, I should have kept working and get promoted to a floor/department manager."
good,All in all Walmart is a good place to work. A typical day isn't too stressful until you get near the holidays. You work with a good bunch of people as well as most management. the hardest part of the job is dealing with unruly or nasty customers. But they are few for the most part.
good,"Its was an ok job, you had your good days and you had your bad days. but any other day its always nice to have a customer come up to out of the blue and still make you smile."
good,Managers are terrible.  Work is easy to learn.  Workers are not friendly and not helpful.  There is no hard part of the job.  Did not enjoy working there.
good,"A typical day at work is doing some live pa, handing out flyers, talking to customers and getting many sales as you can. The hardest part is talking to customers about your product as most customers will not care."
good,"Working here was ok, I would usually get taken to other departments to help out or have to go up front to ring people out, making me not have enough time to clean up my department."
good,"It could be a great job, however the attendance policy could use work, as could communications, & schedule flexibility. For example I need to change my availability but I fear losing the majority of my hours or even my job if I put in the request."
good,It is a good opportunity to work at Walmart and learn different duties of different departments. The workplace culture of Walmart is very comfortable which allows one to excel in his or her field.
good,The thing about WalMart is the managers are so lazy. The feel that they are better than the other associates because they get paid more. I feel that if everyone try to work there hardest everything would run smoothly.
good,Nice people and managers are friendly. easy to switch shifts with people. some weeks you can get extra hours if you ask. its a good workplace to be at
good,"Management for the most part is okay. The work is not hard, you just need to make sure your work gets done. The work/life balance is decent, it really depends on the department you are in, I worked in Produce so i had a lot of hours that were all 7+ hours shift and it can really unbalance your work/life balance."
good,its a job that you go to because you have to make money. while i was there no opportunity for growth. They work you like animals with minimum pay. Also make you stressed out if there are too many people in line.
good,"My experience at Walmart was ok. I like the benefits that came with working there, but as a whole they were unorganized. Not speaking for all Walmarts , just the one I worked for."
good,"My role was to scan merchandise either into or out from receiving shelf locations to maintain system and area organization. Without sun, music, or constant conversation, it's a dull, computer based work life. With the company I've learned customer orientation, daily organization and cleanliness, and learned to understand the business as a whole."
good,Although I was apprehensive about working in the retail world it was a good company to work for. The pay at the time was a normal min wage start. The cost of living raises were minimal at best. I would go back based on what I've heard from coworkers that still work there
good,Workplace culture is great. The job is very fast paced and requires multitasking skills. Strong customer service skills for both internal and external customers are a must.
good,"This job is an extremely fast paced working environment. Very tiring and tough on the body, Very long work hours and short breaks. I would not recommend for females."
good,I would arrive at Walmart at around 1:55 and clock in at exactly 2:00 everyday. After that I would go to my cap 2 team managers to get assigned to where I would work until either my shift ended or I finished my work in that section. If I finished early I would move on to another area which I was assigned to do. Most times managers would often come to check on the workers very frequently most times in 10 minute intervals. Often there would be large trucks of around 3000-4200 piece trucks and everyone would have to constantly keep pace and work as a functional team.
good,I worked at two different Walmart stores and they are all the same. It really depends if you can deal with a lot of stress to work there. Lack of workers and management  does not communicate like they should. The only benefit I got was a 10% discount. It is an okay place to work.
good,"No where else to go in this company but management, and not interested with their management treatment. Workplace culture is upbeat and coworkers are productive."
good,"it was ok management seemed all over the place. It's pretty laid back earlier during the day and late at night. "
good,Friendly work environment. It is an extensive company with locations world- wide thus allowing anyone to pursue their career as far as they would like. The work/life balance is not ideal. Most positions are geared toward part time which does not meet most peoples expectation of maintaining employment.
good,"Walmart offers good training on customer service, however the on the job training is lacking. if you are working with a team it will be no trouble, but if you are alone then you will need to find the older employee to help guide you."
good,I worked there for three years while I was in college. It was a retail job that served it's purpose for the time. Expect to be treated like your are expendable.
good,"On a daily bases I interact with the customer. A customer would ask questions regarding sale items, will ask where to locate a specific item they are looking for, ring up sales, Work with CSM to get help when there is a price adjustment."
good,Fast paced retail environment with flexible hours. Hours are not set so you have to have flexible availability. Advancement and education credits are offered through the company training programs.
good,Walmart is a good company you can learn a lot and do a lot you can advance and be able to further your career within the company with degrees.  Just lots of training assessments
good,People were friendly and would help if someone was behind. Some mid level management would overlook you at times as for as you needing help.Company had decent benefit and did give quarterly bonuses if we met our goal for the quarter
good,"While one person loves it the next may hate it. Some people have it easy and some have it hard. People tend to be two faced, backstabbing liars. If you don't get get support from managers you will go nowhere. But if they decide you are worthy you will never fail."
good,I was able to be cross trained in many different areas.  Good close people to work with and fun to be around.  It will be a good solid job to start out with not sure if you want to make a career out of it.
good,"Being a stocker at Walmart can be very stressful , especially when your in a department by yourself with 8-10 pallets with no help and management expects you to finish it all."
good,Great people to work with and nice work environment. Management semi decent but don't understand that people have lives outside of the workplace. Other than that nice place.
good,"Less pressure from management.  Less pay in general.  They recently are trimming down the hours they are giving to pharmacist.  Compared to other chains, the benefits are nicer, especially 401k."
good,"Working at walmart can be fast paced and stressful but it can also be fun. You get to meet a lot of interesting people and if you take your job seriously you can recieve a sense of pride when helping customers and giving good customer service. It is a physically demanding job ( you are on your feet a lot) but they do work with people on any limitations you may have. I loved the people i worked with and that made the job much more enjoyable. If you have good management, which i did, the job can be fun and there is a sense of family with your fellow employees. I would say the hardest part is the long hours being on your feet. The best part of working for walmart is that as long as you work hard there is a lot of room for advancement within the company."
good,They do pay fairly but prepare to work every second of the day to try and meet the extremely high production rates.  You get the feeling that you are expendable and that any day could be your last day working there
good,Very fasted paced. Great staff and good managers. Learned a lot in the deli department about cooking and slicing meat. Not that stressful just long hours. My most enjoyable part was helping the customers.
good,A typical day at work involves being at the register and assisting customers with their purchases. At the point of sales I scan their merchandise and tell them the total at the end of the transaction.
good,"The best thing about my job are the people I work with on a nightly basis. They are what helps me get through each shift. Some managers are easier to get along with, but I don't stress over it. The benefits are good, but the pay could be better."
good,Walmart is a good place to work with good benefits. It always stayed busy so you always had something to do.  The managers there are tough but they are good people. The people there became family to me.
good,"Walmart is a really good job, but the way they go about things is something people probably wouldn't want to deal with everyday not the job more so the people in the work place. they're very controlling and show their true colors to the employees when they know that they're above you in the work place."
good,Like my job like the people I work with I have had chances to move up in the company but don't take it due to personal reason I'm looking for a part time job
good,cash handling cashing checks training new hires commuication with correct gramer able to stand long periods of time. The job will give you the chance to meet and talk with all new people and able to have self control. There will be times that you will have a customer that will want to talk with a higher manger than yourself and being able to resolve the problem without taking it to a higher manger than yourself
good,It's an okay place to work for. They expect you to do more then that hat you can handle. They rush you when you are doing things and when you need something they take there time doing it.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for."
good,I often had to take time from working on my task to help others do theirs because they were not properly trained. Being under trained was not a huge problem for me because i have years of on the job training.
good,the job was okay its just like any other the staff aka my coworkers were very nice and i like the fact that everybdy was on the same page it felt more like family
good,"There was never a dull moment, lots to do. Greeting customers, cleaning your aisle, making sure the belt and bagging area was clean and organized. I got to meet all sorts of fascinating people. My co-workers and I all got along and worked together nicely."
good,Store management needs to be reworked in some districts and good managers need to be given better roles and weaker managers need to be let go.  Quit holding on to dead weight.
good,Scan out returned merchandise and receive proper credit from vendors.  Train current and new associates on hazardous waste procedures and polices.  file daily paperwork.
good,Working at Walmart you will see a diverse group of people. You will have to be speedy working there being a cashier your line builds up really fast. Stock Associate wasn't bad I was just doing slot of restocking and folding clothes.
good,"Staffing shortages contributed to less than excellent patient care."
good,"Most of my work day was sitting and working on my computer."
good,If you work hard you will get hours but getting promoted is a joke of politics. there maintenance equipment is falling apart but they wont replace it or get it fixed properly but they do have new tc70's and mc40's that makes the back rooms manageable
good,"It was a fun place to work. Mangers for the most part were chill and laied back. Made alot of friends there, i liked it. The pay was alright i suppose, it just didnt feel like enough for 2 weeks, and i got a better job offer making more getting paid every week. So i just couldn't turn that oppertunity down. I was in college at the time too, so i needed more money to help pay for school. The hardest part of working for walmart was when we got like 3 trucks that had came in during the day and we had to down stack them and make sure everything got to it's area and put away before 7AM when our shift ended. The most enjoyable part of working there, was the friends that i made. Because they all had the same personality as me so we all got along just fine and quickly bonded."
good,Walmart does not value thier customers or employees the way they should. I believe their business model will backfire eventually. I would like to move on from Walmart because of a disagreement over direction of the company.
good,"Working at Walmart is a good experience in working retail. It gives you a good idea of what to look out for and what is asked of you and in general can help advance your social skills when talking to customers or fellow employees. The issues I had involved communication with management and schedule flexibility. I feel like they could care less for their workers and what their workers need. It hadn't always been this way, but has slowly turned into this over time. Now I can hardly say the pay is worth it due to the hours I am getting and what is expected of me when I do have hours. It's ridiculous. However this is a problem with one store. Not the entire company as a whole."
good,Seems like a good place to get your feet wet with work experience and handling money (for maybe a teenager) but the hours and money needs improvement.
good,"The expectations of my department are high, the environment is friendly, the work is challenging and fast-paced while requiring a multitude of differing skills; all qualities I prefer in a job. The downsides of the job involve conflicting expectations from the multiple levels of management, chronic and frequent understaffing, high turnover rate, and low pay. The hardest part of the job is working in freezing conditions, as part of the job requires manual labor in a freezer. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly environment and making memorable cakes for our customer's special events."
good,"It was a great tie over job until something better came along.  I worked in the bakery and they were training me to decorate cakes and cupcakes for the showcase counter.  I enjoyed my time there but it was not a permanent job for me.  I stocked shelves, decorated cupcakes, wrote on cakes, bagged bread and buns as well as date tagged them, took cake orders, handed out cookies to children, answered the phone, priced the discount rack."
good,"Hard to move up"
good,Great place to work coming into the company. Felt welcomed and as a part of the team. Throughout time there has been favoritism and loss of some of our benefits such as sick time and holiday pay. Moved to a paid time off program which earns us approximately 1 hour pto time when working a holiday for straight pay. No double time or deferred holidays anymore. Other than that no complaints.
good,"I'd like to work at office to help people because I spend 16 years studying to be lawyer,, and three years at Turkish airlines at the same time,, so I can't find my self at walmart ,, but its a great company."
good,"Overall Walmart is a great company to work for but lately they have cut back on the hours. I'm looking for a   full time job. With benefits "
good,"I thought i could tough it out for the pay, but my management team is killimg me. They will write up entire departments for shrink caused by the lack of rotation, but won't even bother to correct their mods when new items arrive, or their numbers to have accurate stock arriving on a nightly basis. It sucks"
good,Walmart can be a fun enviornment and worker friendly but they have they down sides. They do what they want to do and sometimes care less about you and your needs. Make sure that whatever availability you put down is what you can absolutely work
good,I dont know I just dont want to work weekends and holidays anymore. This is so dumb that I have to write this I dont care about giving a review about this place.
good,A job fit for a incoming college student or a retired person to have something to do to take up time. The managers are more concerned with your personal life than your work production.
good,A typical day at work can be easy as long as one is willing to help customers and follow directions. Management depends on the particular store. The hardest part of the job is getting used to managers and the way they organize their store.
good,".better management, better family friendly hours, increase raises, ethics or doctor working for being applied to doctor as well,  better home office communication when things aren't working properly"
good,No set schedule one many 40 hour next week probably 24 hour no balance manager make your job very stressful and threatened you about get fired talk to employees  wrong.didn't care for my experience  but pay and benefits  was good.
good,My typical day at Walmart was helping customers find items and ring them up and make sure they were the rite prices. I learned that you should ask for help if needed. The workplace is very energetic at times. The hardest part about the job is making sure the customer is happy with there experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting a smile on the customers and fellow employes faces..
good,"I worked as a Department Manager.I had to order make the schedule,run the cash register and stock.. I enjoyed working for Walmart and the people there."
good,Basic restocking and managing inventory. Pretty repetitive as all you do is work on skids for most of your shift. People there are nice since they are mostly within my age.
good,"Okay place to work but overall not employee friendly.  Worked there for  years and was unable to use any sick time as per their policy,  They to not except doctor excuses if your ill.  Will explain more if needed."
good,"I worked TLE department and I loved it, didn’t really work any other departments. Pay wasn’t as I expected for the department I was in though. Overtime could’ve been given out more as well."
good,"I was a sales associates in apparel which included folding clothes, taking and putting back clothes from the floor, helping with returns, and time with the phone"
good,"Salaried Management is grossly abused in the amount of hours you have to work ranging from the scheduled 50hrs/wk to upwards of 120+hrs/wk, with no compensation. Days off are not consistent and are usually split. Can get days off taken away and work up to 12+ days in a row without a day off."
good,"Requires a lot of dedication and hard work. Managers are required to do everything, not just manage. The work load and hours are very heavy at times. Not much appreciation but a lot of criticism"
good,Felt comfortable working due to friendly co workers and effective teamwork. Since I was preparing for college my coworkers really helped me rescheduling my working hours which helped me a lot. I really appreciate their assistance.
good,Es un buen empleo si se quiere ganar experiencia y aprender de muchas áreas y actividades diferentes. Implica pasar como mínimo 10 horas laborando y en la mayoría de los casos muchas más.
good,"Assuming that you know little to nothing about the department you're working in it's alright. Pay is fair under those conditions, also has decent benefits. However if you are more skilled in an area, the pay is lack luster."
good,"Management provides flexible hours, however managers are strict on shift changes, such as students should work at least 3 nights of closing and has to be the weekend."
good,"Since I heard a nursing background, I had more sympathy for the injured associate."
good,Trucks come in daily and must be unloaded as quickly as possible. Management wants quick efficient work done like a well oiled machine. The workplace does try to push teamwork but sometimes comes up short. If out on the sales-floor must be alert as helping a customer takes top priority.
good,I liked working in the fitting room and answering the telephone but I did not like that the managers MADE everyone learn to operate a cash register and didn't offer more money for the extra title. Poor management skills and the managers ALWAYS had attitudes.
good,"The pay is a joke for as hard as the associates work."
good,hardest part of the job was to make sure the customer was a happy when they left Walmart  I learned how a big company balanced the store was I the cash office for 4 months
good,Be on time! Work hard!  The business is customer driven.  Customer satisfaction is very important.  The hardest part about the job is not being able to adjust your schedule/shift.
good,I spent 4 years at walmart. I worked hard was cross trained in everything. I had 3 different jobs while working here and I enjoyed them all for the most part. My biggest complaint is that Walmart does not know how to help or take care of their employees when they need help.
good,They mangers are not professional to me but I love the job. They have great workers but there mangers are childish and very unprofessional when it comes down to work.
good,"N/a a job just to start off. Have to have people skills . A lot of work but no money!!"
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart wasn't the worst thing in the world. Having 10 hour shifts back to back or working 8 days in a row does get a little bit much, but they do give you a small discount on most things except food and clearance items, and we get paid 15 minute breaks. The problem is getting those breaks in a timely fashion so you're not standing for more than 3 hours at a time. Sometimes management drops the ball during the busy hours and cashiers get forgotten about or make customers wait for their assistance."
good,I don't really remember all of my Walmart days as I had been a teen and was more focused on school but I like it and had fun. I remember it was my first job as well and I saved a good amount of money too.
good,Walmart is a company that you know is not going anywhere and you are sure to have a job (as long as you don't get yourself into trouble). One thing about ASM position that is a downfall is that at any time they can send you to work third shift whether you want to or not.
good,"10 years with 1 employer whom I liked and enjoyed working for at the 2 locations I worked.  I worked several different shifts, different departments and I learned many skills while there. My last 3 years were great. Until unforseen issues, family obligations, compounded by medical issues by myself and my children. My supervisors, mgmt and  personnel staff in the end did not standby their word."
good,I was hired as a part-time associate it in three months with me full time and in one year I was promoted to Delhi associate that look forward to being a sales associate in electronics.
good,"Day starts checking reports and signing out keys, then go and get money for registers, conduct price changes, stock any freight left from night before, and then some days you throw that out and do whatever management wants that day"
good,"filled anywhere from 500 to 800 prescriptions per day. Most of the Technicians that work there are students so they have high turnover rate. Usually short handed. Your forced to to the work of 2 people and not enough pay. Company gives you bad benefits. Managers are nice and I know if they were able to, they would do anything to make things better for their Technicians. Schedule was flexible. As long as you request time off about 1 month ahead of time, you get it."
good,"Walmart can be a wonderful place to work, and it can also be an awful place to work. So many things depend upon your direct supervisors and managers. The store manager sets the tone for the whole store, and it seems as if there is really no accountability for the way associates and managers are treated. In my experience, most of my fellow associates dislike their job, because they have often been asked to do unclear or impossible tasks in a short amount of time. So many issues could be resolved with some accountability."
good,"i have learnt how to manage people, how to delegate tasks in a designated area. drive sales. Every manager have to work in their assigned area. customer service in the most priority"
good,"Quick environment, lot of different personalities, fun and energetic, meet new people that come in, learning new things as a manager and love helping customers"
good,"Walmart employees are expected to do a lot with not much to look forward to. Sometimes lines are jammed packed and very frustrating. By the time you reach your next customer, they have really bad attitudes because of the wait time in lines."
good,"we were pushed to get stuff done efficiently, i learned how to work hard and fast to keep management happy, i would definitley go back and work for walmart again."
good,"ambiente agradable con companeros, de trabajo,y clientes"
good,Decent paycheck but not enough to live off of would recommend a second job. Front end has crazy hours and raises usually consist of 30 cents a year otherwise an okay workplace for part time
good,"I was working at walmart for almost a year before I left,  and I loved it there. it was like having a family away from my family. Some days I didn't even feel like I was working ."
good,"Aprendí a capturar "
good,"At Walmart you have days when the load is more than you can bare, but you get through it with your team. There are other days when the load is light and management and everyone you encounter remind you that its not just a place of work its a great big family. On either of the days there is always work to do and room for improvement."
good,"Buenos principios y políticas, excelente cultura y buena capacitación en general, diversificación de funciones, relativa facilidad para desarrollarse profesionalmente, lo triste es que no siempre se aplica la cultura ni se respetan las políticas y valores con los que se predica."
good,I worked at subway part-time (less then a year) it was a fantastic job for me while I was in high school. There were a lot of nights when I was in charge of closing the store by myself but there really weren't much hours to give. And also it started getting hard to get a hold of my manager when ever there would be a problem i needed to address with him . After a little while I realized I really wanted a job that gave me set hours Monday-Friday.
good,Working at Walmart had its good and bad days. Customers would determine what kind of day it was going to be. If a coworker didn't pick up some slack then there would be more to do for others. We found ways to have fun and get work done at the same time. I think it was better back when the store was smaller before it became a Super Walmart...
good,"Walmart has a fast-paced work environment about 75% of the time. I had a wonderful experience as far as working in different departments and performing different tasks throughout my time there. Management may have been an issue at times, but I will say that that is not the case at every store. Each store is different so you may have an even better experience than I did. Compensation is a plus, especially since minimum wage is going up. Most times, the pay depends on the pay grade level but its good pay either way. I would definitely recommend working at Walmart to anyone."
good,"Keeping it simple, it all depends on the co-workers and management. Try to be trained in different areas and you will not be bored. Good start but don't stay long unless there are plans to move up."
good,"Upper management is too focused on Wall Street. You need to keep good motivated employees for a company to succeed. You also need plenty of sales floor help to keep items stocked and customers needs met. If you want your employees to be flexible and work when you need them, you should also be flexible when they need their schedule modified for a personal need."
good,"A worked a typical 8 hour shift. "
good,"Overall was an OK place to work, for the most part. Wasn't the best environment for someone who would easily get upset. All in all just a basic day job."
good,Walmart is a good place to get some customer service skills under your belt. Steady customer flow makes it so that there is always something you can do.
good,"I meet people from all nationality's. I learn about different customs and tradition.I enjoy playing with the babies, I enjoy working with my co workers."
good,I enjoyed working there. Lots of room for advancement very friendly place to work other associates very willing to help lots of good benefits and discount card comes in very handy
good,"I have learned a lot in different areas of retail and customer service. A typical day would include cashing checks, taking back returned merchandise, handling customers issues, helping them find items, running register, cleaning area and returning items to the shelves and stocking merchandise."
good,"I've gained so much confidence working here the past few years. As this was my first job, Walmart gave me the opportunity to work on my self-improvement, and I thank this job for helping me to overcome my fear of being in customer service. I got hired part time while still going to school and eventually they promoted me to full time. However, the longer I worked here, the more I began to see just how unfair and incompetent management really was. There were too many problems that they did not want to deal with, under-staffing issues being one of them. They pull associates from their departments to the registers, only to ask us later on why our department is a mess. Breaks were not given to us on time, and sales floor associates are overworked for minimum wage. Oftentimes I was pressured to give up my breaks just to get my work done so I wouldn't get coached by management. A few managers also showed a great deal of bias towards certain associates. Apart from all this, I do, however, enjoy the fact that my store had a very family-oriented environment and I've met a lot of great people working here."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed my experience working with my Walmart family. After all, your job is what you make it. Although I did not agree with the reasons I was terminated, if I was offered the chance to be rehired, I would possibly take up that offer."
good,"I was hired knowing it was part-time with the knowledge that if I showed I was a hard worker, I would get full time hours.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen soon enough for me; being a single person needing to pay bills to get by."
good,"Walmart is a easy job. Come in do your job and go home. When I worked there the shifts were a little long, and the pay sucked. However  I was working so much that it made up for it."
good,fun fast and friendly work place very well organize a lot of team work and very easy to move up in the company once you in it also help you if you wanna go back to school
good,"it was a fast paced environment and required a lot of quick thinking, the customers are hit or miss most of the time. you will have a nice and easy to work with customer or a stubborn one."
good,"This was my first job, I was barley 18 and wet behind the ears. i got under the wing of some older employees and was on my way. i worked long and hard and wore myself out. the pay was terrible because the state i was in minimum wage was a joke. the work environment was busy...its a 4/7 Walmart. the job was simple and easy to do and i appreciate the experience. my one qualm is that is a big box store, so many people in and out your more like a number than a name., But our manager made it a point to know our names."
good,A typical day would be punching in and finding management to see where to go and have to 15 minute breaks and hour lunch also the days are pretty busy on certain occasions. Learned new things like Wic and numbers for produce stuff. It's a fun and enjoyable experience learning new things. Hardest part is dealing with angry customers.
good,I actually loved working for WalMart but everything about management and there rules made the job horrible.I wouldn't recommend somewhere work here they get rid of employees left and right.
good,It helps pay my bills. Some of the other employees are very nice. They are not very quick when trying to fill positions from within the company to start with.
good,overall it is a great place to work. it was my all time favorite job. i wish i could go back. i love helping people every day and bettering myself along with my department  team work is a must. always smile and if you ever dont know the answer to something just ask
good,The wages are low compared to other companies of similar function. No bad for a first job to get work experience. You learn a lot about good and bad customer service here.
good,"Era todo nuevo ( previo a una inauguración ) , enseñar al personal, armado de equipos de trabajo , horarios, toma de personal , cocción de productos y armado de recetas ( lo que aprendí )."
good,I didn't really meet anyone but the work environment is ok. It has its days where some employees bring their problems to work n it's some days it's a great day.
good,I want to quit due to management. To much back stabbing a drama. I loved my job until the new management came in and are asking me to do the jobs of 3 people and still it's never good enough. I walked in on my manager talking bad about me and I'm done putting up with it.
good,I work 630 am to 3 pm. I count and balance all the registers and compile reports for Management approval. I like working in the accounting office. I find management easy to get along with and they are helpful with making my job fun.
good,"Excelente empresa,buen ambiente laboral,compañerismo y muy buenos beneficios"
good,"i worked at walmart for 1 year and the management department was horrible they are always in their office, they barely know their job on the floor...."
good,It was a good place to work for. I will miss it. I made a bunch of friends and the management team was great. I always meet new people and shared there concerns with me.
good,"Not a place I'd choose as a long-term career, but it's a steady income if needed."
good,Working at Walmart was fun but the pay is very low and working with customers was very stressful sometimes.  Hard to hire people with low pay scale.  Would not recommend to others.
good,Pretty easy to work for but they do not pay enough or offer good benefits. The people that I worked with were nice and enjoyable to be around. over all it was good.
good,They worked around my schedule. They also trained me for many different positions.  This was just a weekend job.  I didn't feel comfortable when the management would discuss how hammered they were going to get after work.
good,"Being at walmart was aright, the assocxiates were nice and the managers never had a problem helping you with something. My favorite part of going to work was talking and getting to know some of the customers. The least enjoyable part was standing on my feet for three hours on end, especially if we were busy."
good,Extremely busy days with constant work to do. learn a lot of leadership skills.  management leads by delegation. work culture is that customer is right and employee kinds of fall to the side
good,A normal day has a lot of work.  Generally there is a goal and plan for the day but you need to be adaptable because things tend to come up.  I learned to be adaptable and to be calm in the face of chaos.  Management tends not to be hands on but are available to help when asked.  Work culture falls short.  Employees tend not to be appreciated but do get recognized for good work.  Hardest part of job is the amount of work that needs to get done within the day while also dealing with constant customers. Most enjoyable part of job is to make a difference inside the store and help the employees and customers.
good,I was a stocker at Walmart for my first ever job. It was a experience I will not forget. Just being my first job. Stocking was pretty easy for me. Sometimes I was put outside to push carts which I hated and sometimes management had attitudes. I got through it and decided I would never do this again.
good,Exactly what I just said. If you're looking for full time this is not the place. Their point system is horrible. You can only get up to 4 points in a 6 month period which makes it impossible to stay very long especially I'd you have transportation issues or Emergencies.
good,System group iscurrently going through a tech modernization program to become a digital company.  A considerable number of positions have been eliminated recently and more reductions are expected.
good,"My day at Walmrt could be good one day and bad the next . I feel like I learn how to deal with multiple situations when it comes to this place.i really feel like the support should be a little better ,but this is a good place to start and better yourself later on in life ."
good,"Management sits in the office and hardly does anything, everything gets passed down to the full-time associates and part-time associates. Get over worked and underpaid. The job would be great if it wasnt for the customers that treat you like garbage"
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart most of my 23 years. But the last year has been difficult to remain loyal to the company. Walmart has let go of Managers who have been a wonderful and loyal to the company for many years. I feel sad to have  to leave such a wonderful company. For the most part it was a joy and happy place to work. I enjoyed the people and environment. It is just time to move on and start a new beginning. Bed Bath and Beyond has a wonderful store and merchandise I feel I would be a great addition to your Company Walmart was always busy and you get to establish great customers interactions that made to store  enjoyable to come to work.
good,"I enjoyed this job. I worked overnights and enjoyed what I did. The pay was decent, the benefits were ""ok"". There were always managers available for any questions."
good,"I worked for Walmart for almost two years. During that time, I never once was looked at for advancement. These things follow you when you go for newer jobs. There was no shot for benefits, however over all it was not a bad job."
good,"fun team to work with plus to security and balanced work culture, just a lot to do with low pay. Walmart is opened to all the ages and nationality to work with and offer a job position to everyone and fit them in the right place"
good,Conosi mucho sobre almacen inventarios descarga de mercancia acomodo en racks
good,I worked very hard when I worked at Walmart and I enjoyed the people I worked with. I have made very good connections with my former employees and customers.
good,During my time of employment you worked with some great and helping people and the work place was pretty laid back most of the time. Worked in the frozen and diary and was not good paid enough for the work required.
good,"Walmart is good company to work, many policies to follow than any other company, management is good. I loved working with Walmart, worked 6 years with company, had good and bad experiences, overall it is good company."
good,A company that is not going anywhere anytime soon. its is a company that is an asset to the community. It provides a way of living for all people. WalMart is a place that makes a way of life affordable for the economy
good,"Not a bad job for someone who has little to no job experience. They take almost anybody (literally). I sated working there during high school while trying to make some cash. Pretty flexible when it comes to scheduling workdays that meet your needs but, most of the times, they require you to work during the weekend. And, unless you work your butt off to be higher up, they only give you part time because they don't pay for insurance. Although you do get benefits like discounts. That's about it. Some managers were great but you come upon some that aren't because they don't care about their workers at all. All in all, job can be very stressful but okay at the same time."
good,sometimes feel like im undervalued or underappreciated. pay is comparable. if the right staff is there its a good day. if one person is having a bad day it drags the whole day down for everyone sometimes
good,This Walmart was ok to work for. For a high volume store there is sometimes next to no help up front. CSM's are spread thin and there have been times where i have not gotten change when i needed it. Breaks were given late or not at all and wrapped into with your lunch.
good,"Walmart was always good to me, some people had bad luck there but it depends on the person. I was always on time and was ready to work, giving extra hands if I had to. The customers were nice and they appreciated the help we gave them."
good,Walmart to me was an okay place to work but my only concern is how they would treat their own employees..there was a lot of favoritism did not like that
good,Wal Mart is a great place to work for job security and benefits.  Do not encourage Proactive work ethic but they do encourage a friendly atmosphere and have many opportunities to advance.
good,Working at walmart was a very stressful experience. They were always short staff and had me running all over the place. I feel that they expected to much. Very unorganized.
good,"Processed payments, applying discounts, scanning items, maintaining cash registers, handling returns, answering to customer inquiries, and implementing store policies"
good,"Some of the people I worked with everyday were tolerable, but there were a few that were so lazy that it was a wonder that they even had the motivation to find a job in the first place. and everyday there were only 3 lines open when there were super long lines, I asked one of the managers why they don't put in the self checkouts and she told me they were ""too expensive"" .... which makes no sense to me.. this company has billions and cant afford to put at least 2 of those in every store?"
good,"Some days can be incredibly busy, and others can be a struggle to find work to do."
good,"a typical day sways from uneventful to hectic in little time. I learned to be flexible in what to expect in my shift."
good,"Love my job there is no other place like it, and actually thinking about moving up. Always ready for my next shift, great benefits and good manger's always ready."
good,"I worked as a cashier. I then learned customer service. Later I moved to electronics as a sales associate. A typical day at work could consist of anything you could possibly imagine. There were days I worked in electronics, photo, site to store, layaway, pick up today, toys, sporting goods, automotive, fabrics, hardware, lawn and garden, etc. The hardest part of the job was meeting management and customer's needs without enough staff. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy, learning new things, and meeting new people. Management is a hit or miss. Some are really great, others are a joke. I learned to flexible and multiple departments."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to assist others when they needed help and management couldn't help them."
good,"Muy productivo en el area administrativa"
good,"I worked at Walmart for 17 years (only had 3 more years until retirement).  I earned every minute of my vacation time (which at the time was 3 weeks per year).  However, I worked in a very fast paced pharmacy that EXPECTED 100% Accuracy along with extra side work customer's don't see and don't understand when we were UNDERSTAFFED.  The last few years I worked there, each time an employee left another was not replaced.  Management was poor and NEVER excersized the ""10 foot Rule"".  One day I finally cracked and had enough and just walked off the job...in hindsight it was worst mistake I've ever made in my life, I made it through 17 years with only 3 more to go now only 1.    It just seemed each day got worse and worse and getting out of bed became a chore!!  The company itself is excellent when it comes to coming to their employees well being, but not replacing workers when needed is unacceptable!"
good,It's OK to work as long as you don't make friends with anyone for the majority they will stab you in the back may are only out for them selves........
good,"i had fun working in walmart i meet a lot of nice people, even thou we are short of people in our area it didnt stop us to do our job. i had a best workmates."
good,"It was fun to be part of a brand that offered such great quality products to the heart of America. Getting the best quality for the right price, working wiht a wonderful industry of manufactures. Making life long connections."
good,"Management needs to be more visible and consistent, communication and follow through needs more attention. Working here isn't all that bad, I enjoy the people and all the culture. I've been given good opportunities for advancement as well."
good,"Easy work, steady pay, but management there was In  complete chaos. My team essentially ran itself because managers were so difficult to find when needed."
good,"I really liked the environment and fast-paced aspect of the job.  Howrver, the management team didn't communicate very well because if they did I would still have my job!!!!!"
good,"It wasn't the best work experience but i had to meet a lot of different people and had a lot to learn about customers and associates."
good,"Good company to work for. I'm just looking for a day time position. I work nights from 3:00 pm to 1:00 am. I do have the comfort of working in the transportation office, however I really need a daytime position at this time."
good,typical day would include unloading usually 1 sometimes two trucks sorting by department number wrapping pallets pulling pallets to floor with pallet jack for the stockers depending on how fast we finished we would assist the stockers occasionally
good,"Doesn't pay the bills if you are older. Great for entry level job be careful of the pay before signing up. Decent management, make sure to step up and just follow procedures which are easy."
good,"I learned to work with other nationalities in this job.  To me that was an interesting experience, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Most of the employees were nice and quite helpful."
good,"For cashiers, the day is mostly spent behind a register checking ages for restrictive material and chatting pleasantly and politely with customers. Occasional breaks from register work that include zoning shelves for other departments and running returns to their proper places and depending on shift length, hour long breaks for lunch plus fifteen minute breaks from work to spend as desired."
good,"Precisa ter uma paciência por que se lida com muitas pessoas com humores diferentes."
good,the manager was always willing to work with me on days and hours.got there early and was home on time for my kids.everyone was very friendly.i would start out with mark downs then do the baking then the stocking.
good,I liked working there. they gave us free food on holidays and were blue collar about it. the mangers were down to earth and made sure to stick on your side.
good,"The job it's self wasn't all that bad I would go in work hard everyday and my days would go by fast, but some of the people I worked with or for were not the best."
good,you always know your check will clear.  They are clearly the low price leader and want to ensure they get all the market share they can.  This may be at the expense of the little guys in small towns.
good,The position I was placed in required training in a training room. As an individual who does not do well in a training room environment this was not a very good fit for me.
good,"Get to work at 6 am, start down stacking produce truck, put fresh product on the floor. Kept track of all product coming in. Scanned for outs on sales floor and ordered what we needed. Rotated stock for freshness, went through for donations and throw away. Management was really kind of hard to work with, not enough people for the department and the expectations were simply unrealistic day to day. Becoming an academy store was probably the hardest thing we did, the expectations to meet with not the right amount of help was not a productive work environment. Did not get the real training needed to make the department as productive as it needed to be."
good,"8 hour days in a busy environment. There is a constant flow of customers. I performed many different job functions, customer service, cashiering, merchandising, developing photos an camera sales."
good,"Very stressful place to work. Management does not really know what they are doing and are unwilling to help you out. Training is not really provided for new hires, set up to fail. The hardest part of the job is dealing with extremely rude customers and even other coworkers/managers. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with people that you get along with."
good,"Overall company is great to work for, however the lack of support form managment makes it very stressful. The culture stands alone but the unprofessionalism needs to improve."
good,"buena compañía, ambiente agradable, te dejan laborar, crecimiento"
good,The job itself is fine. The managers on my shift are the problem. The only way to make it higher in this store is to follow behind managers. The drama at the store reminds me of high school.
good,It has it perks but it's good benifits  and when your sick they don't care bout ur health you have some customers that are nice and friendly and yu have some that's rude
good,Walmart is a great place for growth especially if you can handle the fast paced enviroment that it is known for and if you are able to deal with the daily changes that occurs on the average.
good,es un buen trabajo para aprender en muchas áreas de trabajo en el cual te puedes desempeñar y sobresalir en el ámbito laboral
good,"12 hour shifts in a warehouse setting.  Hot in the summer, cold in the winter.  Two twenty minute breaks make for long work days.  Compensation good, not great."
good,Walmart was a good work experience for me I liked the environment and the fellow employees; by far the best job I have had so far. the only problem I had was towards the end there was 3 weeks in a row when I would come back from my days off there was at least two days worth of work that I had to get done by the end of the work day.
good,Learned many skills. Management and people skills.I learned a lot about inventory sales and increasing profit.Great customer service and great management is the key.
good,O local em si è muito bom para trabalhar em equipe
good,It is a good job that will allow any individual to gain working experience. This job motivates team work while at the same time to work individually.  With hard work moving up in the company's ladder is feasible.
good,i enjoyed working in the management position and leading others but over all the upper management was to self oriented instead of team oriented. the company if over all not a bad place to work the environment at Walmart is  hi paced and customer friendly place
good,Walmart management is unprofessional and full of gossip. Management isn't supportive instead force you to want to quit your job. You get written up for the craziest things that'll lead to getting you fired and putting a termination on your record.
good,I came to the store recommended by the market manager and still didn't get a promotion. Worked with great people but had to suck up to my department manager
good,Working with walmart was my first job and I definitely enjoyed the experience of being with them. There were some bad days coming across customers with negative attitude.
good,"If you aren't use to a fast paced, quota driven environment, this is not for you. Climate control is a huge issue when you are expected to move over 800 cartons an hour."
good,"Typical work for the job.  Pay sucks, management is a bit disorganized.  The perks are a little nice, but associate discount in store is not good when comparing to similar employers .  It's a job, so don't want to complain because they employ several people that need it.  Good starter job, but honestly not the best to raise a family on.  Not like I wouldn't work for them again as they do appear to want to invest in their employees so that's a plus."
good,Very fast paced job with high physical demand. Everyday can be challenging and will push you to your limits. good pay but you definitely work to earn it.
good,"Wal-Mart isn't a bad job in my opinion. The people who I work with are friendly and I like most of the managers that I report to. Overall, it's an okay place to work for the most part."
good,"Working for Walmart was a learning experience for me for sure. it was hard work and fast paced, most employees were like family to me and I enjoyed working with them. Management will drive you to your breaking point. most days I would go home and just want to pass out, but it was a paycheck so I forged through for over 6 years."
good,Nice people coworkers work as an team an very helpful it pushs you to be the best yo can be mangerment  make sure you are on point with what going on an your job is safe.
good,solving problems for merchandising spots. I learned to be a good Department Manager. Management was OK depending the time of year. The workplace culture varied. Hardest part was not getting holidays of or overtime unless it was approved. The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers I had that came in just for me.
good,"I worked at walmart nearly a year. The actual job was simple and enjoyable. The co-works and management however, not so much. There's a lot of favoritism going on there and none of it was based on work performance. I have poor social skills and some difficulties communicating. If I had know how to butter up management with niceties I might have gotten a raise but wasn't able to and as time pasted management would find ways to make things frustrating for me."
good,Great benefits but management feels they have to put fear into employees to get things done. This was also a long time ago. Things may have changed since then and this is only regarding one location.
good,"They are very known to cut hours unexpectingly and drastically , i was working 40 hours as partime for 4 motnhs straight and then all of a sudden they cut me to 16! And hired more people instead of giving hours to thoese who are already there."
good,Worked with overall good people. Enjoyed working at my own pace and independently throughout different departments. No good benefits and pay could have been better.
good,a typical day at work is that you are working  from the time you get there to your department until the end of your shift. I have learned that is more for Walmart employee can learned to advance in the company. The management is great if they was all on one page and you don't have one telling you different thing that needed to be done and take responsibilities for being wrong so that it can be fix  and the put it on the next manager. The hardest part of the job is to get your employee in the department to come together  and getting the job done. the most enjoyable part of the job is completing the task at hand and seeing someone advance in the company..
good,"Management runs you like you aren't a human being, but my fellow coworkers were nice to work with. Hard to get certain days off though, you would literally have to beg to your boss to get it and they often knew you wanted a day off and would often hide or avoid you until you had no choice to either call in sick or show up to work."
good,most enjoyable part of the job is the friendships you create. Management is fully flexible with your personal life and work scheduling. Typical work day isn't too crazy but could be challenging at times but very manageable.
good,"Walmart was my first real job. When I decided to go back to my school, the company told me I was at risk for losing my job because it wasn't business related it was medical. I had to change my availability so I could go to school. Several times I was scheduled when I had school, which caused me to have lates, and incomplete shifts. Management was constantly changing and the rules were always bent for certain associates. Working at Walmart I realized I was only a number. They could hire someone as soon as they fired someone. When I went on maternity leave, I was told to use my vacation or take leave with no pay. So I used all my vacation time and I sold my car to pay my bills while I was on leave. I would use Walmart as only a last resort for a job."
good,You can have a promising career an benefits are great however work life balance it is a challenge. Every day is a new experience training is improving which is a benefit
good,"My overall experience has been okay to say the least. When I first started it was fun and exciting but as things progressed, I was given more work, less help, and expected to perform every single task that I was given."
good,"All in all, it was an okay place to work. Understanding people and nice staff. Pay wasn't that shabby either. If i personally had the choice to return to Wal-Mart, i think I'd save it for a last resort."
good,It's not a hard place to work or stressful. It's not a fulfilling job either. Scanning people's grocery items and generally chit chat is what you can expect and advancement come with seniority
good,Un lugar lleno de retos por los cambios que se dieron en esa empresa
good,helping assist customers.  diffusing difficult situations with customers and coming to a positive resolution that best fit the needs of the customers and associates.
good,"Poor management.  the general atmosphere among the employees"
good,Well you get what you apply for. Overall the time I spent working for Wal-Mart was rather enjoyable. Loved the other staff members. Some managers were shady though.
good,It's an okay place to work if you're still in school preparing for a professional degree but not something you would want to make a career of because they don't pay much to be able to support a family comfortably unless you're in the co-manager level.
good,Ótima empresa para adquirir conhecimento das principais tecnologias.
good,"It's an OK first job. Not all Walmart are the same. I worked at the Walmart in Beaver Falls, PA and I have nothing but positive things to say about the store and the management team!"
good,Walmart is an OK place to work they pay their Associates decently they give you decent amount of brakes.they also listen to associate and whether or not we need new equipment.
good,"the general rule to be promoted is you have to have already be doing the job next level up for one year to get the promotion.  There are many managers who are promoted from within.  As a satelite office,"
good,"im not sure about how things are going these days but it was over nights for me so it wasnt as bright ,while working their ity was bit of a drag with it having to be less communicative"
good,"Es un buen lugar para trabajar y muy buenas sus asociados lástima q inculpen a las personas erróneas sin antes una investigación pero es un buen ambiente"
good,When I worked at Walmart I found there were too many management staff on that where very helpful when store was busy but rushed us. I was one of the top 3 cashiers who worked quickly with a 100% balanced cash drawer on every shift.
good,Good entry level retail job to gain experience and improve on customer service skills. As a sales associate you are often asked to preform in various areas of the store.
good,A typical day at work would be organizing our product and helping customers. I've learned how to lead others and how to train new employees. Management at first were the best that I've known. It wasn't until the after our store re-model that a new set of management were transferred to our store.  I felt like they didn't really know what they were doing.  Though I enjoyed teaching them want thing we could and couldn't do.
good,Working at walmart was cool its a good environment to be at i loved to worked there i saw some many things the bosses was cool too they have everything to there from baby clothes to food products from sandals and electric things movies and phones i even brought my 1st from from walmart so its cool u can fill out your prescriptions in there its alil pricey but other then that walmart is cool and it has expanded all over as well walmart is a big company to wrk for
good,"I worked in the bakery and deli. Most night I would help take orders in deli and close at night. I was always on hand to answer the phone for bakery in case someone needed to place an order. Coworkers were usually very welcoming and nice. And made sure I knew what I was doing. The hardest thing was my first night alone was actually my second day. They didn't show me much my first day, didn't even show me where everything was. There wasn't very many customers so I talked to my manager and was helped with finding something else to do. The most enjoyable part was the coworkers. Usually the time went by fast and it wasn't a very hard job."
good,Walmart Canada Co is a very fast paced working environment.  With a lot of opportunity to move around and experience different job positions and people.
good,Nice place to work. enjoyed customer service. Everyone was nice to work with. I believe I did a great job at handling and counting back money. I would work there again
good,"I worked as a stocker.  Night shift was responsible for a lot of work. My problem wasn't the work or that I had to help the employees.  My Problem was that the manager wouldn't move the employees that got done to the areas that still needed help. I along with most of my coworkers would just move, as it was our responsibility in my opinion.  however there were a few people that would either slack off and/or not work as hard as they should have."
good,Walmart has a lot of opportunities for advancement at store level as well as the home office.Able to transfer all over the USA.Being apart of operation and innovation.
good,"i was a cashier, learned more then just the register though. i enjoyed my time here, the job was good an most of the employees were also their was a few who were herd to get along with. but overall had a good experience working their."
good,"As an orderfiller I loaded pallets with produce or meat for delivery to local stores.  Being older, I was unable to meet production quotas (too slow).  However, younger people were able to meet the goals consistently.  I was unfortunately unable to transfer to a less physically demanding position."
good,While working at my store I met many great people and had a fun times & bad. Then I slowly started to realize only two of my three managers actually knew what they were doing and sadly the odd one out was usually on the clock during my shift. The whole group bumped heads with this said manager causing a very unstable work moral. But let me tell you the days that manager was off work was 50 times better. Leaving the store was a very hard thing to do but I was trying to finish up school at the time and it just didn't fit my schedule.
good,"Capacitación de aprendizaje continúo,descansos wiken ."
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work at all, it has been my job for 2 years now and i have been promoted twice. i make over 15 bucks an hour so you really cant complain, you get paid time off, you get insurance, you get discounts. walmart has a bad reputation but they have come along way. the starting pay at a walmart is 10 dollars an hour"
good,"Walmart is a good start for college students. I learned a lot in my three years there about retail and about life. The hardest part of my job was as a Customer Service Manager when I could not schedule cashiers. Management scheduled it and was not very good, so some nights I would need to figure out how to close down the store."
good,Advancement is every where. Higher you go the more stress. And you don't get good money until salary. Very stressful. Expectation is dependent on how much abuse you are willing to take.
good,I really liked working there. A lot of people were super nice to me being new. I only needed to be told once what to do and it got done. I worked a a good pace. Customers liked how i bagged their items. Overall it was a good place to work but a lot of managers couldnt handle the rushes.
good,"Walmart was a fairly mundane job that I had before going back to college.  I enjoyed working with the people and was satisfied when I was busy, but I did not enjoy slow or down time. I would find things to do to keep me busy."
good,"So I started working at walmart in 2016, and it was an amazing company. It is a great community, and it us a great job to build your skills, not only with customer service, but also with fast paced learning. But language is also key when talking around to managers and how you word things in Walmart is key."
good,"When I first started working at Walmart it was great, management was great, everything was great. I loved work with the people and my co-works and managers. There was really nothing hard about the job. Then I got pregnant with my son it changed. They started treating me badly and 3 days shy of me working there a year the let me go because I was very high risk pregnancy they did not want to work with me."
good,Working outside as a cart associate is spread thin because the only people who agreed to do that job was those who chose to limit customer interaction.
good,"Regular major department retail type environment."
good,At Wal-Mart I felt like while I would have to deal with some rowdy customers at times or some difficult cleaning situations that we were a team regardless of time of day and a task that may have been meant for one would become the task of many if needed depending on the business of the day and the experience of the employee. For example I would sometimes help less experienced employees or overworked employees if needed and it helped me keep focused on the team and not myself.
good,"I would recommend the  job to anyone . i've worked here for 10years and honestly i've been holding myself back from what i really want to do in live  because of the great pay and job security. if you really wanted to an regular associate can bring in 60-70,000 a year 50,000 easy. like any other job this place is full of politics and BS but if you just block everything out and do your job, you'll be ok. like i said great company its just that i've out grown this place."
good,It was a fun but messy workplace. Alot of people judging each other and not helping. alot of unnecessary drama. Management didnt help either. the hardest part of the job are the people. the most enjoyable part was just being able to do my job
good,"I've worked with great managers. I think the store that I am in needs a new management team. There is so much potential, but only a few or seen due to favoritism."
good,"The fellow technicians are great to work with, and the customers were almost always pleasant.  I needed a break from working 10 hour shifts everyday that I was scheduled to work or closing every other week, and it just happens that I can afford to stay at home with my children temporarily."
good,I liked the job itself but more and more management is tying your hands from doing the job the way it should be done resulting in frustrated employees as well as customers.
good,"Walmart, although tiring, did feel rewarding when my managers did recognize the effort i put into the upkeep of the bakery. My coworkers were friendly and easy to get along with. They never made an issue nor was there drama at work."
good,Great job for people looking to have  a  job while going to college very flexible with hours. If a person is a good worker they will give hours to them if the person needs them.
good,"I would recommend this job to someone going through college.  I would not recommend it as a career.  When I started the job to when I quit (a 10 yr span), the benefits decreased.  It took 10 years to go from $10 an hr to $12 an hr.  It's not the worst job ever, but it could definitely use improvement."
good,"Nice,Atmosphere and has great ethics great pay move up in management move up in advancement if you have great work ethics and have motivation"
good,The work was okay i got bored waiting around for customers. breaks were long couldn't get overtime trying to move up in the company was hard. they don't like u getting sick.
good,"They do treat their employees to free food and benefits frequently. The pay is also decent and there is a large amount of opportunity to move around within the company. However, they are highly understaffed and have a large amount of unnecessary middle management."
good,Overall it is a very good place to work . Walmart Pays good and its very good on employee benefits t just sometimes gets very busy and overwhelming but nothing an individual can not handle
good,Walmart is a decent company to work for i work hard but only way to move up is to kiss up to managers and i cant do that i rather work hard and show my skills through that
good,"Family first. Wal-Mart is a great place for those about to currently in or about to graduate high school or are just looking to stay occupied after retirement. I don't see much room for career advancement. They don't really give back to the employees as much as they should, in my opinion, to be such a big company."
good,"More often then not the upper level management isn't very professional."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to get some much needed customer service experience. However, most only work part-time. The pay is fantastic, but the hours you get definitely did not reflect it. Management was absolutely amazing they had excellent communication skills."
good,This is not a work place where you can sit back and do nothing.  You are required to work quickly and efficiently while there.  Attendance is extremely important and required. And call outs are not tolerated
good,"Walmart was a good place to work, great hours and fast paced environment. I had job security in the fact that I knew how many hours I would be working every single week, no hour hunting to make a living."
good,"Big, nice and modern distribution center. It attends the orders place by customers online. I was mainly working as a packer, which demanded a rate of 105 pieces per hour. My productivity range was between 90-110 pieces/hr. I did not have problems with productivity, but with coworkers. The cultural background of majority of workers is pretty low. So, I felt strange there. A wear situation was given by Americans, who behave relegated and isolated in their home country, by the enormous presence of Hispanics."
good,"A nice place to work and secured job but very low in giving salaries."
good,I didnt mind the job itself. I was a cashier and liked how we had goals to reach. I didnt like the fact they constantly changed the requirements for price matching and discounts so when trying to enforce the rules I didnt have the back up from the managers like i thought i would get
good,"Working in the Clinton, MD Walmart was exactly how I imagined it would be. You get freight, you stock, and you clean up. I had the pleasure of working overnight at a store that closed at night so there were a few hours where it was easier to work. The only downfall was the way the managers were. They expected you to read there minds. They would suggest for you to do something one way and after you have done it you are being told by the same manager to do it a completely different way. Also if you didn't work at super human speeds then you just simply ""weren't doing your job"". I didn't mind the work one bit. It was the human interactions that you needed to learn to cope with."
good,lawn and garden department was a good place to work. enjoyed the company of the positive lower management they were very supportive and helpful. overall good job
good,"I learned a lot about pharmacy during my time there.  I loved helping the customers.  It was a great place to work, and I met a lot of great people there.  It was a busy pharmacy, but a very enjoyable job."
good,As a cashier I struggled to get enough hours but when I was promoted to bakery sales associate I was often over worked and called in at the last minute. I felt underpaid for the work I was doing.
good,"Empresa transparente, compromissada com as normas impostas e íntegra!"
good,Wal-mart is a place to get a job if you want to work for a place who tells you that family is everything but then tells you that need to decide between your job and your family.  If you want a career where you will invest all your time then Walmart is the job for you!
good,"I did learn alot working in retail. I did grow a much thicker skin after that. That being said, i would not recommend for that to be your first job, it'll ruin you"
good,"Valorar al personal,ser mas empaticos,capacitar y dar oportunidades de avanzar"
good,"My day consisted of ringing customers up in the pharmacy department of the store. Duties also included straightening up the department by helping the Pharmacy staff organize the OTC drugs, keeping a neat counter, and providing correct information to customers on certain drugs."
good,Les charges de travail par rapport à la rémunération sont  ridicules. Certains secteurs demandent plus de 60 boîtes de l'heure. Secteurs lourds. Mésententes entre employés fréquentes. On achale souvent les meilleurs et on laisse faire les fainéants.
good,"the hardest part of the job is working with management. what most i learned about is that if you aint in the circle of friends,you will a have a hard time. A typical day is long,hot and stressful"
good,"ten hour days. strange hours. not a bad place to work. several different departments to work in. work hard and its good. I dont like the hours. its a physically demanding job, so you must work hard. I enjot the breakroom, its climate controlled"
good,"Walmart is better for new hires than for people who have been there for a long time.  New policies have put new hires at a minimum of $10 per hour but there are no holiday pay or compensation other than overtime which is not allowed 90% of the year.  I have worked for Walmart for 5 years and make as much as new hires now.  However Insurance benefits are top notch, but if you miss the November sign up every year you are out of luck.  The biggest problems you run into on a day to day basis is mostly irate customers."
good,"Probably one of the best paying jobs for my area (62450) However the management is rather useless and order filling is rough. It has its gives and takes, if you can last longer than the training period you'll probably be there at least a year making $15-$24/hr"
good,Fue un trabajo que me ayudó a incursionarme en el sector laboral y conocer más a fondo la responsabilidad y el trabajo en equipo.
good,"Good place to start off working at . They are helpful people, if you plan on working for Walmart for a long time , they have good benefits for you choose from."
good,"Can't find employees "
good,Management is kind of poor and is generally one sided to save face but the coworkers you meet there would make this job worth working at. Getting up 5 days a week to see these people are what'll keep you going and strive for more.
good,make sure areas are clean and provide customer service. also help other areas as needed. the best part of the job is being recognized by everyone and payday.
good,"Overall it was a good company to work for. There was always work to be done but it was nice to take a minute to yourself if needed.  The group of co workers I had made for a healthy and fun environment.  The only downside to the location I worked for was a few of the managers were not able to manage very well. I was well aware of the fact that they were my subordinate, however I do not think it was fair for them to have me do the work they were supposed to based solely on the fact that they did not want to do it.   The general manager was great though.  when problems arose amongst coworkers, he did a brilliant job at helping resolve the issue."
good,"Walmart used to be a good company however they've gotten so big they don't care about their employees anymore.Employees have to fight to get a raise and then when you finally work over a year you might get a $0.15 raise! It's not worth it! The only thing is at Walmart is the great benefits they offer. They're a little high in price, but they're worth it if you need the benefits. I would steer clear of Walmart!"
good,I came in to do my job but had to do more and more but was not getting good pay or not getting almost 30 hours a week. Company never really show concerns for all the hard work in put in.
good,"Assisting customers whilst maintaining good productivity..."
good,"Working for Walmart was not a very good job, but a job nonetheless.  They kept changing my hours and others just to save money.  Our assistant  managers kept leaving every three months, and the rules changed almost weekly.  Overall, its not a great job, but it paid some of the bills."
good,I would have still been there if my daughter didn't need me so much at the time. I worked at least 40 hours a week and was always busy. There was always room for advancement.
good,"I enjoyed my time with the Crossett Arkansas overnight crew. The managers were always willing to help in any way possible while still juggling customers, sales, and theft prevention. The overnight crew was friendly and easy to get along with. I recommend the overnight position to anyone willing to work with a great crew."
good,"A typical day to day was focused heavily on inventory control.  Stocking shelves, unloading trucks, managing promotions and sales, and cross training in other departments."
good,they expect you to work every weekend as if you have no life. Then you have to put in for a day off at least 1 month in advance or you might not get it.
good,"Sometimes scheduling is a issue i still work there and its like a back and forth but, the benefits are good. also chances of stepping up are always there if u suck up to some of the managers."
good,"Empresa solida y muy consolidada. Como primer empleo "
good,It would be a great job for a high school or college teen. But it personally was not a reliable job.  I was not getting enough hours and the manager did not want to work with me until I was going to quite. Store needs were put over employee needs.
good,This is a fast paced work environment. Teaches employees to be quick problem solvers and efficient workers. Sometimes the job forces you to be creative in certain situations. This job also requires you to have a good character and strong moral values.
good,"There are not too many places that will hand someone a $100M operation and trust them to ""run it.""  Having said that, you are expected to run it efficiently and effectively and turn a profit.  This can make for long days and sometime long months, especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas. Some managers were great, some were not but you can learn from both.  I was fortunate to have a great management team and amazing associates however the work life balance simply was non-existent."
good,You must be on top of your game all the time or you'll get behind in your work and possibly get coached (written up) and you also have to constantly be on your managers back to get addiquate scheduling
good,Customers is always right no matter how they treat you ! That is one down fall . On the other hand pay is nice and depending on your department management  try to accommodate your schedule
good,"32 hour work weeks to avoid giving employees insurance "
good,"Walmart is a fine place to work that does work with you. My specific manager does make things stress. Outside of that one person, the other managers are good to work with"
good,Most of experiences were very positive there. Lots of room for growth and learning new skills. Discounts available through different companies. Every store is different
good,"I managed a new store opening in Tampa, Fl where they took over a month to get a second staff pharmacist. There was over a month of 12 hour days with no time off."
good,Walmart is okay to work for if you can deal with sometime difficult customers. It is an easy enough job since it is so repetitive. The benefits and discounts are nice.
good,"el ambiente es bueno, lo malo son algunos de los jefes que se dejan llevar por lo que le dicen los demás"
good,"Managers and higher associates talk down to cashiers and treat us as we are inferior to them. The pay was great ($12 an hour), but the pay wasn't worth it anymore when your coworkers treat you like trash and customers think they're above you therefore they treat you like trash and try to get you in trouble with your managers."
good,"Like all jobs it had it's ups and downs, some nights stocking was a nightmare, holidays particularly sucked, management never seemed to know what was going on; but it wasn't all bad."
good,Working daily at Walmart is a good exercise in patience. There is always something to do to help time go faster and it builds experience in a retail work setting.
good,"it was a great job overall only negative thing was that they would hire you on as part time even though every week you worked a total of 40 to 45 hours a week, thus doesn't qualify you for the benefits you should be entitled to"
good,Working here teaches you a lot and is a very good job to help you branch off into other industries. Management is not very good when it comes to showing respect to their employees.
good,"There are a lot of good benefits to working here, the pay is good and as long as you show up and do your job you're pretty much garunteed a raise each year, but you're just a number."
good,"Assist customers, stocked floor , arranged displays, clean work area. to many managers few posses managerial skills, the hardest "
good,"typically day 6-7 hrs, interacting and communication with customers, average management, good atmosphere with other employees. hard work is must. the most enjoyable part of the work is getting to know people and interacting with them."
good,Miss my customers and associates in my home town store I learned so many positions while in my small home town Walmart and my coworkers management and associates were all a great team here
good,"This job is definitely going to make sure they get their hourly rate out of you. There is no down time and if it is, its always something to be done. Somewhat easy to advance. I enjoyed working in the money center. I appreciate the cash handling experience i acquired from this job."
good,Walmart was a great place to get my career as an Asset Protection Associate started. It gave me the experience I needed to find my place in the field of security.
good,"The job wasn't bad. i liked my co workers, just dont like the way management is about a lot of things.And i hated the shifts they always gave me. i would work there again though."
good,"The average day at work was stressful and poorly delegated, I learned many facets of inventory control and product display. management did not communicate well between shifts, and had massive discrepancies in their agendas."
good,"hours worked were too late"
good,Make sure you're able to balance your job there and enjoy your time with you family. Off days go by faster then days you have to go to the job and it feels like you're there everyday.
good,"I really liked my job at wal-mart. The only thing I didn't like was  they would have is stay late to stock but then have us leave earlier another day, with no option to keep the over time. It was a friendly environment. I worked at a small store and really liked it."
good,Start your day working on the floor trying to have your stock onto the counter from previous night crews productivity level.  Walking with your store mgr and making the changes to improve the visibility of the sales floor.  The expectations were to ensure their people did complete tasks daily. The culture started as customer centric and became more about KPIs. I enjoyed working with the people and customers who came in and were helped.  I grew to know many of the customers personnally over time and all experiences differed.
good,I worked for Wal-Mart DC for 16 years and when I first started it was great and I really thought they cared about the associates.  As time went on they seemed to only care about themselves and not the associates at all.
good,"Conducting store audits, apprehending shoplifters, court appearances, ensuring safety of customers and employees i.e. safe practices/polices. Overnight operations.."
good,I would recommend this job to someone who really needs money and is willing to work many hours. The major plus to this job is the option for as much overtime as you can handle.
good,Typical day at work is very hectic because there isn't enough staff so they breaks are not given and problems to take a break. I have learned a lot over the years in this field and I do want to continue to prosper but their is opportunities to advance. Hardest part of job is no professionalism when it comes to discussing the job duties in a whole. Most enjoyable part is getting a check.
good,"performance from subordinates is difficult to achieve due to their attitude. I think the company should provide more security for associates that express their opinions. The company needs to listen to their people and make changes accordingly. Undercover boss system would be great to eliminate ""clicks""."
good,"Pay has always been good for me, but worth it? Questionable. Management has always been all over the place and my main reason for wanting to constantly quit. I can deal with customers throwing things at me or calling me names, but management not being able to get it together has made my job miserable. Your day is only as good as your manager."
good,it's lot of work depending on certain days. Some of the mangers were cool & willing to work with you with your days and what not;  while others were on your back and mean for no reason
good,Work is mostly the same everyday. You do the same job everyday. You work with all types of people. Most people are friendly. The hardest part of the job is working with limited staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting a lot of new people.
good,The job is what you are allowed to make of it. There are ups and downs just like any other job i will imagine. My experience so far is vague because I have not been exposed or introduced to all that Walmart has to offer employees even though i ask questions and show interest.
good,"Working on the floor is fine, the people I work with are great. Sadly the management don't know or care about what is needed to make the store run properly. Sundays we would have asides from cashiers probably about 5-6 people on the floor FOR THE ENTIRE STORE. Usually 2-3 of them are in electronics which is required but having no one around the rest of the store and they wonder why customers get frustrated or the high amount of shrink."
good,"Very high pace. I loved the people that I worked with, the day went by very fast.  Miss the customers and associates. The company as a whole is a good place to work."
good,"O wal mart é uma empresa de grande porte , a maior na sua area  ."
good,it a great place to shop. the inside of the building and restroom be clean. you can shop an eat while you there shopping. they always have low pricing.
good,"Always busy.  They expect you to constantly be busy doing some type of work; no standing around and talking.  They say they are trying to make the work/live more balanced.  I am not sure of that. If you want or need a 2nd job, it is very hard to match it with your schedule.  The schedule is all over the board.   They prefer you to have open availability vs. a set schedule."
good,"This retail store offered me a part-time position with the possibility of advancement but when the time presented itself after receiving my degree in Human Resource I was turned down because he saw a need in the department I was in but there was also a need in the department I was inquiring about, because if it wasn't they would not have made it known to applicants to apply."
good,worked my butt off. Gave 110% all the time Management love me because I was always on time and always did my job and more. Always stay after my shift to cover the ones who call out.
good,"Job isn';t hard pay isn't great but it is a job and it works , people can get by and work hard and try and move up or slack off and it feels as if nothing ever happens to them."
good,Overall it is not a bad environment and place to work. However I did find it difficult at times to get much support from management. Not all associates were help to the same standards as others.
good,working at Walmart was hard. The deli was fast paced and at times it was stressful keeping up with orders and the cooking for the hot case. The people I worked with were great and we always made things fun but got the job done.
good,"Loved the people I worked with, but management wasn't very supportive. Walmart also doesn't believe in being sick even with a doctors note. If you miss 4 days of work your automatically fired or show up late 2, and miss 3 days your automatically fired."
good,Customer service based business where if well managed properly runs beautifully. Have worked at 4 different stores none were the same and management differed allowing me to grow different aspects of my management style.
good,they will not inform their employee's of any violation until it is to late an requires employee to be terminated instead of remedying the situation and trying to ensure that the employee can have a chance to redeem themselves.
good,"Walmart's work culture improved during the 12 years I worked there."
good,"I would say that this job was not at all anything that I would encourage anyone to take advantage of. Due to their lack of organization, it is not worth it. Yes they offer lots of benefits, which is the way that they pull lots of people in, but it is not worth one losing their sanity over."
good,its an ok place to work.... very friendly and meet new people and happy to help other people in there needs. some places are heavy to work if you have to do those areas
good,Walmart is not really the best place to work. It would suffice maybe for part time work for younger generations while going to school but a long term career? No not the place. Walmart is not as it was before Sam Walton passed. It's gone from family oriented to all about money.
good,"Jobs require associates to be engaged with the customers, providing excellent customer service while performing job specific duties. There are computer based learning programs associates are required to complete at the beginning of their employment."
good,It is a nice place to work for. Some of the workers though do not amplify customer service. Management is for the most part fair. Place though is tough to keep a job at if you have a serious health problem
good,fast paced job just the way management was towards the end of my tenure they treated me like they could replace me even though i came to work everyday and gave my blood sweat and tears
good,"Buen salario, buen ambiente con compañeros de gerencia, la experiencia obtenida en el manejo de personal y en el área del retail es muy enriquecedora, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo era trabajar con la gente lograr, lo que se nos pedía en cuanto a metas en ventas montajes etc."
good,"They don't recognize hard work, always have something to come plain about. It's ok for temporary work but not permanently. I think it's more there policy than it's management."
good,"it was an easy job that i really liked because everybody knew i knew what i was doing and left me alone to do my work. the only issue i had was when management took away our lockers without telling us and they didn't put locks on them and subsequently lost over 500$ worth of my personal equipment that i was told by management i could have, and they just tried to brush it off like nothing had happened because i filed a theft report and they just kept ignoring me in the hopes that id let it go and the four managers that were involved wouldn't get fired for theft."
good,"Sure you can advance quick enough, but the rules and regulations become harder and harder to follow as management makes up their own rules that aren't in any handbook. "
good,i loved the diversity of the job. i learned to be more resposible cause when you at a job you love you leared to go on time and do your best job. one of the hardest part of the job is when i left
good,"O dia de trabalho começa com a arrumação dos preços  e da implantação das mercadorias na loja e com a abertura da loja abordagem direta ao cliente para a efetivação de vendas de produtos e serviços. Administração fraca sem poder de negociação, por muitas vezes perdia -se vendas em virtude da loja possuir uma administração fraca em negociação "" nada se pode fazer "" é o que mais se escuta. Ótima convivência com colegas de trabalho."
good,"Empezar el día con actitud de servicio al cliente."
good,"Walmart seems to always have job security, but they do not pay well for the work that they want done and the environment and just how most of the managers treat their employees and sometimes the customers. The benefits do not actually BENEFIT the employees unless you have worked there for 10 years or more. It is just not the best place that I have worked."
good,Good place to work if the staffing is adequate. I worked there for 5 years and the difficulty always depended on how many associates we had during a night. Standard nights involves attending a brief meeting and reading the task manager to see what area\department you would be working in. Then I would take a few shopping carts or freight carts and start working the department. Task times range between 2 to 6 hours or more if you work a large department.
good,Okay place to work. Management is a little careless for employees' needs. Everything has to be a process with management and other employees which can take forever for some people. Customers are rude.
good,"As a cashier I would have to say this job is grate , meeting new costomers and eventually growing a relationship with them through work is very pleasant.  Also it's a very fast past job and always keeps me busy! Which I love. Walmarts a great place to work!"
good,The environment is friendly depending on the manager. If you work for Walmart you have to be customer oriented and have a positive attitude at all times.
good,in the five years i worked at walmart i seen more people quit and get fired then they will hire and all so the management plays favorites when it comes to promoting
good,I work in the electronics area but that never really mattered to any of the mangers there. I was constantly being moved all over the place being asked to help in departments i knew nothing about. i would only recommend to someone who's in high school or wants a side job being long term i would say this isn't worth it. Working at Walmart is very stressful you have to have a good backbone the customers can get real mean and nasty. some of the tasks are hard to do but you get through it. it does a lot of wear and tear on your feet you.
good,"Uma empresa onde não me arrependo de ter trabalhado,  porem os executivos poderiam olhar mas para as unidades."
good,Us overnight employees should be paid a little more but the pay isn't terrible. They work us hard but the hours can be good and you can move up pretty quick if your good at your job.
good,Learn to keep giving best customer service try harder to locate items in store and to have faster cashiers When lines are long if mangers are there to help
good,Wouldn't want to work any longer with not flexible hours for ME. The employers are okay in the beginning but aren't driven or about the employee it seems unless there is a problem. The typical day of work was okay. Depends on what supervisor or manager was there. and favoritism is wrong. Happened on a daily basis. Giving me work that was originally given to someone else. Only because someone didn't want to do it.
good,"Wal-Mart Kelsey Drive is a very easy and capable job to work. Doesn't require much experience  to get hired or stay employed. Sales floor staff other than management are great friendly people and very helpful as well as feel like a family. Management is a MAJOR issue, very power hungry and not considerate to employees and abuses management authority constantly. Had a manager talk down and yell at employees in front of customers while swearing and being immature about it. Also had the same manager verbally harass my SO and put in a complaint form and nothing was done about it. No talking to the manager no nothing, the management is allowed to get away with anything they want."
good,"My typical day was to zone Fabrics and Crafts and Stationary.  After this, I would most likely be done with my shift.  It was extremely busy during the weekends.  I was often asked to do impossible tasks, and when a worker that had not only sexually harassed me, but others, was hired for a second time, I decided it was time for me to leave."
good,"clock into work, take care of plants, stock shelves, greet customers"
good,It was fun at the time got to make friends and some not so friends but that was fine we kept it professional put our differences aside to be able to work efficiently and in a timely manor at times it was a little chaotic but still fun.
good,I enjoyed working at Sam's club. They do not pay much but you do not have to worry about loosing your job. I have worked for Walmart for over 3 years now and I think its a great place to work
good,Management treats you like gold. No one is forced to work to hard or do anything their not comfortable with.  They offer good training and always accommodate to your life.
good,Many positions offered within the company. Good benefits and decent pay but the hours are dependent on location. Some stores have a good working management team while others lack a functional management team.
good,Great place to work other than the problems with there computer systems breaking. The management there is great there friendly they help you if you need help if u don't understand.
good,"Working for Walmart isn't a bad experience, but its definitely not my favorite experience. The managers can be rude sometimes, and the coworkers sometimes don't take things very seriously. If you mind your own business and do your job to the best of your ability then you should be just fine."
good,The salary should be increase sometimes the management is discriminating us because of our nationality and my co employees are rude to me sometimes i dont now why?
good,"Walmart is an interesting place to work. The job itself is fairly fast paced and physically demanding, but I have enjoyed working with most of the people here. I have developed an incredible value for customer service and work ethics. However, in my opinion, the main complaint about the place is that there are are way too many chiefs and too few indians. For every department, there are about 5-7 managers that I interact with on a daily basis. Many of which are not on the same page with things and their requests are trumped in ascending managerial order, so you work on one thing, and another manager will ask you to do something different and so on. it can get frustrating at times! The most enjoyable part of the job is that I have the opportunity to interact with customers all day long and get to share little parts of their lives each time they come into my store."
good,"Working at wal-mart may have a stigma but money is money. The supervisors I had were pretty flexible and they do let you know when something is wrong. It is up to you if you plan to create a good connection with your coworkers. For me, I had a lot of fun working in wal-mart."
good,"If you are just about money and can tune the managers out wal-mart is the place to go. But not as a manager just as an employee. The management time come around every year. You work hard and preform then another manage come tell you, you doing it wrong when your doing what the other manager told you what to do. The team never communicate with each other, no body know nothing that is going on in the store. The best thing  about Walmart is the pay"
good,"My experience working for Walmart left me with mixed feelings. On the one hand, many of the people in management were very kind and receptive to the needs of the employees. On the other hand, the manager I had to deal with the most was very manipulative and was generally only interested in their own job. The overall morale of the staff was rather low, but many of the low-ranking employees did the best with what they had."
good,Working there as a lower level associate is back breaking work for little compensation. The reward of working there to be fair would not be for money but to build your work ethic and character.
good,"Only negative thing I have to say about working for Walmart is the confusion that the management provides. You have many people that can tell you what to do and you have to do everything that everyone of them says to do. It gets very difficult to do so when at least two different managers each tell you to do something at the same time. Typical day at work would include unloading the products onto the shelves, zoning the products, and anything else that my bosses would tell me to do. Met many great employees there and befriended most of them. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers out. I love helping someone out and knowing that I made their day that much better."
good,"Good my experience there was good, you have a opportunity to grow with the company. Money was ok, but the cost of living down there was expensive, wish we could of made more money"
good,"Walmart is a great company and employs many wonderful people. I love my coworkers, we are like family. There isn't much room for advancement but the benefits of working with customers make it worth it."
good,It was a nice place come in everyday 10 minute meeting before you start working. Learned good customer service skills and adapting to different fast paced work environment. Management was alright didn't speak must aside from meetings or if needed. Lots of different types of people. Hardest part meeting high hours time stamp with few associates in. Most enjoyable part was working along side different cultured people.
good,"A typical day at work was good. there were lots of customers, it was always busy, which was great because there was always something to do. I learned how to look up customer receipts, how to do wire transfers, money orders,and how to cash checks. I also learned how to mange the front end of the store. The management wasn't that bad it was just hard getting them to come and talk to the customers and there was a lot of favoritism. The workplace was very unorganized but one belief that they have that was good is Respect for the Individual. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the favoritism from the management. The most enjoyable part was being able to help the customers and doing it with a smile."
good,"A good place to work, very busy. I was able to apply for different positions in store. They hire on your merits instead of employee rankings of when they were hired."
good,"I do not mind the work here, but there are many lazy workers, and while they stand around and talk,while I am working, the managers are not trained or just don't bother to promote work skills with the employees.  This creates tension, and unpleasant work experiences."
good,It was a decent first job.  I was disappointed with the job transfer policies.  I could not get transferred to another position after being in my position longer than anyone at the store.
good,"i bon emplois "
good,"Worked evening shift, managers were very cool. Didn't really see my supervisor. Closed by myself most of the time, but it was okay. Easy to get your hours, but can't get overtime."
good,I would be willing to work for Wal-Mart again. Company has good benefits and opportunity to go higher in the company. Some of the  managers need more experience before becoming that title.
good,Management could use improvement but associates go above and beyond for customers. Work was easy to understand and help was always available. Would recommend for shopping.
good,The workplace was fun with lots of socializing with customers. Not too strenuous. Managers were lenient and caring except for a select few. A typical day was stocking dairy prodects.
good,"Walmart is a good company with good culture. People respect each other. The company cares for customers, caring for business; especially customer's safety. The associates have opportunities to move up to higher position which full training and caring."
good,"Well where shall I began you never know what you will experience working at Walmart. Currently, we are under staff which makes it hard for certain projects and objectives to get complete. Most enjoyable of the job is regular and customers coming to Walmart to save money."
good,"Working overnight takes its toll but pays a little extra, stocking and backroom work require some self management. Depending on the store and management team work can be enjoyable. There is some room for career advancement but at bigger stores it feels you are more of just a number rather than an individual."
good,"Some managers do not know how to manage a team.  That is the biggest issue facing the company.  IF this can be changed, things will be better.  "
good,working in this kind of environment you will need a lot of patience for the customers. The employees are helpful with one another to get the job done.
good,Wal-Mart has excellent safety procedures in place . I worked three twelve hour days that went by quick. I had good managers the time I was there. Room for advancement is there as well.
good,You can go as high as you want depends on how you apply yourself and how you work with management policies and other customers and associates.  You just must listen and learn
good,Wal-mart lawn and garden was a fun place to work except it is very stressful on the body. I have really bad knee problems which prohibits me from doing strenuous activity such as climbing ladders and such but when I gave Wal-mart my doctors note they didn't care. When I first got an interview it was to be a cashier but they put me in lawn and garden after I specifically noted that was not what I wanted.
good,"This was a good job with great people. It offered minimum pay, but the benefits were decent. I like the department I was in. I got the hang of things and could do my work in peace. I would have liked to start off full-time."
good,"Don't apply unless your desperately needed a new job "
good,"I worked at the distribution center. The work is okay. What is the problem is management. Very hierarchy, but its like any job. They will ""point"" you for anything and every time you turn around something will be wrong but its good money and they offer a lot of overtime although its mandatory. Its a job but stay on your toes because they will fire you for anything. Oh and their systems are horrible too."
good,not too much to say. I had my ups and downs there. The CSS'S there are amazing. My last Assistant Manager was very unprofessional and extremely rude. I had a good time there for the most part.
good,I'm accustom to dealing with fast past environment. My co-workers we're great people to work with store managers are very easy to get along with. I'm A student so they would work with my schedule.
good,lot of work to be done but also you develop people skills and how to solve situations that occur for example department is packed with skids one self is empty second is okay and third is almost empty you have to decide to the best of your abilities what to work on first
good,"Fast paced, always something to do. Clean and safe environment. A fun, friendly workplace. Except requesting time off was a struggle. Will work with company again if given the opportunity."
good,Had good work ethics. But some of the ppl let their job go to thier head.  I loved working with my customers.  As they are number ine priority.  If it was not for them we wouldnt have our jobs
good,It was great pay but management wasn't that good. Many cases of favoritism and unfairness. They're were some ver awesome managers not all were bad Hr wasn't too helpful most times
good,"The managers do not have manager skills, they treat their employees like they don't want to be treated. I learned to just come in and do my job without communicating to some of the managers."
good,"Work on cars and customer service. Most management is friendly. I've learned oil changes, tire installation and supervisor skills. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on cars and being a garage type atmosphere."
good,Learned how to drive a couple of different forklifts. Great pay every two weeks only work three days a week.. They have three different shift during the week..
good,This company is making a great effort to move in the right direction to better help it's employees and customers. It isn't perfect but its a great place to learn and grow as an individual.
good,"face paced customer friendly environment"
good,a typical day is day at walmart if you work in the morning  ( 6am ) is usually slow until about 10 am thats when most of your customers  start rolling in thats when it get real hectic and busy. but if you dont easy get stressed it will be ok but if small things get to you i wouldn't prefer the job. But when its alot of customers the time go by fast and then you get a break every two hours so it isnt that bad. Overall i like  the job Im a cashier i stay away from all the drama. So my work days are ok but im just tried of the job.
good,"ran the cash register and bagged customers purchases and get them out as quickly as possible."
good,"shifts were long and stressful, I learned pharmacy knowledge, pharmacy manager great, rest of the store not friendly, part time with full time hours.."
good,"Walmart is a very stressful, job but I believe you can make your money, but Walmart is not family originated. They make you feel like you have to choose between your family and them."
good,"Sometimes slow but mostly fast-paced as a cashier, i learned a lot of things about each department as a cashier because we were constantly short staffed. Management was always working on the problem at hand and the next problem ahead. Everybody below management wasn't that great CSM's were always conflicting with each other and making us operate in positions above and below our pay-grade for weeks on end. The hardest part is just working with conflicting CSM's but other than that its all easy if you are friendly and inviting, I enjoyed working with the customers and helping them around the store."
good,Fun place to work. Management team needs to get more help for all the departments. In most cases it's a struggle to do all the daily work routines in one shift.
good,great place to work i just move on in wanted better work .I move from the area so i had to find better work . in a stable job i was working through the temp agency. But got ask to join the company because of my work ethic .
good,"They change management a lot and they have a high turnover rate. the pay for managers are good, the communication between employees and managers are not good"
good,I absolutely loved my short time at Wal-Mart. The management was great and helpful in and if any situation arose. Would love to have the opportunity to work there again.
good,"Great culture and priniciples but slightly outdated to current strategic direction. Highly tactical approach where long term strategies are recently being considered but haven't fleshed out."
good,Really wouldn't tell nobody bout to apply at Walmart.. benefits great . Managers sit in they office all day and don't do nothing but complain. The best part about working there was seeing the smiles you put on customers faces
good,"Walmart offers many opportunities for advancement to its associates. The management is friendly and easy to talk to. It is a relaxed environment, but does expect you to do your best."
good,"Great pay and schedule, there are good benefits as well. The best part about this company is the advancements within the company. The job security is very good and management will treat you well. Hardest part about job is switching to 3rd shift schedule."
good,"walmart is a great place to work the only problem is finding good store management that actually takes care of its people, also if you can't handle working with all types of customers don't bother to apply"
good,Somewhat good place to work but sometimes management is not the best. There a big company and have amazing benefits but not good pay for the amount of tolarance you have to deal with.
good,"Walmart was a good place to work at the beginning, but has been changing over the years.  It used to be associate friendly and family oriented,  No real retirement plan except for a 401k."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers. We all tried to have some fun while working our various shifts. The customers were very nice. I did jobs for management as requested and they liked the work I did. The workplace culture was interesting with working the various people. This job taught me to be a better listener, be flexible with work schedules,and like the job."
good,"Empresa que exige bastante empenho e dedicação profissional do colaborador."
good,"muito bom de trabalhar, os colegas ajudam quando preciso."
good,Walmart is a work place based on team work to satisfy the customer to the employee best ability. The customer is always right and do whatever possible to make sure that the customers needs are met. Always greet the customer with a  smile and be polite. Ask customer if they need assistance in any way. And always make sure customer leave happy.
good,"I didn't enjoy working at Walmart, but wanted the experience to see what is was like, and I needed some employment. The workplace culture was somewhat demoralizing and management could've been better for the most part. My job itself was straightforward and not hard to complete, but could be very physically demanding at times."
good,"Overalll working with walmart was wonderful."
good,"Had fun working there with every one and the job."
good,"Working here i was a service writer in the automotives department. A typical day consists of stocking, writing up vehicle for a service such as oil changes or tires. I learned a lot more about cars while working here than I did coming in. At times management wasnt so great because they wouldn't be in the department half the time but overall they would come to aid when called for. The hardest part of this job is taking care of  customers while at the same time trying to get your daily task done. Most of the time i was there by myself with the hours i was working. The best part of this job is it is very hands on and you can learn so much about automotives and such."
good,"Working as a walmart cashier can be challenging because some customers are not always kind, but the kind ones make up for the others. Work environment differ between stores and management can be a hit or miss often, but it's a good high school or part time job with good pay."
good,Very fast paced high energy retail position requiring very good customer service skills.  You want  to pay attention to detail and be multi skilled so that you can CrossFit through the company.
good,"Other ppl are fine, to many management not communicating, or pushing own ideas to get anything done, will earn alot if you go in look for it, don't expect them to offer to train you for anything unless you become a nuisance."
good,I love my job at Walmart. I loved to social scene there. you can have fun while assisting customers. I would go back any time. i wish they would pay more.Thats my only complaint.
good,"*Loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays, and stocking shelves."
good,I have worked at walmart for a while now and it has had its ups and its down but over all it has been a good job. This was my firat job and i couldnt have asked for a better place for a first job
good,worked as a third shift stock handler. I rotated new and old stock on the shelves and made sure it all looked presentable. I then cleaned up the area i worked in to make it presentable for the customers
good,Walmart is a wonderful place to work for people who does not have kids in my opinion. They have allot of good managers that will try to help and work with you.
good,"The Walmart I worked at was a wonderful place to work. The managers are fair and treat the employees right. My experience was very learning. They teach working together and teamwork. I worked in produce the last 3 years I was there. My day would consist of putting fresh produce out, culling the produce to pull the bad off the floor, cleaning the work area , and other tasks ask of me from management."
good,it was okay but not if your looking to move up in life. I was looking for something that was better pay and a company that I could eventually move up in. it wasn't a bad place to work though
good,I really enjoyed the job and the environment. I knew my job was secure as long as I showed up on time and performed my duties to best of my capabilities. Only thing that was in my way was the pay not being manageable enough for a family of two or more. If it hadn't been for that I would consider it a career
good,"company need major upgrade with compromising with employees"
good,"Really enjoyed my 10 year experience. Had the opportunity to work in 3 major areas:  Operations, Merchandising and Realty Support.  Worked on variety special projects"
good,Paid every two weeks. Supervisors will ride you for fear of their own bosses. Their inventory system is very flawed. A lot of things just don't work and you will be blamed for it regardless.
good,"I used to love to cut the fabric and unpack the packages. All of its were good, but the managers were not doing good because they had a hard time to understand my Deaf culture. They did discriminate on me for my needing such as interpreter if meeting is very important."
good,"A typical day would include:"
good,Wal-Mart is just like any other job if you do yours you have nothing to worry about. Clock in respect your co workers and the customers and you will be fine.
good,"A good enough place for a start in life, but isn't a good environment to build a career in my personal opinion. The work only is great only if management does their part."
good,"Walmart was an interesting experience, because it was my first full time job. I worked the overnight shift and stocked various merchandise around the store. There wasn't much talking between employees and there was always a lot of work to be done. There were hardly any customers at night, so getting the work done was not a problem, however I found it difficult to go at a fast enough pace in order to finish stocking and front face the merchandise. Most of the management was alright, however there were some that got under a majority of the employee's nerves."
good,">As salary manager you are required to work 40 hour work week."
good,Learning experience like no other. Learning new skills was great. Co workers were a challenge at times but manager was great. Greeting customers and being of help was encouraging.
good,"Good work environment. Great people. Generous missed day policy. They are flexible with availability of what hours can be worked, and are more than fair when family issues come up and offer multiple ways of helping when special needs arise."
good,"I am enjoying my time with Walmart very much!"
good,"es una compañia que prioriza mucho a clientes y asociados. Busca la excelencia y mejorar dia a dia su calidad y calidez hacia los clientes. te ofrece la posibilidad de crecer, de capacitarte dia a dia, fomenta mucho el trabajo en equipo."
good,The other employees were amazing there and fun to work with. It was mostly the lack of hours and change in policy with out everyone being on the same page.
good,"Walmart compensates their associates fairly and does offer excellent benefits. Unfortunately, the job of Assistant Manager requires you to be scheduled for a 50 hour work week with the reality being you end up working 60 or more."
good,"I enjoyed working at the fabrics and even the online grocery. The employees were awesome, helpful and so much fun. I was disappointed that they say they are ""all about family"" and when I ran into some problems at home and had to move in one day they fired me. It wasn't even my fault, they couldn't transfer me and when I tried to call them to talk to the manager they kept on hold for forever and would never call me back."
good,The environment is very diverse and non-discriminating. There are opportunities for growth and elevation. There are really no difficult parts to the job. The most tedious part for me is knowing that I am not in my field of work. I am able to gain management experience due to the self motivating circumstances of the position. And finally the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.
good,Everyday is different the next. One minute it could be slow and the next the store could be filled with people. Good customer service is a high priority. The managers are very understanding with work hours while employees are still in school. When someone first starts of they make sure you feel welcomed into the department.
good,From what I remember it's not real hard to move up if you stand out and work hard. Problem was they didn't pay enough for me. Management could be difficult to work with and some were not well trained.
good,I had a lot of other experience and I tried several times to get management to secondary me in other departments to get more hours but they would never do it and I had to transfer out to a supercenter to get more hours.
good,"you get to learn a lot of things. meet new people. exposed to different types of people. some of the workers are quiet helpful."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, the job isn't hard and the environment is great. The only problem I had was that you would occasionally need a manager to get something done to help a customer, but they wouldn't ever come and at one point a manager decided to go on break after I was told they were coming to assist the customer."
good,"Very fun job, great employees, however wasn't very worker friendly, inconsistent schedules, as well as being stuck in a different position  then hired for without notice."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great entry job for the high school grad or a part-time for the college student. Besides that, steer clear of working here unless it is a last resort. The management in each and every one is downright unfit to manage these stores. They treat every employee as expendable, and nothing else. I was outraged by the quality of management they tolerate and I haven't looked back since."
good,"While I was working at Wal-Mart, i encounter a various of people, the staff at walmart is huge, a lot of people work there. The person i worked with was nice, taught me how to do my job properly. But others weren't as nice as her"
good,"the job has all the right perks but as from as organization, there's none at all. its a nice job to have and they differently will work with you on your job or keeping it. some employees are rude they need better judgement on the workers they hire."
good,"working hard while keeping it clean, management tellng where to go for the job safety, but the hardest part was lifting heavy boxes to be emptied while alone"
good,its a job co-workers are nice people just dont like 3rd shift room for advancement is slim but there raises are .22 a year but they have quartly bonuses
good,It's an okay place to work but not good on scheduling at all.  Kind of stressful but it's not to bad at all. Lay is pretty good since the raised the pay rate.
good,"Pros : Amazingly understanding if you need time off, good leadership, clear instructions and training."
good,"They pay well, some people are nice and some is not. They work well with you like with your schedule and your needs, I think managers should treat people better"
good,"Long Hours, Worked every holiday except Christmas."
good,Walmart was alright until my dad passed. Then the managers asked to my face if my dad really passed or if i lied and that put a sour taste in my mouth with this company.
good,This is a nice company to start working with while your in school or for a first job. Working here I started to learn how a company is operated and the importance of the customers.
good,Turnover is a problem.  I enjoy the customers that you see regularly. There is always something to do.   There is always constant change to keep updated with.
good,You are over worked and underpaid. There are management that take advantage of their associates. They have you work long hours and are not willing to pay overtime. They want you to cut your time on lunch.
good,Great for part-time work but not if you need a full-time job to be   Support yourself   They keep you under the hours  required to give you medical dental or other health benefits for almost a year no overtime and you start out at 9:50 an hour  they also require uniform without providing any compensation in order to obtain uniform prior to your first day on the floor
good,"You cook and fry food all day got to clean the fryer and the rotisserie and the racks you cook them on sweep and mop take the trash out make the sandwiches and the salads stock everything clean the slicers slice meat and chees and take care of customers, make party trays."
good,Buen ambiente laboral pero gerencia exige mucho para pocos asociados
good,"Everyday I learn more things within myself and others around me. It allows me to grow as a person and experience different ways of controlling behavior and how to keep things professional. Being part of the management time is such a great opportunity and I get use my leadership skills. the hardiest part of the job is working with individuals who have bad attitudes and they do not know how to separate their home life from their work life. the most enjoyable part is working with many different types of people and learning new things, it a great feeling to learn."
good,Walmart is a good place to work sometimes you have days where you will be dealing with an upset customer and some days will you meet some customers that are friendly. The management is ok. What i enjoy most is getting to meet and greet different customers each and everyday.
good,This facility is great for someone trying to obtain their first job or start back in the work field.  The pay improved while employed there however isn't enough to maintain a life for someone living in New England.
good,"I loved the job. left to go to another job due to more hours closer to home. I would love to go back. great work place. great customers, friendly co-workers"
good,"Different challenges and can be chaotic. Management members relocate often to sustain a good structure and teamwork. Every store environment is distinctively different. New store structure or routines that cause miscommunication, misunderstanding and unreachable expectations. Rapidly changes, new implementations are introduced into stores then instantly withdrawn again."
good,"Management was not professional as they should of been.They favor a lot which made associate struggle. I learned how to do customer service, be on register, and multitask different task in one day.The hardest part of being a personal shopper is when Christmas comes around. Apart from our regular job during Christmas season our department is in charge of layaway. Unfortunately the layaway system isn't the greatest and that made my job more difficult because we would lose half the customer items and some of those item we couldn't replace. Packages that came from shipment were to much and there was no room to put them so we would also lose those packages. The store manager could of cared less when she would see us struggle and when we tried to talk to her about solution to make our job easier she wouldn't listen. Half the time we would get in trouble and in my opinion it wasn't fair because there wasn't much we could do with little help they would give us. The only thing I liked about the job was my coworker."
good,"Managed all facets of operations, branch sales, and profitability, increased branch sales by 3 million dollars as well as increasing margins 3 points."
good,Aprendi bastante durante os meus onze anos de trabalho.
good,"Working at Walmart is great as a first time worker, however it is not a career. i consider it a stepping stone to further my experience till i can do what i love."
good,"Uma empresa comprometida , que usa de recursos para melhorar o desempenho dos funcionários é uma pena que a pesquisa de avaliação feita  junto aos funcionários seja manipulada pelos gerentes"
good,"easy work atmosphere, but not the be all end all job for most."
good,"What I have to learn about the job is communication, skill working, and being on time. I have to learn these skills too make the working area a positive compatible environment"
good,The job itself is fun to work and complete. Co-workers are great when everyone works as a team. The work day is busy and fast pasted. The company keeps the customers and employees safety and well-being in mind as everyone is shopping or working in the store. Overall Walmart is a fun place to work.
good,"Not too many complaints, worked around my schedule most times to be able to secure time with my family. Maintained a schedule that was sufficient to my needs."
good,"If you want to be a manager and move up, Walmart can be a great career, but if you just want a job to pay bills it's not the best. Mostly it depends on who you work with. If you have good coworkers you can have a good time, but if you work with lazy people it really sucks."
good,"i love to help the customers find what they need.  i just wished that they would of giving me a little help, i had to everything price changes, stocking the shelves and building displays"
good,The management will make you feel uncomfortable. The work around your schedule however limit your hours when you return. You cant call off in the first six months of employment. No matter what.
good,"I like working here, but only for the first year and a half. Since then it has been really bad corporate has made some changes that make it a bad work environment. It's not the store itself but the rules we have to go by now don't make sense, and make the work three times as hard. There's not better compensation for working overnights anymore. Overrall it's manageable, but looking for something more challenging."
good,"Es una empresa que la cultura la tiene muy clara,práctica respeto por cada uno de sus asociados,así mismo te da la oportunidad de crecimiento laboral,"
good,"a great place to work , they are are great at helping you when its neeeded. well put together company. the job its self was really easy nothing hard about. just have make you please the costmers. because they are everything because they come soend they hard earned so you have a job."
good,"I left because they don't pay enough. I loved the work but I busted my butt for just $10.50, I did everything that I could to make sure the manager didn't have to worry about a thing, whatever they asked for I was happy to help them with but that got me nowhere. I would love to work for Walmart at a different location if they raised the pay to like $12"
good,"Carry outs, gathering carts in the parking lot, cleaning the can rooms, cleaning the parking lot, pushing the carts up to the store and storing them, shoveling the parking lots and salting the parking lots."
good,"Productivity driven workplace with a cheerful atmosphere. Only drawbacks were no health benefits and the travel time to and from work. The hardest part I would have to say was the amount of product need to be gone through but, I liked that challenge. The hard part was the most enjoyable part for me. What I took most from that experience was efficiency. To put my nose to the ground and achieve the goal of stocking the large amounts of product needed to go through in one night."
good,This is a great out of high school job. It is the best paying position in wal-mart other than the overnight stockers. The location of the place is great and well lit.
good,The job was okay. safety wasn't one of there main concern.. a guy got stab a few time. and there main thing was getting him a drug test... didn't approve at all. and the pay wasn't good at all
good,Foi muito bom trabalhar naquela empresa. É uma ótima empresa
good,"Friday was my typical day."
good,It seems there are a lot of policy and procedures that are in place that are just there to cover the company and they do not hold to them
good,I don't feel the managers and leaders do much to assist you in questions. I feel the pharmacy is chaotic. It needs to flow better to run smoother and more productive. The staff isn't happy and it shows
good,"Very fast paced and exciting. There was some trouble at first with management thinking i wasn't fit for the job position. As time went by they noticed they're judgment wasn't correct. with me becoming one of the hardest most outgoing associates that went to work to do what i was hired for and more. Hardest part of the job was helping customers while trying to get the task at hand done on time. The most enjoyable time was the funny, spontaneous co workers there, as well as the customers that came and go."
good,"Throughout the day I completed various administrative duties as well, including baking, filing and greeting customers. I also provide customer service and resolved customer issues."
good,"The fellow employees are helpful and supportive of one another.  The management is helpful and supportive as well. There is a good learning environment. "
good,its a good job but not a career they would rather you work part time than full time and often get upset when you need to work extra hours. they expect you to work several jobs at once and cannot keep good help.
good,Overall good place to start out. The people were nice and the job is easy. They didn't hesitate to give me hours to work. I enjoyed working here and if i had to go back i would.
good,"Each day brings new challenges and accomplishments for the store.  Associates are the core of the Wal-mart family bringing forth their talents and contributing to the success of Wal-mart.   Although some days can be more challenging than others, customers are what encourage associates and management alike to offer the best customer service each day."
good,The customers are friendly and you get a chance to meet so many people from so many different walks of life. It's a wonderful experience you can definitely grow from. You are allowed to do a career change after 6 months so you can get different experiences under your belt. It's a fast pace store at times so you need to have patience and be able to keep the flow moving while multitasking.
good,Empresa Grande e muito conhecida por lojistas e distribuidora de alimentos e acessórios.
good,"I had to hand load trucks for to sent to stores,   I also helped run over flow.  Each day was different and rewarding.  The people I worked with were amazing.  everyone worked so well together."
good,"learned to manage the deli, enjoyed working with customers, training co workers , lo employee numbers, fasted paced, challenging, enjoyed the schedule that was offered"
good,I have been gone from Wal-Mart for 2 years. Shortly after I left the company restructured their store management. I really don't know what it is like to work there now.
good,A typical day starts out by walking the area to identify any issues and talking to my associates to get them on the correct tasks to exceed customer expectations. I have learned how to work as a team and motivate people to do better. Everyone is engaged in the business and wants to drive sales and quality.
good,It's a good constant work bags that keeps you going. You get put in different areas in you have a time limit to get your job done and if you have any questions you can always have someone.
good,"if you like being timed and micromanaged this will be a great place to work. its very much a logistics job. Everything you do is timed as an order filler. Including the time it take you to get to and from breaks as well as clocking out. There is no margin for wasted time at this job. If you dont hit standard you will be fired after a few weeks. Even once i learned how to order fill i found the standard sometimes doesnt give you a realistic amount of time. And management will ask you to do other things and they wont always adjust your time correctly for it. Some people catch on and some just dont. The job isnt for everyone. Order filling is incredibly tedious though. if youre the weekend shift you will only work 3 days a week, but be ready to only average about 30 hours per week. the hourly pay is best in the industry but my weekly take home only averaged about 500 a week for the whopping 3 months i was there. Also was surprised that such a large company will not pay you for any holidays including Christmas."
good,El desarrollo laboral es muy bueno la gente que está al frente de algunas áreas tienen bastante experiencia.
good,"Start out bright and early working with cash drawers till bout mid morning then on to paperwork the rest of the day.  In between helping out management and customers with issues and concerns. I guess the hardest part of the job really was getting up so early (5:00 am).  The workplace was very interesting, there was never a dull moment. I learned some of the insides and outs of retail, and I also learned how to order money to keep on hand."
good,"Orders drop and strategically decide the best why to fulfill replenishments "
good,"Retail life as expected.  Decent pay starting out but can become stale as you move up the ladder, depending on your position and qualifications.  There is always room to move up."
good,"Separaçao de produtos alimentiçios"
good,"Pay was very low for a position as a cashier. Managers would micro-manage us, and harassed us constantly. Co-workers were tired and bitter."
good,"I would say that the training is good because it is a large part of any store to learn inventory control, stocking and moving old or slow moving product to clearance lines."
good,A typical day would start with setting up the printing equipment and checking incoming photo orders.I learned a lot about using new equipment and how to assemble products for customers. I also learned about site to store to obtain customers orders. Management was pretty laid back and nice. I could come to them if I needed help with something or had questions they would help me out. The hardest part of the job would be some of the product assembly. A few things I had a hard time with. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my coworkers and helping the customers.
good,"We come in and set the floor for the daily truck unloading. Once we set the floor for truck we take a 15 min break on clock. Once that break is over we begin on the truck. Usually, only have one truck but it could be two around the holidays. Once the trucks are unloaded we take the freight to the floor for the next shift to put on the shelves"
good,"I started at a bad time in my life. But as long as you work and do what's you need and expected time passes and everything runs smoothly, so overall the company is great workers makes it difficult when it doesn't have to be."
good,Typical day of work is fast paced and hard. Hardest part of the job is the hours you work and always lifting and organizing merchandise.
good,it was a fun atmosphere except for some of management being not so friendly and not being adequately compensated for the job tasks performed. I enjoyed the people and the job itself just felt a little underappreciated.
good,Boa de trabalhar muito engajados sempre entregava o resultado esperado pela empresa alem do esperado
good,"I was a cashier, They took me off the schedule. i was only working for a few months due to the fact i was homeless at the time  2009. I don't have a bad review i would love to work with the company in the future."
good,"managers failed to communicate with eachother, causing back up in work to be done with the spread of all the cap team members."
good,"I worked as a cashier but I had been asked to do many other things as well while I was there. Unfortunately,  when you work for walmart, your first 3 days is nothing but sitting in front of a computer watching videos and doing quizzes at the end of said videos. These are called CBLS and they will ruin any attention span you ever felt you had. Even if you are not a people person, you will feel the need to hug the nearest person after your third day of CBLS. "
good,I enjoyed the advancement opportunities that the company provided. There were willing to work with my school schedule at that time.
good,I enjoyed my time working as a stocker at Wal-Mart. I learned great organization skills as well as intrapersonal skills. A typical day of worked consist of stocking products on the shelves in a timely manner.
good,Walmart has its pros and cons. I loved my assistant managers and shift managers however you are just an object that can be replaced.
good,"Currently I have noting to say at this time neither good or bad regarding this company,but thanks for the opportunity to give a review."
good,"Walmart was a good right job to have, it was a fast paced environment witch I enjoyed. The pay was ok, my co-workers where really helpful in teaching the job, and pushing you to be the Best you can be"
good,"Es una empresa interesante para formarse y aprender.. Los puestos gerenciales conllevan un ritmo de trabajo de gran desgaste."
good,"I learned about sales and guns. The management is great, they're very understanding and easy to work with. I enjoy helping customers  . I try to put myself into the customer shoes so i can better help the customers."
good,"You show up to work, some times management is not clear about what needs to be done even when you ask. The hardest part would have to be the customers."
good,They are too bubbly for me. They expect you to do their silly cheer and wiggle your but doing what they call the squiggly. Not everyone wants to act that stupid.
good,"Walmart had great benefits but the culture was not of feeling appreciated among the employees.Management did check back with each other, giving conflicting orders and too many assignments at one time."
good,This company has lots of opportunities for those willing to work hard and stick it out. The employees are often family-like. The only true unfortunate thing about this company is that as an employee you will miss every major holiday with your family.
good,"Todos los dias hay algo que hacer.Aprendi a"
good,"My day consisted of running freight from the backrooms that the overnight associates could not finish or did not even work"
good,"They care more about their customers then the employees, and customers know that so it makes it a pain sometimes. Price matching is nice but people try to cheat you all the time.."
good,"Loved working in customers service field, any type as long as I am helping others. I am my best when I can help other and make someone day a good one."
good,"La empresa en si tiene valores muy altos los cuales son dignos de destacar y de tomar como bases para una convivencia laboral optima, lamentablemente, no muchos llevan a cabo esos principios. Particularmente, he tenido una excelente experiencia con respecto a mis pares, ya que con la mayoria habia un gran clima de compañerismo. Lo que me parece como parte negativa es la conducta de no corresponder la confianza o las responsabilidades  laborales que se les atribuye, priorizando la complicidad de conductas impropias antes que la productividad de los recursos humanos involucrados a fines de sus tareas diarias."
good,I loved working for Walmart I just felt like they would work us to hard and had us doin things that had nothing to do with the job I had applied for than it was to many people playing favorites but it was a good job.
good,"I enjoyed working there, good benefits but at the end of the day, you are just a number.. I learned that in corporate based jobs you have to make sure EVERYTHING gets documented, word of mouth doesn't count. Management will always be under discretion of the one above them. Walmart is very diverse, you can become a family, but the catch is, when your number is flagged they don't look at outside factors, or what a good worker you are, if everything is ok.. they look at paperwork. If you prioritize well, you will make it, but don't put your trust in anyone else but yourself, you must cover your own tracks at all times. This job was a good life lesson for me."
good,"*poor training for supervisor as well as employees"
good,"I was given a large range of areas I could advance in if I wanted to over time, and it is fairly easy to show leadership skills due to such oppurtunities"
good,"Only cut hours from certain people instead of everyone."
good,"The typical 8 hour work day at Walmart for a cashier usually includes 2 15 minute coffee breaks as well as an hour long lunch break, 5 hours working directly with customers, half an hour ""red-lining"" to bring customers to your till, and half an hour moving from one till to another and cleaning. The CSMs are very friendly and reliable, but upper management can be aloof and it is discouraged to go above your direct manager if you have a problem with them, either personally (such as the way the manager treats you or harassment) or professionally (such as lack of hours or requests to move to another department). The best part of the job was interacting with co-workers and customers, but the hardest was witnessing the way some of my coworkers were treated by customers and management."
good,"I was simply a sales floor associate and they were too unorganized with various departments schedules so therefore I was asked to do other associates duties on a daily basis. Most of the time management asked me to leave my own area so frequently that my department was suffering. But, the people themselves were great people to work with and the job was a breeze everyday. Its just the expectations were unrealistic."
good,"-Shift usually begins with putting back the returns from customer service and after that zoning the different departments for apparel"
good,At the job I had to put stuff on shelves and occasionally help unload the truck.  The managers would threaten to write up the whole overnight crew about every other night (never actually did though as far as I know) because they felt we were not moving fast enough.
good,I had a good experience while working there but after my 1st year it went down hill they didn't want work with me while I was in school they had cut back on hours tremendously...and the managers showed favoritism.
good,Management was almost always helpful. I would recommend this job to any students that need a place to work while in school. They always listened when i needed help working out my schedule and i never had any issues.
good,"Alright job. Good people and most of the management there where good, decent people. Only complaint was I applied for and received a job at the Photo Station. I ended up working fabrics or other departments 80% of the time."
good,it was ok and nice to work for the employess were nice but advancement opportunities were very limited the pay was not a whole lot but they did let us work a lot of hours
good,great place to work but not easy to move up with restructuring. they also handle store issues in a manner most wouldn't agree with.
good,it is hard work not going to lie. but once you get into a routine its second hand nature. my friend has been there for 16 years. the money is good. just be head strong an you'll be alright.
good,"Wal-Mart is the place to work if you're just starting out or are in a bind like i was, but i can't see making a career out of it. It's not easy to make any advancements or get any raises."
good,"convivência boa com os colegas de trabalho, comprometimento em ter um bom atendimento ao público,o motivo de sair da empresa foi devido o encerramento da farmácia."
good,"Walmart does not care how much you have going on in life they will always be the priority, They have issues with working with other schedules. I was in school and ran into too many issues."
good,working here was good no complaints its a fast paced environment which I like and your not only doing your job but you learn how to do others as well you help where help is needed and gain different types of experience
good,Ive learned that I am a more hands on learner i love this type of environment I love to learn new things because each day is another lock of new ideas.
good,"The work at my location was good, the hours were reasonable, and the pay was acceptable. There was, however many documented issues with management-employee relations."
good,"A good company to work for. However, life/work balance is questionable. As well as the advancement in the career path that you choose. It can differ greatly and that is definitely something to look at."
good,Trabajando en esa empresa te sientes parte de un grupo social pero al mismo tiempo puede ser que se te haga rutina todo depende de los compañeros que tengas al rededor también cuenta mucho la forma en que te traten tus jefes eso depende mucho de si te sientes agusto o no.
good,"Greatly appreciated management team, well organized, a steady work ethic, and just a all around great place for employment."
good,staff was over all friendly but because of the fast pace the customers and management were often less desirable to work with
good,"If you can deal with the 3 issues of Merchandise, Customers, and Co-workers well, then the sky is the limit as far as what you can achieve with the company."
good,"J'ai passé la majorité de mes premiers jours dans la salle de formation sur les ordinateurs, en apprenant les bonnes pratiques de magasinage. Ils sont vraiment utiles, et si vous faites attention, vous apprenez beaucoup. Dans l'ensemble, j'ai passé environ 6 mois chez Walmart. C'était une grande expérience."
good,Walmart is a place to get great benefits but not so good understanding management. The environment is fast pace and productive. With the minor rude customers and employees they do work well with your availability.
good,"Productive, fast paced environment. "
good,I was in charge of filling out all the case of water that needed to be fill for customers needs. As well as making sure the lane I was working at looked presentable for the customer and the store manager.
good,"Large company with good training. Motivated employees have ability to advance."
good,Overall enjoyed my job. I enjoyed baking and cake decorating. I enjoyed helping customers. I wish management was more concerned with associate concerns and took more interest in each department.
good,"At Walmart its A Very interesting Job . You Meet All Different Types of People,They Treat you very Fair && They Are Willing To Work with you if you have any issues"
good,"A typical day at Walmart has you doing just about every job you could think of in retail. You're constantly learning about customer service and the industry. Management drives you to work in a way that drives you to excel in your area. The only hard part about the job is that it gets very monotonous after some time. While you can learn a fair amount in this setting, nothing really ever changes. The best part of the job though is how social it can be. You can meet hundreds of people in a single work day, most of which are more than happy to carry on a casual conversation and joke around with you."
good,"Got there, punched in, and went to my manger to see what register number i obtained for the day. Every once in awhile i would have to move registers to cover other cashiers when they went on breaks or lunch. Only downfall is that the registers rely so much on management every time they needed to be unlocked or opened, and management would usually take awhile to come."
good,"the deli is a demanding department"
good,"A typical night of work always began with some sort of staff meeting and job assignment for fellow associates and I. After that we would all move to the floor and or assigned tasks, with very few hiccups. It was required in the particular Wal-Mart I worked at more than some others due to the very small staff available each night. Most of the things I learned, I had to learn by myself since there was little time to spare for managers or other more experienced associates. The hardest part of the job in my experience was just getting used to not seeing the sun much when you worked nights, and the stress of being short staffed on a night with a 2100 piece truck. There was always stress and always camaraderie during those times, but there was also no shortage of stress induced snapping at each other. Normal for most places or work.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the store so well that any shopping you had to do there was really quick. Or easily being able to help a customer without even really thinking about it."
good,It's real is to get prompted at this company. Doesn't pay well. Be prepared to work all major holidays with the exception of Christmas. Bonuses are nice that the company gives to the employees.
good,"I liked working at Walmart because it was a good friendly fun clean environment to work in. The supervisors there were friendly and easy to work for, I would recommend to any young person starting out to apply there."
good,"At work I never know what I'll be doing that day, I work every position on the front end. Customer service, money center, cashier, or self-checkout. Everyone loves me at work because I'm always happy and in the mood to work."
good,I loved working at Walmart. I liked all the people that I worked with. The environment was relaxed but professional. I enjoyed working there but the hours did not work with my school schedule.
good,"The jobs aren't hard, it's the management that makes it stressful. They all have their own idea on how things should be but none of that works together."
good,there were a lot of duties to squeeze into a day's work. customers could be very impatient. other employees were helpful and wanted to help when the opportunity presented itself.
good,"The pay was great. I was hired along with nearly 700 others for seasonal and it was very unorganized. I was offered a permanent position but I am a college student and they did not offer part time and when I went in to do the paperwork to transition from seasonal to permanent, they did not have my shift available and pretty much told me too bad so sad and sent me home."
good,"Everyday was climatic, which can be good or bad depending on the day. Management needs improvements as far as communication and following through with promises. I have made life long friends with many of the co-workers and refer to most of them as family. I learned patience, professionalism, and many more lessons. The hardest part of my job is being a manager over multiple areas of the store when it shouldn't be my responsibility. The most enjoyable part of my job is leaving some days feeling like I have achieved something or have had a customer leave feeling that I have helped them and they are grateful for my help. It is overall a good start job or a great job to step up in quickly."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work I loved my job,  sadly management ruined it for me they made it very hard to want to continue working there. They are very rude and have a tendency to treat their employees like they're lesser than them."
good,Uma empresa com pessoas dispostas a trabalhar e a lhe ajudar como em todas empresas têm .
good,"Not the best, not the worst; all I can say is that Wal-Mart has its ups and downs, perhaps like most companies. I can't complain too much, since they did hire me."
good,"Good people and  OK environment. Can be difficult for advancement. Most of the managers are nice. Overall it depends on you , can get real busy and frustrating but if your up for the challenge you can make it."
good,I enjoyed working there until I got 11.5 points and no one was trying to help me figure out why. and also hurt my self at work doing something out side of my job.
good,"This is a great place to work as long as you do whatever they ask of you. Any time you say no hurts your prospects, even if it isn't something in your job code. The pay is okay but not great. Advancement is a possibility if you can stick it out long enough."
good,"Overall it's a good company to work for.  Job security is always a problem with changing environment though"
good,"A normal  day consists of stocking freight from the delivery and helping customers."
good,"learned  to pick up English and also helped me to help people,willing different department.,Sociable with different cultures and foods"
good,I don't know why everyone says it's so bad to work here. Yeah it sucks and I'm looking for another job but it's not the worst thing on earth.
good,It was ok working for them but they dont do what they say they would like a few of my family passed on and i tried to get it off but they didnt excuse them day and they fired me
good,The people are great. The work you do is will make your shift go by real fast. And the manger's really try to help you out. And you get the hours you need.
good,"At Walmart pharmacy, it is a daily challenge to deliver exceptional customer service with meticulous data analysis. The work can be fast paced and fun."
good,"My co-workers are really fun and cool to work with. The managers just want the job done and that's all that makes them happy. As long as the job is done, you shouldn't have a problem. The store is always clean .The hardest part about the job is doing everything they want you to do."
good,the average employee doesn't usually actually make enough to progress in life. only enough to sustain the same week to week lifestyle. not to mention having to wait 2 weeks for your next check.
good,"Good job to get some extra cash, not much room for advancement.   No stable scheduling, but that's expected.  Overall not a bad place to work, getting a discount on groceries was a definite bonus."
good,"It was fun and challenging to work in the fresh department, with there always being something that needed to be done. Excelled at cooler and skid organization, inventory gun controls and leading the team when it was required and had support with my aspirations"
good,A typical day at work is to clock in and go to your CSM and ask what needed to be done. From there you had an option to do Go backs if needed or to hop on the register if it was really busy. Most of the time I would be put on register. The hardest part of my job was trying to feel safe when I would get customers who would say inappropriate words to me. The best part of that job was to meet families everyday and engage in a conversation with them.
good,"as a manager it can be overwhelming and lack of knowledge and a willingness to misinform can lead to stressful days, freedom to learn and fail, but each walmart is run different and really depends what kind of work culture your SM brings to the table."
good,"The company, as it always has, makes it difficult to advance out of entry level management and into the upper echelon.  Over all, i did enjoy working for the company, and did so for many years.  I just wouldn't suggest someone to work here who wants to advance in their careers."
good,"I was working as a stock associate then later became a unloader."
good,there is great people to work with but didn't like the hour the most enjoyable part of working at this job was helping other people and meeting new people
good,"Go to work, do a good job and go home. Not much else. Atmosphere feels like a facade of people HAVING to help you instead of wanting to. Management was very knowledgable and sociable."
good,Alright for a starter job. I felt secure in my employment. The only thing that I didn't like was the management on some levels. Its touch and go with every Walmart
good,"It's a good fun place to work with mostly good people I say that loosely cause there's always a few that try to ruin other people's good days with petty stuff, but there's always ones that try to improve your days for the better. Definitely has poor management and I think that will always be a problem there cause they try to get people with high iq for a manager instead of someone that's accttually knows a thing or two about what there doing"
good,"It is a ever changing workplace, no two days are the same. Very fast workplace and exciting, we work hard, I learned a lot about produce since I been there. Management is always changing, so a lot of times you have to depend on your knowledge of your department to get the job done correctly. I love my co-workers we are like a family and we work together to see to it that the company is successful. The hardest part of the job is to take orders from a person who don't know your department and tell you to do something that is against the Walmart policy, and the most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers, going out of my way to make sure that the customer is happy."
good,"Wal-Mart does schedule enough people in there departments.  This leads them to send people that work in different departments to fill in the position.  You will constantly be stressed out and over worked.  They are flexible with working with schedules but, managers usually forget to change it and it ends up counting against you.  Your coworkers will be fun to work.  Have a decent break room with vending machines.  Wal-Mart also has dinner for the associates from time to time."
good,"good work setting"
good,This is a bitter sweet job. I have made connections with people there that will last a life time. I as well have learnt many valuable work skills. The problem is no employee cares enough to put an effort into their work. everyday I see them group and talk (even with customers to be served!). its frustrating to try so hard in an environment that cares so little...)
good,for a first job it was alright.the money was nice and some of the management was cool and the discount you get is great but they favor employees that are puss overs.
good,you would come into work clean your work station sign in to the register and assist the customers. Managers would tell you when to take breaks and lunches. Most managers were easy to work with and made the job easier and more fun to be at.
good,"It is a very easy job, with low stress."
good,Les falta motivación para los asociados tienen mucha rotación de personal por este motivo
good,ok place to work and if you are in need of a job they are their for you would be better if they started people off hire and actually cared about the employee not the bottom line theirs more cameras in the back of the store then the front
good,My manager like working with me because I have great potential and creativity to grow with company.  My manager now that i'm a fast learning and that I can get the job done correct.
good,"A challenge and stressful environment, no team effort  to work together, and back stabbers. No one wanted to teach or train and was hard to improve at all."
good,I worked for Walmart over the summer. They worked you hard all the time. Days off were needed to rest up for the next week. Working evenings and nights can be draining. Cashiers were often pulled to do other task. The pay was not horrible for the hours. The hardest part was inconsistencies from other co-workers.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is usually fun and fast. Whether I am working a register, the service desk, or Walmart.com Pickup station, i always move fast and have fun. I work with a lot of other people and meet new customers everyday making it possible to learn new things everyday. Overall i enjoy my job, but as anywhere there are always bad days. I really enjoy the people i work with, management as well, for the most part. The associates and managers I work closely with are great, it just seems like the higher end management of the store do not care about lower pay grade associates and tend to speak to them unprofessionally which can turn any day into a bad day. Id say my favorite part of my job is meeting new people everyday and solving problems."
good,Over all it is a good place to work. They could have better and more affordable insurance for employees. If you work 3 Rd shift they turn off the heat and air so it gets to hot in the summer or you freeze in the winter.
good,It was another experience. it wasnt hard as it was over night in a not so busy area. While there werent many people shopping in Electronics overnight I restocked Toys department and Furniture.
good,"Professionalism and management skills are lacking. Employees are expected to handle situations on their while they and customers have to wait for management to assist. "
good,"The job was difficult, it took a lot of skill and stamina. I was able to develop great people and communication skills. The co-workers were great."
good,It was a great experience. I work the morning shift I stock eggs and milk most of my shift when they needed to be filled which was always.
good,"On a typical night you have to make sure the entire store is stocked and clean with 12 associates to make it happen with. This included grocery and general merchandise. I will have to say that I spent many mornings leaving late as the store manager's expectations were for everything to be done regardless of being short staffed or not. A lot of mornings however the other assistant managers would pitch in to help out to get it done. I really enjoyed my associates because they would work really hard for me, because I worked really hard for them."
good,"At the whataburger that I worked in, my co-workers didn't get along and they got in fights at times. The service was terrible and there was no communication to better serve the customers. They didn't give hours either."
good,It was ok some managers were unprofessional. The hours and pay was good. But the managers some of them need to be more respectful. The benefits were good as well. Overall its not a bad place to work at.
good,"a typical day at work is a rush. you're always on your feet. if if isn't taking orders, it's refiling the ice bucket for the cups, it's cleaning the tables in the dining area, or asking the customers if everything tastes alright, or it's cleaning the restrooms. either way you're always on your feet and keeping busy."
good,"Typically I Marked and moved boxes of product. The job was pretty nice because I got to talk to people and make friends. Managment did care about us and did their best to make sure that they provided the easiest way to complete our job. I learned how to use inventory devises such as MC-40's. The most enjoyable part of the job was simply working, I actually liked my job, but the hardest part of the job was that they did not give me a solid schedule that I could work on and my schedule jumped all over the calendar without notice, sometimes even while I was on my way into work the schedule would change and say that I was already supposed to be there. I was never notified by the store about any schedule changes."
good,I as I said above it's ok to work there while your going to school. Not really a place to have long term career not unless you don't have going for you.
good,Bina empresa que apoya mucho a los estudiantes en cuanto a horarios y escuelas
good,While I was there I had managers that were more worried about themselves looking good then making sure the employees were getting a good training and treated fairly. I found out I was pregnant and needed to change positions and everyone else with lesser reasons would get moved. I tried to work with them to get into at least something a little less strenuous but got ignored and set up to fail. Then gave an ultimatum to quit or be fired for not being able to carry out the duties of my job description.
good,"Everything was very structured, and had its place.  Co-works were always easy going, and most were there to work. Management had relatively good abilities to communicate."
good,"Since I worked nights, my time being there was actually soothing. I've learned that some people in higher positions, tend to let power go to their head. Management and my co-workers were actually cooler and nicer than I expected them to be. I really didn't find any part of my job hard at all but if I had to choose, I'd say zoning. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking the freezer because I caught on very quick and it became an enjoyable habit."
good,I enjoyed learning new skills on a daily basis and the patients were always friendly and made my job easy. I was however not impressed by the management and the way certain issues were handled.
good,"I loved the job, it was my first real one"
good,As a cashier everything was alright. Pay was decent and the management was okay. As a deli associate the pay was slightly higher but that did not justify the amount of work required. They expected a million task to be done all at the same time with no support.
good,Loved working at walmart. I advanced fast and the pay was great with even better benefits. I learned a lot working in receiving how to manage my time and employees better.
good,"Great Mentors"
good,"The job was easy to learn and perform, but the managers made some short-sighted decisions that made it difficult to take work seriously."
good,"typical day at work was very busy and productive, managment was a little difficult to deal with only because organization was sloppy, most enjoyable was the walmart customers friendly and happy"
good,"Fill the shelves, Operate cash tills, Clean the shelves, Provide a professional and good customer service. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. The hardest part of the job was the the supermarket being large made cleaning it take a long time."
good,A typical day at work as a front cashier is how you will have to deal with customers on a daily basis. Some customers are very understanding while others are quite rude. I learned how one needs to stay positive regardless of what happens during the day. The management team were on top. My co-workers were very friendly and talkative. You will feel as a team. The hardest part about the job if I had to say was not working there but the hours. It's difficult to manage with the hours since you can receives shifts as early as 6am to as late as 12am. The hours varies based on your availability. If one puts themselves as available everyday anytime then expect to have a shift as early as 6am to 9am following after another shift just as early as the previous one. The most enjoyable part of the job were the employees. I enjoyed talking to the employees and learning from each employees. Everyone in this workplace has a unique personality.
good,"A typical day at work wasn't terrible, but it could easily go from great to worse within an hour. I learned quite a bit from the job. such a great customer service skills, how to unload and ever load trucks. how to efficiently stock shelves and how to pick and bin with mc40s. unfortunately the management there could have been a whole better. were not very responsive to associate needs as well with the customers needs. my coworkers on the other hand were solid workers. all around a friendly team to work with. the hardest part of the job was unloading. even though it wasn't really that hard. just required a lot of moving around. the most enjoyable part of the job was the friends you would make. the associates themselves were very friendly people. and i personally enjoyed stocking shelves and greeting the customers."
good,"Work always gets done on time. The benefits are nice, especially for college students. The hours are really nice and the people there are nice."
good,"My day was filled with dealing with customers, associates problem solving, freight, schedules, ordering, and anything else needed."
good,Positions were absolving slowly but surely back in 2005.  It was time for a new career. I got out when the opportunity approached. Good learning experience and worked my way up part time to DM level.
good,"Great job for first time workers, they will hire you with not experiences, they will guide you and teach you in order to succeed on your career life. also good job for college students, cause they work around your school schedule."
good,It was a decent experience overall. Enjoyed meeting new people everyday and Management was very fair. Ran into a few problems but those were handled fairly quickly.
good,"Management is very inconsistent. They just care about getting in and out. The employees did not seem to matter to them as much. The customer base can be a bit negative, but it's something you have to deal with. Most often, you will have happy customers."
good,It's a fine place to work for a while but get out ASAP when you find something better. The best part was the quarterly bonuses.
good,Compañía con deficiencias en recursos humanos no repetan horario descando no respetan los indicadores de calidad de vida todo es a beneficio de gerencia y no del asociado
good,"Wal-mart has a lot of good and bad days depending on the customers you come in contact with, but everyday is a good day employed."
good,"Good place to work, will try to help you advance in the work environment if you show strong acts of leadership. very faced paced, sometimes will over load you with tasks but other than that wal-mart is a decent place to work."
good,"Back when I worked here, it had it's up and downs, which people would expect at Wal-Mart. Co-workers are your friends there, your crutch, because the customers that come through Wal-Mart aren't all bad. However the bad ones are the loudest and rudest people I've ever met that act like children if they don't have their way. "
good,"I was the first HR Manager for one new store. "
good,"Trabalho é normal não muito puxado."
good,"Great service live music on Fridays, awesome fresh made food with great clean cooks. Always providing amazing service. Never doubt on coming back."
good,I thought Wal- Mart was a fun place to work. Has a high turn over rate. I would always come into a clean environment and would always meet great people
good,A typical day at Walmart is clocking in going to your assigned department or area and reviewing your tasks for the day. Then you begin your tasks working for 2 hours until your first 15 min. break then 2 hours later you take your lunch break which is an hour long. You then return from lunch an proceed with your daily task and customer assistance until your last 2 hours in which you should be zoning. Zoning is jus making sure the isles are straight and neat. Then finally your day is complete and you are ready to clock out.
good,You will always have a job at walmart if you show up everyday and do your job like you are supposed to. Bad management. no communication between them.
good,Its was i good experience at walmart always fun n progress  there i had family problems thats why i had to leave than i decided to do something i love
good,I worked in Wal-Mart a long time ago. My experience there is typical of this type of work. I did my job correctly and efficiently. I got along with the managers. The hours were flexible.
good,I worked a few positions here. It was easy to advance if you worked hard. The management was very easy to talk to. It was a great place to work.
good,"If you have good employees then you should be fine. You have to book any events/dates off at least a month in advance. Not a bad place to work but no great, but its a job so you cant complain."
good,"There's a lot of work, so getting bored is definitely not in the picture. you'll learn a lot at first but work we'll be just repetitive after a few months. Some co-workers are hardworking at first then becomes lazy when the work doesn't fit the salary. Management is fair. The most enjoyable is break times of course."
good,Typical day was enjoyable for the most part in the back room where I worked logistics. The floor was a different story. Customers and managers are rude. Best part of the day was generally the many breaks Walmart provides.
good,Managers say they will work with you and let you have flexible hours but they will not. You don't get break on time if you get your break at all. Some managers are very rude and disrespectful to associates.  I do not recommend working for this compamy . You no longer receive holiday pay.
good,"The university I attended partnered with Walmart for internships with graduating seniors in the hopes they would move forward for training to become an Assistant Manager.  The internship was not laid out in the best format, so we had to learn how to make the best of the situation."
good,"This position keeps me very busy and allows me to get to know a lot of people and work with others.  Although I do really like this job, I don't see it as an end all beat all position as it doesn't provide me with many challenges except for that of having to find a way to get all things done with a limited amount of resources."
good,The employees that do work for walmart are all family oriented. They make you feel right at home. The management is just lacking a little more structure.
good,"Good benefits, decent pay, disorganized management and not very clean store. For the most part friendly people and friendly overall environment. Would work here again."
good,"My average day of work is pretty okay."
good,"reunión de 10 minutos "
good,The people were pretty nice and welcoming. The job wasn't too stressful or demanding. The managers worked around my school schedule so that was a big help.
good,I guess I was in the wrong position. I hated to come to work Everytime I came in someone was complaining about something advancement was slim to none
good,Working at Walmart wasn't that bad. Really. That was my first job and I worked there for a year and learned a lot.  If they really like you they will increase your hours or even ask if you would want to transfer you to another department to make you happy.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart can be a pleasurable experience, depending on whom you work with, and what kind of customers you have that day/week. The hardest part of the job is definitely customer's attitudes. You have happy ones, which are awesome, and you have one's with no personality, whom usually do not speak back if you initiate conversation, and you have down right rude ones, whom are crabby and complain about everything in sight. The best way to handle all of these people is to keep smiling and move on to the next customer as quickly as possible. The enjoyable part are the happy customers that make you laugh when your day seems to be going downhill. As far as co-workers and managers, they are usually a joy to be around-typically no issues there. Just keep a positive attitude and you should survive, just take it day by day."
good,"Walmart was ok with me, some assistant mangers would abuse their authority at some points... benefits can be ok..(only if you are permanent). Did enjoy working with some of the employees... I might even look over some of the cons of working there and go back in a different position... MIGHT..."
good,"i learned of how to interact with customer in any sort of event. "
good,"Foi  bom trabalhar la,mas sempre em uma empresa ocorre estresse mas devemos respeitar cada um,cada colega e chefe.Tendo ética e um bom senso tudo da certo."
good,i worked here for 4 years while i saved up for and while i went to college. i quit because new management came in and lowered my pay almost 4$/hour because of changed policies. its a good job if youre willing to work weekends to pay for school. would not recommend as a career.
good,Better starting salary and benefits are the only big issue I ever had working there. The training and job learning parts are a little tedious and winded but effective.
good,I've worked in 6 different departments since I've been with the company Walmart. It's a pretty nice and friendly place to work. I thought I was in it for the long run but decided to seek in another direction.
good,to many people to work with and the customer assistance some times was unplaced management don't help with the every day troubles with customers.
good,"Graveyard shift was very satisfying for me when it came to walmart. I got to experience cashiering and stocking at the same time. Management was not very friendly, but I withstood. My coworkers were very helpful and nice. The hardest part was always first clocking in and coming onto the floor. The store was still very busy at this time, so trying to check out all the customers while pulling trash, sorting the restock that customers had left out, cleaning, and answering the phones was a bit challenging but manageable.The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction."
good,The typical workday for my position was both mentally and physically fulfilling most day. While there I learned many useful skills on how to help customers and how to work efficiently. Management left some to be desired with some not entirely focused on the ideals or concerns of their associates. Hardest part of the job was brought about during inventory but it was also the most enjoyable part as I felt that I became acutely aware of the products I was helping the customers receive.
good,I was able to learn what it was like to work retail during a summer of temporary employment. I wouldn't recommend that anyone apply with the idea of advancement in mind.
good,"Tiene buenas prestaciones pero la calidad de vida se disminuye, aparte de que hay que regalar tiempo que no te pagan para solucionar algún problema que se presente."
good,"I had young children at the time I worked here.  My husband got a job that required him to travel so I had to quit."
good,"Never enough time to get it all done. Since it is a"" small city"" it can be overwhelming for some people. You do not get to build relationships with customers like you do in a smaller retail store."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for but you get alot of changes on management and it makes it hard to know who you are supposed to be reporting to and who's in charge
good,"Working as a cashier is difficult especially on our bussiest days. We dont get paid enough to work as cashiers, not only do we have to care for customers but we work with equipmemt that does not function. Thus causing lines to back up and customer complains."
good,just an average workplace 3 stars. i mostly did remodel stuff for them but i did do an occasional stocking job. blah blah blah.
good,Was very fun and interactive job. Enjoyed myself a lot. Only con i had was the managers not very good at listening to the associates about problems going on in the store. Their was only 2 managers that would actually listen and help to fix the problem.
good,"I love my job here. I have very few complaints about working for Wal-Mart. The managers out on the sales floor were a different story, but the pharmacy manager and all my co-workers really kept the atmosphere comfortable"
good,"its a good job, if you are looking for something temp.its not a career.its a really good job and if thats  what you need then go for it. Just know , thats all"
good,Usually you would be able to tell you employers that you have extracurricular activities with no concerns yet when working here it's a lot harder because they assume sometimes that your life revolves around that job. Now the people were really nice there and great to get along with and that'll be something I miss. Also when it comes to customer service most of every employee was ready to help and didn't let his/her failures discourage themselves. Overall decent place to work.
good,"Works well with moving your schedule when in college. So many changes have happened latelty with policies and such, it's a mess. Lower managers are cool, Store management not so much. Co-workers are the best. Good way to start out getting job experience, with the changes in the company hard to move up, or transfer stores, unless management wants to get rid of you. Provides benefits, but some takes a year or so to get. Customers are so-so, there are good ones and bad ones, just depends on how everyone day is. If willing to learn different things, Management jumps on and gets you there, but be prepared to be the only one doing several jobs."
good,Valorar mas  a sus colaboradores por capacidades y conocimientos
good,"I learned that every given job is difficult and needs to be taken seriously. It requires time and effort. At first, especially when you have no prior experience, it may be hard but all things can be learnt if you just work hard for it."
good,Walmart was a good environment to work in most of the times. I was a cashier which was my favorite position  I love the rush of customers lining up waiting to get their items scanned. I was the most precise and nimble cashier with a scan rate of 1080 items per hour.
good,"Management is very unprofessional due to the lack of professionalism expressed in training."
good,I had fun working there and your fellow employees where like family. The pay was terrible due to having a pay freeze which limited it to 7.25 an hour.
good,"It's a good job but not for single parent with young children. "
good,"I have been working at my current job for almost 3 years, I enjoy what i am doing and i am good at it.Sometimes it is not the best place to work because of how some managers treat their employees."
good,It started out nice when i worked in the produce section. then i became a manager and they did not properly train me and started giving me coachings on  things i wasn't shown and then i asked to step down and go back to produce and they are trying to force me to go to midnights to keep my job there.
good,"Alot of the management team like myself started out as cashiers or sales floor associates,."
good,Working at Walmart in the beginning few years was fun management would come around and ask how you are doing. The philosophy changed to how much money can be made by the company in the later years. The don't pay well only minimum wage and advancement is nearly impossible. The manager had absolutely no clue as to what I had to do on a daily basis.
good,"It's like anywhere else it's about making money and that's about it.  you good days and bad days, one day you have a full team the next three people get fired and you have to pick up the slack till they're replaced and the replacements are completely trained. you always try your best to get your work done and keep your head down."
good,"A typical day at work involved Capping backroom stock and taking it to the floor. "
good,I'm am a hard worker Great wit customer services n will do anything to make the customer happy. love working with other people. Team work helps us all work my  motto. there is no hardest part of my job.and the enjoyable part is making the customer happy
good,"Walmart companies are continuously hiring new employers every week, which makes it hard to get comfortable and settle in. The 9 hour shifts are nice though.  Once you get hired it's caring managers who will give you help when you need it. They'll show you the ropes. In conclusion Walmart is a well rounded job who has great benefits that you can build a long successful career on."
good,Good place to work. Fast paced and friendly environment. Leave your personal problems at the door. Don't become involved in the workplace drama. Be friendly with the customers. Smile
good,"Most jobs within in store are simple to do, however difficult managers is often the reason people do not stay with this company. If you are able to deal the managers this company offers good advancement opportunity."
good,It's an ok company but your coworkers will make it difficult to make it an career. Great that they expanded pay but you will get less hours.
good,overall walmart is a great place they don't really care employees and its not a place where you want to be if you go through a lot of family problems cause there is no understanding
good,I worked here for a while and it wasn't bad for a kid in high school but I definitely couldn't live off the pay they provide.
good,"this part of the job is difficult because most patients are confused about why their insurance company wont pay right away, at the beginning I had a tough time explaining when I myself wasn't clear. my coworkers and manager help me to not only learn how it works but I was able to communicate with patients"
good,"The people you work with are usually nice and cooperative. They work well as a tea. Most of the management team listen to what you have to say. The job can keep you in decent shape depending on the positions you have and how active you are in your performance. They are willing to hire disabled people(most of time)"
good,"I worked on MP5 for a year and a half and loved it. Great group of guys, great management, always something different to do. Then i transferred to DD4 and worked with some of the most lazy people i have ever met. Only half of the crew would show up every day, the managers didnt care at all, and only a few people would try to pull above production."
good,It is a good place to work and management is nice but it is only part time and there is really no place to move up here.  Also you have to work all holidays
good,"My co-workers were very nice and fun to be around. A typical day at work would consist of cleaning, greeting, and counting money. The management was pretty standard. Most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people honestly The hardest part Had to be rearranging store products to fit the managers face. I didn't really learn anything there."
good,I like working for wal-mart but after I got hurt they where looking for a reason to fire me and now it seams that I can.t get my job back because I had to hire a lawyer to fight for my work comp and now it seams that I have a red flag on my name.
good,Panera Bread was a wonderful first job! I feel that I learned a lot about customer service and interaction. If I had to work for the company again I definitely would.
good,Gave me a chance to continue paying my bills and caring for my children when out of work and over qualified. Loved working with public and other co-workers. Upper management needs to be more informed about employees needs and listen to ideas/ needs of customers that are brought to attention of workers.
good,"Pay is pretty good, job is hard but not too bad, but upper management is horrible. Firing people for small reasons and then hiring back people that should not be allowed to work there."
good,"On any given day you are bound to encounter some challenges, only issue I experienced with the job was there was no opportunity for growth. Plenty of hard working employees are looked over everyday for new comers. I believe if they hired up more within the company it would grow and thrive even more so"
good,"Wal-Mart is a productive retail setting with a family-like atmosphere. As a customer service manager, i see all aspects of front-end retail. Very customer oriented."
good,"Depending on what they needed I would start out either stocking shelves or binning overstock. If a truck was scheduled to show up I would unload the truck. Then near the end of the shift i would go out and separate pallets on the forklift. I learned how to manage time to get everything done, binning overstock, and how to use power equipment. Management was not on the same page with each other sometimes. I would have one manager tell me something then another would come by and tell me something different. Overall they were great and I am glad they the ones that was over me. My co-workers were great to work with and be around outside of work. The hardest part of the job was learning the new ways management wanted things to be done. The most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers."
good,most of the co-workers didn't engage in teamwork which left you to do many tasks by yourself and management did a poor job scheduling workers throught the day
good,"A typical day starts off with much on the list of things that needs to be done everyday. After the manager's walk, the list grows. With my department, I'm the only employer to this. Two trucks a week, that consist of at the least three skids. These skids range around six foot tall. They need to be down stacked to the right areas and then worked to the sales floor. Out to be counter daily and on hands fixed. Price changes, and displays are a daily task. The over stock needs to be binned into the proper areas and added to the computer. With the candy department, I had to deal with seasonal candy also. From Halloween to Easter, seasonal candy had to be stocked. "
good,"Good interpersonal, written verbal skills.Organized individual will exceptional follow through capabilities.Work well with a minimal supervision and in a team.Work well under pressure with an ability to multitask and meet required deadlines."
good,"There were often times when I would show up to work and find that most employees and even managers just did not care about the needs of the customer, and to be honest customer service was poor. "
good,The job is fast pace and very demanding. You need to be knowledge in all fields of electronics from television to cell phones and everything in between.
good,"Trustworthy team player, Know however to be customer service friendly, Work well with others. Hardest part of the job is not being able to fully assist customers in certain situations"
good,My typical day was working in the garden center which I liked working with flowers and being outside all day.  Coworkers were great met a lot of good people.
good,"Not to much to do but its a job of helping to organize your work space."
good,"Good for those who are new to the workforce. After years of experience, it can be tough with minimum yearly raises. The work is fairly easy but pressure comes from the top. The store manager is pressured by his boss and the pressure drops down from him or her to their assistant manager and from the assistant down to associates and so forth. Most of the work is impossible to finish on time and the pressure to finish on time or get written up for performance."
good,Fun people to work with. Management overwork employees no help or guidance. Employees at time have to guide and teach themselves the system there. Coworkers overall are fun.
good,"Unloaded trucks & always on the move running pallets out to the stockers, unloaded both trucks from warehouse to grocery side."
good,Wal mart is a great place to work if you're just starting out. I wish there was more balance in the work schedule and flexability with the management. Pay is horrible
good,Its a decent job but the management isn't very good. Co-workers are what makes the day go by fast especially in a slow paced environment like bakery. The hardest part of the job would be to find something to do when all of your work is done for the day.
good,able to make a large difference in a team environment.  Lots of red tape to go through to get things done.  This is typical of many large companies but can be frustrating when you want to move fast.
good,Walmart was a different adventure every day. Didn't know who I was working with or what the daily task was going to be. I enjoyed learning various things but some of the training was lacking and they didn't take the time to fully train me.
good,"I loved my job and what my job entailed on my front end. Being able to meet new people both associates and customers was very fulfilling. The opportunities I was given and full filled was amazing, feel good feeling."
good,Hacer partícipe a todos los empleados por igual para generar un mejor ambiente.
good,"I don't care for this company nor would I go back to work there. The job wasn't fun, it wasn't rewarding. The pay was decent for the work but that is about as far as it goes."
good,"Walmart was my first retail job. The job itself was really fun and fast paced. There was always something to do whether it was paperwork, cleaning, restocking, etc. The co-workers there were all very friendly for the most part. Occasionally different personalities would clash but that was all mostly due to the massive age differences in some of the employees. The best part about the job was the flexibility you had with your schedule and the amount of benefits you would receive after your first few months of staying. The biggest downside is the amount of pay you get versus the amount you do as a department manager after they changed the pay system the last year. It really benefitted the new employees but cut people that have been there for 5-10 years real short."
good,"Working at this Walmart was great. The associates,managers on duties make my job much easier. It was a lovely experience."
good,"Drama filled environment where people go to gossip and make your life much more stressful than it already is. Good pay, flexible scheduling. So if you can deal with that definitely worth it."
good,"overall a bad place to work Period. NO support form any management at all have a lot of do yourself with no giddiness , good co workers at time nothing to be enjoyable at all"
good,I arrive and being culling and putting out fresh product for customers to purchase. Taking out bad produce and empty boxes round out the day.
good,Walmart was a great stepping stone to kick start my life. With Walmart I was able to get an apartment and buy a new car but it's time for something new
good,"It was a fantastic opportunity and I gained a lot of experience through this opportunity. I am very grateful for the chance to grow. It was a good work environment, always a fun day at work. I learned so many special skills in sales, merchandising, customer care, and even management."
good,"A typical day at work would have the normal two to three associates arguing with each other. I learned fabrics, jewelry, apparel, stocking and cashiering. The management is alright. You could get along with most of them. Co-workers are fine. You just have to work as best you can while listening to what happened to so and so with a certain person. The hardest part of the job would probably be black Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customers. I loved meeting new people every day and recognizing the regulars."
good,"it wasn't the best job but the pay, and the benefits were awesome. I really didn't like how i had 10 different bosses that i had to report to i like simple job were you have one or two jobs and one boss and the work isn't too complicated."
good,Open availability will leave you with 27-35 hours weekly. Managers vary as each person is different and will leave you either angry or satisfied. Diverse workplace with different people
good,A normal day for me would be really busy making sure that the restrooms stayed clean for the customers and that the store is tidy the problems is thats not a guarantee because managers will have you do projects that will keep you busy and complain if you didn't keep a certain even they told that you should do it later
good,"Buen cultura laboral. "
good,"Worked for Walmart in my hometown of Waynesboro, Ms. Always enjoyed working for management there and seeing friendly and familiar faces on a daily basis."
good,"At Walmart, the better you work the more work you have assigned. Overnight keeps the store running, but is under appreciated by day-time associates. Your job is easier if you are able to manage your time wisely."
good,"There's plenty of boxes (freight) to be processed. It's shift work, so you're either working 10 hour days, 4 days a week or 12 hour days, 3 days a week. You get a 30 minute lunch break with two 20 minute breaks before and after. It takes a several weeks for you to get used to the amount of physical labor and the exhaustion it comes with it. They're big on safety, which makes since because it wouldn't take much to get injured on the job. There's quarterly ""incentives"" (bonuses) based on the success of the distribution center you're at. It's honest, hard work for those ""blue-collar"" type individuals."
good,"I enjoyed working here. It is actually easy to move up, and there are so many departments so you don't have to stay in one department. I have worked all over Walmart and I had three different positions in the four months I worked there."
good,"Managed three workers, ensured that shelves where stocked, items inventoried, displays were set up.  Interacted well with co-workers."
good,"Over all the time I've spent with Walmart have been excellent for me. I have gained so much knowledge with in the company to get promoted 2 times, from an overnight stocker to successfully running produce, deli and bakery as a department manger  and then on to Overnight Support Manger to successfully over see night operations of my store."
good,One of the largest companies that employs many employees and proovides them with equal opportunities. I enjoyed working for the walmart company
good,"It has its moments when you are proud to work here. There are a lot of great teams you could be on, unfortunately same can be said the other way. It helps if you know someone."
good,The thing i liked most about working at Walmart were my co-workers. Everyone got along just great made work go by fast and we all would help each other out if needed.
good,people did their jobs and management wasn't such a mess. No one takes responsibilty for anything and one person could be left with the work load of 4 people. It depends entirely on where you work. It's an easy job with great pay...just won't keep a person there long because of the people you work with and management
good,"I like working at Walmart because I love what I was doing. Stocking merchandise, doing counts, price changes, trained new employees, etc. Also, as a department manager, we were required to complete in stock reports, out of stock, shelf availability reports to make sure counts are correct for system to automatically order outs and what's low in stock."
good,"working at wal mart was an experience ill never forget. there were some characters working there and shopping there. always wanted to get to work to see what was going to happen that day. i was their number one go to guy in automotive. i made sure everything ran the way it was supposed to and fix others mistakes. always had great co workers there, some of which i still communicate with today. i guess the hardest part of the job was, dealing with upset customers on a day to day basis. management was fair. i had no problems what so ever."
good,"Hardest part of the job was not getting enough sleep because it was an over night shift. However, it was nice to just be left to do what you were required to do with out distractions. The manager would assign you to a department and the time it should take you to finish at the meeting and a way you went. You knew what needed to be done and when it should be done by. Management was good they would inform you of any new changes."
good,"The consistent schedule does allow opportunity to balance work and personal time. The benefits are worthy in comparison of the work. There is a weakness, however, when you have ambitious and experience individuals, they should be utilized for growth opportunity, not looked at as a threat. The business day should run the same regardless of the management overseeing the daily work load, especially when you have set daily expectations. The hardest part of the job is meeting your expectations when you have to make up for others not meeting theirs, however, I enjoy the challenge."
good,In the year and 8 months I worked here I came to know great people on my crew but the overnight management treated all of us with no type of respect. I have had only few management that is respectable that I work with
good,"A day at work is full of merchandising, managing store operations, and execution of seasonal changes.  The number one priority is to collaborate with management, who are all smart hardworking individuals,  and maximize resources to maintain instock.  The most enjoyable part of the day is making an impact in inventory turn and customer satisfaction."
good,"A normal workday, busy and under staffed. I made a lot of friends their, I  loved working with my coworkers. I also had great supervisors."
good,"While working at Walmart I learned to keep everything professional and focus on my job. Also it taught me patience, I learned not to react as quick as I used to."
good,"A typical day in electronics consist of taking care of customers, stocking the sales floor, zoning. I really enjoy my co-workers, They play a big part in the work day. We work together as a team and that  helps the work day more enjoyable and goes by fast! The hardest part of the job is when there isn't enough associates scheduled to work so everything is pretty much put on one associate (or the few associates that are there) Diling with rude customers also makes the job hard. The most enjoyed part of the job is helping customers and just being appreciated for what you've done to help."
good,"I am a worker, so I stay busy stocking, helping the customer. By staying busy helps pass the time, but standing on the concrete floors takes it toll on the body. My current supervisor is top notch worker like me and my co-workers are fantastic people. The hardest part of the job is walking on concrete day-in and day-out, and having a decent income. The most enjoyable part of my day is the people, customers, co-workers and management."
good,Not the best place in the world to work but it was a job. I worked in the bakery. I learned a lot. they did not work around my schedule I had to work every Sunday. We had one person who got Sundays off. If you asked of you might not get it.I had to do something different because I have three children
good,Wal-mart is an okay place to work while in school. They are willing to work with your school hours. It's an ok place to work until you can find something better.
good,I started off as a cashier then I was promoted and moved up to meat sales associate my position was to markdown all meat that was almost out of date throw away and scan out of dates for inventory.
good,Walmart pays extremely well but has a serious issue with taking care of its employees. Time of for immediate family deaths should be overhauled and medical issues attended to promptly.
good,"Working at Wal-mart was not a difficult or overly taxing job. They were good about working with my schedule, and willing to do so on short notice whenever possible."
good,"The day starts busy and never lets up. There is always more work"
good,"This is a decent place to work if you don't have kids or a family. I have kids of my own and my parents have had their own issues to and this company's policy on missing work is pretty much if you miss any work, even with a Dr's excuse, it is not acceptable and although they will accept the Dr's excuse, it is still used against you and considered as a non-excused absence."
good,I have worked for them twice on two separate occasions and both times i kid you not i couldn't even last a year. It had nothing to do with my work ethnic because while I was with them i always put in a ton of effort. I felt like they didn't appreciate the hard work that there employees do for them. Which they should because the company is only as good as the people employed in it. If wal-mart could put more effort into making their employees feel more worthy they could have the potential for great employment.
good,I really enjoyed working here at Walmart I've Learned So Much Now That I Can take with me on my new work journey. I've learned and conquered a lot so far and hope there's more to come.
good,"It's a good place to work but can get stressful at times. When we are fully staffed it is alright. Usually there's not enough people, and hours get cut quite often."
good,while working at Kroger you'll learn the ins and outs for the grocery retail industry on a basic level. As well as serve customers with pace and smiles.
good,Buena solo que el salario es bajo por la funcion desempeñada
good,Management was not very organized or understanding of college students needing a limited amount of hours per week. I had no time for homework because I was being scheduled more than 40 hours a week and I was supposed to have around 25.
good,Walmart was a good company to work for in the sense that there is always job security. Walmart is huge and will always employ thousands of people. I worked for them while I was pregnant and they were not very understanding. I had to stop labor six times because of their refusal to schedule me for less than 12 hour split shifts from the time I was seven months pregnant on. No doctor's note was accepted for my absences for doctor appointments. I brought notes and was told repeatedly they would put them on file but they wouldn't help with my absences. Management was less than understanding and frequently bad mouthed employees with other employees. The best part was meeting all the people who come through a walmart store on a daily basis. The worst part was management.
good,Great coworkers/environment. Hardest part of the job is the unrealistic production goals/ Management doesn't communicate.
good,"i did like this job alot until we got a new manager for my department and everything was going down hill, everyone was constantly agruing, nobody agreed on anything, very racist, the higher managers helped not one bit and everything was just going wrong, but i kept to myself and focused on my work there the whole thing because i didnt want to get in the middle of it. i loved two of my coworker, they was the best ones there, i learned alot there."
good,"The job overall wasn't bad, the only downfall is the. lack of resources available to employees, more chiefs than Indians and the ultimate failure that should be fixed is the constant changing or cut of hours with little pay"
good,"I could no longer had a flexible schedule, it made it hard to work there. I wanted to switch to night shift and my manager was not happy that I requested to work night shift and denied it. Once a manager I never met told me I couldn't be in the store while I was on break and fought with me in front of customers."
good,"There are so many different aspects of the business you can learn. I will take all of these with me to utilize at other companies. The Home Office in Bentonville, AR offers some many opportunities for advancement."
good,The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and interacting with different ethnics and being able to learn new stuff such as language food culture music.
good,Wal-Mart is a good job in general. Job requires you to be busy all day and company will not tolerate anything but. Little if anyone gets full-time or any benefits.
good,this is a great company with good benefits. basically you would arrive and then stretch as a team. you would select your pallet and start work. 2 paid 15 minutes and a 30 minute lunch.
good,"Only work here if you have the patience to deal with angry customers every day. The hours are good, there's holiday pay but the raises continue to get smaller. Management is not the best, only a few you can really have personal talks with."
good,"The best part is assisting customers and building a repertoire. Having that close connection with customers builds with each interaction and they become a familiar face to which they become friends in the work environment. Management doesn't communicate which makes it frustrating and very uneasy in the workplace. You can see the 'click' mentality amongst Management and associates which makes it unfair and challenging to work because of apparent favoritism. Like any company you have your good and bad co-workers but it seems the ones who move ahead are the ones who Management like. There isn't much training, more like learn as you go or figure it out on your own. Expressing concerns or bringing observations known seems to be shunned even though there is an Open Door Policy."
good,it was always hectic and customers where usually very rude and stole a lot and the store was very unorganized and always a mess.
good,"In the beginning, the hours were great, the pay was above average. However, they decided to give the temporary remodel crew full time positions. Which cut into my hours, making me part time. It was simple to be a cashier and I wouldn't working for them in the future. And I can't say that for majority of other jobs."
good,"I've learned how to become a better cake decorator and learned how to get over certain obstacles. The company itself is a good company to work for if you would like to go up quickly, for example become a manager, its possible."
good,pretty ok work place management no help ....corporate do not help until You are almost dead.....but if you can get through a year and keep low key you will be fine coworkers are ok they are helpful. They are way more helpful than management. The store manager is new she seems nice though. I have not really interfered with her. The HR manager is helpful ....
good,"My job duty was to stock merchandise. Mainly the food area. They had me in every department everyday. From my department to toys, electronics, unloading trucks in the back, cart pusher, janitorial. I felt like they were over working me for the pay they were giving me. Ive learned that working in a store where all the managers are clueless on what they are doing will affect your job duties. The management was horrible and rude. They rotated areas every other week trying to fix the stores problems. My co-workers were filled with joy everyday and always kept a smile on there face. The hardest part of the job was trying to do my job duties but other managers coming up to me telling me to do this and that. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we got free lunches sometimes."
good,Wal-mart is a good place to work at. It teaches you new things for when you're ready to move on to a new job lots of new things you can always do so you don't stay in the same position for long.
good,I greatly enjoyed my time at Walmart and was upset to leave to move to another state. The management team was very easy to work with and the customers were mainly enjoyable.
good,"Working at Walmart wasn't bad but neither was it the best.  I really liked my coworkers, they are all super kind and out going. The managers are amazing as well. No flexibility at all, I asked for my Sundays off and they were never given to me. I also asked for one day off due to an appointment that I could NOT miss, they didn't care."
good,"Working for walmart isn't as bad as others would think. They're very good with supporting their community. For example, walmart support associates plus their spouse further their education. Such as, get ion your High School Equivalency/ GED. And they Reimburse you up to $300."
good,"When I worked there, WlaMart was the place to work. The job was fun and management was supportive. I didnt need benefits at the time. They were great working with me around my college schedule, loved my shift, co-workers, management, and the opportunity to learn something new and be compensated for it."
good,"A typical day at work for a cashier is usually very slow. You stand around most of the time and have a few spurts of people coming in and being busy. So while their is no customers, you have to find things that keep you busy."
good,a typical day at walmart was to go in and start working and organizing everything in our departments keeping everything clean.  Working with in time constraints. i learned alot from taking things back and forth and taking care of meat productivity. the hardest part overall for me was being in the cold freezer. my co workers treated me fairly and helped me when i needed it. the most enjoyable part of the job getting to assist customers.
good,"Working at Walmart is not a job for the overly ambitious. The work is doesn't vary much. That being said, the difficulty level is low and as long as you work hard, they will advance you and recognize you for that. Management and the co-workers are friendly and easy to get along. It simply wasn't the right place for someone who wants to advance higher up the food chain."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. I truly enjoy being in a position of helping others.  I was able to get a good idea of what a career would be like with this organization.
good,"its always busy day"
good,"i have nothing to say work was work and that was it"
good,This is NOT the job for anyone who needs weekends off. We no longer get paid holidays either. We get our schedules out 3 weeks ahead of time so we can plan stuff.
good,"Working at Walmart was a good experience, I learned how to run a register and deal with customer service skills. I grew as a person with my patience and my communication skills. Walmart has furthered me as an employee to benefit many other companies."
good,"The customers are a pain in the butt, but other than that its a pretty straight forward job. It's ok I guess. They tell you to keep plugging the MasterCards"
good,"A day at Walmart is always busy and full of tasks, but think of all the people you help and serve a day! And their hours are reasonable, sometimes they will work around your schedules with different jobs or if you're in school."
good,"Great place to work at. Management works well with others and knows how to manage associates at location. I have personally learned a lot at Walmart in the back office position. I would recommend others, who are currently interested in Walmart to look further for eployment."
good,"walk into work and no one is ever just standing around. there is always something to do. fill prescriptions, enter data, answer the phone, put away returns. customer service it what I learned the most working in this retail environment."
good,"most co-workers liked to complain over the littlest things for example it was 93 degrees outside and I went to get a bottle of water and when I got back the guy tells ""I've been out here for an hour and I see you with a bottle of water I'm done"""
good,"Shockingly this place was not too bad to work for, I quit only because I was having trouble being homeless, coping with my husbands death and didn't have transport out to the store. "
good,Walmart is not a bad company but there scheduled hours are not ideal.  They pay well and that is how they keep there employees otherwise there turnover rates would be much higher.  The management team is sub par at best.
good,"A typical day at work is fun,engaging with fellow employees about Our Families.  I have learned about the liquor store and the many liquors which I researched to be more informative when asked questions about a particular item.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people be it customers or employees."
good,"Have enjoyed my time at Walmart but feel for personal reasons at this point in my life I really need a job with set hours. Very busy store, great place to work if you have a lot of energy. Opportunity to move up and within the company."
good,"The way things are run at this Walmart are less than up to par. People who have been working here for years are getting their hours cut drastically so, that the new comers can have more hours."
good,"It was an ok place to work, but some of the management there for night shift was horrible.  Some of the higher ups sat on their butts when there was freight that needed to be worked on before the end of their shift"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, I enjoyed my job, but I feel like I was treated unfairly there because of a medical condition that I couldn't control."
good,"My time at Walmart was as quite enjoyable. There were fun,caring,and hard working associates which made it a joy to come to work and be apart of some thing like that."
good,they put more work on you than a person could do for a small amount of pay. And did not do enough training and the supervisers had an attitude.
good,My typical day at wal-mart was driving around fork lifts and stocking aisles with products to be shipped out of the freezer department. I learned how to scan products and load and unload shelves at very high heights. Management was horrible. They didn't train properly or explain to you when you are in your interview that there might be days that you have to work sixteen to eighteen hour days and then  go home sleep for four or five hours and come back in to do it all over again. They tell you when you are hired that you are hired for four ten hour days but that defiantly wasn't the case. Co-workers at wal-mart some were great they would help and answer questions that you may have and then there were others who were there to help themselves and that was it. The hardest part of my job was learning how to do my job properly without proper training in hopes that you didn't get wrote up and fired before you actually knew how to do your job properly. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to just go in and work do my ten hours for that day and go home.
good,"The job itself was good but the Management itself is where most issues where at."
good,Working at Walmart was very exciting experience for me however i would love to have a job that recognize my ability and acknowledge my accomplishments
good,not a bad place to work could pay you a little more there the management is ok but sometimes that won't help you it hard to move up in the company they do not treat people fair
good,in an average day would go in finish up any inventory do price change  resets customer service working with vendors  co workers were good management was always in and out so it was hard to get to work with them loved my job there coud of used a lot more help 1 person in grocery during day is not enough
good,coworkers would disappear for long periods of time and when they clocked back in from break they would continue to site in the break from for about half a hour
good,They forget to give people breaks at times. I also wish they could make getting raises easier than what they currently have.
good,Walmart was a very productive place of employment. During my time there i was responsible for carts and providing excellent customer service while working the floor. Management was decent and fair and my co workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the hard labor in some extreme weather conditions at times it could tend to be exhausting. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to interact with different customers and provide assistance with whatever it is they needed.
good,management is always there to help if they can and most associates are friendly and helpful.  Great customer service experience.
good,"Walmart was a complicated place to work.Working in the produce department, you had like 5 different department managers directing you at all times and the managers never discussed anything to each other which left us employees strung in departments we were never trained in."
good,"I learned a lot working at Wal-Mart Pharmacy. The pay could be a lot better. The management needs improvement greatly. The hardest part about the job in some of the customers. Some customers can be extremely rude, but you have to be able deal with hard circumstances. I reply to those who are rude with a smile."
good,It will teach you lots of the do's and don'ts of the industry. The management is supportive and willing to teach. Never a shortage of work to do!
good,"Walmart is a great place for students needing flexible schedule. Learned skills in many areas of retail, money handling, customer service."
good,I learned that I was meant to do something more with my skills. i need to be in a place where i can be creatative.
good,Walmart was an okay employer to work for. They hired quickly and required you to learn on the job with little training. The do increase pay quickly as well.
good,"Aprendí de todas las personas, conoces la vida de la mayoría y lo problemas de cada uno."
good,"I loved the job, as a cashier. I loved working with my coworkers and helping customers on a daily basis. But having such a wild schedule, and lack of hours was not a good thing for someone trying to make a living. They need to be more clear on their new attendance policy. It doesn't matter if your absence is because of a trip to the ER, it still counts as an occurrence. We were only told we were allowed 9 occurrences within 6 months. I had 7, because I had several trips to the ER and my daughter's trips to the ER, which led to us discovering heath conditions that we got under control. I didn't miss any more days until my mother passed away. Then I took a bereavement leave. When I returned from that, I was called into the HR office. They told me I had 10 occurrences. After I reminded them about the bereavement leave, they deducted those days, leaving the 7. Then told me I was only allowed 4 occurrences during the first 6 months. That was never told to me or any of the new-hires. It was not on the site. Not until the day they fired me. It suddenly appeared on the site."
good,"work nearly every holiday, no overtime, great 401k.   Management makes good money but not hourly associates. promotions are competitive and usually not given to the most deserving associate."
good,"I enjoyed the old Walmart where they valued their customers, cared for their employees, and advanced the right people wanting to move up in the company. All in all I really liked working there the people you meet were great, I just don't think your treated fairly at all."
good,nice place to work if you know most of the managers well other than that good luck because its alot of favortism and funny acting eviornment when it comes to co workers.
good,"Fixing and breaking recliner chairs for the handicapped"
good,setup and moving stock from the business days before                       i learned the setting of an warehouse envoriment                                  in my opinion 8 mangers giving you orders is little too much                  might be sometimes the physical labor part of job                                       the people your co workers down to earth
good,it is a great place too work fun nice people can move up in the comp grate place for family and friends if u like to work grate place great benfits and good people to work with
good,"High volume fast paced management career. Supervising a team of salaried managers, as well as large team of hourly associates. "
good,"The hard part is I was hired on for seasonal, I was able to stay after the seasonal work. But than I had medical issues with my pregnancy and after my pregnancy that made me not able to go back. It was a great place to work but they would not allow my restrictions at the Wal-Mart I worked at"
good,walmart is a good place to start and learn how to handle customer service and build character because there you find some of the most disgusting and rude customers.
good,"Al comprometerte con los empleados formas un buen equipo y se sienten valorados dentro de el,por lo cual es poco probable que abandonen la empresa."
good,"Walmart provides a tremendous amount of opportunity to advance from hourly ranks. As a Co-Manager you are responsible for the daily operation of the facility and the performance of the facility on all metrics. There is not one part of the job that is difficult, what makes the job hard is everything together and ensuring that all people issues are resolved, deadlines are met, sales plans achieved, profit plans achieved, and customer experience metrics are in line with there they are supposed to be at. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to teach, train, and develop the associates."
good,"Most days are very busy. I learned immunization and CPR. Management can always be up and down, but they must follow policy procedures, so sometimes a little overwhelming. I got along with all my co-workers and everyone had their part to do daily to function as a team. The hardest part of my job was being able to interact more with customers due to high volume prescriptions and the telephone lines constantly ringing. the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help customers understand their medications and their importance to the customers' health."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. They offer on the job training. They have a different shifts to work. You work with great people and help customers.There is opportunity to advance in the company.
good,"Il y a une belle dynamique au sein du groupe d'employés."
good,For a year at Wal-Mart in Garden Center was very hot and busy.I learn to make transactions and find code for soil and plants. Anytime I need a lunch break the co workers help out. the hardest working with returning items from customers. The most enjoyable helping the customers.
good,"There is not much to say about being a cashier at walmart when you are 17/18. It's job, but the people are usually friendly, unfortunatley the customers may not be. That is a standard fact of retail though."
good,Logistics is a good place to earn a living and to learn new skills. Overall the work itself was hard but made worth it by the excellent pay and benefits.
good,its a great job if you want to stay in one position for a long time. honestly if you aren't best friends with management there's no room for you to grow. it doesn't matter how good you are at your job or how great you would be if promoted because management already knows who they want and will make it happen for them not you.
good,As a young associate I feel that job security here is really limited and even though i like the culture of the organization its sometimes hard to balance work and life with the arrangement of the work schedule.
good,"its a good company but its up to the higher managment team to keep it going"
good,"Typically busy during the day and less busy at night shifts. A typical day consists of zoning, stocking, cashing and helping costumers out."
good,"Busy, sometimes very hecked it. The job was very impossible at times trying to keep the floors clean and the restrooms done. There were a lot of spills to clean up and keep the every thing clean and stocked."
good,My most enjoyable part of the job was my co-worker They are hard worker. There was not a hard day. A typical day is unloading and loading trucks. Working at Walmart made me a better leader.
good,"Pour toute personne ayant le désire d'apprendre, WalMart offre plusieurs possibilité de grandir et de se surpasser. Ne pas avoir peur du risque, car tout s'apprend avec un peu de volonté..."
good,"Management  hmmm.. is all about favortism ."
good,customer service was my primary job I worked in many areas of the store and they all called for excellent customer service
good,Working at Walmart has its perks but a lot of down falls. The entire store from salaried managers to associates is like a high school. everyone is in everyone's business. Management sucks ! They only look out for themselves. you as an associate is priority zero. They expect you alone to move mountains in minutes like your some kind of magician. Every associate is P/T because they don't want to give more than 32 hours. if you've been there long enough and fought to be full time you cant pass 40 hours per week. If you go over time before your pay period ends you have to cut it by taking a double lunch.
good,"Met very hardworkers and a nice inviroment 85% of time. Managers ,Co Managers and support Managers. Customers as well. Pace and freight was very physical draning at sertant days,nights and Holidays. Enjoyed be in motion and the activity this job requires. Thank you, for this opportunity."
good,expectations of the management team is very demanding.  I work very long days and the pressure to maintain a very strict outbound schedule is ever present.  The management co-workers are some of the best and teamwork between them is very good.
good,Working at Walmart has brought me a lot closer to people. I enjoy helping the customers and seeing the appreciation that they give when I am helping them. Making the customers visit to Walmart enjoyable makes me feel good about working at Walmart.
good,"You have to be an adult to work here. They get every penny out of you that they pay. Long hours, hard work, and most of the time you work with hard headed people. But not the worst place to work."
good,every day was a different day but always filled with excitement. Had great time helping and serving customers. never a dull moment. learned a lot of different things.
good,I love the company but where i`m now is poorly ran.  I do enjoy the associates i oversee.  I dont like how management is treated or talked down to.  We run the company.
good,"learned good customers services skills."
good,I assit cutomers with getting groceries and I alsostock shelf with groceries or I fold clothes put things back in aisliles they belong greet customers at entrance of store
good,"overall good days working with the public interesting.If you have good management its great.And my co workers love them all.The hardest part of my job nothing,working with the public and making people smile."
good,"The job pays well and most of the people are great Associates."
good,"I filled prescriptions, put in orders, put in insurance. I liked this part of the job. I like working at a desk doing customer service handling paperwork, insurance, billing etc. "
good,The company has a lot of room for learning.  They need to take into consideration  a individual's work ethic and not so much a ratio status
good,"The job itself was wonderful, always busy and challenging. I enjoyed the customer interactions and the challenges of the job."
good,Productive work place if you need to work. However when it comes to benefits for employees it can be compensated differently.
good,Easy job with decent pay and schedule. Managers are okay and reasonable. Typical day would be scanning bins that holds the merchandise in the backroom and then taking it out to the salesfloor to work to the shelf.
good,When you need money for your till or a customer wants to speal wioth the manager it takes at least 10 minutes to even get ahold of a managwer and even longer for the manager to come over and solve the problem. None of the merchandise is on the right shelf or in the right spot so the customers are upset when the proce of their item doesn't ring up to what it said on the shelf where they got it from.
good,"Very organized business with easy to get along employees. Turn over is high so training is a must at all times, but always full staffed."
good,"management need to stop favoring other employees. some of the rule are harsh especially the attendance. but over all its not a bad job"
good,"My experience with Walmart is that management is very generous with most hourly associates, but are quick to point fingers at each other. Department managers usually wind up taking the fall as they are management thus can be held accountable but are the bottom level of management so they have nobody to push the blame onto bellow them. Management does not communicate well in most stores (three of the four I've worked at). Walmart is a company that is highly successful but spends most of its time trying to convince stores that they are failing."
good,"My overall opinion is that I do not think Wal-mart is a bad place to work if your just starting out. However if you are trying top make a living, I would suggest a job that pays more/"
good,"I worked with walmart as contract based, my team was very friendly and had lot communication with them in all the aspects. Good job envirnoment."
good,Good stable company to work for.  Flexible hours and competitive pay.  Friendly atmosphere. Always room for advancement and growth with the company.
good,"A variety of experience and overall knowledge for customer service, and job duties. Mostly friendly associates. Great for part time and a first time job, horrible for making a living as the pay is disgustingly low."
good,"Encarregado tem muitas atribuições diárias, mas a empresa tem ótimas propostas de cargos e salários"
good,"Horrible Management, being lied to, talked down to, bad attitudes towards employees and customers"
good,The work u hard they give good breaks the offer incentive food coffe not a bad place to work some friendly  faces good management  poor costumer service
good,"Working at the courtesy desk entails that you are quick on your feet and ready for just about anything. You complete tasks anywhere from a simple return, to a purchase order or even transferring money through western union."
good,"Walmart is a successful and strong company to work for.  They have great growth opportunities and recently adjusted their pay scale to be a leader in ensuring their employees are compensated appropriately."
good,"For a Manager Walmart can provide security and opportunity."
good,"The people at Walmart were fun and energetic.The hours we also very flexible, nothing too overwhelming.  Overall, a positive experience."
good,"The routine is the same every night, however it's always interesting. You stay busy with customers and work needed to be done."
good,The structure is different from a super center and is still under review for best practices.I try to learn something new everyday.There has been a lot of management changes.Making sure everyone has the tools they need to succeed.Providing great customer service.
good,"Overall is a great place to work; however, it does depend on the management you have they can make or break your career at the company."
good,Rewarding place to work and learn. Fun at times. Culture not as good as used to be. Leans to outside forces diluting core company principles. Has already and will continue to hurt company in the future.
good,Working at walmat can be quite stressful. I have learned to adopt to the environment because i have worked in different departments. I also get along well with my fellow co-workers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult customers that don't understand walmart polices and think everything should go there way. The most enjoyable part about walmart is when they appreciate your work and commend you for it and also the best part is receiving a bonus every three months.
good,on a typical day at work i walk around and look for shoplifters. This position is very team oriented and can be difficult at times. The hardest part of the job is seeing all the elements we have to see before we stop someone. I enjoy the interaction with the people more than anything.
good,I enjoyed working at walmart because they didnt leave me in one spot for very long. i am a quick learner so i was moved to various areas of the store.
good,"My day consist of checking customers out,which i did enjoyed. Helping out where they might need me. Stocking, cleaning and working in other departments. I learned a lot of different things. Management was ok,it was always different managers.Co-workers were fun to work with and be around. the hardest part was dealing with rude people. I'm a nice person so that what i like dealing with. I really enjoyed my customers."
good,"As a sales associate, each day is a different day. You're always making sure there is nothing on the floor that could cause an accident with a customer, associate, or you. Cleaning and zoning your department is 100% done by the end of your shift. Also, if its super busy in the front end, you help out as a back-up cashier. On a daily basis, you're giving customer service either on the phone, on the floor, or on a register."
good,"Working at Walmart, they like to change your schedule around and schedule you outside you availability. The co workers are friendly and nice; the breaks were great. I only wish they would fix the schedules and give their employees more hours if they want it."
good,"Walmart is  a retail store that gives employment to a lot of people."
good,Good work environment and co workers but bad management. Would recommend as a first time job. Learn basic customer service and how to read and stock products.
good,It's walmart. I worked there as a teenager and young adult. Not a forever job. Management from time to time is not the best and coworkers love the drama. Got away as soon as I could.
good,"Empresa muito boa para quem procura crescimento profissional pois existem oportunidades para as mais diversas áreas, porém no meu caso eu estava diretamente ligado ao Diretor da unidade e como a carga horária deste tipo de cargo era extremamente alta eu era ""obrigado"" a acompanhar esse mesmo ritmo, inclusive aos finais de semana, assim não sobrava quase tempo para minhas realizações pessoais e meus projetos, como estudo e lazer."
good,"A typical day starts out on the grocery side to stock freight on the sales floor for 1-2 hours. After that, the general merchandise sales associates would go to the GM side to stock returns, assist customers on the floor, and zone the merchandise on the shelves. If we got done with the GM side, we would zone the consumables side until our shift was done. "
good,Walmart cares more about the company itself and it doesn't value workers as human beings. What I liked about working in WalMart was  when I was assistant manager. I was able to see how the company runs.
good,Walmart expects alot and gives little. Alot of people that advance are  who you know by others opinions. I personaly don't know as I never tried for a higher position. I will say the manager walked with her assistance and would yell at them infront of hourly employees making it difficult for the assitants to get the respect they deserved. They also had little care for the employee as a person.
good,"Inventory Management."
good,"Day starts by walking from clocking in, to the tilt which you will be in for rest of the day. Greeting co-workers and customers just showing a little appreciation. One of my favorite thing is learning new experiences, skills and mass general education. As a wal-mart cashier, I learned it's difficult to sell master cards to customers and also learned, people don't know what they want till you give them a idea of it. managers didn't treat the employees like robots, they had a relationship with them. enjoyable part of the work is working with well developed individuals that help you grow each and everyday."
good,I was in college at this time as a mom and married adult. The hours were convenient and the work was very enjoyable. I am a person-centered individual which made working with the clients fun for me.
good,"I was excited about working for one of the worlds largest retailers, and i fit in just fine. I enjoyed the environment and the availability of work hours as well. I got injured on the job and I am eligible to return."
good,"I spent most of my day on the floor filling the shelves and helping customers. For the most part our department ran smoothly and everybody knew their role and did it to the best of their ability. It was difficult to meet the standards of the department because of lack of product and a poorly organized backroom. However, The people I worked with were fun to work with and we kept each other going with positive attitudes and teamwork. Management was very nice and easy to get a long with. While working at Wal-mart I got to see the differences in their operations compared to other grocery stores. Their employees did their jobs, but their was too much product in the backroom and it was disorganized."
good,"not really good with schedule, work would be long sometimes forgot break, bosses can be rude, customers are sweet and will lift your day up"
good,Never enought sales floor associates or cashiers. Constntly having to be reactive instead of proactive. Your daily routine should be called chaos because there is no daily routine.
good,"un ambiente de trabajo muy bueno, conoces nuevas personas y vives nuevos momentos, pero el salario es muy bajo"
good,"un dia tipico, llegar fichar saludar a mis compañeros,retirar mi fondo diario, verificar que este completo, dependiendo de la cantidad de clientes en el local se abre una caja para agilizar la atencion de los cliente o bien se cubre el descanso de algun compañero."
good,"I  worked  on cash opening and closing shifts .We promoted the credit card. We worked at a high pace ,scans per order. I  relieved other people on cash  for breaks .We had to tidy work area.I feel we worked well as a team. I feel they have turnover in staff because of the way people are treated."
good,"Job consisted of unloading trucks which was really hard on my back, especially in the holiday season when trucks were doubled. pay was decent."
good,"Early morning's we would sign off what products we received and if we were missing certain products, Then we would grab all the shipment and begin to stock them upon the shelves. Afterwards we would begin to zone aisles looking for a mess or something that was in the wrong place before busy hours to get our department ready for customers. Throughout the day I would greet customers and asked if they needed any assistance. Once I finished helping the customer I would ring them up at the cashier. Then the process would repeat. My first weekend there they needed help up at front end because our cashier's were not available so they decided to send the new associates to help out. Slow days were dreadful because if you didn't look busy, they would send you somewhere else. Busy days can get really crazy since there are only two registers at the electronics. Hardest part of the job so far has been explaining to a customer a product that I have yet to learn about. Other then that I love putting smile's on the customer's faces. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful when they are around. Management, is hard to explain. sometimes I see my Manager and sometimes I can't find them. Haven't worked here long enough to form my own opinion just yet. Worst day was after completing CBL's there was no training and they told us to head to our departments. We had no numbers for the cashiers and both co-workers who had numbers took there one hour lunch break at the same time during busy hours. Debated whether to walk out due to extreme stress for not being able to help customers."
good,"Most days I am a cashier so I encounter many types of people and many situations. I ring there items, collect money, bag their items and usually go above my duties to place the bagged items back into the cart for them. Management is friendly but not always understanding. The hardest part for me is the constant schedule changes and not getting enough hours."
good,"A typical day on the overnight crew was stocking shelves for the Dairy Department, then binning merchandise back into the stores inventory."
good,"big corporation, did not like the hours. loved my co workers. did not like working holidays since i am a single mother it was hard. no sick time did make it hard"
good,Wal mart is a great company to work for . They are many benefits and opportunities for the employee . Sadly I had a bad experience with management and it wasn't only me that I would complain about management. I believe that managers and supervisors should treat people with respect so the employee will take them seriously and there is not conflict in the work place .  My co-workers will help each other to make our job faster and easier for everyone . The hardest part of the job was having management screaming at my face all the time because I forgot to tell the customer about our survey. I have learned that you can't trust people too much and you have to be careful what you say because it can be use against you.
good,Learned allot more on security at walmart and that you can't judge a book by its cover. co-workers was cool and to themselves as well as management. Management wasn't present all the time but all in all ok.
good,not much room to move up was a privately owned store. management was easy to get along with had every weekend and night off. learned many different roles while working her
good,"Co-workers and management are helpful and friendly, there's is a lot more to being a good APA than previously knew. I have learned about another side of the customer service industry."
good,"Company closed to home. A busy store, co-workers are very"
good,Casi no tienes vida personal y para algun permiso se ponen demaciado pesados.
good,worked with company 24 years. has changed a lot. hours have been reduced. benefits are average. its an average place to  work.
good,"Chez Walmart, j'ai appris à être efficace et travailler rapidement tout en évitant les erreurs. J'ai pu cotoyer plusieurs type de clients au tempéraments différents qui m'ont permis de faire fleurir ma patience et de développer mes compétences sociales."
good,"At Wal-Mar I the work  very hard, they are understaffed and there is very little time for breaks, there is no full time hire , and there is very little flexibility."
good,"Years ago, I worked for this company and I was still a student in high school. I had to be out of there by 10, so they said, but there were nights I would not get home till nearly 11:15. The management team directly above me was horrible, inconsiderate, and hardly had a smile the whole time I could remember. Not only that, but they did not care about their cashiers. I can recall on several occasions that I was left with a line of customers while I needed manager override or change from the cash drawer (which usually took about 10 minutes, God willing.)"
good,Pas aussi terrible que ce qu'on dit. J'ai été bien accueillie et bien formée.
good,I think they need to pay more for the job that we do and they need to transfer the people that want to transfer to different department
good,got to work listened to the mananger at the meeting then went and stock or zoned a register til it was time for me to check customers out then break then back to register then sorting returns then lunch then back to returns zoning again or checking people out then break again then checking people out zoning sorting retuns then leaving
good,"A fast paced busy day with good team work."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Walmart.  Everybody was very nice.  They could have paid a bit more, but it was what it was.  I don't know what else to say it was Walmart."
good,"My experience at Walmart was quite an experience in the best way possible. I was introduced to qualities as a good customer service representative. I learned that the customer is always  right, and our main focus is to satisfy the customer, Being apart of receiving was fun, because whatever wasn't being found on the sales floor was definitely found in the backroom and they gave me an opportunity to retrieve it and satisfy a customer. I loved every moment of it."
good,"In a typical day of a Walmart employee, I have a lot of tasks to do, I ring up customers, give and take money,and clean up around the registers. When I am not at my register I stand at the end of it to pull in customers or when it is slow I go to apparel and fix the clothing racks."
good,"Non-Conveyable A-2/BreakPack:  While using power equipment and with minimal supervision; fill store orders, maintain freight inventory, organize warehouse. Comply with all company guidelines and safety standards."
good,My typical day at Walmart is helping customers with return also answering phones and transferring calls. Learned how to talk with angry customers and get everyone satisfied . Management was great there . Hardest part of the job is helping everyone during back to school time. The most enjoyable time at work is storming days at work nearly any customers there
good,A very fixed and flexible work schedule. I have learned that team work at this job goes a long way. There are know benefits if you are part time. Yearly raises based on yearly reports.
good,the best thing about working in Walmart was the co workers they help you on what you need help. every day was doing the same thing but sometimes you got to do something different and learn something new. working with the management it was hard because every one wanted something different.
good,"Days go by fast, but you have to work very hard. I've learned to find enjoyment at work to make the day go by faster. I laugh with my co-workers and really enjoy helping the customers. The hardest part of my job is lifting boxes over 50lbs. The most enjoyable part of my job is the team that I work with and the customers that frequent the store."
good,All my co workers are hard workers and we work great as a team.I feel valued by the customers service managers and i am rewarded for a job well done. The hardest part of the job is rude customers who act out when they do not get what they want. With a good group of co workers i was able to deal with these troublesome customers in a professional manner.
good,I worked at Walmart for 8 years. In my time the company went from a happy place to work with plenty of optional overtime to no overtime allowed and most people were unhappy with their job and management. The focus was centered solely on profit. I can say there are many great people that work there but not a company focused on a good working environment while making profit.
good,"too many changes overall, lack of communication with employees from management, family oriented, good benefits, can be cold in the winter, and hot in the summer"
good,"When I was scheduled to work, i would scan my badge in a price check scanner and it will send me to an open register. i would barely have any contact with a manager and when i did, it was not a good experience. The managers were never on the same page. One time i was going back and forth from register to register because one manager wanted me there in register ""25"" and the other manager wanted me in register ""10"". Also i was never trained. I was left at a register by myself on the first day. When i would ask for a manager for help, most of the time they do not show up."
good,you worked when you came. breaks are always late and the holiday are atrocious due to unprepared staff. They very rarely provided any type of recoginition. i do not want to bash walmart so i think asking me to speak about and employers is crossing the line
good,"A hectic day at work is a typical one. The particular store I was at had solid staff whom seemed determined to keep everyone on board, but at their same level. For some reason, corprate thought we needed to cut down on payroll, but the store was at a skeleton crew at best. They do toss you around where you are needed most, as anywhere that is different than your typical area is better every now and again. All in all, however, I would prefer to not work there again, as they don't look at you for a transfer to a different department or higher position until you have lost the will to work in that store in the first place."
good,"Ring people up, and go to break that was it. I just rung people up talk to them order change, occassionally push buggies or do whatever else i needed to do. It's laid back."
good,My typical work day would consist of folding and organizing clothes. Mangers needed improvement. Training methods needs improvement as well.
good,"You get your averaged angry customers who don't get there way most of the times. Then you get you average nicer customers that enjoy their shopping at Wal-Mart. I know that you have to be very patience with all customers, no matter what mood they are in. The management is a total bum. They try to help the very best they can, but sometimes they are not reliable. The people I work with can be a little annoying, but dealing with a job like Wal-Mart you have to learn to get along and work together. I think the hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers. Most of the time you can deal with and calm down an angry customer, but when you can't everything just turns ugly for everybody. The thing I enjoy most about my job is the compliments I get daily. I love providing the best service to my customers."
good,"i love working at Walmart the pay not all that great, but i worked at 2 different Walmart and they have a really good family."
good,"i learned quite a bit while working at walmat, but it is definitly not a friendly work environment. the supervisors have their ""favorites"" and treat the rest like dirt. and the supervisors are the biggest gossips."
good,great people and staff. challenging customers. great working with my co workers on projects and accomplishing difficult task.
good,"great place customers , employees, love helping people deing a cashier was a great experience for me to learn new things"
good,"Great promotion potential, not so great work/life balance."
good,"Worked at Walmart as a meat and sales representative. Counted stored and stock product in the meat department. I would bring lunch from home and they would have a nice refrigerator, microwaves and coffee makers to utilize during lunch breaks."
good,I have worked for walmart for 13 years and have seen a lot of changes.  Walmart's pay has gotten better over the years and it provides you a lot of opportunity to work your way up and grow professionally.  There 401k and stock plans are pretty good.
good,"Usually steady work pace."
good,"My work day is fast paced, upon arriving you are assigned to a cash register. And will start working through the line until your next break, they are persistent on employers taking their 15 mins break and 1 hour lunch."
good,"working here was fun at times, talking with customers was fun and taught me a lot."
good,"People are really good.  Lots of change and new programs all the time.  Very Busy never board.  "
good,a typical day at Walmart wasn't such a good experience Walmart was really segregated and racist and they treated us badly
good,"There was only one real problem I had with this job and It was Work and Life Balance. I felt as if they do not care that you have a life outside of work and while I was working here my life literally revolved around my job. Besides That I loved this job, Knew everybody worked with the same people every night and Its a pretty simple job. However it can be a bit overwhelming. They do have there bbq's and  lunch ins once in a while as well as Bonus pay. Although they base the bonus on how many hours you worked, and tend to cut them back for you a week before your bonus. I guess it just depends on who you work for."
good,"The job was fun, I enjoyed my department and the people I worked with. It is long day, but you get enough breaks to compensate. The customers are great, but you will get the stinkers that will just ruin the day. And management is fine at best, sometimes you wonder how someone got the position but other times they are capable of doing their job."
good,"Most of the time I worked in the garden center and help customers find items within the store. Water plants, stock shelves, printing price stickers and zone. One of the values I got while at Walmart was helping and assisting others. the most challenging part of the job was keeping my job assignments up while making sure to offer good customer service."
good,People at work are friendly. Management is inconsistent with their policies. Low wage increase encourage employee to quit and move forward.
good,"You basically come into 24-7 Intouch - Walmart.com. They give you a 1 week training on the downstairs floor before posting you upstairs on the main floor using the phones and computers. You come into work, get your systems and programs all logged into and then wait for the calls to come in. Many calls have to do with ""Where's my order?"", ""My package arrived damaged."", ""I received the wrong item."", ""I ordered a PUT (pickup Today) and I never got a notice."", ect. Your job is to be able to answer these and other types of questions in a matter of timing. No more then 7 minutes per call if possible and to push email surveys out to them to get your score ratings in on your customer service."
good,A typical day would be clock in then go to the assigned register I was placed and just continuously ring people up. I learned a lot about working there. I learned customer service and patience and how to deal with money. Plus the computer setup. Management was really good about how they managed the front end. My coworkers were really nice. The hardest part of the job was when customers got rude and ugly but using my customer service techniques I was able to help them.
good,Walmart was a very interesting place to work with great people. however their is a huge communication barrier between management and the associates. I have requested time off countless times only for it to be completely ignored along with my availability. They also had a big issue with people calling in sick and countless employees have been written up because they were sick.
good,Not a lot of company morale.  Break room very quiet no one talks to each other.  Didn't seem to have much to offer the employees for incintives
good,"I worked with great people and gained a lot of experience, but Walmart has low pay and benefits are pretty much non existent unless you're a salary employee."
good,"There is a large yearning for leadership and training."
good,No había crecimiento laboral el trato como empleados era mínimo aparte de que no te capacitaban
good,Stocking shelves and joking around with co-workers. The management was good with working with you. Hardest part was to fully stock.
good,"In a typical day of work at Walmart, the day would start off relatively slow, starting off by greeting my management, and associates. I would then walk my backroom then make my way to the sales floor. After my walk through I would establish notes/goals to be met for the day, which would then be relayed to my team. While my associates started on key points of work for the sales floor, I would begin breaking down and sorting the freight that would come in from the     previous evening's truck. After the freight had been successfully put away I would then join my team on the sales floor, and help with the final adjustments to the points of interest. Around this time, upper management would then give me any additional notes for the day that would need be complete by the end of my shift."
good,"I had a fair experience at Walmart. Despite of the random personalities that come with the job, the employer does provide their employees with great benefits and the ability to achieve their future goals and career paths."
good,"La cultura que maneja  la empresa es muy buena siempre y cuando sea cumplida como lo dice su misión y visión."
good,"Okay job, with a little bit of benefits.  The pay was not very good for the kind of work performed as an adult.  Good job for young people to get some experience in the working world."
good,enjoyed working pay was low management was cheap but hours were reliable was always busy and job was fun. owners have switched since employment
good,started out as a floor employee for the toy department. then became a cashier and worked my self into a department manager for the shoe department. the job had work to keep you busy all times of the year which was nice. working with my co workers was great. the job felt family orientated.
good,"A typical day at work would be ringing items for costumers, discounts purchases with coupons, and collecting several different kind of payments like credit cards, checks, foodstamps, and wic also making sure my work area and the shelves are clean, in order and safe."
good,"day at work - intense"
good,"Management is divided: half are very nice/get almost everything done, the other half is extremely rude/doesn't do anything except walk around on their phones and yelling at people telling them what to do all day. I was almost never in the department I was hired to be in because we were short-staffed nearly 95% of the time, and we were short-staffed so often because management wouldn't hire the necessary staff. Most of the time I was OK with helping elsewhere, but I would argue with management if they asked me to go help unload the truck. Everyone back there always seems to be so angry, during the summer it's blazing hot, during the winter it's freezing cold."
good,"Walmart is a huge company, and middle management is not well-trained to keep employees happy and satisfies, leading to large turnover."
good,A typical day was pretty much trying to sell the Walmart master-card and ring in sales. Also if there were discounts I would apply those as well as putting through the sale items and changing them to the desired price. I did not necessarily enjoy the management. I liked everyone except one manager. She wasn't really that nice and wasn't someone that I could talk to about fixing my schedule and was the reason to why I left since she was not reasonable. The hardest part of the job was to sell the Walmart master-card. I enjoyed being able to speak to the customers because I am a very sociable person as well as I loved my co workers.
good,"Working for this company at that particular store wasn't a bad experience. A typical night of work was the same as it was every night. Stock, and then zone shelves. I learned how to use electric equipment, such as the electric pallet jack and walkie-stacker, how to stock a shelf and zone it properly, among other miscellaneous things such as how to use a hand-held scanner. Management was strict but fair, my co-workers were very much team players, with exception of a choice few. The hardest part of my job was when holidays when we recieved more freight than usual, but it was never too much than we could handle. Only one night did we have to push unworked stock into the backroom. The most enjoyable part was the sense of accomplishment that you felt when you successfully stocked your part of the store, that you were a sturdy piece of a jig-saw puzzle."
good,"Manager is rude. A lot of the time days were short handed because the manager actually gets a bonus for not hiring extra associates, and if we were not short handed it was the associates that were only kept for their 90 period."
good,"Wonderful people to work with, especially starting out as just hired, great bonuses and raises, flexible in changing shifts and preparing for time off."
good,It needed better management and it took them a month to contact my references. The job wasn't what I expected it to be and it wasn't willing to work with me when I went on maternity leave. I learned not to work anywhere with poor management.
good,"Walmart Distribution is physically demanding and can be a very stressful place to work. Everyone has production goals to make for the day, week, and month. I worked here for a year and a half, and in that time, you really learn what your capable of."
good,"During a shift one would expect to take care of customers as well as maintain work station. The best part about the job would  be how fast paced it can get, as well as how short the shift seemed to be when you get really bust. The worst would be the long hours and the poor managing."
good,"It all depends which Walmart your work at. Some can be awesome and some can be horrible. I'm going to be very vague and say that don't gossip or you will get in trouble. Everyone will know your business if you tell one person so trust NO ONE. If you make an enemy with management watch your back. And be careful  of them using you and not paying you."
good,"A typical day was completing a four person job within a slotted time frame. I learned that quality is more important than speed. Completing a job the first time in a correct fashion saves time rather than doing it quickly and having to do it all over again. The kicker is learning to enforce quality and speed at the same time. Some jobs do take precedence over others but I do make sure all of my work is no where near sloppy. I easily became friends with all of my coworkers. Finding a common interest(s) in each of my coworkers is what led to successful friendships in and outside of the workplace. The hardest part of the job was staffing. At times it was a struggle to keep all customers happy when we were short-handed, but we did show them that we were giving them all that we had when it came to customer service. Repeat customers are what makes the company so successful. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a second family. I've heard many times that a job isn't a place for making friends, but I disagree. No, I don't believe in standing around and doing nothing but talking but it does make the job more enjoyable when you can pass by a coworker and exchange an inside joke and be able to pass on a smile. Which could possibly make their day a little better and in turn could elevate their productivity."
good,"I made so many friends, its a very diverce workplace because you get to see so many different kinds of people. loved working here. managenemt was decent,"
good,"A typical work day at Walmart included how to work with customers, sometimes even difficult ones, efficiently and satisfactorily. It involved sending and receiving money for customers, processing returns for customers, cashiering duties, and making sure the front end of the store ran smoothly and effectively. I learned how to be a member of management, how to supervise, and how to be a cooperative member of a team in order to get daily tasks done. The hardest part of the job was learning how to work with the customers who did not want to be appeased easily. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers, and getting compliments from customers on my excellent customer service."
good,Coming to working finding different things with vehicle and how they have advanced and changed. Find new challenges with vehicles.
good,es una buena empresa pero abusan de la gente que trabaja debido a que los sueldos son bajos con la horas que trabaja el personal
good,the hardest part of this job is the many different supervisors and  to whom you  are accountable to.  this was hard work but if you can focus and not dilly dally it works  the co workers were great I met many new friends and the  ethic  variety is uncomparable
good,Was in Charge of the GM side of the store.  was in charge of about 12 Department mangers.  Giving them directions on this that needed to be completed daily.
good,Walmart is not bad for a college student working for some extra cash and just need a stable job. But I really cannot see myself working 5+ years at this company it is not my passion I am just in it for when I am through with college.
good,"Bom eu ia para almoçar, ai depois do almoço ia até um responsável e perguntava o que eu tinha que fazer no dia como ( abastecer, brigadas, ajudar no RH etc .. ) E assim ia todos os dias...."
good,"Very Friendly place, with outgoing people, performing outstanding customer service to each individual customer, very people oriented with positive leaders, very supportive, understanding  and flexible with time."
good,This job can be stress-less at times but often management is able to make the work environment stressful for no apparent reason. Co-workers might as well be your customers and you must strive to impress them to gain trust and ensure teamwork cooperation.
good,"Llego puntual, checo y me dirijo a recibir las indicaciones de mi jefe inmediato, se hace el aseo correspondiente a mi area, se atiende el conmutador, y se realiza el voceo que solicitan los jefes de cada uno de los deptos, asi como gerencia, se da atencion a clientes  que va a probadores, se recibe mercancia de bodega que va al area de damas, se desempaca, se alarma y se clasifica, tambien se separa toda la mercancia que dejan en el area de cajas, y se reparte a cada uno de los departamentos. En ocasiones se apoya al depto. De paqueteria y la embajada(recepcion de clientes personalizada)."
good,A typical day at work for Wal-Mart would be me operating a cash register. As well as stocking shelves and assembling shelves for merchandise and floor layout plans.
good,"A good company but POOR safety training"
good,"Walmart is an alright job to start off being in the work force. I wouldn't recommend trying to make a career out of it, but maybe something to help start you off on your feet."
good,High pressure to get cake orders done on time and correctly and dealing with all manner of customers and supervisors while maintaining health department standars
good,"I have worked at Walmart over a decade both hourly and salaried positions. As an hourly Associate, I was not given a decent wage and had to open up my availability to get hours...despite the fact that I was in college and had a child."
good,I worked 40 hours a week morning hours through the week did some over time as called for. I utilized lots of customer service skills ineracting with co workers and the customers. The managment rarely ineraccted with the employees other than passing by saying hello unless there was something specific they wanted. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for the long periods at a time and the most enjoyable part was able to shop at a discount store plus receive a discount.
good,"This place is ok but like a lot of big corporations they want you to do"
good,"Los días suelen ser muy pesados pues siempre hay mucho que hacer en todos los puestos, pero a pesar de eso la empresa se preocupa porque todos esten agusto, siempre creand dinamicas para hacernos socializar."
good,Shift Started at 7am i would make sure sales floor is stocked and clean begin to bake breads fresh everyday assist customers in placing orders for cakes and other pastries prep bread to be baked the next day.. A great place to work because im a people person and i love to meet different people and assist them in making sure they had a great experience while shopping
good,"I was always busy. I learned that you can't judge people by their faces. Managers were ok, I liked most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was stocking the selves. The most enjoyable part of job was seeing pleasing faces on customers"
good,Fast pace environment where number one focus is the customer.  Salary if great but you will work for your money.  High demanding when it comes to work outside your rotation.
good,"Walmart de México es una excelente empresa, administrativamente es muy eficiente, como ninguna, pero tiene fallos y no se deben a la falta de procesos o a la falta de capacitación, estos son influenciados por el ambiente laboral el cual es muy diferente a su cultura laboral."
good,"Wal-mart is a good place to work as a manager. There is alot to learn. Lots of hard work and long hours for salaried members of management. If you help your team, your team will help you."
good,Walmart is not such a bad place to work at the end of the day. I get along with my co-workers well enough and the job itself is fairly easy to do. I enjoy talking with the customers and thinking about the best way to bag the groceries that they bring to the register.
good,"I was a seasonal employee who started off with a descent amount of hours, then my hours got cut drastically. Its difficult trying to contact and locate your supervisor when wanting to discuss additional hours."
good,Nice place to work with flexible schedules. Most of the associates were very easy to work with. They pay was ok but the management was a little bland and always all over the place.
good,"worked in jewelry so it was slow and not challenging bored most of the time, training was all done on computer, and question was done on a computer, for retail it really was something that did not interest me.  not enough customer interaction."
good,It is usually pretty busy at Walmart depending on the time of day. I was a cashier so I usually had a good flow of customers. I learned that patience is a virtue that should be practiced. The management there was fairly good compared to other stories I have heard about managers at other places of work. I also got along with all of my coworkers and they were usually friendly to me. The hardest part of the job for me was standing in one place for a long period of time. I like to be kept busy and move around from place to place with different tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably talking to friendly customers.
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers and managers. They were like family. A typical with them was fun and always something new happening. I have a lot of memories with them and that store. Hardest part of my job was deciding someone's outcome for the wrong decision that they made, especially the young boys and girls. I learned how to stand my ground and realized how strong I can be for my coworkers and myself when situations became hectic for us."
good,"This joy gives me the ability to work with many different people, different cultures and various challenges throughout any given day. Different vendors, different departments and skill sets."
good,"Like working along side of the associates, Teaching them new skills and learning new skills from them. Clean store great set up."
good,"not much to say about working at walmart, it was a short term commitment. i was there about 9 months on a midnight crew, and was part of a restructuring plan to convert a department store into a super store/ grocery store, management is upbeat and knowledgable of most aspects of the job, walmart runs a transparent company which allows all employees to have an insight in the future of their careers. typical work night stocking shelves and signing tunes off the store radio, not much to learn really open boxes take out product and place on shelves in locations with the proper displays above, most enjoyable part of the job, discount on cellular service with the providers they carried, co-workers were mostly kind. hardest part of the job was the low wages."
good,Busy the whole shift. Was required to work rotating shifts. Not allowed to make overtime unless it always was in favor of the company.
good,Everyday is different because associates never know what they are going to be ask to do. Most of the hourly employers work well together while the management team could be more supportive. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done with limited amount of time. I have learned that bad days happen and know matter what happens tomorrow is another day.
good,"Fast paced work, managers willing to work around employees schedules, enjoyable part of the job help customers resolve their needs, must be prepared to be used in more than one department."
good,Great Benefits and Compensation bad work-life balance. I enjoyed my time working there but it demanded too much of your life.
good,Somewhat flexible schedule. Nice employees. Management is not the greatest due to not being accommodating during the time that I broke my right arm.
good,"When it comes to the rules, they couldnt stick with the same rules. They would tell us, "" You can take the buy one get one free"" and then the next day... ""No no no... don't do that you need to do this"" and then they change it a week later...."
good,"Typical day is helping customers and keeping shelves stocked and looking nice. It was a great opportunity to learn how to deal with customer service and become a bit more of a people person. For the most part, management was great, however with every store there will be some people you simply don't get along with. Same goes with co-workers. Overall the job was enjoyable, and probably would have been better with co-workers with a more positive attitude."
good,Understaffed as h*** in receiving. Would not recommend working in IMS to anybody. Some days we would have 5 people in the back unloading a 2800 piece truck. Title says 4PM-1AM. I've stayed as late as 5:30AM simply because they didn't have enough employees working IMS. Everyone that worked there however was awesome. Great people.
good,"Busy day to day work place with customer interaction. "
good,Picking up your scanner at the beginning of your shift and unloading a truck in an assembly line style. Helping other workers and assisting customers.
good,Walmart is a company with a solid history of working hard to ensure lower prices for Customers by monitoring cost of business to pass the savings on.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance: I asked for 20 hours originally, but am currently getting 25 average, even after a month of or so of new hires (I have only seen 2 so far), and we are horribly understaffed (Which looks like it wont be fixed ever). I STRONGLY recommend giving a review after the first month because I didn't start feeling the pain in my legs until after about a month. I have been given 8 hours in a row twice now, on the weekend."
good,Being a orderfiller is a very physal job and also very repetitve. You can expect to ordefill 5000 cases a night. The positives of the job is that you only work 4 days or 3 days a week. If you can handle a very physical job then it isn't a bad job. Good company to work for.
good,"Every day was different, you never really knew what you were going to walk into. I learned a lot about how to run a successful business and how to grow sales. I learned how to be a leader the right way, by making people want to follow you and not just demanding that things get done. By teaching and training and using discipline as a last resort not a first. The hardest part of the job is missing my family. It wasn't unusual to work a 12-15hr day, but the pay and benefits were really good. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people. Helping the customers by helping them find the things they needed at a great price, but what I really enjoyed was helping the associates. Most management there don't view out associates as customers, but they kind of are. It is just as important to build a relationship with them as it is to build one with the customer."
good,Management could be a little bit better. They need to be more flexible with people schedules especially student. Learned a lot and worked in many areas.
good,The pay is good along with the benefits. So much has changed for the worse in the past 5 years. Advancement in the company is really hard
good,"It was a easy job for a person to get into as well as easy to move up within that store.  None the less its a good entry level, if you want to move up you need to be aggressive or leave the store."
good,"Walmart is a fast paced environment, you have to get things done in a certain amount of time. This is a big company, have to keep a positive attitude at all times. The most enjoyable part of this job is building trust and friendships with the customers that are regular customers, or just interacting with different people everyday. You learn something new everyday."
good,Diverse Operation with a tactical mindset. Co-workers are hardworking and strive for excellence everyday. Very associate friendly and benefits their future.
good,"All i do is push all carts every day from the parking lots to the inside of the Walmart carts area. I've learned teamwork when other cart pushers help me. I pick out the trash and throw it away in the trash. I help the elders with the electric carts and help them with their groceries. I take electric carts back after they get in the vehicles. I help with the carry out when the manager asked me to. I support the other employers with their work when i'm needed. I return the lost items to the customer service. There is no hardest part of the job in this company. I like to push carts a lot all day nonstop. It is a good work out for me. I don't like to stand there doing nothing. I like to keep walking, push and lift weights."
good,this is one company that I personally cannot speak well about . several times if you cannot get out of your work area on time because someone is running behind you have to stay extra time and the next day you have to cut the time off on your lunch breaks if not they will write you up
good,A typical day at wal-mart was your going to work from the time you get there to the time you leave.  I've learned a lot about stocking and zoning aisles when i started working.  Management wasn't all that let's just say there's too many chiefs and no Indians.  My co-workers were awesome i love all of them to death i really enjoyed them.  The hardest part of the job keeping the stationary department together because that is the most tedious department in wal-mart.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers seeing those customers leave happy knowing that they saved money.
good,My co-workers where all good and the management was okay but there could have been some changes other then that is was all good work place
good,"A typical day is filling carts and not slacking."
good,"I enjoy working for Wal-Mart because of the support system you get and ability to advance when you start working there. However the higher up on the chain the worse your support is from management. The co-workers all work hard and are treated fairly, so I never really have an issue with them. Job responsibilities increase drastically due to a lack of hiring more help, thus you are often overloaded with responsibilities that become expectations. Wal-Mart is great for anyone looking to get a job asap, but for long-term careers, it is better to find appreciation elsewhere. The jobs are now becoming consolidated because of the pay increases, but it doesn't make the jobs easier. I started as a Cash Office associate and now am an Office Associate (Invoice and A/P), however my job responsibilities now include my office associate responsibilities, pt cash office on weekends, assisting receiving associate, process donations, retrieve mail, do vendor payment research, floor research, ordering supplies, and helping out with any requests management has. I learned it is great to find a job with responsibilities, but you also must be able to grasp that others, especially management, will not always have your back. To work at Wal-Mart, you cannot demand particular hours or days off, you must take what they give you."
good,this is not a perfect company to work at..it has its own flaws..company with big diversity..this company taught me a lot about the retail industry
good,"I've gained quite a few helpful skills in this placement that I wouldn't have from sitting around the house, including giving a much-needed boost to my social skills which was my most feared part of working in the service/retail industry."
good,"Most people were able to advance and receive decent wages prior to the initiation of HCR.  I really enjoyed working with the customers and being able to find them the item they were looking for, even if it was the last one left in the store.  I enjoyed helping a hostile customer become happy.  I knew almost all of the 633 employees.  There were only 3 areas of the store that I DID NOT work in during the 5 years I worked there.  I really liked the ability to work with so many people and to learn so many different things.  I loved training new employees and watching them grow."
good,"llego a mi área de trabajo registro mi entrada, pregunto a mi compañero supervisor de turno que es lo que se queda pendiente, hacemos un recorrido por el área para delimitar el orden y las cosas por mejorar, junto a mi equipo de trabajo para darles a conocer los datos del turno y repartir actividades concretas a cada uno, elaborar reporterias del área, calculo de la nomina diaria, revisión de tarjetas de asistencia, y solucionar problemas que salen en el transcurso del turno."
good,"First we all go to receiving  to make sure our merchandise  was worked on the floor the night before and overstock is off the floor into the bins. Have a morning meeting to go over the sales made in each area and discuss other issues. Go to assign work area.Work features to side counters,clean an zone area. Provide great customer service. Hardest part of the day is finding the items for your paper work.The most enjoyable part of my day was working beside my colleagues."
good,"Making sure that all machines, fryers, and inventory was working and well stocked. "
good,"En general la empresa da beneficios que ayudan a los trabajadores como vales de despensa, fines de semana (2 días de descanso), pero el sueldo no era del todo justo para lo que se hace y contribución se queda corta."
good,"Tools in progress"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart usually consists of putting out freight and tidying up merchandise that is already out.  As well as working with freight, I help with collecting the returned clothing articles, creating a new tag if needed, and putting them back on the sales floor.  From 2-4 pm is zone time, so we are to focus only on tidying up our designated areas on the sales floor. On days that certain areas are short staffed, management asks for help in putting up their freight, tidying up their areas, or dealing with the returns."
good,"Walmart Pharmacy is a great place to start if you want to be a technician. You can learn while working as a technician and you have 1 year before you have to take your test to be certified. Upon passing your Certification, Walmart will reimburse the cost of the test.  Love my co-workers even on the craziest of busy days. I totally loved learning new tasks and doing something important to patient healthcare. I just need a more regular schedule in my life with most of the same days off which is impossible in a retail setting.  I will miss my group of co-workers but feel it's time to move on."
good,"Es un lugar de alta exigencia, la zona influye en el tipo de cliente y necesidades de este, aprendí el manejo de mercancía y el proceso de captura de datos, lo mas difícil es el cambio de temporadas y el manejo de excesos en la mercancia"
good,"A typical day consisted of providing fast and friendy check-out. If your lane was empty at the time, you must clean your belt and make sure your aisle was cleaned. I learned the software of Wal-Mart and secrets to couponing. Managment was typical management. Most were there to get the job done and go home. However, there were various opportunities to be involved with management. The hardest part of the job was frustrating customers but have to keep telling yourself, you only see this person for a few minutes a day, smile and go on. The most enjoyable part of being an associate at Wal-Mart was the continuous interaction with people."
good,"Walmart is big on advancing their employees, but they have to want it. I have moved three times myself, and seen others start as a cashier and become a co-manager. Some associates can be difficult to work with at times, but that is to be expected when you work in a retail environment. The work is almost always fast-paced, and it feels nice to go home and feel that I did a good day's work."
good,"I liked working for Wal-Mart! There was never a dull moment! There was hands on training and lots of multitasking, which the job interesting. Its a family owned business and its always a family oriented atmosphere!"
good,Great location to work! Made alot of friends with Co-workers and customers. Customers are loyal and appreciate good customer service.
good,"My typical day would start on a cash register and when it was slow I would go out and zone. The management had a lot of favoritism and they would take long to find a solution if you had a problem plus they put too much workload on you when you had little time. The main thing that really made work easy was the fact that there was great customers and co-workers. One thing I do appreciate from working here was that I learned a lot of new things like working a cash register, a scanner, how to solve certain problems and how to deal with irritated customers."
good,"Typical day involved removing out-of-date or unattractive product and restocking it, changing prices and displays as necessary, and customer service"
good,"I left because there was very limited advancement. The management only cared about how much they could get out of you. When goals were met, they were raised shortly after. It was never enough."
good,If you are just starting a job. This is a good place. You can keep this job for a long time and reap the benefits if you pick a good store. I would do a little research on the store you are applying to. Each store is different based on sales and goals. Bonus are plenty in a good store.
good,"Revisar, trabajar y archivar reportes así como dar información útil a los asociados como negativas, agotados y ventas diarias de los diferentes departamentos en toda la tienda, dar solución rápida a problemas comunes como dar de alta artículos nuevos realizar rebajas en costos activar promociones, respetar precios bajos, mandar información a gerentes y distrito de movimientos en inventario como mercancía agotada y entrante."
good,"Empresa que da oportunidade de crescimento para os seus associados."
good,"I enjoyed getting the $400 biweekly, there was also good benefits that came along with working at Walmart. I got along with nearly every employee that i worked with, but when it come to the hours they cut them too much and i just couldn't afford to drive back and forth to work with little or no hours. If i got the hours i needed i would still be working at Walmart to this day but unfortunately it doesn't work that way."
good,"Um ótimo ambiente de trabalho,empresa dinâmica, colaboradores prestativos."
good,"It's an okay place to work at"
good,Very repetitive! Constantly not doing anything. Always had to find something to do and keep busy even if there was nothing to do. Too many days off. Really needed a constant schedule!
good,after arriving at work checked  what trucks if any was due in. if trucks  came in we would start to  unload and stage . after staging  we would take to dept that the products  were to be stocked.most nights trucks were schedule  in so we had plenty to do. all asigned  area had to be kept clean and make sure  walk ways  were passable . my boss was ok.and the  coworkers  were a good team. i learned to  cooperate with others  and work as a team player
good,"I did enjoy the experience, but found it to be less than what it should have been b/c of the lack of workplace respect and treatment of us by customers as well day to day.  There was not the communication between staff (Hourly) and Salaried that there should have been due to what I felt was a bias, but it could have been lack of patience and due to their ducks just not being in a row they were combative and acted defensive when challenged to correct this matter...they did not have an open door policy upon complaints or suggestions from lower totem pole employees as rookies just coming in and their dictatorship on this was less than impressive from my perspective."
good,If you do get hired at Wal-Mart you would basically have to fire yourself. The management team usually helps you if you need help bu honestly you have to do your work and get in with the right people.
good,Very fast paced work environment. Some associates and managers were friendly and worked well with each others. The neighborhood was not that great.
good,"The only thing that really had brought problems with work and my personal life was that they did not work with my school schedule. I had repeatedly advised them when I had class and when I would be available to work. They continued to schedule me during my school hours. Besides that issue, I enjoyed my work."
good,I work over and beyond for this company I learn different area that is not mine. I try and help other each and every day. I like working with my co-worker. the hardest part I don't have one. Then enjoyable part is helping customer.
good,"I enjoy what I do at Walmart. Unloading trucks has always been the career of choice for myself.  Management has set high expectations on deadlines to be met without the right resources to make them possible. The pay is also an issue. I have to find a better paying job regardless how much I love my job, I can't afford to live on my own with the pay rate."
good,"Day to day inter-relation with customers is more enjoyable, interacting with friends on a daily basis and,the satisfaction of completing a work task on a daily bases."
good,I had a lot of fun working at Walmart and met a lot of great people. The job entailed a lot of customer interaction which I liked. It made the job interesting and a new experience everyday. My coworkers were friendly and easy to get a long with. Most of my managers were friendly as well.
good,Good work environment with good people. The supervisors only cared about sales and numbers while employees cared more about how the store in general was flowing. loved the fast pace at times but not the  other dead slow times. A multi tasking job but you had help if things got out of hand a supportive staff and a good clientele.
good,"The job is fun, there was always something to do, but despite that, it was not worth the minimum wage. The walmart i worked at had some pretty awful managers. Not all of them, just some, just like in any workplace."
good,"Great company, you can easily advance but the work hours do not work with a family life.  The management team as well as the corporate offices really value their employees."
good,Its an alright place to work with a changing environment. I personally like the people I work with which is a big part in why I stayed so long.
good,Provides remarkable customer service. Ability to work under pressure. Promptly answer customer calls. Ability to operate a cash register. Follow proper procedure for handling claims. Be knowledgeable about all sections of the store and products within each department.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of the cashiers working seemingly harder than the managers. I learned my money management skills, and how to cooperate with other coworkers as we worked as a team. Management in the front end could have been better to work with the lower coworkers. Instead of standing around and socializing with each other, they could have taken the time to help other coworkers that needed the help. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management and having to work extra hard in order to help the other coworkers. The most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart was being able to help customers finish their purchases."
good,"Atención a clientes de manera personalizada."
good,"Coming into work and getting straight to my tasks was the typical night at work. I learned time management, I didn't like my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was not being able to spend so much time with my Son. The most enjoyable part of my job were the breaks."
good,I had to talk to management multiple times about my schedule because I was getting scheduled during times when I was in school. It was difficult to work after I had to go to the ER and the company does not except doctor's notes. This made it very difficult because I had to keep calling in due to medial issues. Overall great place to work and if circumstances were different I would go back.
good,"Overall, the work experience with customers was great.  Work load was either very late some days, or extremely heavy others.  Because of this unpredictable work load, scheduling and maintaining became an issue.  Coworkers, for the most part were great to work with.  Hourly staff I was in charge of were either very helpful, or the exact opposite.  The hardest part of the job was maintaining and delegating the work load knowing that not all employees were trustworthy enough to complete the delegated tasks."
good,"I enjoy working retail depending on the day, but I think that is anyone who works retail. I have worked at 3 different wal-mart stores in my 8 years with the company and I am comfortable saying that each store has been very very different. I enjoy the store I am currently employed at the most. We have a clean, well staffed location. When I say well staffed I do not mean just numbers. Our people are friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. Most of us really enjoy our co workers and our job. "
good,I loved working in the vision center because I learned a lot about optometry and there was always more to learn. My co-workers were great. It was really hard getting the a schedule I needed as a single mom.
good,"a typical day at work at walmart was rushed and very stress full i was always helping other co-workers while finishing my own work. i learned how to multitask and be prepared for customers, the management was not the best they would always be on my neck about something that wouldn't have been my fault would constantly re write the scheduled which made it hard for school,my co_workers where helpful for the most part but would also get me to do theyre daily activities cause i was the new kid, the hardest part of my job would have been managing my time around alway getting new objectives from management."
good,coworkers are top notch. some management as well. as a company not so much. but did have a friendly environment. for the work you do pay should be more
good,"I was a customer service representitive, I was in the bilingual team, we would answer calls to assist the customer, would take payments, and resolved any issue that they may have. My co-workers would always be busy cause the call volume was always high. I learned how to deal with diferent kind of personalities. The hardest part of my job was when I was trying to solve the issue but the customer didn't understand what I was trying to help him/her with. the most that I liked from my job was that I could Talk with the customers in spanish."
good,"Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.The most enjoyable part od this job was working alongside with the doctors and learning from them. Extremely busy at times and sometimes a big challenge to deal with certain customers, this job gives me a great deal with experience in customer service a big variety of different people, everyday you experience something new."
good,Many changes being made and not that great of a place to work any longer. Bonuses and employee morale is no longer where it used to be.
good,This company does not properly prepare their employees for work there. They come up with new rules and such without notice to their employees. The management staff is very unprofessional and the benefits are very poor.
good,I think the company could be a good place if they would stand by their reputation and what they stand for. The department's that I am over I have brought the standards up along with safety and customer satisfaction.
good,I enjoy my work and the people I worked with. I was usually waxing the floors because I had skill at it. I even enjoyed helping others with their work in stalking product.
good,"Very busy, constant customer service. Assisted with cashier as needed.  Worked approximately 40 hrs/week.  Associates were pleasant and easy to work with for the most part.  Helps with personal growth and will help associate/family if they need help at home.  Could usually keep very busy.  Most customers were very pleasant.  Occasionally would have a customer that would try to be unpleasant, but management would usually deal with the problem."
good,Walmart is great place for you to work and go to school its just not a career and somewhere I would want to retire. I love working there its great people.
good,i loved working here it helped me learn so much i got certified in being a lube and tire technician it was fast paced fun and hard which i love i love to work hard because it puts a big smile on my face knowing i did something and i did it good and at a safe but fast manner.
good,"I usually worked as a sales representative for Electronics, Photo, and Connection Center. I ended up operating as an acting manager without the title, and was responsible for all 3 areas with little staff assistance. The lessons I gained from this job are essentially patience for customers, coworkers/supervisors, empathy with them dealing with highly difficult people and sympathy for their struggles. The managers varied from awful dictators, to indifferent, to push-overs. Overall the most difficult part was trying to manage a large workload when coworkers didn't want to be there and management didn't want to provide direction. However that allowed one of the best parts of the job which was being able to learn how to run things fluidly myself."
good,Typical retail operations with high some time not attainable goals with inexperienced or less than desired staff.  Salary and benefits keep you there.  Constant change in direction and leadership make you stay very adaptable.
good,I hope walmart offers full time job and good hours. Co-workers and management are easy to work with. I love what I do I just hope they offer me a full time job.
good,"I started at this company as a front end cashier, greeting and checking my customers in a timely manner. I then advanced to customer service desk where I still checked customers out as well as money orders, bill pays, returns and exchanges. I also handled the dressing room, switchboard. I performed price changes and setting up modulars for merchandising."
good,Walmart is a decent job but unless you want to be an assistant manager I'd only recommend it for high school/college students. It depends which department you work in but sometimes it can be fun.
good,A manger here was very rude and nasty and they think they can talk down to their associates. It was seasonal and they were making people permanent that didn't deserve to be in my eyes and when I asked a  manager if they were hiring more people as permanent she told me that they had already made the people they wanted as permanent.
good,Usually  working in walmart is fun. But due to some customers who are already frustated due to their persona problems results in typical day at work. Instead of serving them with really good customer service still they react like we didn't done well and make me feel low.
good,"Wal-mart was a very great place to work I enjoyed myself and learned so much over the almost 8 years I worked there. The most enjoyable part of my time there was the great people I met associates, managers and customers."
good,A typical day at Walmart is rewarding.  You interact with many other associates and customers.  The hardest part is keeping the shelves full for the customers.
good,"Fue facil integrarme al equipo de trabajo, ahi aprendi a llevar control de almacen de productos, control de gente a mi cargo, sobrellevar clientes con caracter complicado y a entregar valores a panamericano."
good,"Walmart's benefits overall are pretty good.  The opportunity for advancement is great anyone willing to work hard and put in the hours can advance easily.   You can have a lot of fun working there at some location under some managers."
good,everyone is easy to work with. nice to have more extra shift. If only Walmart will give full time opportunities I will grab it and work my way up.
good,"Loved my co-workers, good place to work for students who are getting their feet wet regarding careers or confidence in general."
good,fun place to work with great management learned a lot of skill that can be applied to further job opportunities and careers.
good,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart would almost always be an eight hour period, rarely would there be a seven hour day or a nine hour day. Wal-Mart required you if you're working 8+ hours, you needed the one hour lunch break and two additional fifteen minute breaks, if less than eight hours- a half hour lunch break. and two separate fifteen minute breaks. I worked in the Fitting Room - which my day consisted of answering store calls, transferring calls, keeping ears on the walkie-talkie and reaching people over the intercom. In the fitting room you also have to tend to the people who need in the fitting rooms, as well as taking two or three trips to Customer Service to keep up with your returns, which in your case you have to tag/re-tag and sort the returns into Jewelry Department, Infants, Childrens, Womens, and Mens clothing. This job taught me how to multitask very effectively and manage my time - and keep a fast pace. Once or twice a week, although, management would not answer back to the fitting room even if we used both the walkie-talkie and intercom to reach someone. During those times, callers would sometimes wait for management to answer for up to twenty minutes at times. Most of the time the fitting room would have all returns completed and rarely would it not. I considered all of my co-workers very hardworking people, especially those who trained me and worked with me every day. I had learned each of their life-stories and the reason why they worked in the fitting room. One of the most enjoyable parts of working in the fitting room would, indeed, be the company of my"
good,Working and getting to know so many different people from so many walks of life made my day each and everyday. The Walmart staff became like a 2nd family to me. At time dealing with the management was hard but then at time depending on the manager on duty thing ran very good.
good,"It's a good job. Management is nice. Better for starting employees than long term unless you plan to try to climb management. Pay raises are few and far between, but there are decent long term benefits for full time employees. Myshare is a nice bonus. You get discounts after 90 days. It does keep you on your feet. Overall, I like it."
good,"management helped in a lot of different areas.  typical day arrive at or before 7 am stock any merchandise night crew did not.  Setup registers, took work orders from customers for tires, oil changes, or headlight restore.  Bin any over stock that would not fit on shelves.  Help other departments work stock that was left.  Being able to take customers to items or products they where looking for.  Hardest part of my job was being the only member of my crew that stocked shelves when manager was on vacation.  Most of the Auto Care Center Techs refused to stock merchandise.  I have learned that while the managers want an associate to stock, adjust shelf caps, set displays ect.  they only give options on the gemini and hand held devices to associates that are managers or that management wants to advance with in the company."
good,"Walmart needs to pay better, the stores are making a lot of money but the managers get paid the same. I'm not sure why they don't pay better, the company is doing well."
good,walmart is always a busy store so you never run out of work. hours were great.pay could have been better. coworkers were great. management wasn't the best.
good,A typical day we have a morning meeting to discuss the stocks and news of the company . I get along with majority of my co - workers but there are a few people you feel you have to make sure they are doing what they are suppose to do. The hardest part is being in the store during holidays and it is understaffed.
good,"I enjoy working with my peers at this company. Lots of positive relationships and friendships are formed. I will say the management team needs to get on board and be a team player like the associates, instead of walking around and demanding work and idle threats. We would all greatly benefit from this."
good,"I loved my job, but felt I have been overlooked or passed up for higher positions.  I worked hard and deserved more advancement.  therefore decided to see what's out there and hopefully a company that will let me excel with my job performance and knowledge.  Too many managers pets and family working together in my store, which is not professional"
good,"Provide excellent customer service through product knowledge and placement, and ensuring a quick seamless experience at the checkout"
good,learn how to check date on product. and stock product. co-workers work well together. trucks and overnight was kind of hard but it was not to bad. we all got along great as long as everyone do their job.
good,Work hours are different every day so it is hard to plan routines.  Schedules are made 3 weeks in advance though so you do atleast know what you're going to work for the next couple weeks. Unless you are a cashier you will be doing more than just your job description and have to take orders from many managers. Recent pay raises for all walmart employess make the work bearable
good,"A typical day consisted of writing vehicles up for service, cleaning, stocking and assisting customers."
good,"it was the same each day "
good,"Team work, organizational skills, dedicated employee. Transferred from the company in texas to south carolina.  Enjoyed working with others the only con was it was hard on my health and looking for a position that requires less physical activity"
good,Working for Walmart is everything you would expect it to be because it is Walmart. its great if you need work and you dont mind everyone who out ranks you being your boss.
good,Went to work usually unloaded a truck then went to stocking and straightening up backroom. Also did inventory prepping.
good,"Hay buen ambiente de trabajo, se maneja bien el trabajo en equipo, hay respeto mutuo entre el equipo de trabajo de la empresa, se aprenden diversas funciones tales como códigos nuevos, pagos de servicio, afiliaciones, renovaciones, bonificaciones , mas que nada una muy buena atención al cliente y buena organización de trabajo. La parte mas difícil del trabajo es cuando se pierde la concentración porque entonces pueden presentarse los errores."
good,"Although they will work with you on days off if it is medical or appointments of any type. The management is rude, the co-workers do not care about others, and they do not care about getting you out of work on your scheduled time. They will give you 4 hours of work to do an hour before you are ready to get out."
good,"una empresa con muy buen ambiente laboral , capacitacion diaria y exelentes horarios faborables para los estudiantes"
good,"As my first job, I'll admit that I don't have much to compare Wal-Mart to, but I have a great work ethic and upbeat personality, so any observation I make is completely uncompromised by any form of disdain, and based on experience alone."
good,"Walmart has a great work environment, managers, co workers, and customers. The hardest part about working at Walmart is balancing my job and my personal life."
good,"The job payed OK for a retail job. It was a constant job, never anytime to stop and rest. Management was hit and miss. Some managers were great and would do everything in their power to help you out and back you up. Others didn't care. The people I worked with were great and like a big family. There were often days when I, as a front end supervisor, would end up outside pushing carts, or covering jewelry or electronics while covering the front end. Staffing wasn't always great."
good,"A typical day at work is usually very busy, with lots of foot traffic. Each day I learn how to appreciate our front end supervisors more and more, they truly our the behind the scenes people making everything run without a glitch. My coworkers are wonderful and we all work as a team to help one another's days go by quickly and enjoyably. The hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with rude customers. Unfortunately it can sometimes be a daily occurrence, and often times can be the same customers.The most enjoyable part of my job is the regular customers I've come to have. I have one imparticular who has really made an impact on me and I look forward to seeing her every Friday and Saturday I work. She works for a local group home and will often have large orders and one of the group home members with her. Sometimes she has to walk away from the order or leave certain things behind because they have a set budget. I don't mind at all, helping her helps me know that I'm making a small difference."
good,"Ambiente agradável por conta de supervisores, mas não de mais funcionários, tive a oportunidade de trabalhar com pessoas experientes no ramo e e agregar conhecimento."
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. I met wonderful people that I will probably know for the rest of my life. Regular customers who we would encounter 2 to 3 times a week knew employees by name and that made us feel like a family. They also knew who to turn to for what like who was the ""expert"" for smart TVs or cellular phones."
good,"A typical day at work was getting out as much freight as possible.  I learned how to process the freight & we had to re arrange the floor in order to put out new stuff.  It was hard when you had deadlines to meet."
good,"mi jornada laboral incluía: llegar, presentarme ante mi jefa directa, me proporcionaban mi fondo para empezar a cobrar, realizaba mis actividades asignadas de cobro, después de unas horas salía a comer una hora, regresaba, me volvían a asignar caja asta que acabara mi turno, me cubrían y ordenaba mis valores para ser corte de caja."
good,"I would rate the overall of the company on a scale of 1 to 5, an 3 because some employees were rude and nasty to the customers and were not sympathic to theirs needs. I look at it as if its not for the customers how would the store survive all of the accomplishments that they posses. Working with this company help to develop my own personal skills such as, communication and patience."
good,There was a great Team ethnic in the facility and Strong leadership skills in management.Great potential for advancement in many diverse area
good,Day to day life as a manager in a big box retail chain. Great company however each location differs with experience. The store manager dives the work experience  for the employees
good,The most part it was a nice place to work and the people who had worked at Wal-Mart were hard working and caring. Management had it's ups and downs. Hard to work with most of the time.
good,Un dia tipico en la empresa es llegar sacar merma sembrar la mercancia aprendi sobre el acomodo de mercancias y manejo de merma la empresa ofrece  facil promocion
good,"Usually, whenever I would show up for work, my first task would be to clean my area and make sure the products on the shelves were organized and all of the prices were in place. Also, assisting any customers arriving at my counter. I learned how to juggle multiple tasks, as my surrounding areas were usually understaffed, I would have to take control and manage any area needed, as well as taking care of my core department. The management was slightly difficult to deal with because of how many mangers we had. One manager's task would frequently interfere with another manager's direction and resulted in small conflicts often."
good,"es un poco estresante y pesado el trabajo, la tiene vende mayoreo, entonces hay demasiada gente, pocos compañeros cajeros para todos los clientes que se presentan en cajas, aprendí a ser amable, tolerante y tener paciencia, ser ágil y rápido."
good,Works with customers to either exchange or return items for either cash or in store credit.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when we make the customers happy!
good,"daily goals and I learned to delegate"
good,My typical day at work would be pushing carts to designated area. I enjoyed interacting with the customers. I liked my co-workers. There was nothing hard about my job.
good,"a typical day at Walmart consisted of working on the remodel until about five am then focusing on recovering the store until the end of the shift at seven am."
good,"Keeping the departments clean and organized. working with other department heads and managers to keep everything in order. Cash handling."
good,Cool work place with some down to earth co-workers. I just some time thought that the pay wasn't equal with the work. but other that I loved working with the officers. I did like the thrill of catching shop lifters. I liked the paperwork and being incharge of the security of the Electronics dept
good,Wal-Mart was a very fast pace place. I enjoyed working there because we always stayed busy. It was a very productive work  place for me because not only was I a fast worker. I made sure everything was accurate. As far as management goes I feel like there are things that could be improved. The hardest thing about the job for me was working every single holiday and when I first started I always had to work afternoon until night and I couldn't get anyone to work with my school schedule at first. The enjoyable part about this job was of course the people.
good,"At 11 pm, Walmart would hold a team meeting informing us of the sales and profits made. After the meeting concludes we are told where to go and start to work. A usual night including unloading between 11 to 14 skids of food products and zoning/ front-facing. During my experience at Walmart I learned to move at a quick pace while unloading the boxes, as well as I learned to operate the machinery in the back room.Management and my co-workers were very informative and kept all employees relatively safe during work days. The hardest part of working as a overnight stocking associate was learning the different areas of the store you were not used to working in. The most enjoyable moments I experienced at Walmart was building relationships with my co-workers."
good,"Great job for people without much work experience to learn valuable work skills, with plenty of room for advancement into higher paying rolls if desired and motivated. Definitely not a career unless planning on moving into upper management"
good,At Walmart they weren't very flexible with what you were able to work and weren't so gracious when needing a day off. I loved the job as being a cashier in general but I did not like management too much and I didn't like how screwy my schedule was.
good,"Day shifts would consist of setting up merchandise displays, maintaining the shelves with more product, cleaning up the aisles, helping customers, keeping records of cleaning and inspecting, and other miscellaneous tasks. Nights would be similar but with the addition of unloading the daily trucks. In the later years evening shifts would be hectic after 7 as the in-stock team would often be understaffed which would require floor associates in the grocery department to work in tandem with the in-stock team by assisting and working as an in-stock associate. Variety was an opportunity as multiple departments often needed help, so once the tasks of my own department were finished I gained experience with other departments. Management was very hit or miss as some managers were great, while others were infamously awful. Similarly co-workers were hit or miss, however most would get their jobs done, with problem employees being the exception rather than the rule. The work environment was overall pleasant. The most frustrating part of the job was the miscommunication of priority of tasks by management as it would make an employee seem less professional to certain managers for not completing certain tasks because of listening to my direct manager. The most enjoyable part of my job was working as a team to accomplish large jobs as it was satisfying to accomplish such a job in that time."
good,"I got to work different areas was very flexible always had something to do. was offered extra hours. had chance to learn how to do price changes change out display for new merchandise always worked as a team to get things done when someone needed little extra help. Management was very open to what had to be heard and worked with you to solve a situation."
good,"After arriving at work I would consult my manager what duties would need to be completed that day by the end of my shift."
good,"great place to work nice team members"
good,Walmart is a company that has great potential for advancement but  i am seeking better employment to employ skills in areas i enjoy more than retail.
good,"loved working here, everyone is friendly but didnt get enough hours. If i was able to get at least 40 hours per week i would still be there."
good,support and empower our managers to help fulfill our mission of saving people money so they can live better. It’s a big job that requires leadership and in-depth knowledge of our stores
good,"Great job for just starting off in the work field. Pay was not great. Learned a lot of skills like cash handling, customer service, deli and bakery and store remodles"
good,"Working at Wal-Mart, although very easy work, was also incredibly boring and stressful. When one gets very good at their job, it tends to become boring, as you quickly get your required work done. "
good,fun enviornment low pacing movment but an amazing place to work. Co-workers were manerable. Hardest part was lifting heavy equipment to be stocked on shelves.
good,"Expansive growth with the right amount of worth ethic. Learned Sales and security procedures for product. Management did their work for how much they had to do on a daily basis, they did it well. Workers were very cooperative and did the best to get by for their families. Getting through the day was the worst part of the day, but primarily the last few hours. Some work longer than others. The best part of the work day is lunch, free leftovers and junk food stacked to the sky!"
good,"•	Maintain and restock inventory"
good,"Walmart has delightful environment wich one can nurture , expand your strengths and career opportunities. working there has been one the few highlight of my life."
good,I started off as a cashier and within months I was working customer service and soon after that I advanced to front end manager/ customer service manager. I learned that Walmart is a good company to grow with. as for management I have to say the store manager was more concerned about the numbers then the employees and customers. The hardest part of the job was making sure to follow procedure while making the customer happy. I did enjoy moving through the ranks at the speed I did and am happy I was given the opportunities I was.
good,It was ok to work at. Normally set the merchandise on floor display then for few hours in the morning when store opens would be salesmen on the floor. Could of been a little more flexible in the management field.
good,"Pharmacy time based work program (good rating for efficiency of work, but It didn't allow for personal customer service).  The retail profession of pharmacy requires the pharmacist  to fill prescriptions by completing the doctors orders, reviewing patient profiles, perform drug utilization reviews, and to provide consultation advice.  Although the previously mentioned services are responsibilities , most importantly a pharmacist job  is to provide personal service to customers to show  you are listening and you care."
good,it was ok .. considering the location  hours isn't good  an they want you to do everything while your doing your job.. good place for a teen for a first job
good,"Había motivación por el trabajo, metas por alcanzar solución de problemas personales al momento, aprendí a tratar personas según sus necesidades, la gerencia no hacia mucho contacto con los trabajadores, los compañeros se apegaban a la vida laboral personal, lo difícil era hacer trabajos pesados fuera de las actividades por las que no decía el contrato, lo mas agradable era la motivación e impulso por hacer y lograr objetivos dentro del ámbito de trabajo."
good,"As a cashier, I was able to meet new people every day but there were times where it was very slow so I was sent to perform matinee and stoking."
good,This job overall was a stable one. I was able to work enough hours to make sufficient income. Also the job was one where a person could potentially advance with time. I learned more about customer service and satisfaction and the importance of reaching out to every possible customer.
good,"An entry-level job title, the position of Walmart stock associate involves moderate-to-heavy labor. Primary job duties may include loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays, and stocking shelves. Walmart stock associates must possess the ability to lift heavy objects in excess of 50 pounds. Knowledge of operating heavy machinery such as forklifts may also prove necessary. Only applicants 16 and older may apply for Walmart stock associate jobs. Walmart generally trains stock associates using verbal and visual orientation as well as hands-on demonstration."
good,Hard to get days off. Otherwise a great place to work.The management team can be hard to get alone with as well. There is drama everywhere and it's irritating.
good,"The workplace was a fun and enjoyable place to work in, safety procedures were always well taken. Walmart was also very close to my home which was a nice plus side to working there."
good,This Walmart I worked at had a lot of miserable people working there. It felt like working at a morgue. I worked at a different Walmart where management actually cared and understood you as a person and made you want to succeed. Not this particular Walmart however.
good,hard working making sure all gets done dealing with customers and making sure they keep coming back. learning more about new thing you can do to improve
good,"Although almost every day is a challenging day working for Walmart and with the proper human communication skills therein, there are some things at Walmart that are overlooked and could use a bit of refinement. Walmart is high on my personal list to challenge your physical as well as logical skills and it does provide somewhat of a homely atmosphere. However it is adamantly enforced by the managers to get the job done during, at times, seemingly unrealistic time intervals and to advance to another task at yet again unrealistic time frames. "
good,Overall it wasn't a bad job. But the pay was low and they weren't flexible with time off. The job was not complicated or hard. It would have been worth it if my goal had been to reach a management position. But as a grocery stocker the pay wasn't worth it.
good,"I liked my coworkers a lot. But the management seriously lacked the knowledge of how to properly use leadership. I don't think they understand how easy it is to get whisked away from your assigned task to help a customer. It's hard to get a solid five minutes of work done without being interrupted and distracted in some way. It may have just been the store I worked at, but management did not address that issue very well.."
good,"I did not have a good time working here, because I was a rather tall and bigger guy I rarely stayed in the department I was assigned too. A typical day at work should have been zoning your department, making sure all the merchandise was neat and presentable for the customers and to take care of said customers with professional service and when you were caught up and not doing anything, to help out your neighboring departments. However my typical day in Toys would start by trying to get the department zoned while helping customers, but instead of allowing me to get caught up, because of my gender and size I was pulled from my job to help in the back, with receiving merchandise. Leaving my area to suffer and the next day when it wasn't done, I would be pulled back again to do it all over again never being allowed to get caught up. This would cause issues with the other management in my department and heads. I was called to the office several times because my department was a constant mess on my shift, but when I told them I would be pulled, they told me I simply needed to work harder. No matter how hard you work you cannot be in two places at once, and when I asked what I should do when they pull me to the back I was told to listen to them. It was a loose loose situation until I finally just left. I would not work here again if given the option."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers, providing customer service, asking customers if they would like to sign up for the Walmart credit card. I learned how to run the registers up front. Some management I enjoyed working with. Others I did not. Some listened to what you needed to talk to them about. Others didn't seem to care. Nothing to hard  to learn or do at Walmart. I enjoyed seeing a customer leave happy."
good,"* Departamento de Auditoria Global permitindo mobilidade entre os mercados internacionais "
good,I learn some many different things while I was working in customer. Having patience is one of the most important things. I worked with some of the most amazing people.
good,we were too water the planets twice a day and make sure that the patio and also the inside customers must stay attended too .
good,I worked for Wal-Mart for seventeen years and during that time I had the opportunity to work with some truly amazing people.
good,"I did enjoy working with my fellow associates and wish I could have been a permanent employee , The store was clean and well stocked."
good,"I would go and work at Walmart helping people, unloading truck and putting items away where they belonged and then cleaning areas where it needed to."
good,"No loyalty with Walmart, no matter how dedicated you have been over the years.  No set schedule, that isn't ever altered. "
good,"The people you work with are amazing, but like most retail jobs it has many downsides. If you can handle a lot of cranky customers then you will be fine. They try their best to work around your life and give you the things you ask for. They love training you in new areas as long as you are persistent. I would work here again."
good,"I worked many hours there with no opportunity to advance! Moreover, I managed not only my department but other departments and received on extra pay."
good,"-A normal night on the job includes a lot of ""picking"" and ""binning""."
good,"Walmart is a company where associates maintain a fast pace and sometimes hectic work schedule.  My coworkers are focused more on the team’s success rather than on their own accolades.  The hardest part of my job is managing multiple projects.  However, it is fun to be able to work on something different and not be limited to the same project for multiple years.   The most enjoyable part of my job is that I can learn about multiple areas of store systems.  My team works on small projects, so I have the opportunity to work on something new."
good,"Walmart gave me the opportunity for advancement in my career. I learned so many skills for retail and customer service. Management let me share my vision by building sales for items that possibly are routinely overlooked by others. I was responsible for ordering,  maintaining and promoting these items. All jobs when first beginning seem hard until it becomes part of your routine.Overall I enjoyed my jobs at Walmart, especially the associates that I worked with."
good,"Non stop work from start to finish."
good,"It's a hard work/life balance being involved in Walmart."
good,My overall experience at Wal-Mart the best thing I looked forward too was working with the people around me. Everyone was like a family and got along well together. I also loved looking forward to talking to new people and helping others.
good,a typical day in walmart will be busy and fast paced. Management will teach you day to day functions and great co workers. the hardest part of job is juggling all the duties. most enjoyable part of job helping associates
good,"a typical work day begins at 10 or 11 with a group meeting of what was shipped to us and our assigned areas to work."
good,A typical day at work would be getting up early and going to a work enviornment where even though not everyone was the nicest person Id still keep my head up high. Throughout the day I wold assist customers on where to go if they needed to buy a specific item while at the same time trying to keep the dressing room clean and helping cutsomers get in an out of there. What I learned there was to be patient and know how to multi-task. My co-workers werent the nicest but that never stopped me from getting my job done. The hardest part of the job was working with some of the people there beacuse they were not very respectful and were never really happy and Im the complete opposite. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing a good job or getting a good on ya from my boss every now and then.
good,"They let you work around your schedule, on the job training, good people work there, great place for someone out of high school to start getting work experience."
good,it was good customer service experience and meet differnt types of people the pay was to low for the work and hours the hours were not consistent and days off to work for daily life
good,"Start with making sure floor is filled, which includes making subs salads. going and getting freight in a timely manner and making sure put away properly, which includes making inventory labels and using the binning process. helping customers with slicers and hot case. cooking food when needed. organizing inventory once a month. My immediate supervisor is hard working and helps with anything that is needed when not doing her work. my co-workers are all hard working and we work well together. The hardest part is simply getting 40 hours of work. And the most enjoyable is making sure my customers get what they want and what they paid for."
good,"A typical day is picking back room Items for the sales floor. unloading trucks, and assisting customers as needed.  Coworkers are generally accepting."
good,"For the most part I loved working for the company itself. I was offered the promotion of Co-Store Manager, but turned it down due to already working 13-18 hour shifts 7 days a week. With the proper management this is a great place to work, but with a leader who's own personal life isn't in order chaos is sure to come. I served under some great Store managers, and received Exceeds expectations from them all, but I've also served under a very unorganized store manager, and that's when working all those days, and hours were no longer fun, A career should come as second nature, and should be something you love and I love retail."
good,If you don't have patience this job is not for you. Only thing I liked was the pay and meeting new people. The manager I had that was over the front end was rude and she had her people picked. I worked part time but I barely got any hours. I asked to be full time and they never did even when I opened up my availability. Overall I would never work for them ever again.
good,Working there always gave me  a chance to meet new people and learn new things. The management was tough but teamwork was defiantly required to succeed.
good,"I enjoy working for wal-mart supercenter.The availability to learn and advance in the company.The benefits of 401k,stocks,and my share profits.Our human resource department has the best employees and have whats best for us.I love the job i did and enjoyed my customers."
good,Walmart isn't really a job I would recommend anyone to go to. They do not have a union so any job trouble you get in to you are pretty much on your own.
good,"Walmart is a an easy-going place to work. The actual work process is enjoyable and calm at times. The only downfall is management requesting a short staff without the proper equipment to complete all tasks that need to be done. The hardest part of the job is the amount of work that needs to be done while the most enjoyable part is working. My co-workers make the job tolerable. The typical day at work includes me sweeping around the store until break comes,scrubbing the floors or cleaning the bathrooms after the store closes,and helping others in other positions until it is time to go home. I have learned while working at Walmart to always get all of my work done and to stay positive because when I do that co-workers and maybe even management return the favor."
good,I started working there as a Stock Clerk and was transferred to the Floor Team where we would keep the floors buffed and cleaned and looking good. I was told by my team lead to strip the floor and my boss told me he did not tell the team lead to have it done so I was thrown under the bus and terminated for just following directions of the team lead
good,Great if your looking for an opportunity to advance within the company. Career growth is restricted to store level unless your willing to move out of state to corporate headquarters.
good,"My hours at work are Fri-Sat 5 am-2 pm, and Sun-Mon 5 am-9 am, varying depending on vacations. I enjoy my job greatly, by I do not enjoy the compensation, or the fact that I work every, single weekend, missing my children's ballgames and dance recitals, etc. There are only 2 of us in accounting, and she has every weekend off, and I see no fairness in that. I am also very limited on the hours I receive, so I struggle financially, which makes my daily life a struggle. I want to get to where I can live on a more comfortable basis, spend more time with my family, and be happier overall."
good,"a steady work environment that relies on your people person skills. "
good,"Many things can be said about being a manager at the world's largest retailer, but one thing I am proud to take away is how much I grew as an employee. I learned that the sum is greater than the whole of its parts, meaning that working as a team achieves much and more than any individual can even dream of. I learned that I can handle multiple managers asking me to do very different tasks and in the end how to make everyone happy."
good,"Walmart is an excellent career choice for people who intend to retire from the company. Promotions and job changes are readily available if one's work ethic is sound. Unfortunately, though, that is not always the case. There is rampant favoritism among upper level management but there should not be a problem if you do as you are told, even if the directions do not make the most sense. Co workers are the best part about the job, as you get to meet so many people, and most of them come to work wanting to make a difference. The hardest part of being a department manager is not actually being able to manage much. Some assistant managers are not entirely competent in how they want the departments ran. While those issues can be quite frustrating, those with a strong work ethic and good interpersonal skills,skills in problem solving and conflict within the workplace will likely excel."
good,"Era gostoso trabalhar lá. Tem grandes chaces de crecimento, gerencia não tinha do que me quixar, todos profissionais, colegas de trabalhos todos trabalhavam unidos, bom quando a gente gosta do que faz não vê as coisas dificies e sim como aprendizado. O walmart foi uma lição de vida pra mim."
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of operating the register, helping customers with things that they needed, putting up stock on the shelves where it belonged, and also cleaning up around my register and pulling all items forward. Having this job as a cashier and sometimes a stocker made me learn how to manage my time with doing certain things throughout the day although I had different jobs to get done. The management before we opened was okay, but once we opened and they got close to certain people, they were unfair to many others. While working at Walmart,, my co-workers were very nice to work with when we were allowed to work in teams to get a job done. Although the hardest part of my job was to try to operate the register while stocking items that I was told by management to stock that were in areas that weren't close to the register. I also enjoyed working there because of the benefits and the customers as well."
good,"I am a detailed worker, I need no or very minimal supervision, I can look at a task and immediately know what to do to complete the daily task I am given. I assist all levels of management because I have a very strong work ethic."
good,"Stay on the register the entire shift"
good,It was a nice job but they wanted you to get too much done in little time. Plus management didn't care they just wanted it done.
good,"•	Exceeded customer expectation by being knowledgeable about the different products"
good,Wal-mart has been a good place to work at but a lot of things have become corrupt in the company. Lacking of knowledge in some  situations have caused the store to crash and start to forget about its associates and focus more on things that don't really matter. As a department manager i  would think that i deserve more pay then someone who is just starting and only given the task to stock the shelf. Everyday i am going into work slaving just to come into work the next day and do it all over again. I don't mind doing it because obviously i need the money for bills and other things but if i had another income i wouldn't see myself working there anymore. Its not just one department manager that feels that way it is literally everyone who has the title of a department manager. We are all underpaid and now that positions in the company are being canceled more work is being pushed on us while upper management sits in offices and enjoys a cup of coffee everyday. Wal-mart as a job is good for someone who maybe doesn't need the money as bad or is looking to use up some free time but other then that it is not where you want to be if you want a career.
good,"A great place to work, really enjoyed working with the public. Learned a lot and it was easy to learn within the company. Everyone was helpful about teaching me how to work the front end to the back stock room"
good,"Empresa que ensina a como lidar com pessoas, em diversas situação do cotidiano."
good,"stock merchandise on backroom shelves "
good,We separate the brick packs which are containers with product from different departments then we go to the department that is assigned to us.We separate the product according to the aisle it is in then we place it on the shelf and do the zoning at the same time.I realized that working together as a team will get the work done faster so that we can concentrate on doing quality work.My co-workers work at different paces so we work together so that we can help them from falling behind.My manager is easy to get along with.He is patient and he listens and try to fix the problem if there is one.The hardest part of the job is not enough workers.The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the results from the hard work that we put in.
good,Walmart is a work environment that is based on how you work. If you are a lazy worker it is going to be a difficult job. But if you come in do your work and not complain it is not a hard job. To me there isn't a hard job in Walmart just associates make it hard.
good,"Great place for a part time job or a second job. Walmart has a grate work environment and workers that will work together to complete a task,"
good,"Clearly identifiable work objectives."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar ambiente bom."
good,My typical day at work usually consist of coming in and briefly touching base with other associates that also work in my area to see what lose ends need to be tied if any. After hearing where we currently stand I will try to fill in the blanks or cover breaks and lunches if need be. Other wise I will help the cashiers with the lines if any or work on putting returned merchandise back on the shelves. I get along pretty well with my fellow co-workers as I have been working with those in my department for the last 7 to 8 years. Management varies being that there are several managers and some are on call at different times and days. Sometimes it can get a little confusing because all the managers tend to handle and require you to handle certain situations differently. The hardest part of my job would be handling certain situations according to how the managers that are present at the time would want me to handle it.
good,It has its ups and downs. I liked working with my regular customers. I would go back and work for the company if I don't find another job.
good,"A typical day at was staying busy, and helping customers. I've learned to work hard and fast per management. I enjoyed working with a team that works together. my hardest part of my job was working nights and the best part of my job was I accomplished my job duties at the end of the day."
good,"Very busy place to work. Always have enough work to keep you busy all night, which is good, because makes the day go quick. Employees are awesome, which makes it easy to work, and talk to anybody."
good,Most enjoyable part of job is helping customers. We hava a large population of self pay patients and trying to help them budget their healthcare dollars is rewarding.
good,"I make sure guns, ammo cases, and knife cases are filled. Assist with filling merchandise, and work with customers in sales."
good,Management was good for the most part except when managers from other departments would come into another and start managing before they knew what was already going on in that department. Otherwise friendly good atmosphere where one could learn some good skills.
good,"Able  to work with others, staff worked as a Team, showed proper use of Pest control chemicals, proper use of protective gear, had sufficient personnel and supplies for job sites. Staff members assisted with teaching new members proper use of chemicals and equipment for jobs. Members assisted with prepping of materials and supplies for job sites."
good,"After having been employed by Wal-Mart for nearly four years, I have learned to manage multiple tasks, many associates, and customer service quite fluently. Retail is a job that conditions you to a fast-paced, high-stress environment, yet it also lays the groundwork for you to move on to bigger and better things."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart has the same routine, except different and some loyal customers on a different day. Working there I have met many different kinds of people both racial and couture. Hardest part of the job was not having the full training in most of the departments, but the enjoyable part was meeting the right person with the right knowledge of that department to be able to learn from."
good,Pues atravez de esta empresa aprendi o mas bien me di cuenta que tambien soy bueno para las ventas y que se me facilita la prospeccion de clientes asi como  ofrecer productos no fisicos
good,Loved working at walmart but little pay but great room for advancement. Spent a year at walmart before moving on to something better and more challenging.
good,"it wasn't a bad job, just management would tell you different things and would make people look bad by telling you to bend the rules in front of the customers."
good,A very fast night was always in store. Management was ok at best. Hardest part was the whole staying up to make it through the night but that got easier as time went on. It was a typically laid back type of job to have for a night job. Do the work and go home. My biggest problem was a coworker of mine who happened to be my partner in the frozen foods and it was a bunch of pressure as well to make that area look good from management.
good,first thing I do is check sales and backroom for freight. then I check bam screen for price changes. Usually check to see who is working with me then plan my day as far counting outs/lows for departments. Zone floor to make sure their was work left from overnight. I then order if I am out of the merchandise.
good,"While at Walmart, I learned about a lot of different areas of the retail and customer service environment. It is also pretty easy to learn quickly."
good,Good hourly start rate 17.30. 3-4 days per week 10-8 hours days depending on shift. average 30 hrs a week no overtime. Fun place to work I would go back if I had to
good,start at 3am get done about 5pm 2 breaks one lunch travel a lot traveling is a must gone any where between 3-7 days+ at a time
good,"There is a lot of work and not enough people in a day at times. The long hours are hard on anyone but not seeing family is even harder. I believe that is why I learned so much, not enough people to work the areas."
good,a typical day at work is slow in the morning  busy around lunch time and after four thirty when its time for people to get off work. i learn how to do a series of things i crossed trained just about every where in the store  the management is pretty cool and understanding at times my co workers are decent i pretty much stay to myself the hardest part of the job is nothing and everything is enjoyable
good,I had a good experience at first till they accused me and messed my record up and now its hard for me to find a job. and they hire new people and find reason to fire the old workers for more new people
good,"My duties for work constantly varied day to day."
good,hardest part of your job is having to bit your tongue when you have a rude customer. enjoyable part is for me being able to interact with the community.
good,a emprAesa é boa de trabalhar masi nao oferece muitos benefiicios
good,"Uma grande empresa de renome, com geente de diversas idades, culturas. Boa para aprender a trabalhar em equipe, e resolver problemas que as vezes parecem ser impossíveis de solucionar."
good,"we were always understaffed and expected to run to to day normally, other department manager made my days at wal-mart. The assistant manager switched up alot which didnt allow you to bond."
good,"It was a good job environment with little downtime. Spent most of the day working inventory and making sure everyone stayed busy."
good,"As an inventory associate my job is directly influenced by everyone else doing their job correctly. The more people that over-order items or don't take care of their shelf mods in order to get the product out of the backroom, the harder my job gets. In a store where the management team seems lack-luster in these areas it leaves me feeling bitter sometimes about the job."
good,It was very fast pace. I enjoyed my co-workers. Sometimes dealing with the public could be challenging but overall it was a pretty cool place to work.
good,"Multicultured environment, professional growth to some extent. Salary is at the bottom level. Have to work in an easy as well as complex environment."
good,"es tranquilo "
good,"I have worked at Walmart nearly a year and it's not a bad place to work. The employees are nice, the managers are easy to talk to, the pay is decent, and the hours good. You'll either get 32 hours a week or 40, which ever you prefer."
good,"My typical day at work consists of ringing up customers items. Handling money and or card transactions. I've learned basic money handling skills, customer service skills, how to set up different displays, etc. Most management does their job well, and helps associates and customers. I love my coworkers, fun to work with. Hardest part of my job is dealing with unfriendly, unruly customers. Most enjoyable part is being involved with different people."
good,"Co-workers were friendly and supportive, and people were not only to work hard but also enjoyed a lot of fun time together."
good,I loved the job and all the different duties I got to do. My only issue was with certain supervisors and how they treated the employees. There was many complaints against a certain supervisor and there were no repercussions for that supervisor. The other employees were awesome though it was a very happy place.
good,"After a few months of training, I began At the Seekonk MA store as an Assistant Manager. Having been hired from outside the company (most new A.M.s worked there way up through the company), I had much still to learn. I began in softlines, moved to domestics and hardware while in Seekonk. I transferred to the Fairhaven MA store, where I was put in charge of the Front-End. That includes all the cashiers, Customer Service Reps, Service Desk, Door Greeters and Shopping cart/ carry out asssociates. I also was responsible for the cash office (that requires counting the outgoing deposits daily). In total this was about 150 associates in my charge: by far the most of any other Assistant. I was responsible for scheduling them weekly, completing annual reviews, and of course getting to know them, and their work habits, so that I could better help and coach them if necessary. "
good,"Every job has it's good and its bad points. Its all in what you make it."
good,Learned even more about marketing and customer service.  Liked working with co-workers and I like helping customers.  Being able to meet people from all over the United States and abroad.
good,"This Job Was Fun & Taught Me A lot. But The Managers Were Unfair & Didn't Care About Safety Hazards. My Typical Days Were Relaxing & I Always Tried To Find Ways To Learn New Things. The Co-Workers Were My Friends & We Got The Job Done As A Team & As individuals. Everyone Loved To Come Get Me To Give Them A Hand With Whatever Their Doing. Customers Loved Me, Supervisor Always Told Me I Was Her Right Hand & She Always Talked About How Hard I Worked & Promotion. Overall I Loved It"
good,"A typical day was pretty enjoyable,I helped people with items and information and maintained the parking lot. My customers and co-workers were outstanding."
good,Working at Wal-Mart was a great first retail job experience for me.  I learned quite a bit from many different areas of the store.  I got along with all my managers and coworkers.
good,"Most days the store was swamped or empty, and rarely in between. I learned how to quickly and politely figure out exactly what a customer wants, and how they want it done. Most days management was finding out what area needs help and who was able to go there. I never had a problem with the coworkers, in fact most of the time it was mutual venting of the days hardships. The best days were usually when I would be sent outside to fix something."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of coming in early, picking up items off the floor in department, grabbing your carts to put items back onto the shelves, etc. Going to cash office to pick up your cash for the till and counting at beginning and end of shift.  Making sure your area you work in is clean, safe and tidy at all times."
good,"Walmart me Brindo la posibilidad de crecer personal y profesionalmente,Me dio la posibilidad de Ser Líder de Grupo lo Cual me dejo una Experiencia muy buena. Aprendí a Valorar cada momento al lado de mi familia , ya que pasaba mucho tiempo dentro de la compañía.Lo mas positivo de la compañía es la cultura walmart, la cultura que se vive es muy buena.-"
good,It is a nice place to work and I enjoyed myself making new friends and learning new things that help me grow into a better person.
good,Co workers were very good.  Liked the big box atmosphere.  Customers loved the store I worked in.  Benefits were good.  Like to seasonal changes in the departments
good,"Working at walmart there was always something new, which was exciting, i enjoyed being a cashier, having the constant contact with our costumers. I also enjoyed working in the bakery, fixing the french bread and all the bake'd goods. I always felt like i never knew what to do because there were so many people telling how to do the same thing so many different ways, and when i was working in the bakery i   didn't the training i thought that i needed. i was left alone way before i even felt comfortable on what they had me doing. There was no real hard part of working at Walmart other than i just was unaware of what they wanted me doing, there were too many employees there at one time, which was clogging up the front end, and the management was aware of many inappropriate situations and still did nothing about them. The most enjoyable part of this job was doing the store set up. Build the inside of the store the way that they wanted. i enjoyed setting up the check out stands and well as the isles."
good,working at Walmart you learn quick how the employees are. i have watched countless times employees mark down 20 dollar items for 89 cents. no matter how many managers you tell they say they will take care of it and literally do nothing. I've seen this first hand multiple times. Another thing is there customer service. They are straight horrible. What is the point of great prices if you cant enjoy going into the store. Every time you turn around there is nothing on the shelves and the employee is NEVER in there spots. Don't get me wrong Walmart has very good prices but! but if it were up to me the attitudes of every employee would change. There are some very nice people out there but i don't think great prices is what shopping is all about. and can i ask why Walmart isn't even run by the family of Walton's anymore? or at least that's what i heard. and why does everybody always wait to the last minute to get things done? get it done before the big bosses come around so your not killing the employees getting everything clean and ready for them to come in.
good,My employer is Walmart. Its an okay place to work and they do offer a really good chance for advancement. My main complaint is that I work at a Walmart that is in a bad area.
good,"A typical day at work would begin with a meeting at 10PM where the managers told us what needed to be done at what time it needed to be done. Then I would start my night by down stacking pallets of merchandise placing the boxes in the aisles they belong in. Next I would start in the aisles I had been assigned in and stock the merchandise, after I would clean up my area by picking up boxes and removing any trash and pallets off the floor for customer traffic. by the time I finish cleaning up, the store would open at 5AM and I was assigned to the cash register. If I was not assigned the register that night then I would ""zone"" the aisles I had been assigned meaning making the merchandise look presentable and face forward to be easily viewed by customers. I have learned many things working for Walmart. I learned how to use the cash register, down stack pallets, and I was the only person in my area of the store that knew how to do ""break packs"" for the over the counter pharmacy section. My coworkers were very helpful and I made a lot of friends working there. The hardest part of the job was when the store always over ordered and we ended up having 2 people responsible for 72 hours of freight needing to be worked. Not including cleaning up and zoning the store. Id have too say the most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made while working there and the simplicity of the job."
good,"Me deu oportunidade de exercer todas as atividades que precisei."
good,40 to 33 hrs a week is consider full-time. the health insurance is one good thing..Some days are really busy like holidays and others are really slow... really good job if your a teenager..
good,alot of work wich made the day go by really quick. didnt always get teated with the same respect as the other employees. we unloaded the producgt from the truck and palletized it then brought it out to their designated ares.
good,"Id start in the morning and work till the evening helped around in the shop on cars like putting air pressure, vacuuming, wiping windows write up other cars for services like fuel injections, head light restorations, Learned how to change oil, how to do fuel injections, headlight restorations, proper air pressure in each type of vehicles, what type of oil a car takes, Coworkers were great even if we had a few differences or butted heads, they taught me more then just about  work related stuff. Hardest part would be leaving that area and moving up and moving to a new state.  Meeting new customers was probably the most enjoyable part met alot of different people from different places."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the customers.  They are always friendly and smiling.  The pay could be better and the medical benefits aren't as good as some other companies.  I truly enjoyed my job and the hard work it took to do it.  There is great opportunities for advancement provided you have proven to be a hard worker and reliable as with any job.  I learned a great deal about inventory control and the process of on hand stock, incoming stock, mark-ups and mark-down percentages as well as the profit margins."
good,"I worked as a fitting room attendant. I was in charge of 5 fitting rooms and 5 phone lines as well as intra-department and managerial pages, along with sorting the returns for individual departments within the apparel section."
good,Working at Asda as a my first formal job was great. I learnt loads about retail and customer service and worked as a part of a great focused team.
good,"The work days were alright most were really slow because I worked nights. I did a lot at Walmart like stocking shelves, cashier, and back room unloading. The management was unorganized and did not want to be there so it was hard to know what to get done. I had great and funny co-workers. The hardest part was to get motivated. But I enjoyed my work time making people smile."
good,"Everyone was so friendly towards eachother as if we were all a family, Management were very hardworking but overall i feel as though Walmart under pays employees."
good,Overnight co-workers are a good team to work with including management. I've learned to have more patience with the public. I enjoy being able to assist the public with their daily needs. The hardest part of my job is the heavy lifting and pulling the heavy pallets.
good,"Fast paced, flexible scheduling, teamwork. Stocking shelves and creating and following pick lists."
good,As a training coordinator I was able to have plenty of time to be cross trained through the store.  The great thing is there is plenty job options for advancement and improvement.
good,Working at Walmart pharmacy you enter and interpret presciptions from doctors.  Fill prescriptions and assist the pharmacist.  Some compounding and emulsions.  Cash Handling customers
good,"Although the work environment will be different depending on the Distribution Center, DC7016 was a wonderful place to work and a very co-worker friendly environment in the beginning.  After a 2 years our GM passed away from medical issues, since that time this building has been having issues with retaining any of its long-term associates.  What use to be a fun place to work has now become a place you dread walking into knowing that the rules will change daily from the management staff.  Also watch out for the occasional removal of a job position and being forced to a no position, a few weeks to months later your old job will be available but not to you since your locked into the new position for 6 months, according to company policy."
good,"They keep most workers part time so you never know how many hours you will get from week to week. This is a decent job if your just looking for some extra money but having to rely on this place as a sole source of income is not fun. Culture is somewhat toxic most workers are not happy to be working there. Efforts by the company to make the place seem fun are lame. Having to do the Walmart cheer at the end of daily meetings in the middle of the store while customers shop is kind of demeaning because we all look like goofs.    Pay is famously low, but really that's how it is in most retail environments."
good,"I worked here in high school. As an adult walmart would not be able to properly support me. Walmart worked fine while I was in high school, actually I would end up socializing a lot there so I look at that as a plus."
good,"Checked in with Supervisor, followed instructions, greeted customers and associated in a friendly manner,responsibly, time management. "
good,Definately a place to work if you love to meet new people every day. I love working here my co-workers are nice and easy to get along with. Management not so good. They don't listen and understand problems in the work area.
good,"Ringing up customers"
good,"go in at 4pm, no big deal, would get off whenever job was complete, but they wouldnt give you any detail about how much more was  to be done.  Management changed quite often, so about the time you would get used to one, another would show up.  hardest part of the job, nothing really hard about it, for the most part was always simple.  Enjoyed working with my co-workers, they were always friendly and easy to work with."
good,"Basically returns, where things were, none were on the same page, some were okay, and some of them thought they didn't have to do much, communication between management and employees, making a customer smile and the interactions."
good,"My typical day would start at 7am and consisted of the minutes from management. Management would prepare all notes that needed to be taken care of throughout the day for mine and surrounding departments. I had to order inventory daily and prepare for sales and holiday events. My co-workers were awesomely supportive, we worked together to ensure management had everything completed by the end of the day. My employees worked hard to overcome disabilities and other short comings to help accomplish the tasks.  The hardest part of the job was having everything completed by 4pm daily and not having over time at the end of the week. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the job complete at the end of the day."
good,"Amadureci muito trabalhando nesta empresa, desenvolvi minha resiliencia e meu jogo de cintura. Aprendi muito a lidar com pessoas e passei a gostar lá da palavra logistica. Vivenciei e profundamente o temo ""Estoque""."
good,Wal-mart is great as an entree level job. Hours are good evn tho pay was barely over minimum wage. its a good job to learn customer service skills.
good,"llegaba a las 8:30 era mi hora de entrada, Checo mi entrada con mi tarjeta, y me dirigía a mi lugar de trabajo que eran las cajas, tenia que ver que mi caja estuviera limpia y en buen estado, saludaba a mi supervisor, y me disponía a trabajar."
good,"Don't expect much out of Whataburger....or any fast food joint for that matter. It's a very routine and mundane occupation. Be prepared to work over 7 hours a day, with no guarantee of a break--and only 30 minutes of it at that. On the plus side, there are many opportunities for promotions, you get evaluations every 6 months, and the half-percent off discount on food is always a nice accommodation."
good,"The main reason that I left Stimson was to find a job with a shorter commute, with less chances of hitting a wild animal of some sort. Pristina Pine wasn't a bad job, but the management left a lot to be desired, when I left it was because of the fact that the bank had taken over and was in the process of shutting down and liquidating the mill."
good,"We would ull the pallets off the truck and put them away in their proper department."
good,"its a good place, some people are friendly other are not. management could be a bit better ..but everyone has favorites. overall nice place to work overnight. the hardest part is the walking back and forth and lifting up pounds of product being a female it takes a little more effort, but it can be done. the most enjoyable part is the hour break :) and the nice employees who are friendly all around. I learned how to use a hand gun, work the wake (a machine that goes up and down and drives like a car) and work pallet jacks. how to pick and bin merchandise and food products. a typical day at work is coming in at 10pm and having a overnight meeting then separating to either GM (GERNERL MERCHANDISE)  side or GROCERY side to start picking things out the system for the stockers to work. bring the picks out before 3 and go to break ..come back at 4am to start binning new freight and old ..everything must be off the floor by 7:00am before you go home. that's my typical day at Wal-Mart being a overnight IMS associate. like I said overall good place to work but just has a few tweaks to be fixed within the store."
good,"Since there are many employers, they can schedule your shifts to times that are suitable for you. The managers are not strict but also ensures each department has at least one employee to help customers find what they need. The co-workers and managers care about the people they work with"
good,My co-workers & I work long hours to provide Canadians with viable shopping options so they can live better. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of providing our Associates answers to questions they may have regarding their employment.
good,"Typical day- busy until around evening then slows down"
good,Everyone employed at the Wallaceburg Walmart Supercentre are very professional and productive. It feels like one very large family.
good,"Stable job with good pay, be ready to work not just in your department but around the store as well. Management is still growing now that a new store manager is there , that aspect of this job needs improvement."
good,"pushing carts cleaning the bathrooms "
good,"-Spent most of my time taking care of customers and keeping my cash register clean"
good,"On a typical day at work, I would literally run through out the whole shift trying to get my job completed because of the high overload of customers for the store as compared to staffing, it made things challenging on me.  I met my goals everyday, but I worked hard to get there.  I learned I could push myself physically to attain goals that I didn't know I could do.  I had a wonderful manager that would work with my crazy schedule (at the time) and was business-wise; we constantly made increase in sales while he was the manager and he was fair, and professional.  The next manager was all about production and went strictly by the schedule, she was biased to those that met her standards.  My co-workers were hard working individuals that could do miracles in production.  The hardest part of the job was baking the bread, it has certain specks that had we had to strictly go by for public health and safety, and yet you had to have your product ready for sale at a certain time.  I pushed myself to do this and it made it even harder when an employee wouldn't do their part and I had to take up the slack.  The most enjoyable part was at the end of the day when you look back and see what you have accomplished and say, ""did I do that?"" and hold your chin up and tell yourself, ""yes, I did."""
good,Managers are nice and helpful.  Fellow associates communicate well.  I've learned better time-management skills.  This position replaces the need for a gym membership.
good,"unload trucks by hand ,sort and palletize. unload pallets with electric pallet jack, forklift, and pallet jack. bring sorted pallets to departments. do picks for departments and bring to floor."
good,A typical day at work would involve stocking shelves in different departments. I've learned to move as quickly as possible getting everything in the right place. The most enjoyable part of the job helping the customers.
good,helping customers on the sales floor with questions and purchases and helping out on the cash register while maintaining a safe and clean working enviorment. i learned proffesional courtesy and willingness to take pride and responsibility for my work.
good,"To be honest the mentality shown at Walmart is not entirely the fault of the store managers or any of the store level management. The way this operate in a Walmart large or small are for the customer to view the store as having tons of variety and for store managers to operate within their budget they hire employees for one task knowing full well they will be expected to juggle work."
good,Typical day at work is filled with multi tasking and helping customers with everything they need. Having the customer leave with a smile on their face is my goal and to get all my task at work done. Co-workers are amazing and all work well together. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and that the work crew is like a family.
good,I liked building things and working by my self. I worked in back had my own area and listened to the radio while working. Management didn't bother me. Only thing is its Walmart so the pay wasn't very good.
good,"Was always asked to do more then anyone should be though there is nothing wrong with going above and beyond there is a limit to how much can be expected from one person."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is all about how you control your attitude towards everything. Dealing with customers and their needs can sometimes be a hard thing, but it will also make you feel good to know you're helping someone."
good,If you want a stable job in the optical field then Wal-Mart is the place to go. If you have even the slightest ambition you will succeed. I don't like being forced to go to lunch by a certain time limit. The Vision Center has many opportunities to eat during the day and getting the job done.
good,"I found from working at Walmart that I do not enjoy retail work. However, I am grateful for the experience. I learned a lot and now have a better appreciation for people that do work in retail. I learned quite a bit about the business side of Walmart from attending the daily meetings. They are good about sharing information with their employees."
good,"The job itself is tiring and demanding. Not that that's a bad thing. However there are times you are asked to do the impossible, and when you don't meat that Impossible standard You get beat down for it. "
good,"Tener buen ambiente con mis compañeros, así  tener un buen día de trabajo relajado. A fin de turno  asistir al comedor para platicar como nos había ido ya que elaborábamos en diferentes oficinas y cámaras de perecederos."
good,Lots of good experiance in retail. Not overly demanding. Not the greatest compensation package
good,"Very busy and time flies by so fast. i learn how to stock,price,clean shelves,zone and bail cardboards. Managers are alright but i wish they appreciates their employees more. I love my co-workers,we were the fun shift. The hardest part was, it was very physical that i was so run down by the end of the day. the most enjoyable about it,is we get to see people destroy what we made all pretty at night"
good,"Walmart cashiers operate cash registers at the front of the stores, greeting customers warmly as they make purchases. They scan all items, process cash, check and credit card transactions and deactivate security devices on bags and items purchased. During busy periods, baggers are usually available to help the cashier pack and load customers' purchases in carts; otherwise, you must do the honors. As a Walmart cashier, you maintain the required amounts of cash in your registers and request price checks when necessary. You also verify customers' ages when they buy restricted merchandise such as beer or wine. Cleaning work areas and returning merchandise to shelves and racks are other responsibilities of the Walmart cashier. "
good,"i learned to stock shelves correctly, using the UPC's and brand types.  I learned how to use a cashier in two days, was hard to understand at first, then when put to the test, it was handled well."
good,I enjoyed my co-workers a lot. They say they will work with your school schedule but that it a lie. The raises was nice.
good,I had great co-workers. We had a lot of fun at work. I've worked at several Wal-Marts and liked them all.
good,I worked overnight and I barely interacted with customers. It taught me teamwork and leadership skills. I would not say my job was hard. It was just very particular which any job should be. The only thing i disliked about the company was they were not consistant. The part I enjoyed about the workplace was every one was got along and worked together.
good,"Management could work on letting people know when someone does a good job, and not always focusing on the bad. Overall like working there, people i worked with, and being able to help customers made the day easier."
good,"Wal-Mart is an excellent company to work for providing you want to make a 35 to 40 year career at retail 'warehouse' sales with a tract to be promoted from the inside.  But, part time work is not what it could be given the employee culture I experienced on the graveyard.  Management was awesome...but I could not overcome the 20 year age gap with me being the senior in age given the average age of the stocking employees.  Yet, Wal-Mart management creates a teamwork environment whereby an 16 to 18 year old individual may advance from the floor into management which is a good model when structuring a vertical chain of management based on seniority and merit together."
good,"my job wasnt to the point of being impossible, despise the backroom where i had to clear out the lingering useless items, but what i enjoyed most about my job was helping the customers. i left smiles upon their faces, even some hugs. that made me feel special, that im doing the right thing. something that i love to do. the co workers were like your average people, only few who remain to be professional. when it comes to management, i did not really favor because they were not available always. the uroganization was frustrating but i remained calm to finish my duties the best way i can even taking heat."
good,"my last position was an order fulfillment sales associate (Site2Store), basically taking care of online orders off the walmart website. Receiving the packages, binning the packages, when customer comes to pick up their order, I look up their last name, check identification and give them their package, took telephone calls, Picked merchandise (PUTs) Pick-up Todays, where a customer can order something online that we have in stock in the store so we get the item for the customer and they may come pick it up at our store."
good,"I am a hard worker, productive. Always on time or early for work. Fast learner. And love learning new thing. Very adventurous when learning something. Not afraid to ask questions."
good,"Gostei da empresa. Meu primeiro emprego foi lá e realmente, gostei de todas as experiências que obtive dentro dela."
good,"Mainly worked as a team, maintain your area clean and neat. Around holidays it gets so busy and hectic, have a flexible schedule around holidays because a lot of hours are given."
good,It all depends on which WalMart you work for. Each is different and implements their own rules.
good,"While Walmart has a bad rep, I actually like working there for the most part. I have made more friends there than any other job."
good,A typical day was building shelves and adding them to the floor. I learned how to put a shelf together. I learned how work well with people in a short ammount of time.
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you have another income. The hours vary from week to week. It is not a reliable income.
good,"I was a cashier so everyday consisted of clocking in then asking the manager at the front what register you would be working unless I was working the returns desk that night. It could be slow or fast pace depending on how busy the store was, My co-workers for the most part were easy going."
good,Walmart would work if I were a bit younger and have no children.  I can't balance my life properly
good,Working with the public was fun and exciting. As well as working with my co-workers on a daily basis. I loved the work atmosphere. My managers were all cool. The down part of the job was there weren't as many hours I would have liked.
good,A typical day at walmart is steady rush of work with constant changes. While working at walmart i learned the meaning of teamwork and working amid multiple ethnic groups and cultural backgrounds. the hardest part of the job was sometimes having to wait for the freight delivery to get in and trying to keep busy. the most enjoyable part is constant customer change and being able to help make a customers day brighter by being able to get what they need or help find them a like item.
good,"Not bad for my first job. they are flexible with hours, they worked with my school schedule, they give you more hours and sometimes let you go overtime. but could use some more managers and more orginization"
good,it would be crowded at times but you wouldn't be overloaded because they would have enough people there to help with the work load
good,Good people and most Upper management will make time to hear any issues but seldom are those issues resolved in a timely manner.
good,the company per say was a good company to work for  just some of the people within in the sore was bad managementecept for the store manager and co-manager mr marlan
good,Great work conditions when properly staffed. Reasonable hours with low pay no matter the position. Highly unappreciated employees by management and no uniformedy between management(e.g. no two managers have the same set of rules and regulations.
good,"I greatly enjoyed this job mostly because of the respectful work environment and the fact that I was always busy. I loved my co-workers and the managers were great. My typical day at work involved me stocking shelves, but it was never boring because my co-workers and I also had to help customers as a part of our job, which is satisfying if you are someone who loves to help people. The hardest parts of my job was the fact that I was very tired after work and that the job security of being a temporary associate and the pay rate is sub par if this is your only source of income. Luckily for me I had my husband to bring in the income we needed to survive, but if that weren't the case then the pay rate and lack of job security would have been a big source of complaint. Overall, I greatly enjoyed the job overall because it kept me busy and gave me many opportunities to help people out. Also, having kind and friendly co-workers made the experience much more wonderful."
good,"althought walmart is one of the bigest reatail chains today there management has a little to be desired or at the walmart I was employeed with. I enjoyed my job meeting and helping people, unloading trucks but the management wasnt alway so readly avaliable to assist employees with resolutions."
good,"I enjoy the benefits of the discount at the store from being an employee. The work is not hard but is physically demanding. Management has a difficult time keeping morale up with changes in policies and the changes in standards for production. Quality is set at a high standard and is met on a regular basis but the quarterly results are not good enough for corporate."
good,I worked the dairy/frozen area for this company. The job was very fast past seeing as this was the most shopped area in the store.
good,"Always kept a smiling face to make the customers satisfied, also helped and always asked if they were finding everything ok or needed help with what they were looking for. my most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers and seeing there faces light up when I helped or just smiled at them."
good,"Daily I had to do price changes, order, and make sure the shelves stayed stocked. I did everything I could to make sure whatever the customers wanted or needed was regularly available. I loved the appreciation the customers had when you were able to help them and make their shopping experience that ,much better. A smile and a hello can go a long way in making someone's day."
good,"Everyday is different, dealing with customers and their complains "
good,"Working here was great for the most part , I loved the environment. I didn't like how the manager talked to me, very disrespectful."
good,"The hardest and great part is dealing with the costumers. Its overall a great place to work at. Its very family like, a home away from home. Ive enjoyed and will work there again.My  co workers were very helpful and always there for me"
good,"I work at the register.  I meet such a variety of people.  It's gets very busy during the day, and lines form at the registers.  At the Walmart in Burke, I've met many people that I hadn't seen in a long time. I've seen many old neighbors, classmates, teachers, school staff members that I remember. It's been like a reunion.  My coworkers are pretty diverse, but the majority are from South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh.  The hardest part is dealing with those supervisors that tend to be critical.  There is not much commendation given.  I love the customers."
good,A good place to work. 8 hr work day. I liked the people I worked with. Most of the management was good.
good,"I'm all about driving sales.  Identify and communicate ideas that will improve products and services to customers.  Promotes and supports customers efforts to exceeds expectations.  Adaptability demonstrates creativity and strength in the face of change, obstacles, and adversity.  Failure is not and option."
good,I used to love working here. The management team was very nice and they helped me accordingly. There was some issues along the way but everyone helped me catch up. My supervisor was extremely nice and she was very helpful. I absolutely miss working here although it was only temporary work.
good,The day starts with a happy smile. Go in greeting everybody with a good morning. Start the system just to be called to go help somebody or do what management says. Then when I start the system again I would have to wait around twenty minutes just to have somebody unlock a security door. The hardest part of the job is trying to do my job and help everybody else. I feel my co-workers often can be really lazy at times. The most enjoyable part of the day is the satisfaction I know im about to clock out and go home for the day.
good,"Typical day work is to print pictures and provide to customer service in photo lab electronics and connection center."
good,"buen ambiente laboral, cumplia diferentes tareas ya que estaba en el turno de 15/23 y había poco personal para cumplir dichas tareas. Mi trabajo consistía desde dar ingreso a camiones de proveedores, manejo de autoelevadores  asta la reposicion de mecaderia en el piso de vtas"
good,they will give you HOURS. your checks will be lovely and you wont start at minimum wadge plus over time. just be willing to deal with nagging managers and youre set.
good,"- Goal oriented daily work."
good,Fast paced and high volume; expect to be on your feet all day! but you get to interact with all shades of people...definitely great atmosphere for building customer service and interpersonal skills
good,I enjoyed my time working for walmart. meet a lot of great co workers
good,The work place is fun and safe. We all get along great as a team. Large amount of responsibility.
good,"En general la empresa es buena, aprendí que es la responsabilidad de tener personal a cargo, normalmente hay cambios constantemente, así como hubieron gerentes buenos, también hubieron sus excepciones, los compañeros con los que me toco trabajar siempre trabajadores y buenas personas.    "
good,a typical day at walmart would be very easy. sometimes it was stressful but at the end of the day i liked getting paid every couple weeks
good,"A typical day in my current position I through between 1 to 3 ares of freight, change features or any other special project management. "
good,"Walmart was a challenging work environment that often required you to work unsupervised and alone balancing your work area requirements and an never ending flow of customers."
good,"Co-workers are enjoyable and fun to talk to, but work can get hectic when management demands all tasks to be finished and the floor filled 100% before the end of your shift and you are the only associate working in the department."
good,The job itself is not hard it's fairly easy my only thing about it is some customers can be rude and the managements communications with other employees is terrible.
good,Left because was interfering with my college classes. Great supervisor but not enough money for work done.
good,"I showed up for work at 5 a.m. sometimes 4 a.m. depending on what they had for me to do that day. I typically did p.o.s. (put out stock) which means to put product out on the floor in its place. I learned that it was a little difficult to juggle a job, school and being a new single parent and that working in a place that deals with people is much more fun than i thought it would be. My department manager was a very good and caring person. He never gave us more than we could handle. He helped out with what he could when he was finished with his own assigned task. The hardest part of the job was putting stock into the freezer. Frozen food is heavy and not to easy to handle. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers. They were great to work with and everyone helped everyone."
good,Working for Wal-Mart is fine but there is no future here for me I have been working here for almost 2 years and I haven't really advanced much. The managers most times can be very condescensive and arrogant. I love my co workers they are very sweet and caring. Honestly the hardest part of this job is dealing with management.
good,"Walmart is a great starter job, or part time job. Working in the deli you dont deal with as many customers as the front of the store, however the tasks are very hard and your feel WILL hurt. Daily tasks include slicing meat and cheese, working the hotcase, cooking food for customer consumption as well as catering orders, taking apart slicing machines and cleaning the parts reassembling them. You will also be washing dishes cleaning glass cases and preparing rotisserie chickens every 30 minutes."
good,This was a great job for a college student to hold because they worked around my schedule.
good,"at a day at walmart its very fast paced and busy so you are moving all day non-stop and I also cash checks working in the money center, doing money grams, money orders, im also a cashier, I do customer service, layaway, hardware, customer service, front end, stoking."
good,You have to be there a long time if you want a decent pay. For the most part they work with your schedule.
good,You don't have to work there to know that it is not the best company to work for and management is horrible they help with nothing.
good,job is ok you will get your hours the pay is not very efficient
good,"Our store was great.  Walmart, as a company, is OK.  I was always treated with respect by the management (excepting one asst. mgr.)  My job was selling electronics and cell phones."
good,"individual effort is required most of the time, and the pay doesn't match the job"
good,"-Stressful work environment."
good,While at Walmart I was able to transfer and open a new warehouse.  Managed both in Regional DC and Grocery DC.  Worked well with the entire management team.
good,"Good place to work, Not the best pay rate, easy job good people to work with you work in a team, fast pace work."
good,I love the interaction with all the different customers.  They give a flexible schedule and good benefits.
good,"No need to explain the store was operatable met alot of good people, my job was not hard or difficult. My managers were good natured and thrived to make the day what it was."
good,There's never a typical day at work in retail. Always room to learn and move on. I learned how to interact well with others. I enjoyed being a department manager and had the opportunity to excel with my coworkers. A great bonding and a wonderful impact on my life made with many close friends. The hardest part of the job is all the physical demands and strenuous work it places on one throughout the years. I worked in a very demanding hands on store. The most enjoyable part is working with close friends.
good,I learned a lot about all the different cars and how they are built and how to deal effectively with the different types of customers.
good,"I worked in the deli and while I completely enjoyed the work and most of the people I worked with, management had little to no support to give if there was a problem. Somehow it always became the associates fault even when nothing had been done wrong by them."
good,"I worked 3rd shift which had its perks. The flow of customers at the beginning of the shift was sometimes overwhelming but was to be expected. If there were enough cashiers scheduled ."
good,Your typical days at Walmart are very busy. Long hours; different personalities and lots of movement.
good,I knew most of my coworkers and all of management was easy to get along with. They were not strict at all
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience. Interacting with and helping customers is what I do best. I was also recognized many times for my services. Coworkers and managers were also like family. But in the end, it paid too little to make a living. I highly recommend this employer to younger workers wanting to gain experience and senior workers wanting to make some extra money."
good,"1)Análise das vendas e indices. Atendimento ao público, entrada e saída de NFs e receitas no SNGPC. Entrada de NFs no sistema."
good,"Wal-Mart Canada, Windsor ON             "
good,"I work the 3rd Shift (Overnight) as a part-time ICS (Inventory Control Specialist) from 10pm-7am. I don't get to interact with customers as much so it can get a little boring in the backroom. Sometimes we get 2-3 trucks per night which can get a little overwhelming especially when stockers don't bring their overstock back earlier enough. On the other hand, we have plenty of slow nights where only 1 truck is scheduled and it can get pretty boring, and when I get bored I get sleepy. Management is ok, I have had no problems with my managers. Co-workers are ok as well, but you have to remember that everyone is not the same as you nor have the same likes and dislikes as you. The hardest part of the position is staying awake (after lunch is the worst for me) and the most enjoyable part is meeting different customers from all kinds of backgrounds when I can as well as working with co-workers from different backgrounds. I love to learn constantly so it's a pleasure that I enjoy whole-heartedly."
good,"-I've learned how to upload the merchandise on the racks and sales floor just by the barcode numbers on the merchandise and the shelves. "

good,"I enjoyed my job very much, I'm looking for a change, I have learned a lot through the years at my job, always open to change and new directions, enjoyed my time with fellow associates and loved to help others succeed at their jobs, gave help whenever it was needed the hardest part of the job was the lack of support from the upper management, if they didn't make sure associates were performing their jobs it had a huge impact on my areas, follow-up was much needed but often ignored, I enjoyed being the best I could be at what I accomplished every day, at work I believed in giving 100% at all times I have a drive to master whatever is asked of me."
good,This was a temporary job so I didn't get too familiar with it.
good,As employees and work colleagues everyone is supposed to help each other. at work/ At wal mart that is not the case especially if u work overnights. Nobody lends a helping hand you have to learn to overcome the toughest tasks and obstacles on your own.
good,"Every business builds on it's own set parameters. Walmart sets bars of standards and then deviates, without properly relaying the transitions to it's employees.  Work load increases while improperly staffing, causes customer and employee frustration."
good,To replenish the depleted shelves of the dairy department for the customers to shop. Help my fellow associates with there work when I am done with my work and customers.
good,"Cuando te pones la camiseta y sientes ese sentido de pertenencia a la empresa, tu trabajo lo ves como un pasatiempo agradable, como un hobby entretenido en donde percibes un salario por hacer lo que te gusta. Se aprenden valores que se utilizan dentro y fuera de la empresa. Las administraciones son las que cambian el ambiente laboral, ya que las maneras de trabajar se basan, en parte y la mejor, en democracia, en escuchar, en pedir aportaciones de mejora, en ser empáticos. La otra parte es solo soy la autoridad y se hace lo que digo. Y eso limita lo que se venía haciendo por nuestra empresa. Me gustó el mundo de personas que se conoce, que valoran tu esfuerzo, tu trabajo, que te buscan para ser atendidos por ti. Cuando te gusta lo que haces, no ves complicaciones, sino retos. Retos que te llevan a adquirir habilidades y mejora en tu compromiso. Todo es excelente. Y se hace hincapié. La administración es lo que modifica todo."
good,"um dia tipico de trabalho sempre com muitos desafios e oportunidades que tinham que ser resolvidas no dia."
good,My job is just what I want it to be.  I like working there and enjoy most of the customers.  I put my available hours and the management does adhere to that.
good,"My night at work began with my cleaning the management offices along with the personnel office and the bathrooms. I would then continue on to clean the vestibules and the entrance way carpets, and the warehouses. The management pretty much didn't hover around you unless they feel the need to because they feel you need it. Co-workers were good and acted as if they were really part of a team compared to everyone for themselves. The hardest part of the job was working overnights although I had done overnights before it was more difficult this time due to the fact that I know have a family and when I did overnights before I was single. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a management team that trusted their employees enough that they feel the need to hover around their employees making sure their tasks were completed."
good,I learned how to develop pictures. I also got to socialize with customers and make them happy.
good,I like the management team and the work is fun. The co workers get along well with each other. typical work day consist of unloading trucks and putting product on the sales floor while taking care of customers. The day goes by very quickly.
good,"pay is great for a first job. moving up to dept manager is fairly easy, you just need to prove you can take charge"
good,I enjoyed working there. The place was always clean and busy. the other employees were friendly. My only complaint with this company is at the management level. they hire in people right out of college with no work experience and it stops the chance for advancement within the company. this leads to employees quitting or finding better opportunities outside or the business
good,"Wal-Mart present it's workers with all kind of chances to learn."
good,"Your're always busy as a manager. Typical day consists of dealing with customer/associate issues, merchandising, training, viewing reports to prevent shrink, and stocking shelves."
good,"My biggest accomplishment was adapting and exceeding in a new company. Starting off as the underdog to three other supervisors who were previously with the company I had to prove myself to everyone. I proved the that I can handle the pressure and perfect time management with the store being busy and having to place orders with tobacco and candy.Everyday is a constant change in the store, whether it be with management, modules or the cashiers. I learned how to prioritize the way I worked to accommodate my changing work priorities. The most enjoyable part of my job is when my cashiers and customers are happy; without happy cashiers there aren't going to be happy customers. The proof that I am doing my job correctly is by seeing my regular customers. Everyday I deal with a multitude of challenging requests but I manage to excel on a regular basis. My experience with this company has taught me that I can do anything."
good,"Needs new management, but for an overall experience I have enjoyed working with Walmart and would consider being re-employed."
good,"Walmart was not a fun place to work, there was too much going on, wrong people in management and not enough time."
good,I met new people everyday while learning good management skills also the hardest part of the job was the customer always having to be right
good,Working with patients and assisting with his/her eye care needs. I learned how to interact with people from all walks of life. Management tried to work employees and his/her life outside the job. My co-workers and I worked well together. The most difficult part of the job was learning how to be patient with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being surrounded by my co-workers.
good,"walmart is a great company to work for. They provide a friendly, team oriented working environment. There are a lot of options for moving around within the company in order to meet your preference and work availability. There is also great opportunity for advancement."
good,"Wonderful co-workers , hard work, great benefits and you will learn patience."
good,"For the first 6 1/2 years I was a Pharmacy Tech and I loved that job. I spoke with Doctors and Insurance companies, typed prescriptions, filled prescriptions and kept all the Medications updated. I filed, faxed and had to multitasked with the phones and customers. I really liked my job. But eventually I needed a change and moved up front to be a cashier for a few more years. I learned something new every day and loved it. The hardest part of being in the Pharmacy was having to turn elderly people away that really needed their medication because they couldn't afford it."
good,"A typical day of work in a Walmart deli involves sorting, dating, and properly storing freight; providing customers with assistance and merchandise as well as doing a majority of our direct supervisor's job as delegated."
good,you can advance in these stores its a lot easier then some places
good,I gained plenty of customer experience within this job. The working environment wasn't that professional due to co-workers. This job wasn't difficult at all and I enjoyed interacting with the customers.
good,Days at work were mostly geared towards stocking the shelves and making sure the products looked presentable. I learned that hard work is never overlooked and teamwork is a big part in getting the job done. Management was good at times and not so good at times. I enjoyed working with the co-workers there everyone was upbeat and in good spirits. Hardest part of the job was trying to understand management and be productive. The most enjoyable part was the atmosphere that the co-workers made.
good,Good pay and good schedules. Their is no opportunity to grow or flex for change. Managers don't manage they follow a guideline so its the same format each day. Wal mart is such a big company that they dont really worry about the employees since they drag in billions each year.
good,"Working in Wal-Mart is demanding. Everyday, I get to meet different people with different needs. I have to help them find their item, explain the functions of the item, help with lifting, cash out people and answer calls if I have the opportunity to do so. My co-workers are cooperative and we help each other when we need it. The management is not that bad. Although they send us in other departments aside from our assigned department when the need arises. The most enjoyable part of this job is that I get to talk to different people and their cultures."
good,"Doing things very well and being oranized , have good customer care."
good,"start day by touring entire store looking for things that need to be fixed for better customer service. Once done you either 1) go back to your own areas of responsibility to do a detailed deep dive of your own areas or 2) you are duty manager for the day being responsible for entire stores reports, customer service calls and making sure checkouts are running smoothly."
good,"A typical work day involves dealing with a lot of customers with many different types of transactions."
good,I enjoyed working with people.  A typical day at work was very high paced and sometimes frustrating .
good,"Un día típico: Sacar la operación de toda la tienda con pocos asociados, buenas ventas y mucha clientela."
good,"-As a whole we raised several thousands of dollars for various local charities and families in need."
good,"Very basic retail company that has room for growth. Basically, you can make your own destiny working there."
good,"I learned much during my time within the company, but the particular position and store that I worked for definitely provided many opportunities to excel."
good,It's a good job you have good benefits. But between the employees there is no team work. Only way to advance is to be the bosses friend.
good,"accountabilty and oragnization in the cash office. Dealt with large amounts of money. Supervision in the front end.  Daily financial transactions includes posting information to accounting journals or accounting software from such source documents as invoices to customers, cash receipts, and supplier invoices. The bookkeeper also reconciles accounts to ensure their accuracy."
good,Their management isn't very good at helping associates in a timely manner.
good,"Managers were unproductive, difficult to work with and had little to no training. "
good,Wal-Mart is busy all the time. I learned how to use their customer service equipment and their bill pay process. Management was good. The co-workers were great. The hardest part was not knowing what my work schedule would be for the week. I enjoyed the customers because I would meet new people on a daily.
good,Management was disorganized. Customers were friendly most of the time and co-workers were a joy to work with.
good,worked cash the best part of the job was being out in the community making people smile by being a bubbly cashier
good,"I enjoy what I did there! I like the work and the people. Management some care and some didn't. The ones that care they got the most out of there associates.  The ones that didn't, associates didn't work hard for them. I consider myself lucky because my team work hard for me. At the end of the day the only way you were going to get promoted was if you knew someone.  Unfortunately my hard work really got me nowhere.  I got promoted twice but got stuck at being an ZMS."
good,"I feel respected and dependent upon to do what is needed. No pressured demands just get the job done in a timely manner, right the first time. The hardest part of the job is trying to please the patient to their satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job is being there. LOVABLE ENVIRONMENT"
good,"pretty terrible place to work. Advancement, when I worked there, was slow if at all. It was very hard to move or move up. Very unrealistic time goals by any standards. Some co-workers made the job harder and sometimes down right unbearable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with extreme stress and pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the people made the job and after work down right enjoyable."
good,There is so much to say about Wal-Mart . I loved working there. I loved everything about it. There wasn't anything I didn't like.
good,es mucha dedicación y tiempo para cualquier tipo de persona sin ecepcion
good,Management works with you most of the time. I find myself doing many different tasks at once. Customers come to you of all kinds with many requests.
good,the people great. the management is very awful to work with.
good,It was a good balance of work and fun. The job kept me on toes and my head grounded focusing!
good,I learned that all management should get together and talk about the plans for the night so things can run more smoothly.  Hardest part of the job would be 3 different managers asking you to complete tasks at the same time.  Most enjoyable helping customers find what they need.
good,"I think walmart is a place to work, when there isnt many other options left. The reason I said that is because they over work you for very little pay."
good,"Everything moved normally through the days, nothing more nothing less."
good,"I enjoyed my job very much."
good,"didn't enjoy working here, management is a little rude and they don't work well with personal issues"
good,"I love meeting new people, Helping customers find what they need and answer any question about the merchandise."
good,id like my job it was interesting and fun flexible hours the scanning and how many pounds when we threw the fruits they gave me off on saterdays  I just like working there
good,A  typical day at work is usually hectic. You have to get in where you fit in . I  truly loved my jobs because i had the chance to interact with many different customers and help them with there needs. I love that even if i was having a bad day i still wanted my customers to be happy. You will run into some lazy co-workers that would drive me crazy but as long as the work was done. i felt like the pay should have been more because you are required to do a lot  of work in 7 hours. Sometimes i did mine and others work. It was hard because late at night when there is no customers and you have cleaned up the area theres's really nothing else you could do.
good,"I have to get the backroom ready for truck."
good,"theirs always work to do a job never ended at Walmart it was always busy anytime of the day, i loved the fact that i worked along side with managers to learn more about the company.Theirs always a hard part in a job that was only on holidays where it would get the busiest and back to school and not to mention re setting departments."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart is clocking in and finding your immediate supervisor. If no notes need to be completed there is a routine for each department. It lists the day to day activities that become your normal things to do every day. Eventhough the department I work in is lightly staffed right now we all get along well and do a good job. the hardest part of my job is when the upper management can not make up their minds about something and have you work on the same thing for more then one day. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the different customers that come thru the doors.
good,"I worked in ladies apparel. Keeping the sales floor neat and in order. I also worked in customer service and would be the store operator as well. I didn't like how they would take you from your dept, throw you into a dept you've never been and expect you to do that job like a pro."
good,"I started at Walmart as a Pharmacy Technician Trainee. As a Pharmacy Tech my job was to enter in prescription data, as well as fill prescriptions. I learned how to fill prescriptions as well how to identify false scripts. It was fine at first but soon they began cutting our hours. Not able to support myself on the 17 hours I was scheduled, I sought a second job. After 4 months at my second job I was offered a management position if I left Walmart. I turned in my two weeks notice and was asked to wait until they found a replacement. I agreed but after waiting two months for them to find someone I quit."
good,"I would work as a cashier or a door person, not that positive of a work place and the management was not nice at all."
good,"Its a great place to gain experience and to advance. Many opportunities to advance or to change your position. Nice benefits and bonuses. Can be difficult and stressful at times, but also rewarding."
good,"longevity and skills desired, opportunities for advancement offered"
good,"Un dia tipico de Trabajo: Llegar a tienda, saludar compañeros, ir con mi jefe de departamento y recibir ordenes y mensajes, hacer  mis rutinas y atender al cliente. Al cerrar hacer defenza de zona, limpiar el departamento y esperar la salida"
good,"fast paced work load, learned stocker skills, management abused power, co-workers were dishonest, hardest part was management and the most enjoyable was providing customer service"
good,"A typical day in a retail environment...busy in any department that you may work as everyone shops at Sam's Club and Wal-Mart.  They are a Member/Customer centered place of business that operates by three basic beliefs and teamwork to get the job done.  They truly believe in promoting from within locations, across companies, internationally and to Home Office.  The hardest part of the job is the attitude you bring with you and the work ethic you employ when working in stores and clubs because it's retail."
good,They are concern about that the customer gets a really good deal no matter what.
good,"Not very much to say about Wal-Mart. If you cant say something good, don't say nothing at all."
good,"It is a typical retail job. where you work for next to nothing and have to do a lot for the little amount of money you start off with, the management is cool for the most part."
good,A comfy job if you like to perform the same tasks daily. Very chill job.
good,"Working at wal-mart gave me a lot of experiences there. You get to deal with a lot of different kind of personalities of customers. It gets really hard sometimes when you have a long line and it's been really busy and the customers are just raging at you. What i like about wal-mart is the co-workers they're really kind, likes to joke around and funny. The most i enjoy about wal-mart is working with good peoples."
good,wal mart is always busy so you would never get bored. seeing new faces everyday was fun. meeting all kinds of people. just turning someone's day around was fantastic.
good,"Wal-Mart is a challenging company to work for. They demand a lot of time from you, so it leaves little time for work life balance. They do not offer any time of tuition program, so it is hard to stay committed to the organization upon graduation. I would recommend it to someone that is starting their career or has a vested interest in retail management."
good,I believe Walmart is a good job for college students and older people and retirees. I received 32-40 hours a week.
good,"It was usually busy up in the front, to certain points where I would be over my time to take my scheduled break or lunch. There were times where I worked overtime, and other times where I was told to go home early. Co-workers were fun to talk to whenever there's a time up in the front where it wasn't busy, but work was done while doing so."
good,"•	The Asset Protection Specialist (APS) is primarily responsible for preventing financial loss caused by"
good,Empresa com uma ótima oportunidade de envolvimento pessoal mas com muita desorganização operacional.
good,I started as a part time cashier and worked my way to  merchandise manager in 7 years. learned alot about each different job along the way.
good,i really have no views on the Wal-mart workplace..besides very demanding
good,"Busy work flow"
good,"I learned to manage people and time "
good,I was the firs over night shocker in the toy department. started at $8.75 a hour and there was no training really.  I think I worked there for about 2 weeks before someone came over and helped me to learn what to do.  By that time the department manager came to the overnight shift to train me.  By my first year I was at $10.00 an hour because I became a weekend worrier which meant I worked 4  days including all weekend day from 8pm to 7am and had 3 days off during the week.  when Wal-Mart got ride of the shift I kept  my pay and moved to the front as a cashier which I loved because I had much more interaction with the customers.  In time i would help train new cashiers and help the front end managers when they went on vacation.  I was asked to be a front end manager but I didn't think I could do the job the way I thought it should be done so I turned it down.
good,overall poor management and communication in the store as a whole
good,"Management level is generally friendly and approachable; depending on area, expect to be long hours and change management skills"
good,Safe frienly environment in which to work.  I worked overnight maintenance.  Worked well with the managers and my co-workers. Good benefits and vacation time.  The pay scale was low with very little advance in pay.
good,I was just a sales associate and stocker. It was my first job.
good,Stocked shelves and zoned department also assisted customers with sales and knowledge of products.
good,I found a lot of good friends in this job.Although the management  could treat their workers more fair.
good,"I enjoyed working here mostly because I have fun providing customer service and remaining active at work and this was a very fast-paced and busy work environment. My co-workers and I got along really well , management was often having issues with communications which sometimes caused issues in the workplace which was probably the hardest part of the job for myself. I learned to be open-minded and get along with all types of people and have plenty of patience."
good,Started out not so bad. Needs some help with management and supervisors.
good,"There is a lot of customer service, which is great, and the people are genuinely awesome. I love working in toys because I get to make little children very happy. My co-workers are some of the hardest working people I have every known. I have worked in saw mills, bakeries, National Parks, but employees at Walmart have to have a thick skin and always a smile on there face."
good,"Unload freight trucks and sort freight and distribute to specific departments, and do inventory."
good,this store had a very unsafe work enviorment. thereason i said this is bcause at this stor location the store was robbed over five time while i worked there. Cars were being stolen and broken in to  in the parking lot. There was no loss prevention or security.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Beaver Lake Aviation very much.  I was lucky to work with such a great team that would come together under pressure and always provided the best customer service including going above and beyond to provide assistance.  The most difficult part of working for Beaver Lake, in my opinion, is the lack of opportunity for upward mobility as well as the seclusion from the remainder of Walmart's corporate team.  I was given the opportunity to learn about fixed base operator functions as well as corporate and private aviation.  A typical day as a Customer Service Representative at Beaver Lake is spent recording fuel sales and payments on customers accounts, working in conjunction with corporate security, customs, as well as local transportation and lodging to the objective of providing the best service available."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart for the most part. There was always something to do so I was never bored. The only problem I had was that the management team lacked stucture. They were too relaxed when it came to company policies.
good,"I have learned the different cuts of meat."
good,"The company gave me a lot of opportunity to advance and learn. Unfortunately after thirteen years I was termninated with no prior forms formal coachings or accountability. If you are willing to compromise and do a lot of ""needed"" extra hours as management than it may be for you. And by needed I mean cut hourly time to save money and make up for it by using salaried management."
good,"The company isn't bad to work for but they don't treat their help well especially the one I work at. but a job is a job a lot of people don't have. MANAGEMENT NEVER TELL U UR ARE DOING AA GOOD JOB WHICH WOULD BE NICE ONCE IN AWHILE, Some of the coworkers are great workers but some just come just to get a paycheck. Most enjoyable thing on the job is when u can associate with other coworkewrs  that pull their weight. to get the work accomplished."
good,"A typical day is to help customers find what they need. Clean the station and area. Price items, fold clothes, (zone) Management is very supportive. I learned cash experience. The hardest part of the job is standing and walking on my feet for several hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping pleasant customers and that my co-workers are fun, supportive and loyal."
good,"This company is far too scrambled to be this successful. Retail tends to work best when you have few managers and more hourly workers but Walmart has many poor managers and never enough cashiers, cart pushers, sales associates and technicians. Every department seems to be short handed but the top end. Too many chiefs and not enough braves. Now the pay isn't great but it's better than fast food and the benefits aren't terrible. The schedule is usually steady and hours aren't outrageous. Being retail you can't count on getting overtime but in my experience it wasn't too hard to keep my hours up. It was very hard to keep up with demands in the job because of always being short handed. Most of the managers I worked under were not reasonable or very responsible. They would blame everyone under them for all their mistakes and demand what few people we had that we complete the work meant for 2 or 3 times the people. I witnessed several unnecessary terminations because a manager had a personal vendetta or agenda. I have also seen managers select people for promotion based on personal relationships not job merit. On the other hand I had witnessed a few fair, strict and capable managers that I would love to give credit to but I may not use names. I can say that if the company were run by more of these individuals than their stores would be in much better shape. "
good,"Self Check outs were where shoplifters would go to try to steal merchandise.  In one day, I stopped a lady from stealing a $60 pair of boots, a large bag of dog food, and multiple expensive ink pens that were placed in a box with envelopes.  "
good,came in around 10 pm to 7 am stocked merchandise and did various other task with a prompt deadline that you would have to make
good,"this position is very easy, Over looking the smoke shop!! customer services comes easy"
good,"Typical work day begins at7am, with the management team, we would tour the store and set priorities for the day."
good,"Starting out as a grocery associate and ending up in Asset Protection, I have learned several skills and experience."
good,Always hectic and you are always doing something. I learned how to deal with all kinds of customers. I now have exceptional people skills from my time at Walmart. All the managers were very kind and fun to work for with an exception of a few people. Hardest part of my job was cashiering during crazy hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was always seeing the happy customers after you have helped them.
good,This company has room to grow but their pay is low and would take several years before you could live on that kind of salary. Great benefits.
good,"A tyical day at work was fun, you sometimes didn't know what was going to happened but you were ready for anything, you learned to go with the flow and the people you worked with was pretty good, some easy to get along with some you just say hi and keep moving, the managers were the same way, some you go that extra mile for and some you just want to get it over with but at the end of the day you got the work done."
good,I am responsible for a copious amount of tasks and complete them to the best if my ability's. I am trained for multiple departments and am expected to work these departments on a daily basis.basis. I am currently looking for a company with room for growth and that has more respect for their associates.
good,"A typical day is varied with the different jobs I will be doing, from removing items from the floor and replacing them with new merchandise to different interactions with customers. I've learned many different skills from patience, to communication skills with other people. The management, for the most part, is fair and interactive with other employee's. Most, if not all other employee's are very nice and easy to talk with. The hardest part of the job is always keeping busy moving back and forth between the store. The most enjoyable part of working is by far the employee's I've interacted  and made friends with."
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart. I would Clock in at 1pm   there would be  two pallets of orders that people ordered from Walmart.com . I would finalize that the orders haveb arrived and I would binned it in a specific location. When the customer comes I would be able to look it up in the system and find it . If  the order didn't arrived I would call Field Support and figure A solution to the problem. Next I would go to Customer Service help Customers with Refunds and Returns or go on the sales floor and sell TV's . I would also Clean out the bale area With an  Electrical pallet jack and set Up to unload trucks which we would get at least  two trucks with twenty five hundred pieces on each truck. I would help unload them as well basically  I did everything at Wal-mart. I learned that when your working for a company the customer is always first  to stay professional and polite but firm at the same time. I also learned how to change prices manage a team on the sales floor, drive a Fork Lift and manage Inventory. Our management was some what helpful but i had to really push things and learned them on my own. The hardest part of my job would probably be intervene with an employee and angry customer and finding a solution so the customer could be satisfied and  we could make the sell."
good,Flexible schedules made it hard to plan anything. Management was not well trained and lower management employees get on a power trip.  You could be written up for no reason.
good,Typical day at work is working on the register helping clean the front of the store.
good,Everyday was interesting and challenging dealing with irate customers and the most nicest people all in a days work.
good,Very productive. Lack of communication with managment. Co-workers were friendly and helpful.
good,"Customers refused to accept that they could be wrong and insistent that they be given special deals, like a $149 air mattress for $1.98, since there was a food sticker stuck to it, from her carriage, or a pair of $200 head phones for $14 because another customer placed them in the clothing department."
good,"A typical shift would pass quickly working at wal mart because there was always a job to be done, my goal was to finish tasks early so I could have enough time to double check my work."
good,A typical day is often long and stressful. Fast- paced and does not seem to really be team- oriented. Management is good if you never have to really speak to them or need days off. The hardest part is juggling daily tasks along with great customer service and things from management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with the customers and being able to help them.
good,"Nothing is hard about this job to me. A typical day consist of working freight to fill the floor, down-stacking pallets and cleaning the backroom. My co-workers are enjoyable people and the management team expects the best."
good,"I would wait on customers,pick up things that was out of place,also would help the customers find what they were looking for,I learned that nobody is the same if I was not busy we would go to the end of the isle and if somebody come by we would ask them if they was ready to check out,and we would say I will be glad to check you out on whatever register we were on! When I left I really missed my customers,because you had certain people that they would come to your register,because they liked you,got along with my co workers,did not have no problem with management,the hardest part was to work a night shift and have to go in early!"
good,"I have been working at Walmart full-time for more than 22 years."
good,"great co workers"
good,"Perform recruiting and interviewing of potential new associates, reading and utilizing exception reports that impact the front-end performance, auditing cash registers, utilizing the company policies and guidelines for courtesy desk procedures, perform associate appraisal and performance coaching, and scheduling for lunch and breaks, and assigning job tasks, and Promoting and reassuring excellent customer service and quality."
good,"Work is very laid back.  You learn a lot about phones, TV's, and other household electronics. Hardest part of the job is committing to it for years as you don't make much plus you are in retail and retail hours switch often."
good,Make it priority to get to work on time everyday all the time. Do not take off work not even if it is an emergency you will be fired.
good,"The work itself was high energy but, not difficult to do. Somewhat time consuming. I learned new skills while on the job including machine operation. "
good,"My shift does the majority of the work in the store, we keep all shelves stocked and make sure all the overstock in the back is binned."
good,"Customer Service, Answering Phones, Putting Out Stock From The Back Of Store. I Learned To Multitask,The Management Team Was Very Helpful At Times When It Came To My Concerns At Times. I Had Excellent Co-Workers They Always Had Great Attitudes & Was Ready to Work. I Didnt Find Anything Hard About My job, I What Enjoyed Most Was Interacting & Meeting New People."
good,"A day at my job could be hectic that's the main reason why i come prepared and ready to get the job done. I have learned a lot by working at this business, their could be mean customers and even co-workers. I learned to always keep a smile no matter what the case may be. Management is good could be a little better other than that theirs a lot of kind managers. The hardest part of this job is that i work in multiple departments, which is shoes and apparel I always get through it everyday without complaining. The most enjoyable part is meeting people and having others feel the warmth of my humor, I love positive attitudes."
good,"Stock departments, unload the trucks, organize isles, work the back room, and clean up.  Co-workers where fun."
good,I usually worked mid day shifts with different people everyday servicing all types of customers.
good,custermers were great and coworkers were great just hours were not what i was looking for
good,"An average day at work is very physical and can be very fun as well with people that aren't afraid to make the work environment a fun place. I've learned several things like : being able to use the Walkie Stacker, several things about departments that i never knew before, and that stores can run on a very low amount of associates which can be dangerous. My management team is mostly very rude and thinks that one third of a crew you need can do as much as a normal sized crew. they are very disrespectful and don't care much about what we have to say. It's all about their numbers. The only manager i enjoy is my direct supervisor because he makes work a lot more enjoyable by having fun while working as fast if not faster then a majority of the people working. The hardest part of my job is not being able to speak my mind without retaliation in someway. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to have fun on days that my direct supervisor is working."
good,"Everyday you deal with customers and help them with what they need. You get to be a pro at fixing registers and counting money faster than you could imagine. All of the cashiers are great to work with but sometimes the management isn't so much great. But when it comes to helping someone with a family matter they will defiantly work with you on what you need. And they do recognize you on great work. I had customers all the time telling my higher managers how much I made their experience so much better, and that they would come back because of me. You develop relationships with customers cause there are always your casuals that do come in. But over all I say that it is a pretty good place to work but I wouldn't make it my permanent place of work. There is a lot of stress that can come along with it too cause you will come across certain people who will just kind of do their own thing and will not work well with you and put all of the duties on you. That is how I was, every once in a while they would pitch in and help but they never really offered it, or really seemed to try and work as a team, some of the staff seemed more as a defend for yourself type of group. But my time working there I did like it and it was pretty good place."
good,It was a good job for that time period met new people everyday. Was the only one who worked in sporting goods section. Good experience.
good,"Atypical day at work is very busy as we average over 800 fills per day. I have learned to adapt and overcome any obstacles that may be thrown at me as well as how to effectively resolve ongoing insurance issues. I have an amazing management team and co workers. The hardest part of my job is when a patient needs a maintenance medication and even with their insurance, they are till not able to afford it. I do everything I can to help lower the cost of their medication, but there is only so much that is in my control. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help people stay compliant with their medication."
good,"My typical day at Wal-Mart working 11 am- 8 pm coming in pulling charts or pallets out the freezer and filling the floor then close to the end of my shift I prepare the pandown of bread so that the baker the next morning can bake the bread for the customers, and then cleaning up.  l learned about the different breads that people like to eat, how to do price changes, place orders, set mods, and do counts. My co-workers aren't that great all the time but I don't let them stop me from doing my work. the hardest part of my job is when my department manager and the other co worker are unfair to me and don't communicate with me. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping the customers."
good,I was hired and went to 2 days orientation. I started receiving calls tellin me not to come into work. Well after about a week of the constant calls I called them and spoke with a manager. Drove 45 minutes to the store and was told by the manager that I was terminated for no call no show. Not only did I NOT get called and told I was terminated(managers failed to call me period) I didn't get paid for my orientation days($200!). Walmart is A JOKE!
good,Company does not hire/train managers well. Consultants are expected to do everything while mgmt takes credit. Working from home is a plus-two days a week.
good,"A typical day at this job was checking out customers and bagging groceries. Run cash register and keeping up with money. I learned you have to have patience when working in a fast paced working environment. Management was awesome. My co-workers were also ready to help other customers and make sure they had a pleasant shopping experiment. The hardest part of this job, well, I cant think of anything. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with customers."
good,"Very unique employees, some of management have a severe problem living in reality. Customers are always right here, even when they're completely wrong. Management bends over backwards for customers in the worst ways."
good,ongoing calls in a fast paced environment. most calls are not that bad but you do have irate customers. being patient and very important and meeting your call times is a priority.
good,this job was ok when it came to cleaning you had to know what you were doing and depending on the amount of rooms you had to get them done in a vertain amount of time. but over all it was fun cause you were always busy
good,"Basically, I worked in the company Cafeteria as a Dishwasher. Sometimes double-shifts. Experienced a health issue, had gall-bladder surgery. Felt as though since I was sort of the new guy, many of the employees in there didn't like me, or took advantage of me at time...left because of stress related surgery."
good,"empresa multinacional ,que atende bem as nesecidades  de seus colaboradores dentro de seus limites  . aprendi muito com os cursos de formação disponibilizados pela empresa,atendimento ao cliente ,manipulação e higiênização,auditoria,a gerência dialogo aberto,colegas de trabalho gentis e educados,sempre prontos a colaborar com a equipe."
good,"Helping customers all day. Clean register during down time. Organize shelf product. Help organize ""go back"" items in right categories."
good,"A typical day as a Dept. Mgr. at Wal-Mart included Identifying customer needs in the Automotive and Hardware/Paint Departments as well as directing the sales staff. As the Department manager of Automotive, Hardware and Paint I was responsible for unloading and stocking incoming tires and batteries as well as regular freight for all three departments. Paint mixes, merchandise display, inventory control and counts as well as product zone control were also a regular part of my daily work load. I was also a member of the store safety team. The most difficult part about the job was the lack of appropriate staff to take care of the daily freight and register tasks so that I could concentrate on the Managerial tasks which were constantly growing and evolving. The staff that I had was comprised of 2 or 3 very diligent workers who did there best to keep up with the work load and still attend to the customers needs in an appropriate and friendly manner. This was a very high stress position as can be expected when one is attempting to do an exemplary job with minimal resources. I got along very well with my Assistant Managers and received Exceeds Expectations or Role Model on all of my yearly reviews."
good,My day started at 3 am and ended at12noon I would work by myself for 4 to 5 hours the I would have a co-worker start and package. I learned how to be a strong leader of my team I set the pace of the day. There was really no hard part to my job.
good,"Ha troca de turno quando se chega e como é um mercado relativamente pequeno se tabalha em 3 setores, padaria, rotisseria e fiambreria no atendimento ao publico. Aprendi varias coisa, e uma dela foi na confeitaria tirando as ferias da confeiteira, uma direcao presente, simpatica e educada, uma equipe unida e boa de trabalhar, parte dificil trabalhar domingo, pois era 1 emprego de carteira assinada, parte facil uma equipe boa de trabalhar do auxiliar ao chefe."
good,This job taught me the benefits of working hard and the reward of customer satisfaction. I learned the value of teamwork and established lifelong friendships with coworkers. I also learned valuable medical knowledge from my supervising Pharmacist.
good,"Clock in to a new day stress is following close behind. The meeting is short, simple and sweet.  A quick hello, how are you to your fellow crew members.  Off we go don't forget to task.  Management tonight is you know who.  Will they be relaxed or pressurized with no more room to expand. Tonight is slow, thank God it is not like the last. Too much freight with no time to spare.  Managers scurry to get live freight worked. You help here, you go there, right now no time to spare.  How old am I? We ask ourselves. While we hurry and stress to put the freight on the shelf.  Meanwhile inside talk breaks out. What happened to respect for the fellow man.  Did he/she just put me down with one hand? A few of us joke and laugh to make this dreadful night pass.  This is what can get you through the darkest night, that positive soul with laughter's light guiding you to the sweet end.  Joy breaks out as we all task for the end of the day. Will there be a thanks, job well done, only you would know my grateful son. No time to let it linger for sleep creeps up fast.  Grab a few items before you dash to your car thinking this is the best part of my day so far."
good,"Stock merchandise, make sure Inventory counts and sales floor counts and correct and if not, check Inventory sales floor and stock room to get the correct count on items, Learn how to correct our inventory, check in new merchandise, manage time on project. My co-workers come to me for help or advise on items and help on projects and how should they be done. The hardest part of the job is not getting in the merchandise you need to keep the store stock, and the enjoyable part is that knowing that I've help a customer and complete projects in a timely manner."
good,"Principalmente mi trayectoria laboral en Walmart ha sido muy satisfactoria entre como supervisora de cruce de anden con ya directo con la empresa y de ahí tarde 3 años para obtener una promoción a Jefatura de Transportes, si he participado en diversos curso ya sea importiendolos y así mismo como tomándolos, se genera un buen ambiente de trabajo debido a la cultura que se tiene, y ademas es una empres mundialmente reconocida."
good,"working up the patient"
good,"Muito bom acompanhar as metas diárias e mensais (vendas)x quebras de produtos da Empresa, a parte mais agradável a convivência com os colegas de Trabalho."
good,Job postion was great. Great customers and employess. Great environment and work place.
good,"4:00am - until"
good,An ordinary day at work would include me reorganizing a large storage refrigerator by myself for at least 1hr and a half. Then to make a check list of what needed to be pulled from the display case and what needed to be restocked. When this was complete I would throw out all the expired fruits and other waste and recycle all the cardboard. And basically i would repeat this until I the last hour of work then clean the entire section our produce department occupied in the back room and in the front of our store. The management was very nice as well my co-workers created a friendly environment and provided me with the proper training required for my specific job and a little more.
good,"A typical day at Walmart was interesting and hardworking. Sometimes you never know what to expect. I learned a lot as a leader which prepared me leadership positions such as supervisor and manager. I worked with a lot of great managers at that really cared for the associates. My co-workers were great to work with. I had some of the best associates that worked in my departments. The hardest part of the job was supervising multiple departments at one time having 1, sometimes maybe 2 associates working with you. Multitasking is easy for me to do but it goes by a lot quicker and more pleasurable if you have a management team that's willing to work with you and get you the help that you need. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping others whether they were customers or associates."
good,A Good Job with good co worker and management. Never a dull moment fast paced
good,I worked for the company for 8 years. Advancement is what you make it to be.
good,"very fast pace"
good,"en la oficina con los compañeros de trabajo revisando reportes, ordenando el área de trabajo, dialogando hacerca de un tema respecto a la empresa, las juntas de trabajo con los jefes y tomando un delicioso café, después de terminar los pendientes realizar un recorrido por la tienda y ayudar a lo compañeros con sus etiquetas y orden de mercancías. Los compañeros de trabajo muy sociables y buenos conmigo me apoyaban siempre que tenia una duda no importaba si no se encontraban en tienda para ayudarme, solo marcaba el teléfono y ahí estaban, los jefes con sus consejos, regaños y facilitadores, la parte mas difícil fue el primer dia no tenia idea de lo que iba hacer pero gracias a todas esas personas que me brindaron apoyo para que aprendiera muy rápido, siempre fui muy amigable con todos, me relacione con personas muy importantes de la empresa y por supuesto que me gusto laborar para la empresa la experiencia es única y muy buena para desenvolverme en otros ámbitos social y laboral."
good,Typical day is greeting each person you come in contact with. Helping others achieve goals. Multi tasking and relaxed office. Co-worker are the best and truly care about each other.
good,"tire repair,ordering replacement and making sure the day by without any problem"
good,It's a place to start for beginners who need to have experience on their resumes.
good,grew with company. company changes thought out the years . management is different at every store
good,"A very hands on job. I learned waxing and cleaning, hardest thing about going to work is maybe picking up slack when staff is short."
good,Interactive customer services. Great co-worker interaction. Most enjoyable part of day was the end results at shift end.
good,"Empresa dinâmica que me deu oportunidade na área de trabalho, aprendendo a lidar com público. "
good,the management is nice untell it is time to lay off most of the work force.
good,"Empresa de grande porte, me deram oportunidades onde eu fui reconhecida profissionalmente. Gerência sempre ótimos, sempre me deram atenção, tanto supervisão quanto gerência, sempre que precisei estavam prontos a me ouvir. Como trabalhei muito tempo, tive diversos colegas diferentes, pois devido a nos sobrecarregar pela carga horária e o pouco salário sempre teve rotatividade de funcionários onde não paravam por muito tempo, os que eu convivi sempre foram ótimos comigo sempre soube lidar com eles apesar da insatisfações deles nunca nos desrespeitamos. A empresa que me abriu as portas para área profissional, onde aprendi muito soube lidar com o público."
good,working in modules labeling freight. licensed to drive tugger. co workers are willing to help out each other when the situation arise.
good,"Well, it was busy everyday I was there and the other associate were good people, almost like family. The Managers were alright, it just depends on who you had. Hardest part the job was leaving on time, depending on you position, the higher you are, the more you work."
good,it was a great job to work with their where many opportunity's and job positions you could switch to if the one you where currently in didn't work for you. me being an Unloader I enjoyed the quick paced environment always staying busy made the day go by much faster.
good,"Was tasked to clean up the shopping carts in the parking lot and help maintain the front end of the store. The job helped me to learn how to better assist customers and work with others. The management was tough but fair. The hardest part of the job was the extreme weather conditions, while the most enjoyable part was how you could set your own pace, as long as you didn't far too far behind."
good,"The pay is average. The management treats you bad, The co-workers are fun to work with."
good,A typical day consisted of working 5 to 8 hours at the cashier booth assisting customers. I learned how to communicate with customers and co-workers better and deveoped better interpersonal skills. The managment was not the greatest but the co-workers were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was having to stand up and work for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and how loose and free minded they were.
good,Long hard days. Had to deal with some poor attitude customers but killed them with kindness. Managment was normally very helpfull. Got along great with my coworkers never any problems and made many close friends I still have to this day. The hardest part was the customers that would get in my face and scream and yell over the smallest things such as being out of a product. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet greet and conversate with many great kind people on a daily basis.
good,"Empresa pronta a ensinar, com uma cultura muito forte, aprendi que não devemos deixar as tarefas para outro dia e sim terminarmos o que começamos no mesmo dia.  Um dos contra que acho da empresa é a elevada carga horária."
good,"Worked mainly with customers and selling product, did some stocking and ordering, Cleaning and Cashiering, did a little marketing, developed and printed pictures and created digital cds for customers,"
good,"Maintaining the front line cashiers & registers "
good,una junta para evaluar los logros de un dia anterior y el logro al que deveriamos llegar en ese dia y termida la junta deviamos posicionarnos en nuestros lugares de trabajo ya sea en la emplayadora o etiquetando tarimas o reestibando mercancia
good,"Walmart is a good company for people who are in college or seek business management opportunities. The hours are very vague, but the inside community (sales associates) are warm, and understanding. The hardest part of this job was not meeting the needs of customer service. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with fellow employees to accomplish team work projects."
good,"Worked "
good,A typical day in my work at Wal-Mart was starting in the produce department. I was the opener and would be responsible for culling through the produce. I would need to look for outdated product or signs and replace them with the appropriate ones.  I would have to help unload the truck and take care of the pallets of food within a certain amount of time. Management was not very effective or around when needed. My department had only a few employees so our team culture was very good. We all got along and helped each other out. The hardest part of my job there were the hours. The most enjoyable was interacting with the customers.
good,Walmart was a great environment  so had grate costumer service and there merchandise was always a very good quality  and the food was always fresh. But in some departments the management was poor. i learned grate communication skills and costumer service.
good,"I have learned a lot from associates at work, a typical day will be working on sales floor, customer services and completing notes from management. Management at the store isn't what it should be like, very lack of communication and rude. There isn't really anything hard about my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my associates in my department."
good,"My day starts working with a team  to make sure the store up to the standards, walking and write notes to address any opportunity, meeting with store management, meeting with zms and dept. managers, teaching, training, verifying the daily deposit, customer service, stocking freight, unloading trucks, follow up on the notes, zoning the store."
good,"Typical Day at Work was coming in, having a night meeting, checking our work on the system, and getting to it. Gather your products from the back, take up front, and stock the shelves."
good,"Head to my assigned department to work, me and another co worker or just by myself if short of staff.  stock as much as possible keeping area neat and clean as possible. stack all overstock separate from any items that have not been worked. put overstock in the back. The hardest part of the day was just trying to keep my energy up to move quickly. the most enjoyable part was pay day."
good,Very large company lots of employees. working with the publics needs and wants. competitive with other stores.
good,"A typical day at Walmart begins with a register assignment as a Cashier.  After two hours a 15 minute break. Perhaps a move to a new location or at the Service Desk.  A one hour meal break is given off the clock.  I learned many things at Walmart including inventory, recyclables, purchase orders, counts on hand, merchandise mods, price changes and ad matching. "
good,"I worked in the toy department. Typically I would work mornings with the department supervisor and work on various projects/restock shelves/change shelf labels. At night, unless it was holiday season or a weekend, there wasn't much to do other than 'zone' the department, put away go backs, and complete occasional tasks left by the department manager. Some assistant managers were easy-going and easy to work for, others were rude. Co-workers were easy to work with and mostly friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they were looking for. The hardest part of the job was not getting 'coached' while working there."
good,"A typical workday consist of viewing reports, overseeing merchandise plans and displays, holding meetings and communicating with department managers on their daily plans for their area to ensure that deadlines would be met.  I learned a lot about time management and the supervision of others as well as how to properly delegate tasks to fit the needs of the business.  Wal Mart is a very diverse workplace so I worked with a vast array of individuals with different talents and mindset.  I enjoyed working with the company and the role I played for the duration of my career with them."
good,Even though the pay is low the people are friendly and easy to work with
good,A typical day at work would be tiring and hard on the body. You dont work in only one department most of the time you will be pulled by an existing manger to work elsewhere when they are short on employees. Most of the co workers i have experienced are nice people and very easy to get along with. The most enjoyable part is getting to watch a movie on a 72 in television during your lunch.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was easy and fun got to meet a lot of good people.
good,worked their usually 38 hour week consider parttime no benefits.
good,"Great learning experience, work as a team to get the task done."
good,Inventory checks and shelve stocking. working in teams to finish all tasks. Management will help where help is needed.
good,"A typical day at work I will walk through the dairy cooler to see what all is on the floor and see if the milk need to be filled then I will walk over to frozen to see what all is on the floor and if milk needed to be filled I will go fill milk first, but if not I will start on frozen because it's usually needs to be worked first. I will then start pulling out pallets or carts out of the freezer and worker the merchandise to the floor. If I have any over stock I will prep and bin it if I have any space in the bins to put it, but if not I would work bins (pull merchandise out of bins) to make space and get what I can off of the floor that day. Within all of this I will take a fifteen minute break two to two and a half hours in, go back and stock some more, within three to three and a half hours in I will take my hour lunch, come back and see how milk and eggs are looking, and sometimes I will take my last fifteen minute break or sometimes I will not. Clock out."
good,Walmart is a well organized and structured company. There are opportunities to advance.
good,"I liked working here, although the Assistant Managers liked to micro manage everything. The employees themselves were great and I never had to deal with any sour customers."
good,"un dia típico para el departamento en el que labore era llegar, atender primero proveedores, inter actuar con el departamento de recibo de mercancía, atender a los compañeros de otros departamentos para cumplir con las necesidades etc. "
good,my typical day consists of till work. here i am involved with cash handling and customers service.
good,es una empresa la cual se desarrolla en el ambito comercial en la cual los empleados conviviomos arduamente y apoyamos para poder salir mejor en las ventas
good,"The people I worked with were nice enough, but working for walmart kind of dragged me down as far as my attitude and the like. They claimed I was a no call, no show on a few days when I told them I spoke to a manager and they didn't believe me...so they definitely do not practice good communication with each other. "
good,Basically working there had it's pros and cons like any place.  The benefits at the time were great and the pay at the time was great.  I was not impressed with the management and sometimes felt like I was being worked against.  Other times they offered encouragement and a pat on the back goes a long way.
good,Management need to know how to communicate with there associate to achieve productivity and learn to take constructive criticism.
good,Good place to work and advance your career. Just work you all kinds of hours and are strict around the holiday and won't give you time off not even if you request off.
good,"Started the day by checking cart aisles to see which side of store was low on carts. Start off by collecting carts on the lowest side of store so every customer would have a cart for shopping. Learned how to use machinery on first day to help retrieve carts. The manager was super busy with work that I only contacted her if there was an emergency. I didn't really have any coworkers to work with as some were either repositioned, quit, or fired. Hardest part was coming back from lunch with no one to cover my position. Asked for help every time before going off to lunch but help never arrived until customers notice carts were unavailable to them. Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers due to the little break in my routine."
good,stressfull work enviorment not enough manpower for work load.
good,I loved being a manager with Walmart corp but with it being a new store and going through some personal issues I had to not stay. If i could get back with them I would just because I like the job alot.
good,"A typical day at work I clock in and go to my area. I cleaned it, restocked it, and organize it over and over again. For about an hour out of the day id go to another area(fitting room ) to cover for break. I rarely learned new things. only tricks with the hand held device here and there. Overall management was good. They seem to care and try to make you comfortable but more could be done to make the job better. The are no challenges in the job unless you find working with rude customers difficult. the most enjoyable part of the job was when i seldom got to cashier and answering phone calls in the fitting room. don't get me wrong it is a good job but i but need pay, benefits, challenges, something different to deal with from day to day and managers that help out more for people who actually hold up there work load."
good,"Wal-Mart is one of those companies that will get beat on day in and day out by previous employees who have worked there."
good,"Vivenciamos um ambiente dinâmico exigindo agilidade e habilidade na tomada de decisões. Aprendemos a valorizar e respeitar as diversidades culturais, controlar e gerir conflitos diversos. A gerência procura atuar em conformidade com os valores e a cultura corporativa em um ambiente de respeito aos colegas de trabalho. A maior dificuldade é a convivência com pessoas não engajadas com os processos empresariais. A parte mais agradável é quando as metas e objetivos eram alcançados e desfrutar dos benefícios alcançados."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart challenges the typical idea of a work schedule, considering it changes every day from week to week. Some managers are better at listening than others. A typical day would be making sure that the paperwork within the department was current and changing sales figures as needed. Organization was a big part of my daily responsibilities as well as maintaining checks on the inventory. The customers could be hard to handle at times but they would always leave happy as long as respect and understanding was shown. Co-workers always believed they could never be wrong but we all taught each other a lot."
good,"we didn't have enough help. we was always short staff, Bad leadership"
good,"Good solid job to have, room for advancement. Great coworkers and everyone is very helpful and nice"
good,"It is a ok job"
good,"I did learn a lot about the retail industry working for them but it can be a very demanding place to work and they don't give you enough hours of work (no full time, only about 15 to 20 hrs a wk)."
good,Wal-Mart can be a place you can advance if you are willing to give up spending any holidays with family. Some management can play favoritism. But Wal-Mart does provide opportunity for advancement into management and there are frequent pay raises depending on performance. Pay raises are very low.
good,"A typical day consist of setting up pallets for every department on the dance floor. Me and my team would unload trucks from the least being 1300 - 3000 piece trucks. the trucks were unlading by hand and thrown onto a roller which all freight was pushed out to the team handling the separation part of the job. After the truck was completely unloaded the team would take a 15 minute break. After the break we would head onto the grocery side of the store and unload the truck which consist more of produce and frozen foods. After lunch we would return to begin hauling out all freight using pallet jacks placing pallets out of customer way and in correct departments. Finally once all pallets have been disperse of we would put the warehouse back in normal condition and ready for the next day. What I learned as an ICS Lead Associate was no matter if I had a whole crew or not I learned that my supervisors knew they can count on me to get the job done. Once I learned how the job inside and out nothing was really hard about it. I really did enjoy unloading the truck because Wal-Mart motto was 1000 piece per hour. a lot of the other associates would complain about the heat or getting tired but there was also a few that would make a game, we would compete against each other and in no time the job was done."
good,"Would conduct internal/external product loss investigations. Perform citizens arrests on shopliffers. Made 73 'stops' in first 6 months of work saving the company over $20,000."
good,looking for a temp job it would be good. i learned a lot just from working there!
good,"Management can sometimes be biased and choose favoritism."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of waiting on customers, handling food and food preparations, and cleaning all equipment . My co-workers are excellent. We provide quality customer service. The hardest part of the job would be when we deep clean the fryer equipment. I learn every day how to be more responsible."
good,"WalMart was a good company to show me how to count cash quickly and efficiently, and how to balance money. When it came to their overall view of how a job should be done they graded the office as a whole so when one person wasn't doing their job everyone got penalized for it. They also used seniority as a tool instead of what person was telling the honest truth."
good,"I arrived to work and build 10-20 bikes and assorted furniture and or grills before working the floor assisting guest. Then train any associates or management on the PLE. This is where I perfected my customer assisting skills. To this day I still Love and cherish the friendship I have with many of my Co- Workers. The hardest part of this job was too many managers pulling you in different direction, Non of which are on the same page. The best Part is the satisfaction Of Building or repairing A customers Item and seeing them smile afterwards."
good,"I love working with people. I love that I get to meet all kinds of people. I love that there is room for advancement. I do not like the politics that goes along with the managers and assistants. I did learn how to manage a department with reports, ordering, Profit and loss, inventory management and resetting modules. I worked with some really good people when I was learning to be a department manager they helped me with the process till I caught on and learned how to get the reports down and how to get the shrinkage down. I really loved working there. I loved the team work on the over night shift that I got from my co workers."
good,I learned that no task was below me.  I did everything from cleaning toilets to working a register.
good,"Management does not work on job retention. Decent benefits, but poor building design."
good,"O dia-a-dia é sempre agitado e os prazos apertados! Isso me torna uma pessoa mais ágil e experiente dentro do varejo. Novas atividades todos os dias, fazem com que o dia se torne dinâmico!"
good,"great comany to work for, management is easy to work with and understanding. The pay is really the only down side working here I left this job because I could not support my self working full time with over time pay."
good,"Breaking pallets down, and stocking produce in cooler or on the floor each and everyday. I learned different fruits and vegetables I had know idea about. My co-workers were fun to be around everyone kept an upbeat. My hardest part about my job was pulling 8-10 pallets everyday. I enjoy being out on the floor and helping customers when needed."
good,"I love working with the people there but our store is not fair at all at most times when it comes to things such as rasies, and moving up."
good,"This not a great company but it does put food on the table. If you are a male be prepared to do jobs you are never trained for such as truck, set up, etc. Its tough at first not to bad"
good,Management and co workers are not so friendly. It was always something going on between co workers. A lot of misunderstanding between management and co workers. It was okay I never had a problem with anyone but just did not like how things were ran
good,"A typical day at Walmart was very busy and demanding. The management which was called the CSM were nice to me, and very helpful. The hardest part about the job was that the systems were not up to date. Also your schedule is all over the place. Which made it difficult for people that took the bus to work or student workers. The most enjoyable part was that I got to meet a lot of wonderful people everyday."
good,"se aprende muy rapido como se maneja esta empresa, la direccion es muy estricta, los colegas de trabajo siempre estan ocupados en algo ya sea de su seccion o de otra, me gusto que se conocen muchas personas pero lo mas dificil es hacer lo que te piden en tu tiempo laboral."
good,"My job at law-mart is okay they give us free food occasionally and the discount card when you can use it is nice. they offer insurance and most of my management with a couple exceptions was great. I felt like there was to much ""I don't know"" about everything in the store by managment. were all the associates to quit at once i dont think the managers knew enough to retrain people..."
good,"I worked during the busiest season for Walmart from pre-Black Friday to post-Christmas.  It was non-stop every day but time flew by.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to talk to so many different people each day, but the stress of the holidays made some customers very negative."
good,"Work wasn't hard, just very fast. Management was horrible and lied to me about what I was being hired as."
good,"The best way to learn to hate the human race, is to work at walmart. Atypical day would start out with a manager asking you to do part of their job for them, then you get to deal with a customer yelling at you for their card getting declined, while simultaneously yelling at their toddler. He's 3, he's supposed to want skittles, chill out. Then when you finally get to start doing YOUR job, another manager will come pull you out of your department to pick up slack in another department. The hardest part of the job was realizing that typically, the customer wasnt necessarily angry with you, but more with them selves . The most enjoyable part of the day was clocking out and goin home. granted, you will always get your hours, and you are able to get benefits through the company, and in certain aspects you can learn alot while working there."
good,"No es una empresa que sabe valorar a sus empleados."
good,Duties were accomplished beyond expectation time and again and there was zero recognition
good,Everybody working there is helpful and willing to work together as a team.
good,"the beggining of the day would start out just making the areas managable for the customers, after a while we would go around maintaining the shelves and assisting customers. the managers were easy to get along with but weren't ever around when they were needed."
good,"I've worked at 4 different Walmarts. Some are better than others depending on the management. Scheduling is usually ok. With one of the stores, it matched my lifestyle perfectly. You get an hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks which is nice. More than likely, once you get the job, you don't have to worry about losing it. If you're hired as a temp, it will become permanent unless you are incompetent and lazy. Ok place to work most of the time. Nothing extravagant."
good,excellent pay and great benefits. nice and friendly people. walmart dc is definitely better than the store level.
good,"Regina was my direct surpervisor and she was wonderfull to work for she would work with you and make sure you understood what was expected, the other managers where not that hands on"
good,"el ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno pero la gerencia comete errores en contra del personal, por lo demas es una exelente empresa"
good,"A typical day for me would be making sure all of the items are in stock. Also, making sure that the aisles that I work on are nice and neat because in an environment like Walmart, things can get very messy for example spills or just items being placed in different areas of the store. I try to make sure that there is nothing on the ground because it is considered to be a safety hazard. I learned that I can work by myself, but with some help will make the departments I work in heads towards a greater success. When the managers give me certain notes, I try to be reasonable and accomplish the most important tasks as I go through the day."
good,"Very busy unloading trucks, sometimes you may be without help based on how the schedules fall,  stocked shelves when there were no trucks, was in-between shifts and had two sets of management (second and third shift managers) and could have some difficult communication issues between both parties."
good,"Wal-Mart was a learning experiment , I learned how to multitask , team work, my co-workers were like family. I think the hardest part of my Job was to keep my customers happy, I loved the interaction with the customers . The most enjoyable part was the Team work from management down . I loved getting involved with the charities."
good,Respectable company to work for if you are retail oriented or retail driven. Definitely worth a business savvy individual.
good,"dont pay enough "
good,"a lot of shoplifters, management wasn't in order, co-workers was great, management  was the hardest part of the job, they wasn't trained for asset protection. The best part of the job was making the customers and employees feel safe"
good,A typical day at Walmart consist of fast paced activity that deals with reviewing documents to make sure the information is correct for the products on the truck. I help other associates fix problems that has occurred with their paperwork and also work with the customer who will receive the product on discrepancies.
good,Great place to work but sometimes the policy's can set you back
good,on a typical day you worked non stop with very little down time
good,"Compañerismo y amabilidad del equipo de trabajo. Fácil adaptación e integridad al ambiente laboral."
good,One of my great leadership learning moments was that leading is about establishing realtionships and enagaging the team to achieve great results. An engaged team is a productive team that has pride and creates a fun work environment.
good,I enjoyed going to my shift daily and management was great. I learned many new trades into knowing how to work in a department store. Any issues that arose management was always their with the open door policy. I would recommend if you like to work with the public this is a job worth having.
good,"Llegar en el camion de la empresa que pasa a cierta hora asignada en el lugar que se le asigno,poner uniforme asignado para el area de donde se ha de trabajar."
good,"My typical day was scheduling the cashiers to assigned registers/posts, keeping the change drawer, keeping the front area cleaned and assisting customers."
good,love the customer fun place to work busy always co wokers were fun peoples management was nice people from all  walks of life dinner time
good,In the beggining you will love this job and how easy it is. Then you will began to hate your schedule and you realize how lazy some managers are and place a heavy workload on you. There will be always be job security here. The bonuses are good and some people are great. Just be careful of what you say around some people. But over all walmart is not a bad place.
good,"Location was Clinton, TN  Enjoyed the retail aspect of the job and customers.  Left there for a more professional job, with Sundays off and most nights."
good,"Its ok job but not for ever , when find another just let it go.cause walmart its not the life job,you only work too hard and expect nothing ,you give but you almost get nothing."
good,I like not having a supervisor standing over you the whole work day and just checking in periodically.  You are very independent on the job.
good,"A typical day of work would be getting constantly called upon via radio for whenever the opposite cart bay is nearing empty, whilst you're the only person working on a two person job. None of the managers for the cart pushers has any idea of our perspective except one who didn't manage us and worked in the back."
good,"A typical day at walmart is always busy many customers that need assisting. The one thing I learned was  it is best to making the customer happy if you can. Management was not so helpful ,but  my co-workers would help when possible. The hardest part  about my job is there was  no breaks. I mostly enjoyed working with the customers."
good,My co-workers are great honest and hard working. The management really believes and tries to convey the Walmart way of doing things while yo do your job correctly and fast.
good,"A typical day in the tire lube express was coming in and ensuring that we had the register ready for the first customer, getting all the tire displays out and signage in place and that I had enough technicians to cover the shift, during the day I would assist as needed in both the bays and the front counter, when no help was needed I would do quality checks on the services and also inventories to ensure the we were keeping up on our ordering and that we would not run short of anything. I would handle any customer complaints that would come up and if they were not satisfied I would take the complaint to management to see if they could do anything that I could not to rectify the problem. I would ensure that all breaks and lunches were taken on time which was not always as easy as it sounds because that part of Wal-Mart is service driven and sometimes we needed all hands on deck to finish services in a timely manner. I assisted my management team in writing schedules and evaluations, and they worked with me in training and discipline and in this way we took a TLE that was struggling, with numerous customer complaints and not even trusted to do the service of our own employees, to one of the best in the region weekly. the hardest part of this was to get the technicians to buy into my plan and the management to trust that I knew what I was doing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction and new people that I was able to meet on a daily bases"
good,"Cashier was my typical day. Checking people out of the store"
good,i come in meet and greet then push carts for about 4 hours then do trash and recycling then go to lunch come back then do it all over again carry out some times if called to not much as far as learning gos manage my day well co-workers are ok a bit pushy but work place isnt my hardess part of the job is picking up cart out of the ditch because the is no guard rail next to the ditch so carts get blown and push down the ditch line the must enjoyable time at work is half hour lunch break that it as far as wal-mart gos
good,"A typical day in produce at walmart is filling and culling the floors, then when it's closing time you take out the organics, garbage, and cardboard then scrub down the floors and the cooler. I learned alot about different kinds of fruits and vegetables. my managers were friendly and always a help as well were my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when we were short staffed and trying to get our duties done. The most enjoyable part of my job was putting out flowers because I always liked to see what flowers we had in for every season."
good,"Es una empresa que maneja buen ambiente de trabajo, en ocaciones es flexible con horarios , y es una empresa enorme con presencia en muchos paises lo que la hace una empresa que trata de siempre sus empleados practiquen su cultura hacia la atencion al cliente, que es su razon de ser."
good,Very fast paced and kind of crazy. You are required to multitask and get things done quickly. Taking care of issues for employees and customer with efficiency and satisfying all parties
good,I enjoy the job.  I get to look for shoplifters all day long and wear regular clothes to blend in.  the hardest part of the job is to keep visual of the suspects while trying not to let other shoppers see u watching someone.  That is a good sign of who you are and what your job is.  They go and tell everyone what you look like.
good,"Had one day training before being thrown in to work.  Work schedule kept changing, which led to illness due to lack of sleep."
good,"walmart is a very good jobs with benfits , you are able to advance fast In this company"
good,Walmart was a great place to begin my career however they are not about your family. Overnights is a bear. Loved the fast pace life and the challenging assignments.  Is very political when trying to advance.
good,The employees of Wal-Mart are a team and work as a team but the pay they get does not add up to the amount of work they do.
good,"Working there for 4 years and counting I have had my ups and downs with WalMart. I don't agree with a lot of the policies and how they treat the associates but in the WalMart world, you don't really have a choice but to go along for the ride. I have pushed to attain the goals I have set for myself and feel comfortable in several positions in this warehouse. However, I feel that there is not much chance for advancement and all I want to do is better my family and myself. That is my main goal now."
good,"A typical day at work was fun, challenging at times but could always manage time to get projects done. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers to ensure there experience was a positive one."
good,typical work day was phones fitting rooms ear piercings jewelry
good,"My job was good, it kept me busy and let me see costumers daily. But all of a sudden I not recieved hours."
good,"Everyday was the same: come in, scan your id card, and see what tasks were set on the task manager computer. In order, we would have an approx. amount of time to do these tasks and had to finish all in order. Weather it was bread production with setting dough, baking, cooling, packaging or doing inventory and stocking the sales floor. "
good,At the beginning was happy to learn new things but the higher the person went in the company the more demanding for your time. I became over worked and health was more important so we had to part ways.
good,"Empresa multinacional, consolidada no mercado, com crenças e valores bem definidos, porém não tão bem executados na prática."
good,this job was productive and hard working built some upper body strength. But customers attitudes were not always pleasant.
good,"A typical day of work at Walmart is truly a lesson in patience and flexibility. It is being mindful that all the customers are different and their needs are too, that some have bad days, some have disabilities, some are coming from the hospital just down the road, some dishonest, and some wish you a good day and will pray for you that evening at supper. Your breaks will be early by 30 minutes, or will be overlooked entirely. The store manager is wonderful. When you have a question or do not believe you are being given a fair shake, he is a common sense man who will sit down and listen to you. Walmart is extremely lucky to have him. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is also the customers. Asking how they are preparing the groceries they are purchasing, hearing stories of who they are inviting over for supper, or how their grandchildren are picky eaters are the parts of my work day that make me smile."
good,"I enjoyed my time there the work was hard but I like staying busy,I learned how to work with difficult people. Some of the management was great to work with and my coworkers were good peoples."

good,"Very stressful work place, must have a strong work ethic and be very confident in yourself to work there."
good,"Depending on what store you work you might just find a good career within Wal-Mart. However, there are some stores that are poorly run that I'm surprised that they remain staffed."
good,Normal day non-exciting came in did job went home. Team members in my opinion pretty much felt same way. it was a job no more. When talking to management it was like it was going in one ear and out the other.
good,"being a cashier was a difficult task because of working with the customers. Some days were good, and some days were bad,. Overall not a terrible experience"
good,Always something to do. Always changing things for the next season.
good,I love my job been there ten years just looking for some where that i can use my skills and grow with the company
good,My time at Wal-mart florida was short but I was very busy and liked it very much. The work was constant and that help the shift go bye fast. Everyone worked as a team which was so important. I do miss the employees at Wal-mart Florida.
good,"I liked the job in the beginning, but now its very stressful on me."
good,"The Wal-Mart corporation has its ups and downs as with all companies. On the plus side there is a trial by fire attitude that will strengthen any individual who endures it."

I quickly grew and developed from one post to another and I learned a lot about equal opportunities and diversity in the work place. A typical day a work was never typical at all we were a very busy store and each day brought its own drama some day were dull some days were fun packed. I had great co-workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, English Brits, Nigerians, Ghanians and I enjoyed being the only South African and being amongst the senior people in the business. The hardest part was that we always had mystery shoppers but did not always achieve a high score specially when the store was extremely busy and customer service was under pressure but we still maintained a high level of highest mystery shopper scores in our region. I enjoyed the get together's that we had through out the year that were team building."

good,"I would check out customers.  Make sure that they found everything that they were looing for. Handled cash transactions and help the customers out to the car if need be,"
good,"I had excellent co-workers, but management was very catty. They were dramatic and constantly gossiping. And, it's a monotonous job, as a cashier, you just stand there ringing up groceries. For eight hours in one spot. And you have to wait for management when a problem arises and only half of them are competent it can be very frustrating, but the co-workers you have makes the job."
good,"Day of work was always fast-past from making sure that the task assigned to you and assisting in check-out lines, to helping management when they need help was all done. I learned that shopping in a store could be a totally different experience from working there. Managment didnt own up to their duties of being there for the employees when they needed help. Co-workers were positive and always helpful when it came to customers and other employees. Hardest part of the job was doing the task in your department and the task in other departments that management may assign to you without their help when you call for it. Knowing that starting work with always having something to do makes the day go by faster."
good,"come in put up stock or worked with the plants."
good,"I started at the bottom of this ""totem pole"" and worked my way up into the company as an hourly supervisor. I loved the job and most of the people I worked with. I was promised many things that I never got as a supervisor."
good,"clock in get report from days if working afternoons. Prep, cook chicken,clean,make salads..I also did stock and pharmacy tech and cashier. And floor work,sales,customer service. How to slice meat, and how to take care of people when their sick. Management is great.co-worker are great people to. cleaning the grill was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.."
good,I worked their seasonal so i had different duties but i was always busy. My manager was their to help when needed.
good,"Rochester, NY and transferred to Sterling, VA					Oct, 2006 – July, 2011 "
good,"While I enjoyed working there for many years, the changes made over the last couple years made the job very stressful being continuosly understaffed and expected to still perform as if we were fully staffed."
good,If you show some intelligence and determination to perform well with the company the sky is the limit. If you just do the minimum then you wont be getting very much.
good,It was a fun place to work at with an opportunity to meet new people everyday.
good,"i would show up on time every night,clock in walk to the loading dock"
good,Overall good place to start off work. The company has good values and people there are generally nice. Some of the management could use improvement on their job performance... they don't always do what they should.
good,work when schedule; learning the store system; management changed often; enjoyed workinng with co-workers; hardest part of the job is when working alone and have a line of customers; enjoyable part of the job is when you make a customer smile.
good,"a typical day at walmart was assisting customers with choosing the right electronics and accessories they needed. Working items onto the floor and organizing the displace to make everything fit and have items relating to the product near each other. I learned that alot of people dont really know the difference between electronics and what most of the contents in them are such as lcd led and the processors in lap tops and tablets and cell phones. Management was overall lack luster they didn't treat the employees that well, but there were some managers that seemed real interested in there employees and they always kept up to date with them but that was very few members of management. My fellow coworkers were for the most part great to work with. Some of them didnt really comprehend their job to well but were still good people and friends. Friendship was easy to find among the workers of walmart. The hardes part of working at walmart was that they were always short staffed so you would be pulled away to assist other areas of the store witch normally isnt a problem but when your area also doesnt have the appropriate amount of workers  you really fall behind in your area. I really enjoyed the coworkers we all felt like a family and got along very well definitely the most enjoyable thing about working at walmart."
good,Interestin place to work every day is an adventure in people. You learn to improve your self image. Learning your team players help you do the best job each and every day or night.
good,"very physical job, had to load 53' semi trailers  2-4 of them at a time hardest part of the job was loading everything by hand  no fork lifts"
good,Long work days that kept you busy but were tiring. I learned about retail setup and inventory. I enjoyed the people I worked with most of the time.
good,"Aprendí a trabajar en equipo con mis compañeros del área y con diferentes departamentos en inercia  en cualquier turno  siempre con respeto, tomado la retroalimentación de gente con experiencia para poder enseñar a mi equipo."
good,"-There is no job security at walmart."
good,mis dias laborales iniciaban al  momento de entrar en el area de entrada de personal tenia que hacer la entrega de objetos personales..al rgistro de entrada...recibir  y conteo de dinero para apertura de caja en alguna de las terminales..apertura de caja..atencion a los clientes con el cobro de sus mercancias entre recargas telefonicas y pagos de servicios..relizacion de transaciones cuando la caja ya excede el limite de dinero por cada cajero..al termino de la jornada se reliza la entrega de dinero para corte de caja...se registra hora de salida...
good,Daily job functions could change if a position needed to be filled for a day.  Learned how to work in many different departments.  Learned to work a telzon along with a different POS system.  Management changed over the years and seems as if management don't work together as much as they should. Hardest part was dealing with the irate customers and the best part was being able to learn so many different job functions.
good,A typical day was dealing with day to day transactiona and handling money.
good,"Cashiering."
good,"Great place to work. Great benefits."
good,"Typical Day : Unload truck, palletize products, scan for products to go to floor, retrieve and fill shelf."
good,Team work makes the dream work but my co-worker didn't understand that.
good,"As a Customer Service Manager, a typical day is very fast-paced and on-the-spot, at times very trying and stressful. I have good relations with my co-workers and the associates that I manage. Store management is also friendly and helpful for the most part, but at times lacks support for my team. As a CSM we are expected to do I job quickly and efficiently and to also be able to perform any other task throughout the store. The hardest part of the job is handling everything we do during rush hours, but how enjoyable my workers are makes up for it during the down time."
good,"Busy, and fun place to work. Liked all my co workers, nothing hard. Costumers are the most enjoyable."
good,"Supervised 60+ employees in a regular shift."
good,"A average day at work with Wal-Mart meant simply doing your job, the number one responsibility was make sure the customer was taken care of. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping the customer who came in looking for something that they were not sure where it was. I was employed with Wal-Mart twice, once as a sales associate on the floor and once as a night receiver unloading freight trucks at night. Both jobs were very rewarding to me because at each job I always gave 110%. At each time I was lucky enough to work with co-workers that were always willing to help if there was a problem or if I simply had a question."
good,"A typical day at work would be I get in at 3pm and I do many tasks including; Returns, freight, customer service problem solving and cashiering. I love customer service. I love helping people everyday even if it's with the simplest thing."
good,At the distribution center its hard work and you work for every dollar you earn but the good thing is that the pay is not cheap.  You can make good money at the distribution center but when they get slow you better make sure your not wasting money til it picks back up.
good,"I worked in Electronics and there was quite a bit of heavy lifting.Customer sales help,straightened CD's,processed photographs,balance nightly drawer.Worked through Christmas season which was difficult."
good,Always interacting with customers and co workers. Constantly moving and keeping busy. Great work environment.
good,"Physical demands are tough, which can be a good thing to keep in shape.  But it is really hard on the body although the mental aspect of the job is easy.  Walmart does not pay enough, in my opinion, for the hard work involved in stocking the store.  Annual raises were ridiculous."
good,There were fast days and days where there were down times. Some of the co-workers were good people to work with. I would advise anyone who decides to work at this walmart to work overnights.
good,es un trabajo muy mal pagado y estresante pero es un ambiente laboral entre compañeros y jefes muy relajado ya que trabajar ahí tiene su lado bueno ya que la mayoría de los empleados son buenas personas algo malo eran los días de cambio de precio ya que en departamento de venta no cambiaban sus precios y la gente llegaba a cajas con la idea del precia mas bajo y nos reclamaban
good,Nice coworkers and learned a lot on asset protection. Hardest part is the long hours on your feet standing in the entrance.
good,It was an okay place to work. My favorite part when meeting new people and making new friends.
good,good people and decent management but the higher corp people just try to screw you.
good,". Very Busy from time of beginning to end of shift"
good,"I worked my way up through 5 positions, in 3 different stores in the 5 years of my employment. I enjoyed all the positions I held. The biggest challenge was poor training, you have to learn a lot on your own as you go. Some stores are ill equipped, hard to find the tools you need or they are simply not available."
good,"Walmart Supercenter, is a very nice place to begin and build a work ethic for High School students. A typical day at Walmart consists of many costumers day in and out, shopping for objects or items needed for there daily lives. I meet and assist tons of costumers each day, and it can be very exciting to meet new or see familiar faces."
good,"a typical day at work is a lot of phone calls, customers, and multi-tasking. its a very fast pace job and i like that factor a lot. i have a great relationship with my boss and co workers. they have become my second family."
good,The surrounding is customer satisfaction focused and allows for opportunity for advance thru intense dedication.  Requires endless  work availability and dedication.  Can spend in excess of 60 hours work week.
good,Give me a squigglie........ Its not bad if you don't mind the often ridiculous tasks of motivation
good,"When I get to work I sometimes don't know where in the store that I will be working exactly. I usually end up working in any department that needs help. I do get to work out in the Garden Center more often then not and I help take of any heavy lifting along with anything else that needs to be done. "
good,"Hard work running the register and handling mad customers.  Handled cash , checks , and debit machines. Sacked groceries, and cleaned around registers.."
good,"These people show too much favoritism, but had a few good benefits like employee discount  and bonuses."
good,"In my opinion this job is very ideal for someone looking for a job while in school, or just in need of some extra money for the ""right now""!"
good,Requires  cash handling and standing on you feet all day. You have to be able to deal with all types of people.
good,A typical day at worked involved working independently in the seafood department or in a team in the deli department. As an overnight stocker I independently maintained the stock of a Specialty meat wall. I learned alot about walmarts many store departments. Co-workers were pleasant. Managment was very friendly. The hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable was the experience.
good,"The typical day at Walmart required moving pallets, stocking shelves and writing off damaged or defective merchandise.  I learned the difficulties of working the overnight shift, it was by far the most difficult part of the job.  Management will push you really hard to complete something you've never done and they expect everything to be done and orderly.  The most enjoyable aspect of the job was the fact that they gave everyone a decent amount of time for their break and one dollar more than the morning shift employees."
good,The job itself at wal mart is not that difficult of a job but the co workers and management at wal mart are not that good and do not create a good work environment
good,"Walmart is a great company if you are looking to do your work and go home and not worry about your job. There are many opportunities for advancement in a challenging workplace. Expectations are always high, and it can be stressful at times. Co-workers are great, and it can be like a family atmosphere."
good,"always busy"
good,"When working for Wal-Mart as a Department Manager there is never a dull day.  Between customer service, merchandising, inventory, and many other job functions there was always something to be accomplished.  "
good,"Stock all the merchendise, I learnes that I was the fastest of all the employees who worked there getting all my stuff done and then I would go help my co workers. Some of the management was awesome loved to work with them others not so much. Co workers did there best to get done but we were always being monitered and pretty much ran like slaves by some of our managers. Hardest part of my job was keeping my temper down when some of the managers dogged us to move faster but we were already done with everything. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,I cant say anything bad about walmart. Its a job and I really enjoyed the people I worked with. It is a stepping stone job and all of my co-workers are excited to see me move on to bigger and better things. Im currently a cashier at walmart and management treated everyone as well at they could for a large business. The harder parts of the job were sometimes the customers. They are sometimes unruly and can not be pleased but we all have bad days.
good,"a typical day of work inquires coming in at 10 pm having a team meeting being put in your area to work , being harassed by managers   , who sleep most of their shift. Having to take on an extra work load because other team members are calling out. First 15 minute break at 11:45, then back to the floor to work. At 2 am you take your hour lunch break and back to the floor you go. If you finish your area, instead of them letting you zone it they move you to start on another area. At 4:45 you take another 15 minutes and then your bk on the floor. Right before your shift ends which is 7 am, you get a complaint about your areas not being stocked and zoned when you were shifted around all night by managers and didn't have a chance to zone anything or finish your last area."
good,"Very busy, stressful, over-whelming (sometimes), under paying job."
good,"The job wasn't that bad.  Simply put, managers were not doing their jobs.  They seemed to push everything aside, and let it keep going."
good,"This company had good plans and procedures in place but the lower level manager did not follow these.  It is very hard as a new associate to get needed information about company procedures and practices.  I came from a company before where team work among supervisors was a very big thing and I noticed Walmart was the opposite.  It was each manager for themselves and they would step on each other to do it.  Some extremely unprofessional behavior among the supervisors as well, such as talking negatively about others, including upper management, in front of other associates."
good,"Customer service, stocking, price changes, putting up displays, cashier were all part of my job.  sometimes long hours and sometimes worked night shift."
good,"Very poor management at this store. Especially on the fresh side. The employees are great. Good team work here. They do offer benefits , but you have to wait 1 year . Part time employees are never eligible for dental, and it is like pulling teeth trying to get full-time. They find ridiculous reasons here to write you up. The pay is alright , but not compared to there competitors. One good thing is you are allowed to be up to 13 minutes late with out it counting against you. Also you get an hour lunch, and 2 fifteen minute breaks on a full shift."
good,"good hours and days off, keeps me in shape, pay is good, work in a cooler and sales floor-hardest part is heavy lifting over my head"
good,I like workin there because workers an costumers were great. an it give me my first experise in retail. an it thought me a lot as not be afaired an speek up to your manger when you are upset.
good,"coworkers were the best part of this job "
good,start at 11 pm and stalk shelves all night then when stocking is done we zone and make the store nice for customers in morning
good,"Wal-Mart is a high paced work place. I liked working in that environment. You learn a lot working with different people, different cultures, and different attitudes. I learned that patience is very important in a BIG work-place. My co-workers were very helpful in assisting when they were needed. The most hardest part of the job was probably unloading the truck.I overall enjoyed the job until i left to attend school."
good,A typical day would be sorting and picking items to go out on the shelves. My management and coworkers were pleasant to be around and work with. The hardest part of the job was staning on my feet for 9 hours a day but it was worth it.
good,"A place for students and workers with flexible schedules."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers find anything they wanted, however there is a lot of area to cover in a Walmart store, but I could tell you where the item is at"
good,Some of the managers were negative towards me being a female in male work enviornment
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart. Over the years I have been hired back four times which has been amazing. Our store is a training store, so quite often our management comes and goes and it is very inconsistent and difficult to get used to. Recognition for employees also lacks and I think as a store we work really hard."
good,"i do inventory for walwart. a basic day consist of keeping counts in the backroom accurate, sending merchandise to the sales floor.  at times it could get out of hand, management keeps track of time of how long it takes us to get done all the while breathing down our necks.  co workers are pretty cool."
good,Wal-Mart always required dedication and sometimes more than the usual. My day was  always filled with daily duties to be completed by shifts end. The hardest part of the job was giving up so much family time. But at the end of the day being able to see the work I completed was a pure satisfaction
good,"Era fácil socializar con los compañeros, los directivos eran buena onda, te asignan un padrino para que todas las dudas oh problemas que tengas dentro de la empresa puedas tener un apoyo directamente con la persona, el trabajo en general era un poco pesado sobre todo en época de temporada, llegaba mucha mercancía."
good,"Working at the front end is not for the faint of heart; the lines are always long or its so dead that you'll have nothing to do at all. People are often rude and there's very little you can really do to fix some of the problems that arrive. Customers come to you wanting to know where things are, but there's little chance you'll know since you are only ever at the front end. If the register locks up or something goes wrong with a transaction, you usually can't do anything but wait for one of the CSMs to use their key and code to fix it. The policies also often change and there's barely any time you'll ever get to do the CBLs or attend meetings unless you come in on your time off--though they do compensate you for all meetings."
good,It  Good  Hard  Place   To   Work.  With  Good   Fun  Hard  Wording    Freind    The   Most  Enjoyable   Part  Is  Working  With      Management  As  A   Team.    Learning  New   Think  as   work   Side  By  Side.

good,I like the people I worked with and got along with everyone.  I learned how to deal with different people in many different situations.  The management wasn't so great. The job wasn't hard at all.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and learning different things about the store.  Also the activities every now and then for the store.
good,Set up register and start checking people out. To always stay level headed with all types of people and circumstances. Co workers were great. They were very helpful and willing to help. The hardest part of the job was always being pleasant and courteous to costumers that were angry with you because the line was to slow. The most enjoyable was costumers praised for a job well done.

good,I work In three different departments and I have to know how to multi-task when it comes to getting stuff done and you know what your doing. Solving peoples problems and answering questions that may be needed to be answered. 
good,"Working at a distribution center requires you to be very productive. Each and every day you have to be able to load an excessive amount of boxes and pallets into a trailer for a very long period of time. I learned that working at a Distribution Center requires more work than a typical job. You have to be very flexible type of worker. The management team at Walmart is very friendly and polite. The co- workers at Walmart are very hard working people who are courteous, helpful, and polite. The hardest part of being a loader is dealing with the heat inside the trailers and the amount of work you have to get done on a daily basis. You have to be able to adapt to the work environment and have to be smart of how you get the job done. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to only work three days out of the whole week. It is a great schedule which allows you to accomplice things outside of work."
good,I work 50 to 60 hours a week and moved up in the company fast. I like working at Wal-Mart. I like the fast past and the people.

I have to managers. I work along side them to make my areas look better. The hardest part of my job is to make sure that the side counter are kept full all the time. I think the most enjoyable part of my job is that I can work with different people and I like the customers."

good,"3:00 pm review truck inventory and deploy work duties to Associates"
good,Unload trucks buy hand. Items would be placed on pallets according to department. When truck was fully unloaded pallets were pulled to floor to be placed on shelves
good,I prepare the cash office along with each idividual cash register for daily operations. In my role I have learned to manage large amounts of cash in an effort to reconcile each register for daily deposits for the entire store. Walmart's store management assists me grow in challenging leadership abilities. I enjoy working with a team to provide great customer service. The most fulfilling aspect of my repsonibilities is to accuratley ensure the store's cash balance/deposits each day while maintining a 97 percent approval on my daily score card
good,Great place if you need a summer job or are a single person with no kids.  
good,Working at Walmart is very busy. It is a fun a interesting place. Its a good place of learning to work with the world in many different experiences. A typical day at work is very busy and your customer service skills have to be on point. 
good,"The pharmacy had it's good and bad days. I loved my co-workers and the Pharmacists, we had fun and enjoyed working together. Wal-Mart as a company, I don't think I would work for ever again."
good,"Walmart.com is a fair place to work. They try to bring the aspects of tech savvy ""Silicon Valley"" to the penninsula area, by creating the critical thinking ambiance,with white boards draping the hallways and conference rooms.The perks are sweet too, such as free lunch, game rooms, fitness room and much more. Walmart creates a very cultural environment and allows all ethnic groups to bring their culture to the office for a number of events to create the diversity and knowledge of life outside the norm as one may know it."
good,"Personally I got a lot of experience working here, I started in apparel and when I left had ended up in hardware. No, it wasn't because I was bad, it was because I showed them they could rely on me. Because of this job I feel like I've had a little experience working in quite a few different departments, though when understaffed you end up doing multiple departments which leaves you tired and makes you feel like you really didn't accomplish much"
good,"Working at walmart, I learned how to deal with complicated customers and how to control my frustrations when at work."
good,Every day i would come in and they would have projects to start on. The projects are pretty simple but the time lines were set almost to impossible. The co-workers are always hard working and reliable. Management only looks out for themselves and would never attend or listen to problems we had. Whether it was school scheduling to doctors notes.
good,It is a place where you can learn about retail and other parts of business.  I feel that it may be a good place to start out when looking for your first job.  
good, My coworkers were great and hard working but a lot of the times felt unappreciated. The hardest part of the job was constant negative from the contracted in optometrist.  
good,management and the rules change so much you dont know what they are the next work week.
good,"helping people with buying needs / if need up sale to added items that would benefit there needs to better use the equipment of chose"
good,"A typical day includes:"
good,"ok company, but managers can make things hard if not liked . need to really find good managment "

good,"Recibir turno de mi par, verificar la asistencia del personal, revisar equipo de trabajo y de seguridad de los asociados, realizar junta de 10 minutos, asignar el trabajo a realizar por los asociados, dar seguimiento a los pendientes por meddio del sistema, estar al pendiente de las juntas con la gerencia y la subgerencia del area de recibo, estar al pendiente de los  cursos y capacitaciones, ya que estas no siempre se programaban con anticipacion, etc."
good,"The main focus is to get rid of the overstock and clean the most you can. Also give nice customer service"
good,Wal-Mart expects everything to be in order and correct.  Management does not respect the employee like other retail stores.  
good,"I didn't work that long, just for internship. I enjoy working with the people and learned a lot."
good,"Working in the money center I tend to see the same customers that come in weekly and some daily. Working in the money center I have learned patience. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with customers that think they know how my job is done and explaining to them the correct way of why what they are trying to do can not be done, which could be due to policy change. The most enjoyable part of my job are my customers and co workers that I do see daily."
good,Working for the largest corporation on the planet was an eye opening experience. While working for a company with millions of employees might make the average employee feel like a small cog in a massive machine and the product of your hard a little harder to discern. Working for Walmart was an experience I wouldn't change there was always new things to learn and monotony was not often felt as their was an infinite amount of new things to learn. 
good,"Hard work in a day"
good,"Welcome customers in a friendly and courteous manner. "
good,"el trabajo en wal-mart es trabajo pesado con horario de entrada pero no de salida, aprendí el manejo de montacargas HP así como a llevar un inventario, almacenar y etiquetar mercancía, cargar y descargar, la oportunidad de crecimiento o aumento salarial es poca o nula ya que no hay evaluaciones mensuales como se estipula en el contrato"
good,I worked from 10pm-7am stocking shelves and working with customers. My co-workers were like family. the hardest part of the job was working night shift and taking care of my 3 year old. at the time he was 2. the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,I helped customers check out and if they ever needed help finding an item directed them to it. For the most part my store never had enough employees because corporate would not let us hire people.  this often meant I had to do jobs like pushing carts or help other associates with their jobs.
good,"I love my coworkers, and i love the customers. The hardest part of my job is to please all the customers. The most enjoyable part has been making new friends, and having my regular customers come in. I have learned a lot through working at walmart. I have had many oppurtunities to be in management, and other things around the store. My co-workers have become my best friends. "
good,"Overall it was a good place to work. Management was great and co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job, was keeping up with all the calls for carry-outs and keeping the carts in store for the customers, because sometimes it got really busy there."
good,"Heath Benefits are second to none."
good,"Since I worked overnight, I started working at 8 pm and ended at 5 am. I learned to serve , give explanation the the customers, making hot food, slicing the meat, cheese, labeling the merchandise, marking down the price of the merchandise, making the list of merchandise that needed to be order so the department will have enough merchandise for the future.The hardest thing to do was when we had to re-arrange the freezer, and the most enjoyable was when I saw the satisfaction on the customer faces because of the service that I gave."
good,"Answer customers’ questions and provide information on procedures or policies, compute and records totals of transactions, count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change, greet customers entering establishments, and issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers."
good,"It isn't very organized, not enough employees to assist customers"
good,"In my opinion Wal-Mart is a good company but the schedule is not family combine. In addition, the daily duties are very stressful. However, in daily routine I could manage around 35 associates and support a store manager."
good,You get to meet people from all walks of life and are exposed to many different sides of the business.  
good,"I would go in and stock shelves, zone and clean up."
good,"Break down pallets, organize where each item goes then stock the shelves, and Zone up the Aisle. The management team is usually  reasonable. The co-workers are cool to work with. The hardest part is when they don't schedule enough people for the shift. Makes the workload heavier. Going Home( joking with the other co-workers)"
good,When I first started 9 years ago I loved every part of this company. But now as the economy change so does the people and what the company stands for. The benefits could be a lot better and health care could too. But i'm blessed to have a job.
good,"On a typical work day when the work load is heavy is the beginning of the month and on the weekend. I've learned alot while working in produce such as culling, sanitizing, and makng sure all produce is fresh. The hardest part of the job is when the other associates does not pull there weight. The most enjoyable part of the job when you know for sure everything is fresh and your area is spotless."
good,"Everyday I would start out by cleaning and zoning the shelves. I would help any customer that needed information on an item that we had in stock, and I would retrieve that item for them as well (if we had it in the back). I worked the register and checked out items for anyone who found whaat they were looking for. Working at Wal-Mart was my first job, so I learned communication skills, how to help out a customer, how to work the register, and different job requiring skills. The management were friendly and welcoming. I loved my co-workers, they made the job more enjoyable. The hadest part of the job was when a numerous amount of customer wanted your help, and they would get disapponted if you didn't help them first. The most enjoyable part of the job was that it kept me busy. I also loved how much gratitude the customers showed when I helped them.  "
good,"the facility i worked at was decent, they worked around my then hectic life and provided me with a flexible schedule when i needed."
good,"A typical day at work was OK , i drove forklifts and helped others stock selves."
good,Typical day at work could go either good or bad. I learned you have to  not trust many there at this company. Management was not really helpful as they try to out shine each other and kept to their self a lot about things they know.
good,"My day would start with store tours and meetings. We asigned tasks based on what the store managers plans were for the day, including findings on the tour.  As shift manager I managed salaried managers and hourly associates. Followed up on delegated tasks and gave new tasks accordingly.  Constantly touring the store and helping customers as needed. Walking individualized departments for merchandising opportunites and coaching and directing associates."
good,i worked toys and stocked shelfs and worked the unloading trucks i worked the cash-register 
good,"Cashier.  When not busy I would help stocking."
good,I have learned so much in my 12 years with Walmart. I have been given the opportunity to move from a store to a distribution center. I have also been able to move to different positions within the center.
good,"A typical day included organizing basket carts, providing great guest service, and stocking freight. It was my first job so i learned how to adjust to the real life. The management team were firm and knew what had to be done. My co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was managing work with my high school work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work and stay out of trouble."
good,"Always a busy day at our store.  Enjoyable work environment.  Great co-workers, fun and friendly.  Management was easy to interact with.  I would have to say the hardest part of my job was having to tell a customer no to returning an item (because you knew it was theft).  Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers in the community and seeing them return."
good,You work with fun people but at the same time everyone liked to pass the work on to someone else instead of just doing it.
good,"Avalio a empresa como boa no setor em que domina,tendo algumas dificuldades como a falta de equipamentos de trabalho,como por exemplo no meu setor as vezes falta recipientes para o embalamento dos produtos vendidos.Mas tirando esse tipo de falta a empresa é bem atuante. "
good,"I handle all returns and exchanges on items. I handle sending bill payments, money orders, sending and receiving money with moneygram. I train new employees, cashiers and customer service representatives. I deal with the deaf community as I can use ASL and I have known ASL since I was a kid and have a deaf brother, so people often look to me to sign and communicate with the deaf population. I also handle tasks from my managers as well."
good,"Toda a experiência profissional que  tenho aprendi dentro da empresa ;"
good,"Most enjoyable part was working with customers, they are so diverse!"
good,Wal-mart is great place to start of working. You get a change to meet people from all over world and different backgrounds. You get a change to train in different departments and learn the skills needed to move in the company.
good,"I opened the store every day for more than 6 years at 6 am and I loved it untill about one year ago.  My co-workers are great we all use to work as a team but that isn't what Wal-mart wants any more. Everyone is afraid to do anything to help thier fellow associates due to the fact that you may be terminated for not following policy. "
good,"stocking freight,costumer service,knowledge of product"
good,"As far as the work goes, it was pretty much simple. I loved working for walmart. Only problem i had was on night where we was short of staff, managers would take out that problem on you. They would threaten you by termination and put you on a set time whenever short of staff. The good managers told us do the best we can and they even got on the floor stocking with the associates. Another thing too if you dont read up on Wal-Mart, they would hiring you part-time with full-time hours and tell you your full-time, that way when it comes time to cut hours back they can easily cut yours back and when you complain about it, you cant do nothing about it. Plus you have to be working with them over a year to receive benefits, but only if ur full-time for a year. I done seen people had to work a whole year over again jus to get benefits. Overall, I like the job, but the workplace had bad blood in the managers. Some cared, and some don't at all!"
good,This was a very busy job with high demands for low pay. The great thing about this job is what I did not get in pay I did get in job satisfaction. I learned a lot about true customer service and I met some amazing people that I was able to call co-workers. The hardest part of the job were the long hours. The part I most enjoyed was providing excellent customer service to my customers.
good,The start of my shift would include being there fifteen min early to have a team meeting. Once the meeting was done we would do a walk through of the store to properly place personnel in areas needing the most work & assign the fastest person in said area.
good,"When you apply for this position it state it is a demanding job they pay you a low rate to do your own job, other peoples job and even the supervisors job. The only good part is working with co workers. In which they all quit. I would have stood there but they didn't really care about my situation of a hardship. "
good,"Walmart doesn't pay well at all starting out but if you're a hard worker, you can move up the chain pretty quickly. Walmart seems to be a great community of people too. You get the feeling that the company really cares about the world and about you."
good,"I was in charge of cashing out customers, and dealing with customer service needs. I learned how to interact with all people both cooperative and difficult. Though the management staff was busy,  they always helped when they could. My co-workers were friendly and supportive. The hardest part of my job was having to say no to people. The best part of my job was the interaction with the cooperative customers."
good,Loved walmart wonderful company wish there was more room for growth inside but overrall ok
good,"Helpto customer what they need at the store."
good,"A normal day at walmart is very balance at times everybody is doing their own thing, and doing their work task. the most thing i have learned at walmart. Is that my job is a busy place with alot of different people coming in and out. the managers are very helpful and all about customer satisfaction.The co-workers are friendly and talkative.Most hardest part at walmart is when different seasons come. we have to change prices n Modules.My most enjoyable part at work is when im completing my task"
good,I learned to find ways to work fast in order to meet deadlines. Hardest part was taking on a lot of work not sure if you could get everything completed in time due to shortage of co-workers. The most enjoyable parts were learning different areas of the store and being able to help customers.
good,My day was just coming in seeing what departments I was to stock and starting my day. Management was ok but could get a little excited if they thought you weren't going to get done. Other than that good poeple to work with
good,typical day was clocking in getting your register and checking people out
good,"customer assistance, stocking new merchandise, ordering out of stock merchandise, and changing merchandise end caps is a typical day."
good,I really enjoyed the fast paced enviornment. I love providing customer service and learned the most about providing quality service and dealing with customers while working here.
good,"When I worked at Walmart, I was told I was part time yet they insisted giving me near-full time hours, not complaining about that though. I was full time at college at the time, I told them 3 months in advance and kept reminding them I was going to be going to college and they told me they had it covered. Little did i know, they had me scheduled for work during my class hours so it was either skip class or skip work. I told the Human Resources and Manager and both were non-sympathetic to my ordeal. I got numerous call ins and in trouble both at work and at school. I failed a good majority of my classes as a result and after 1 month of being out of college they let me go from my job. So I was out of work, had a student loan to pay off, and they even missed giving me 1 of my checks."
good,Download your freight
good,Working at Walmart is very challenging because work is tough and always a busy place. But over all great benefits and great pay
good,"You learn different areas of sales; The workers are relatively nice, they try to help you when you need it, most are friendly; The managers are never around when you need them and are often mean;"
good,"Working at walmart has shown me what customer service can be. I have learned to juggle over four departments in one day, from working in lawn and garden to cutting fabric. The hardest thing about my job is keeping up with returns while doing work in other departments. My managers are great but lack communication skill amongst themselves. My coworkers are fun to work with and have a good attitude. It one of the many reasons I like working there."
good,"Walmart is a very High impact, time demanding, and customer driven company especially at the management level. Its a very fast paced environment and company directions change constantly. No two days are the same and there is no such thing as a typical day. What makes the job challenging but great is that you are directly involved in the customers experience."
good,workload was a little heavy due to lack of hiring
good,"Ahi nunca se pierde tiempo siempre existe algo que hacer. Aprendi a tratar a la gente como clientes, en cuanto a la gerencia pues en todos lados siempre va a haber buenos y malos; en este caso siempre hubo uno que nos apoyara, lo q no me parecio que no toman en cuenta tu trabajo para subirte de puesto."
good,"Os dias se trabalho em a empresa Wallmart eram recheados de problemas para resolver. Aprendi auditar processo, primeiros socorro, brigada de incêndios, como realizar a abordagem quando a ocorrência de furtos, etc...Problemas com a gerência, pois, meu trabalho lá dependia de pedir favores para superiores como por exemplo o gerente que boa parte do tempo se encontrava ocupado."
good,"i was a over night stocker, i learn a lot from them i learn how to pick orders,how to talk to custumers,and learn how to work as a team.i was the lead men in my department,sometime it do get hard when they bring a lot of product to me and my crew, but when we knock them out and a fast salf maner.that is like my most enjoyable time"
good,"A typical work day for me was ok for the most part. I cashed checks, did returns, helped customers. For the most part I enjoyed working with my co-workers everyone was somewhat nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was handling customer complaints. most enjoyable part was making money to support myself."
good,"• Defined project scope and requirements, maintaining project plans and documentation for all system"
good,"um dia de trabalho era bastante atarefado com tarefas pré estabelecidas.Pude Aprender a liderar e motivar uma equipe , ser responsável buscar metas e objetivos. A gerência tinha"
good,"I would start with notes from my manager of what needed to be done and the time i was given. I learned how to work very very fast, was a fast paced environment. Management appreciated what i gave. Hardest part of my job was when i was on my own at times on very busy days but also made the day go by faster. Most enjoyable was when i was able to really help many people."
good,It is a great starter job to learn and get experience. The place is very clickish so becareful of who you talk to.
good,"A typical day in electronics consists of helping customers with their questions which requires that you be knowledgeable of the the products available in the store. You assist customers with their questions, demonstrate products (when applicable), check the back for items that are not stocked on the floor, and ringing up customer purchases. Part of the job is also to keep the section looking neat and organized and to stay alert to possible theft."
good,llegar
good,Wal-mart use to be a a fun oriented family work place but things are not the same..
good,"A typical day consists of Unloading the trucks and sorting merchandise per department, Taking the merchandise out to sales floor for overnight associates to stock, pick products from backroom that needs stocked, bin merchandise that is overstock and finally clean work area. Lots of heavy lifting and pulling. While I do not mind the hard work, I just wish they would compensate for pay for such hard and demanding work."
good,"very fast paced job which i like but pay is low. i use electric pallet jacks reg/ pallet jacks,walkie stacker. we unload trucks then stock shelves"
good,easy enough place to start working in and easy to learn procedures depending of your position. very easy to move up in the ranks to supervisor if you are knowledgeable. depending on your management its an okay job.
good,I enjoyed working and talking with customers. I picked up great multi task skils. The most enjoyable part of this job was the discounts! The hardest part was also the customers.
good,"O trabalho não era dificil, aprendi a lidar com rotina, com o publico, a lidar com dinheiro isso foi muito bom ! A gerencia era mais ou menos, o encarregado ouvia mais o lado do empregado ,os colegas eram maravilhosos, mais os horarios mudavam muito e tinha que trabalha aos fins de semana, e a parte boa que conheci pessoas que vou levar pro resto da vida"
good,A very fast pace work place from mornings to night times. You really learn a lot every day. Managers are always breathing down your neck. Every day is a hard day from morning to end. The most enjoyable part of the day is at the end of your shift.
good,It was my job at Wal Mart to unload items into inventory and then stock those items on the sales floor
good,was ok steady work sometimes fun other times very nerve racking co workers were good hardest part of job was everyone thinking they were boss management could have been better but were ok.
good,Otima empresa com otimas instalacoes.
good,"my job position was a cashier, I was able to learn new processes and procedures in the retail industry; which i love to learn new operations, however i wanted something challenging, Walmart was just my fill in the gap to help me obtain a better opportunity."
good,"Very fun place to work if you enjoy working with people. However, there is DEFINITELY a glass ceiling preventing part-time employers from achieving full-time employment. This takes the pride or sense of achievement out of work. Management, honestly, seems like they're in just as much of a bind as their employees are. I think management at the highest level (bentonville, AR) is ultimately responsible. Not local managers."
good,"cash customers out,stock shelves ,order merchandise and tidy department,assist customers with whatever they need.some management was supportive and fair,others were not as well versed in that area.coworkers were fun and a pleasure to work with.hardest part was resolving problems for irate customers.most enjoyable was interacting with the various customer."
good,easy work to do
good,Focused in dairy department more than any other area. Dealt with all kinds of people. Enjoyed the people I worked with. My least favorite was when it came to management. Too many managers having their own agenda instead of having one agenda as a whole. People's schedules got cut way too often.
good,"Workingt here the pay was good and it paid the bills. The cons are to many to list however I'll still try; horrible benefits I was pregnant and had a $3600 deductible with a $ 600 co-pay per a docter visit, the politics out there are horrible, honesty and ethics aren't valued, other employes are allowed to malign you and it doesn't have to be the truth but managers will still listen, managers could be very petty and unproffesional and for God's sake don't ever Open Door something, if you get konked on the head from a bottle falling out of the sky its your fault in fact if anything happens it will always be your fault lets leave it at that. And simply comming to work keeping to yourself is not enough for people to leave you out of the drama. To get a free lunch you have to almost kill yourself going over production. But "" Hey if you can stomach it ,it pays the bills"". Be prepared to encounter some inter office bullies there are bullies there and noone does a thing about it."
good,"awesome working with the general public, could be long and tedious due to repetitive duties"
good,II worked overnight as a receiving associate. When I first started I was told a certain weight limit to the things we would lift on a normal basis which was well under what I could do repetitively for 8 hours. I informed the manager before I started that due to a surgery I could only lift up to a certain limit. After a week or so they put me in areas where I would sometimes lift twice what I was supposed to. I tried to ask for placement elsewhere but they were severely understaffed. The management was terrible. There were supervisors/managers in relationships with employees they were in charge of which no one seemed to care. There is no amount of money that could get me to work there again.
good,"At Wal-mart I can walk through the door, get greeted by other employees, clock in, report to the manager, told where I need to go and start working. I like that about this job but if a manager is having a bad day they will put it on you in almost every way. I learned how to use company equipment, help other department because they had to quick train me, plus I learned where everything was. My co-workers were fun to be around and the customers were even better at times."
good,todos os dias eram bons bem agradaveis
good,"Nice pay, enough time off to enjoy family. Company will retain lots of great individuals if they treated people with respect and dignity."
good,I had great co-workers and management is great. I learned a lot about doing money transactions. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers.. But I dealt with them well.
good,I go to work and clock in after I go and pick up my squack box.
good,i would come in and start by inventorying the back room and then take the information given to me on my hand held and restock the sales floor. If needed i would work at site to store helping customers to pick up their online orders. However sometimes site to store was not properly organized and it was timely for a customer to get their order. my coworkers were great and friendly and supportive the managers sometimes did not care about the associates needs as far as personal matters.
good,"unloading trucks and stocking, writing labels and labeling shelves"
good,"My experience at Walmart started off very good. I was in Customer Service and I enjoyed going to work every day. I liked all of my co-workers and managers. My pay was well above minimum wage and I usually worked between 25 and 30 hours a week. After I transferred to another Walmart my experience and love for the job declined drastically. My pay was dropped almost $2.00, I was put in a cashier position instead of customer service and for almost a week straight I would get off work when I was supposed to, but none of my managers acknowledged me as I was leaving. I felt unappreciated. After I transferred to the second store I had a strict schedule that I needed to follow outside of work with my family life and school, but it seemed that my management was not willing to work with me and my hectic life schedule. That is why I had to leave Walmart."
good,The day start off unloading trucks and down stack the freight. Sort thru all the load of pallets divide all the work in areas or sections. Stock the freight than zone it to be neat for customers attention. Take all trash and plastic wrapping to trash compacter.
good,"My day here consisted of me unloading trucks and doing picks. I would also stock shelves and help other stockers if finished early. I got along with everyone , almost felt like we were a big family ."
good,I always enjoyed coming into work. Loved my coworkers and managers team.The hardest part of the job was taking care of outrate customers but it also tought me how to deal with the situation. the most enjoyable part was working with a lot of different people .
good,"Great team environment, good interaction with groups. The hardest part of the job would have been keeping up with all the compliance opportunities brought to our attention from the different locations. Working from a desk to try and resolve issues in Hawaii would always prove to be unique experiences."
good,Certos valores a gente nunca esquece
good,"It was nice meeting new people every day. I like change, so this job helped with that on a daily basis."
good,"Começo a trabalhar as 07:00h abasteço químicos nos laboratórios, reviso se as planilhas estão preenchidas, audito laboratórios reviso se os produtos estão próprios para consumo, aprendi como lidar com o mau humor dos colegas a ser paciente, meus colegas de trabalho são pessoas que nem sempre gostam de ser auditados mas o convívio é bom, parte mais difícil fazer auditoria, mais agradável enviar relatórios."
good,the good thing about wal mart was that it was an easy job for me. it would get kind of busy which i wouldnt mind because it makes thr day glo by quicker. walmart thaught me good customer service skills because there moto is the customers first and there always right. the hardest part of the job was answering to rude customers. but with the customer service skills they train you to have lets you handle it in a professional matter.
good,"A typical night, we would clock-in, and go to our meeting. In the meeting, manager's would tell the associates of what product, and how big the product trucks where for the night. From there my co-workers and I would go to our isles and begin working on the product."
good,It was a nice place to work until I told them I needed to change my availability due to my classes at University of phoenix. They didn't take that well so I utilized the open door policy to my advantage and was isolated from rest of the unloading associates.
good,this company is a good place to work for if you really need a job. members of managment lack sense of professionalism.
good,a typical day at work is very busy
good,"Telephones ring off the hooks. To many phone line and not enouch associates to answer the phones. Open with 3 techs and have 4 customer lines and 4 doctor line, leaves nobody the fill."
good,Boa empresa
good,Walmart had an upbeat environment and it was a joy working there.
good,Schedules go from 40 hours to 20 hours week to week to fit the big wal-mart's payroll. Does not have much respect for there employee's
good,"I had many jobs duties, I changed oil, oil filters, tires and did fuel injection services. When needed I would run the register and assist people inside the store. the management team would make sure everyone was doing what they were supposed to be doing. The other coworkers and I would make sure we got all the cars done in a timely manner and that the customer was happy with their service."
good,A very stable environment that pays well for the hard work that is performed. There is a team spirit. You learn to appreciate the good as well as learn from the bad. It is hard to juggle the work/life balance for salaried associates.
good,I was hired threw first choice staffing as a temp to work there for the rush hours.
good,Managers always point out the negative and positives of each associate.
good,"I was an Overnight stocker and i worked really well with my co-workers, i learned how to operate a manual plaaet jack and use a pricing gun, and a box crusher, and a box cutter, i worked in various departments, and i enjoyed helping the custimers when they needed me and the hardest part of my job was to get all of my departments done with an 7 1/2 hour time fram espically when younget 3 or more in a busy night."
good,Essa empresa é uma escola e agrega valores.
good,Great place to work if you are a older person. Mnagers are not nice and like to yell at people. No rewards for your hard work.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is helping and building relationships with customers. I enjoy helping people. Management is always willing to help the associates learn new procedures. I have learned so much while working for Wal-Mart, everything from handling multiple customers at a time, large cash transactions, remodeling departments, training new associates and department managers and writing schedules and yearly evaluations.The most difficult part of my job would be dealing with a high turnover rate. It is hard to be one person trying to do the work of three, but it pushes me to try my best and prove that I can do my job as well as cover for another associate."
good,"Trabajo agradable solo el salario encuentro poco, para el trabajo que realizo."
good,"I worked at one of the newest store in the Valley, it had a few Bumps in it's young life. My typical day at work was helping customers find merchandise they required, restocking the shelves, cleaning and maintaining the shelves and aisles of trash. I learned much about stock, and ordering procedures, as well as time management and communication skills. My co-workers were good people who were friendly and well trained. The hardest part of my job, was the fluctuating hours, at the time I needed a more set schedule, but I adapted easily. I enjoyed helping the customers the most on this job. When they left happy I felt a sense of pride."
good,this is a good job for people in school or first time workers.
good,Managing cash register
good,"My day at work is pretty much the same. There are about 7 of us that work on the BI Team. We have a certain amount of picks to do every night, when we are done picking we deliver all the picks to the appropriate departments. Then we go to lunch. After lunch we bin all of the merchandise that wasn't restocked back in the steel."
good,"It depends on the department you are in. In the fresh areas, there is always a lot to be done. There is a lot of helping customers find various items, as well as handling complaints. As a cake decorator you deal with a lot of very kind and also very terrible people. During the holidays there is a lot of pressure to make sure everything is full. Sadly a lot of the time that is not possible due to order errors or in many cases just a lack of help in general. There is a lot of cleaning to be done. I will say this Wal-Mart is the cleanest place I have worked."
good,I would check out customers at my register and help customers with their needs. I learned that bagging groceries are hard on your hands and back. The mangers are ok but they constantly look for reasons to fire you instead of helping you. The co-worker were nice and good to me. The hardest part was standing on my feet the whole time and bagging groceries. The best part was helping the customers.
good,signed in and got my work station. i learned how to work different stations and management was very pleasant to work with. my co workers were very different in values and backgrounds. the hardest part of the job was to learn a new work station in an hour. the most enjoyable part of the job was the fact i got to learn the different parts of the mega store.
good,great place to work and everyone is so nice. always chances to advance and move up to better positions
good,"I really enjoyed the job and the people as most everyone tried to achieve company goals and targets and on a consistent basis we did. I worked at night as the Overnight Asst. Mgr and it was my responsibility to run the entire operation of the store from 7:30pm-8am. That entailed most importantly that we were delivering customer service at a high level 100% of the time and that production was met by each and every associate. Teaching and training were nightly things I enjoyed doing as I got to see associates grow and reach their capabilities. "" Inspect what I expect,"" "" Trust but verify"" are my words to live by as I would give positive feed back to those who did well and reteach and retrain and possibly coach those who did not perform to company standards. What I learned is that even though the concept is the same for all retail stores meaning the bottom line is to make money, grow the business, give unbelievable world class customer service, retain our associates to name a few the way getting their can sometimes be different. What I mean is as I use this as an analogy. The same goal of reaching the Super Bowl is the same for all 32 football teams as well as scoring more points than the other team is the goal that will help you reach your ultimate goal. The difference is all 32 teams have different play books for play calling as well as players codes of conduct to name a few. For me being with one company for 22 years that was the biggest challenge I came up against but I really am proud of the fact that I was able to overcome that and learn the new playbook. The Management team"
good,Very well maintained work environment and works well around individuals life.
good,workplace was ok the things i did not like about it was the management and the unexpected cut of hours.
good,Main objective for Wal-Mart is customer service.
good,"Um lugar bom de se trabalhar,aprendi muitas coisas la dentro,do lado dos meus colegas,é bom trabalhar em equipe principalmente pela gerencia que não era muito rígida .Tenho certeza que o setor todo era muito agradavel de se trabalhar."
good,Worked independently most of the time. Managers were understanding. Customer service was very important.
good,Wal Mart is a decent company to work for if you only require a part time job. Their new policy of no more full time status unless you are management has forced many of their employees that would have remained loyal to search for more reliable income
good,"My very first job I learned alot, mainly how to be a people's person. Meet some good friends there, just was not enough money, unless you moved up to managment."
good,a full work day from start to finish. as long as u keep up with your work it will all be done but if u slow down then u will fall back and wont catch up
good,"Empresa que desvaloriza os funcionários,por falta de educação entre as pessoas que trabalham entre si."
good,I liked working for this company i think all the co-workers are nice.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, buen trabajo aunque pesado y un poco estresante, pesima duracion de empleo, aprendi un nuevo sistema para captura, tuve buenos compañeros y buen supervisor, me gustaba relacionarme con gente nueva, aveces te ayudan recursos humanos, aveces no."
good,Customers were always nice and friendly.
good,Was allways cold. I worked in the forzen dept. Igot along well with my co-workers.
good,I learned alot about big box retail in my positions with WalMart. Their pay is on par for the position in the retail world. Walmart provides a very good opportunity to advance in their company because of their size. The down side is how they treat their employees and customers. They have made long strides in the worklife balance side their day Assistant Managers work 3 days on 3 days off and O/N Assistants work 4 on 4 off.
good,Got along with everyone in the store. Like the management I learned to operated hand held scanner for inventory
good,A typical work day at Wal-Mart was like no other. The job it self was very laid back. I enjoyed assisting the customers. However they were very short on staff so it made it alot harder to assist customers in a timely manner. The most enjoyable was helping a customer find exactly what they needed.
good,Pues es una empresa seria
good,Start up in the morning with meeting then run system until goals are met for the day.
good,good place to work just be prepared to work. Hardest part of job was cleaning up.
good,"Typical day ,come in at seven and walk the store ,make sure the store is zoned and cleaned walk to the back room make sure the bale is done and the back room is clean,no shopping carts in the back and cheack outside to make sure pallets are in a stack and ready for pick up."
good,"los dias tipicos eran llegar hacer papeleo de la mercacia que llegaba despues acomodarla darle mantenimiento a los muebles del departamento renovando todo, imprimir letreros de promociones y verificar precios de competencia."
good,"They make sure you know your job, the management there look out for their employees. They will provide guidence where needed. You can develope friendships with employees and managers. They always follow proceedures at all times"
good,Enjoyed working and growing with Walmart. I supervise a group of about 30 males and females of different ages.
good,Aprendi bastasnte.
good,It was a good and fun place to be during the day however during the night it was a freaken night mear. Wal mart has no Security and if they do they do a thing to prevent theft in or outside the store.
good,rang register and waited on a diverse group of customers. Had an enormous amount of money pass thru the registers.
good,Wal-mart was an overall good experience. A typical day at work was cashiering in pushing carts. Also I had to deal with all types of customers.

good,"Bom a empreza me deu muitas oportunidades, me ensinou a utilizar sistemas, me troxe conhecimentos que não conhecia, tenho muitas amizades com todos os tipos de colaboradores, desde os assossiados de dentro da empreza até os fornecedores. Aprendi a conviver com pessoas de todos os tipos e raças, de todas as partes do brazil, e do mundo pois são muitos os estrangeiros que nos visitam todos os dias, para fazerem suas compras. Também aprendi a trabalhar em equipe, ser dinâmico, prestativo, me ensinou questões de seguranças,de responsabilidades, tive a oportunidade de ser promovido a gerência de departamento 2 veses, mais por questões de horários não pude ser promovido. hoje curso Técnico em Mecânica Industrial, e consigo consiliar estudos e trabalho normalmente sem nehum problema, pelo contrario minha grrente me deu total apoio para que investisse nos meus estudos, é isso não tenho nada a reclamar, so agardeço."
good,Customer Service was a great experience. Usually busy and that was a good thing but down time was always appreciated. Black Friday is CRAZYYY!! Great place to start if looking for a first time job. Best oart was making friends with people who I still keep in contact with.
good,Work was fun for the most part I learned a lot there. management needs help getting there stuff together

good,"Management made sure everyone was doing their job. it was well organized every event or special sales where thought out, talked about everyone participated and used team work. The most difficult part of the job was the customers. Everyone is different and you have to please each customer and atleast ensure that you made the effort to help them. the most enjoyable part of the job was the team work. everyone helped each other to reach a goal."
good,The hours were great in the beginning but they dropped to only 15 hours on most weeks
good,a lot of advancement in this company gives grants for school
good,very demanding employer.
good,Dealing with customers and management that have demands and being able to handle multiple tasks and change very well.
good,Routines are critical element
good,Being employed with walmart showed me that if you work hard you will get recgnition.
good,"if it were any other wal mart i would have stayed forever.the customers were great, the expierence was great, and so were my co workers but managment was not that great."
good,"2nd shift truck crew are literally the hardest working in the store. but we are also the most unappreciated. whatever another shift doesn't do, it fails back on us. we do not get paid for the amount of work that is given to us. so it makes a normal work day very uneasy"
good,A typical day at wook was good in the deli when everyone showed up for work. What I learned everyone is not as dependable as I would like.
good,they have good benefits but they expect way to much for too little pay
good,"Dinâmico,"
good,"No, Dealing with the management of company. Pay was to low for the job duties."
good,"A typical day is check the freight that arrived,do price changes.Morning meetings,check outs on side counters.Pick items,stock all shelves,Then order products that we are out of.Co workers are all friendly.There alot of work to this job.The enjoyable part is you are always busy."
good,"Fast advancement, co-workers and management delightful to work with"
good,"Em minha ultima expriência aprendi muito sobre pessoas,como lhe dar com elas e suas insatisfações.Também que pequenos gestos e atitudes mantem a equipe engajada."
good,"Making customers happy displaying good customer services skills. Meeting new people. I learned how to run a bakery with high quality standards. Management okay, the hardest part was ever being shorthanded, but still pulled through and got job done. I love to Bake."
good,alot of management problems with conversation
good,"wal mart is a good company, the work is not hard and the benefits are good, however working 80 hours per week was not fun, I had no family time."
good,Way overworked
good,"Taking care of my associates was main goal. I learned profit and loss, shrink control, how to manage over 100 people at any given time, and how to manage every department in the store."
good,cashier
good,"90+ customers daily, customers go first even on their bad days, so you dont know what to expect but to prepared for the best, I learned to deal with all types of people face to face on how to take care of them with their needs, I also learned how to handle stress very well, there's lots of managers, but only certain ones do what they are suppose to and well others have their favorites, the hardest part of the job is none, is how you can handle it, the co-workers is what makes it Enjoyable"
good,"Great customer service skills, fun place to work, enjoyed working here"
good,Constantly moving and working. Worked with a good team. Management was good.
good,"My job was very easy I mostly rung up customers and done a little cleaning. My team was very easy to get along with, I never had any problems out of any of my co-workers. I loved my job as a cashier for third shift. My nights always went by smooth when it came to doing my job. The hardest part of my job was not having anything to, when you're the only cashier upfront it gets a little boring. So sometimes trying to maintain busy when you feel you've done everything can be a little difficult. Overall working at Walmart was a great experience and at the end of the day teamwork came into place."
good,it was ok. long days standing. you have to get use to it. co- workers are fun. easy to learn the way things are ran here.
good,Grato ambiente de trabajo con posibilidad de crecimiento.
good,"I arrive just before 10:00 pm. We have a shift meeting lasting approximately 20 minutes. This meeting is usually led by a Co-manager and/or Assistant Manager. We then go to our assigned areas, where we down stack pallets of merchandise, open the boxes, stock the shelves and ""zone"" the area for a uniform appearance. IIt is a great lesson in time management. The management as a whole are very supportative and encouraging. The hardest part of my job would be very little recognition for the individual on a job well done. They thank us as a whole but fail to distinquish between the hard workers and the idle workers. They most enjoyable part of the job is keeping busy. They time goes by quickly because your body and mind are constantly being challenged."
good,"love to work with people,"
good,"aprendi muita coisa fui promovida em apenas tres meses, me dava muito bem com colegas e gerencia, só nao tinha dia certo para folgar por ser logistica trabalhavamos os sete dias da semana sem poder escolher dia da folga."
good,"I liked the people that i worked with, but the job was not my ideal job. There wasnt anything fun about working there. The only think i ever looked forward to was working alongside my co-workers."
good,"Wal-Mart is a probably the best Retailer you can work at, if you’re looking for a long term career in retail. By far the best pay structure in its class, and job security is excellent if you do your job and not put yourself in a position where your ethic's, and integrity is called into question."
good,"Typical day at work would include managing associates and keeping current on the inventory in the store. I learned how to manage associates, integrate new programs into the store. Managment was helpful and approachable. Co-workers were mostle good but had in-store rivalries or cliques. Job was enjoyable because it was steady work day-to-day."
good,"funçao que fui selecionada ,nao batia muito com meu perfil em ser muito séria,sou muito comunicativa"
good,"It is a fun place to work, There are many caring people there that I have made many new friends with. This would include both fellow workers and many customers. One of the best parts of the job is being able to help people and make there day a little brighter.."
good,"I worked overnights 10pm to 7am, we would have a meeting right at 10. Okay after the meeting I would get all the things I need to do my area first. I would downstock my area and help everybody else, after that I go to work on my aisle. Make sure my area was cleaned at all times."
good,"from beginning to end, they have you running around and at times doing work that does not entail your job description."
good,"Walmart was very relaxing most of the time because of the overnight customers. they were few and far between, but always interesting. putting up the freight was easy but time consuming work. maintaing the back room and unloading the truck was the responsibility i took most personal. having a clean and organized work space throughout the store was integral to our success every night. team building skills were a must and sharing the load was also a must. from time to time we all had to help each division out some times. especially on holidays. it was awe striking to see so much product being shipped in and all of the associates at work pulling together to get it all worked out before customers began filling the isles"
good,"A typical day at work was coming in getting my notes for the day of what to get done. Also managing 40 plus employees such as the cashiers,stockmen,maintenance, employees in the special areas as the service desk and money center. I had to bring them change take care of customers answer any of the cashiers questions. I learned how to be a manager and how to take care of customers. I also learned about merchandising and stocking the shelves. I learned how to work and fix registers how to catch fraudulent activities. I enjoyed my co-workers and management team. You can't succeed I believe without the help of your co-workers and managers. The hardest part would have to been our busiest times when everything seemed a little chaotic and I would have to keep it all together and make sure everything ran smoothly to make sure the customers were taken care of. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting our customers everyday and being able to help them with their shopping needs. Also just my working environment I was in just taught me about being a team player."
good,Each day at work is a typical day. The co workers are fair. The management isn't very good though. Through working at Walmart I learnt how to be a leader and take charge when its needed. My favorite part of the job is being able to interact with many different people. I'd say my least favorite part is the management and cleanliness.
good,It was exactly how you think it will be. Alright I suppose. I'm not sure what else to write. I didn't learn much here
good,"It was a good environment, and a fun place to work. Management was good."
good,"Never worried about losing my job here. Although Associate issues were hardly ever fixed and there were many times we were expected to go above and beyond without any appreciation. Need a job, perfect place...a career, I would look elsewhere."
good,"Typical days consists of assisting customers, ringing up sales, stocking shelves, cleaning, maintaining work area. I enjoy working with the public and feel a sense of accomplishment when I can help a customer find what they need. Helping my customers is also the most enjoyable part of my job. The hardest part of my job is having to be on my feet all day and occasionally having to climb up and down ladders."
good,Every Walmart I have been to says Walmart on the outside but is totally different on the inside! When Sam was alive the associates meant something now Walmart is all about the mighty dollar! I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with! I learned that everyone is replacable and it doesn't take management long to get rid of you if they decide you take to much from their payroll budget!
good,"WalMart is a unique company. Depending on the level you enter the company along with the the amount of relationships you enter the company with will influence your ability to advance within the ranks of the company. The work duties are not the most challenging, more tedious than challenging. The hardest part of the job is the staying in line with the policies as not to get ""coached"" which will impede your career advancement. The best part of the job is assisting customers who genuinely are in need of assistance with shopping advice."
good,Llegas temprano checas la entrada a 6:00am entregar cambios de precios y despues de haber terminanado empezar a contar de acuerdo a la area que fue asignada despues de haber terminado el conteo de piso seguir con la bodega y para terminar checar las diferrencias .
good,"From the moment you start work, your doing something. Which is pretty good when you first start out. Then it just becomes repetitive.The hardest part of the job is when managers and other associates dont want to hear what you have to say. I enjoy my job as a service writer. I like helping customers and helping in the shop, I like writing work orders and filing paper work and dealing with and potential conflicts"
good,"Work was pretty much normal got up and went to work that's it but i can say i did learn a few thing such as how to clean bathrooms and as well as learn a few things the other associates did, my mangers were pretty decent well most at least some just didn't really care and the hardest part of my job was probably cleaning up peoples messes such as vomits but i did enjoy the job only because of the people i met"
good,Working for Walmart was alot of fun. Team work was key and most of the the team members made it feel more like family and not a job.
good,"Great place to gain management experience out of college. Long hours, frequently working nights and weekends as well as holidays. Mediocre benefits, decent salary."
good,i would start at 10 pm to 7 am ill take out my freight and start stocking the shelve in the pets department learned where evrything goes and how to build a pallet with the merchantdise manager was ok co workers they were good the hardest part was staying awake through out the night i was able to keep moving around which made me comfortable
good,"At all my jobs i can honestly say i enjoyed maintaining the work environment, working as a team with co-workings helps us all keep up with company demands."
good,"It was fun, as long as you were working and doing what you needed to do. Some of the Managers was ok and some were not."
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart consited of helping the customers with all of there needs as well as stocking the shelves,unloading the delivery,ringing up customers purchases,etc. I really liked all the nice people I met and bbeing part of a team as well as being able to help out wherever needed."
good,"Decent position that allowed me to get through college. Customer service is number one, as it should be. A company that 100% stands behind their products and name."
good,Wal-Mart is an good place to work. People can climb up the career latter quick if they stay focused and are great at what they do. I enjoy working at Wal-Mart with all my co-workers and managers. Everyone is really respectable is there is rarely any problems among co-workers. Although it can be very hectic because we're short on staff but that doesn't bother me because I work good under pressure.
good,My most common shifts were in the morning which was mostly preparing and stocking up merchandise within the store. Working as a team to display areas within the store to company standards. The most difficult part of the job was attempting to create displays that thoroughly attract customers. The most enjoyable part would be the completion of displays that give aid to sales of particular products.
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in and do my routine of running the front end of the store which would include the cashiers, service desk, people greeters, and cart attendants. I learned how to manage mulitiple teams and make their schedules. I learned a lot of patience to deal with a lot of peoples needs. The management was good when I first started then as I stayed longer and manager changes came in some of the managers were not very cooperative and helpful. The hardest part of my job was trying to fight for my teams to management to be able to take care of them and keep consistancy. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I left I realized how many people I touched through the years and their appreciation towards me."
good,"they tell you one thing and they do something else. they tell you that you can advance and when you're ready they tell you they can't find anything, not even at a different store"
good,"Do what your told and you will get by, my only complain that even managers could not separate there personal opinions or ideas from work, and there were a few who would be little you if they did not like your personality what so ever."
good,Cuidados e atenção em preços e validades.
good,"Eight to nine hours of grinding, back breaking work with mostly nice customers and great co-workers. Learn about people from different parts of the country. Managers tough but fair. My co-workers were the best they were honest and hardworking for the most part kind of like a second family."
good,"It was an experience hat i wouldn,t reccomend to every one. I wouldn,t Reccomend working there."
good,"Working at Walmart I learned great time management skills. I was pushed to better myself everyday. Quick Stocking of shelves, great customer service and the ability to prioritize is Key to success in Retail. Management realizes the potential in people that want to advance and builds self confidence in each team member. I loved working along side of some great managers. Hardest part of the job is dealing with those who just ""show up"" for work..."
good,"In working with this comapny for three years I learned many things.Some of those things were good, some not so good, but it made me learn how to get along with others and to strive to work harder"
good,working nights was not to bad merchandise was every were fright came in every night sometimes there was just to much for one person rto handle on there own but it showed bow to manag your task in a certain time frame
good,"On a typical day at work is very busy environment especially working overnight.Management maybe aggressive sometime but then, they were there to develop us and to push us to the best of our ability.Co-workers are very productive delivering all the tasks needed to be done everyday.Hardest part of the job maybe segregating all products to be place in their designated areas.But then again you are working in team job make a lot easier.That is why working with the best team at work is the most enjoyable part of the job.What i have learned is no matter how hard the job is,we have to deliver & do the best of our ability to get things done in anyhow or anyway.Communicating,trust and cooperation is the key to all of this."
good,"Assisting customer with lawn and garden care materials, suggesting wal mart products and checking customers out."
good,I was only there for about 2 months however I found the employees to be clique and a little but rude. The management didnt really bother to learn anyones name but they were still professional. The customers were actually my favorite part they were very nice and the fact that I could cash my check on the premises was a huge plus. Also the .40 cent sodas in the breakroom were great. I would work for walmart again because the salary was ok and my day was never that stressful.
good,This is a fast paced industry and very challenging to puch and set up the inventory while serving the public to the best of your ability.
good,"Typically I start my day by checking in with my associates, checking to see how the day is going so far as well what needs my attention a some point later in the day. After that it is check list to insure equipment is in good repair and that oil and other hazardous materials have been stored correctly. Then I sit down go over the work orders and paperwork from the previous days and check emails."
good,A typical is helping customers helping them find what they need
good,"The company in general is generous to the employees and a person can survive with a career at Wal-Mart, however advancement is limited to the amount of open positions in the area you live in."
good,I had told management that I would not be able to work there anymore and then the next thing I know I find out that they have told the employees that I got fired. I never got fired i had quite my job there.
good,"Everyone tends to their jobs, sometimes you work as individuals and somtimes you are working in teams. You can learn othe tasks within your department and you learn to be part of a team. the hardest part in when you are working for too many supervisors."
good,"Working at walmart was pretty straight forward, same routines on a day to day base! Ive learned plenty from walmart! Customers are your number one priority, keeping your customers happy made the day much easier! The management team and my co-workers were awesome to work with made me happy to come into work everyday, I just love meeting new people!"
good,"My typical day at work,is a overnight shift,which consist of customer needs,assuring the product is on the shelf,and store is zone for opening."
good,"Passei 7 anos no empresa, e em sempre tive oportunidades de crescimento.entrei como controlador de acesso e chegueia encarregado, empresa tem uma cultura muito forte."
good,fun enviroment always strive to get to know my customers by name
good,"Part time no full time available, Some managers favor others and not the ones who do their job. Small raises. Co-workers where fun and could get along with everyone. The hardest pasrt of the job is the busiest because of insufficient CSM's or not enough help for the fron end mngrs. Still enjoyed working their and will definetly go back if the right people (MNG) are there."
good,"Operate heavy equipment such as forklifts. Place products in equipment or on work surfaces for further processing, inspecting, or wrapping. Obtain, move, and sort products, materials, containers, and orders, using hand tools."
good,I work night shifts at Walmart (11pm-7am)
good,"a typical day consist of zoning,breaking down pallets giving direction multi tasking etc. I learned about inventory,ordering,how to get a system going. Management was ok not the best but not the worst.Co-workers I got along with pretty much everyone.The hardest part of the job was always being short handed and managers not sure what they exactly want you to do. Most enjoyable part of the day was the relationships I shared with co-workers and customers and the the completion of task."
good,"gosto do que faço, supero desafios, tenho um bom relacionamento com a gerência e aprendo a cada dia com os colegas de trabalho."
good,Una empresa muy estable y cuenta con buenas políticas pero los Gerente de cada unidad distorsionan la información y las mismas políticas.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart because it was a fun workplace and atmosphere. The people were friendly and treated me with respect. A typical day at work was helping customers and pulling in carts from the parking lot. I learned customer service.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for that is were I started out in retail
good,I loved working with the public. I have a new found respect for food service & retail sales. It's not as easy as it looks.
good,busy place to work and you feel over work due to management never schedules enough people to work the front in.
good,"Empresa orientada al logro de objetivos, marcada rientacion de trabajo en equipo, polinfuncionalidad,"
good,"Excellent place to work, staff is friendly and knowledgeable."
good,too busy for the average person. must maintain at least 500 sph
good,"undercover surveillance of suspected shoplifters. wrote reports, had some really great team members. the hardest part of the job was customer complaints . and i learned lots of stuff about loss prevention."
good,"Working for wal-mart is overall good. I was in produce and i enjoyed the freedom of working around my co-workers. Cashiering, I had to wait for my breaks and lunches. I enjoy ringing up customers. Management over the cashiers are strict and a little up tight but the managers on the floor they assign what you need to do and as long as it's done they are happy. It depends on the wal-mart you work at."
good,- Ringing the customers though the till in a happy and timely matter
good,"There are good days and not so good days, I currently work overnight 10pm to 7am and my night consists of picking merchandise with the use of a telzon and taking that picked merchandise to the floor for the overnight stockers to place on shelves, after the o.n stockers have done their job they bring back to me what is called exceptions for the morning staff to research and bin. I also bin nightly overstock frieght into bins by department so that each department stays together. My management team, some are awesome but then you have some that needs to be more relatable, my coworkers for the most part are awesome hard working people who need to be recognized more often for what they accomplish especially when we are shorthanded, the hardest part of my job is trying to accomplish and complete certain things when everyone is not on the same page, meaning if you have too much merchandise and u have no where for it to go. The most enjoyable part is working with hardworking and fun individuals."
good,"When you are working in the front-end of the store. It is very important of the impact you have with your customers. We work hard to keep our customers happy, but the popularity of this store kept us pretty much busy. Even Cashiers can be that ear that listens to the problems for our regular customers; aka bartenders or hair stylist. The hardest part is standing on your feet for several hours to get the lines down, serving our customers."
good,i love to work i dont like sitting around at walmart i did just that constent work the best part of my job was unloading the trucks myself and doing the ack room inventory my jo was hard work but i enjoyed doing it
good,learned how to be customer service oriented. The managers was strict but the were also nice. The people i worked with was very nice and friendly. I really liked this job u see all types of diffrent people and u get to build good repor with customers.
good,"I Love this job as well , The management wasnt great. I really wish this job would have worked out for me"
good,"The fun part of working here is the people I get to work with, you enjoy work a lot more when you work with great people. Everyday is different, there is always something new to learn."
good,Overall its a fun place to work. Apparel is fun to work in but your also expected to backup cashier. Management isnt the best at scheduling enough workers. Ive learned a lot of what it takes to move up in the company.
good,i really didnt work there that long but from the time i did i enjoyed it & would love too try it again.
good,"Scanning groceries, greeting customers, organizing workstation, keeping your area clean, assisting with customer needs."
good,"It is an okay place to work. But the pay is just lousy. The managers are sorta nuts. My coworkers are the best. the hardest part of the job is having to work for such little pay. but it's like going to the gym, a great work out."
good,"All in all I enjoyed working at Walmart, management was good along with co workers. Nothing to bad ever happened working there. Ups and downs with other co workers because everyone knows everyone and it goes hand in hand in a small town like Bracebridge. I loved learning everything to do with the Deli and everything to do with stocking merchandise. The hardest part of the job was when we would have power outages, best part was all the friendly faces that were thankful"
good,management was flexible and easy to talk to. definitely a fun place to work in. pay could have been better.
good,"Always fun to help out customers, some are great, and some not so great, but always helped with a great attitude"
good,ambiente laboral muy buen compañerismo y menues baratos para los asociados
good,"i was a stocker on the night shift from 10.00 pm to 7.00 am. my job was to stock the shelves, and to do other jobs that required more than one person, the people i worked with were great people, and helped me if i had a problem. the hardest part of the job is that i had 3 bosses, but i enjoyed the job, and was sad i had to stop working due to transportation, but i no longer have that problem!!"
good,"great customers just like any job their are up and downs. price checks, customer service. good and bad managers. i have worked in many areas including food and back room i enjoy being a cashier when i get the chance to interact get to know talk to customers."
good,"Team meeting, Daily task asigned, Safty meeting, Group leadership involvement, Unloading trucks, People"
good,"Bom essa foi a empresa que me ensinou quase tudo que sou profissionalmente falando. É uma empresa em que possui uma cultura muito forte de Busca por Excelência, Repeito pelo Indivíduo, então o ambiente é na maioria das vezes agradável, leve, mesmo com as pressões do dia a dia, por se tratar de uma empresa de grande porte, cada dia tem uma novidade, por mais que no geral as coisas sejam organizadas. Nos últimos meses que passei por lá, fiz parte de um projeto chamado ""Sala Sol"", onde pessoas são treinadas para trabalhar como gerentes de loja, que para o escritório corresponde ao cargo de analista, é uma experiência sensacional pois te desafia a conhecer todas as áreas de um segmento, te tira totalmente da zona de conforto, e te faz trabalhar com o que você nunca imaginou fazer."
good,"It was a fast paced environment, with many challenges. Interacting with management. At the end of each day I went home knowing that I accomplished my goals."
good,I loved working here they dont work to well with your school schedule and work schedule but I did love working for the company
good,"Wal mart was a good company to work for. I worked in the backroom with 4 other people, trying to make everything organized so that the department managers could easily access their products and so that the store would be ready when inventory came around. My co-workers were great and management was around to let us know what needed to be done for the day and pretty much left us alone. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock shelves with the aisles filled with customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was on the days when we just cleaned up the whole backroom and made alot of progress. A very productive day made me feel real good. My absolute favorite day was when we got to unload the trucks at the end of the day though. It was hard work and fast paced!"
good,"The pay was great compared to most retail companies but with the load of work we would be doing, wasn't worth the pay. I loved working with the customers and the other employees, I enjoy helping people when I can and getting to know new people. I have worked every shift with Wal-Mart and it is a very stressful environment, you are expected to do up to 8 tasks at once, it may seem impossible but somehow we as a team at Wal-Mart are able to get it done but it does take it's toll with your body. I do enjoy the challenges at Wal-Mart and I do love to keep myself busy with the work."
good,"they were friendly, I really enjoy to work,and be with customers. work in stock and retails."
good,Okay company to work for in the long run
good,"Worked with customers and operated cash register first hand on a daily basis. Learned how to use the registers, better communication skills, and cigarette and alcohol regulations. Management was easy to work with."
good,"Would cover 5 to 6 departments one self and would not get proper breaks, management was all over the place"
good,"A typical day at work is a busy one. I learned to work in a fast paced environment and how to interact with customers in a personal and professional manner. I found management to be consistently changing but overall appreciative of my work ethic.The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks due to handling merchandise over 60 pounds. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting, interacting with customers, and satisfying their needs exceeding overall expectations."
good,Changing oil & tires. I learned automotive maintenance. Management are concerned about your welfare & safety. Hardest part of this job is dealing with the elements. Easiest part is actually changing oil
good,"I learn how to work with different personalities, each customer or co worker is different in alot ways. I deal with alot of different attiudes throughout the day. I believe the hardest part is the policies one person would say one thing than you will hear the total opposite."
good,Good place work if you are full time. Unfortunately it was only a seasonal job.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping to customers be happy. I do work with a great staff of coworkers and most of the managers are good as well. Entertainment and electronics zones are fast paced and there is no shortage of duties to perform.
good,"Nice place to work, though very physical. Hourly compensation was poor; benefits after qualification (1 year employment) but still many out-of-pocket expenses. The people you work with are all basically ""in the same boat,"" so they try to make it fun and enjoyable. Sometimes, customers were unkind in believing that all Walmart employees are dolts. It's a shame. I found a new respect for the employees who work in shops such as these. I'm sorry it took me working there to discover."
good,"Overall it was an ok store to work for. But alot of problems in management no one could take charge of things and needs to be done. But i did learn how to work with others and treat all employees with respect. I learn how to do inventory controll, ordering of the groecery to keep the shelves stock."
good,mis dias de trabajo ahi fueron buenos pero lo malo que mi jefa no dejaba que yo creciera un poco mas
good,Enjoyed working there and benefits were great but the pay is not. Overall I enjoyed working there but did not see myself making more income there any longer.
good,"Left this job for a better advancement at Kohls. The part of the job I miss is the electronics, I.T., and I.S. I learned a lot at this job about conveyors."
good,"Walmart is an okay job. Great job to have to gain experience and to learn many things such as the fork lift, cash register, customer service, stocking, cleaning etc."
good,worked the max hours until full time was required then bumped down to part time again. They didn't seem to interested in advancement opportunites.
good,"It was a good job. I enjoyed the challenge of the job. I started with 3 employees, When I quit I had 2 part time associates. The management expected me to work with people that disrespected me and wouldn't do their jobs. I had no control over the people however I was responsible for their actions."
good,"The hardest part of the job is unfortunately most of the time I dont have the resources I need to be succesful in my department. My area is very fast moving being frozen food and dairy. A typical day begins with checking for expiry products in dairy, I then have to throw out all the expired and damaged product with a telxon. I then have to scan all my out of stocks and research to find out if we have the product or not if we have start stocking the out of stocks I am also responsible for ensuring direct deliveries are worked on the same day.. I have learned a lot out about health and safety and time management."
good,A great place to work ! I enjoyed my employement. I met great people
good,Typically when I show up at work now that I'm on nights all the other people head home and I clean up the department and put away the stock unloaded from the trucks and leftover from the day crew. I reorganize the lock ups and pick product listed in the telxon gun. I bin any over stock and take out any other stock not listed in the picks to fill holes in the shelves on the sales floor. I rearrange endcaps to feature products in the flyer or just to change things up to keep it new for regular customers shopping in our stores. I do like merchandising product on the shelves and setting up displays and working over night with no one shopping makes it easier to complete these things much easier.
good,"Walmart starts as a good place to work at, overnights you get 40 hours a week and the job is easy besides manual labor. They do little to train you so you learn everything by hands on experience or asking questions. Like every workplace there can be drama and people who try to get under your skin but overall it's pretty decent. Worst part is working overnight but you get extra money for doing so which is what makes it worth it."
good,"Planagrams, planagrams, zone, zone as much as you could,inform people, be friendly, always please and thank you, with a smile on your face, help other co-workers, you could talk top management about anything at any time, co-worker always helping one another, meeting deadlines, getting merchandise out on the floor, gatherings of the walmart team in a big bike parade, xmas parties, bbq's, fund raising."
good,"A typical day at work, stocking shelves with produts,"
good,"I come in restock the milk and eggs. Try and fill any outs that we may have. I've learned on how to use a gemini to check if there is a certain item in the backroom. The management is good, they can help you with any questions."
good,Walmart was good to work for they offered 40 hours. You would definetly work all of the hours assigned. Management would use databases to access sensitive information and use it against its employees even though the employee gave them the same sensitive information when they were hired. If you tell them you had a record when you were hired they would use it against you in the future insted of backing you.This amounts to illegal terminations.
good,"dia tipico es saludar con un hooolaaa, lo que aprendi a ser mas responsable y cuidadoso,grencia trabajan bien pero hay veses que se alteran un poquito, mis colegas nos gusta trabajar en equipo,lo mas dificil capturar el sici (ya que ban a cuentas diferentes y se tienen ajustar en ocasiones, lo que mas me gusta es contar el efectivo,retirar los bauchers, capturar las ventas,dolares,talones,ect."
good,I typical ran the register and assisted customers when needed. I learned how to talk to customers and how to read them and figure out what they needed or wanted without being pushy.
good,"This company is difficult to understand. It use to be all about the customer and the customer experience. Management, my co-workers and myself began experiencing changes that moved away from making the customers happy. We were given additional responsibilities that were almost unreachable. The changes taking place moved away from setting employees up for success, instead set employees up for failure. The most enjoyable part of my day would be when I could help a customer and watch them leave with a smile on their face."
good,"A normal day at work is to make sure we service thousands of customers in a fast and friendly atmosphere and managing our daily operations of the store. I have learned an extensive amount of training in merchandising, customer and employee involvement, day to day operations, marketing, and what helps to increases sales. The co-workers I have worked with, some were easy to work with and others were not. I have learned not to focus on making friends but having business partners to work with was my goal for the job. The hardest part of my job was having to say No to a customer. No, if we are out of a product, No, if we can't take a product back because of its warranty, or an indirect No, to a customer if they are not serviced with a fast and friendly experience. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a smile on someone's face indicating appreciation."
good,"Worked in many positions. Working in management can be stressful and you usually work long hours. Working in the department included stocking, cleaning, serving customers. It's been a while so some things have changed."
good,"Department Manager Garden Center Managed stocking, watering, and garden layout; provided extensive carry-out duties ."
good,"i do everything,don""t feel appreciated"
good,"98% of the days as a cashier were very busy. Interactions with the customers was actually my favorite part of the job, whether they were upset or not. It was a bit of an adjustment going through so many different members of management in such a short period of working for the company. It was also stressful for management to announce new rules that were being enforced, without sharing the announcements at least on a bulletin board or in an area where all employees could view then to be chewed out for following old procedure when we were left unaware. There never seemed to be enough people on the registers during a really busy time of day and there would be lines that lasted over 30 minutes on quick check. For the most part though it was always an adventure, never knowing what was going to be in store the next day at work, and with that element of surprise it was easy to go into work not knowing what to expect. The reason I chose to work for such a large corporation was because I understand the way that Sam Walton ran his business. No matter how large a corporation, the workplace should always be treated like your home and you should welcome your guests warmly, without the guests there is no business, and I've seen too many people take advantage of the lowest prices and price matching as an excuse to treat customers poorly, because 'Oh well, they'll come back'. I sure hope so, and I hope they are treated excellent the next time they come in."
good,"My typical work day will include cashiering, One hour photo development, customer service, and returns and exchanges. The hardest part of my job was the machine keep breaking down and dealing with irate customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and establishing customer clientele."
good,"A typical day in the bakery department requires setting up the equipment for the day's workload and prepare the donuts, bread, and cakes for various tasks. Other tasks for the day include pulling the previous day's dates off of the sales floor and help other areas of the bakery with their assignments. Overall the relationship between all of the co-workers in the bakery is very positive and we all work together well in order to accomplish the goals nessecery to complete the tasks for the day. The enjoyable part of the job is making sure the customers are taken care of and are satisfied with their orders. Sometimes the most difficult part of the job is making sure that everything is done in a timely manner. However when the area is shorthanded that can be a difficult task. Management overall are willing to listen to our concerns as employees and find a solution. Because of a continuous workload that keeps them unavailable to employees, howver, it can be a challenge to communicate properly with them. I have learned the importance of customer service, a willingness to work together with your fellow co-workers as a team, and my continuous improvement on communication with customers and co-workers."
good,"work day consist of restocking shelves, placing orders for the next business day, mark down prices for specials."
good,A go go go work place at all times. Very rewarding. It's a people place.
good,"obviously the largest retailer in the world. Lots of opportunity for advancement if you are willing to work hard for it. once you get to where you want, you are almost dead to rights though. i made assistant manager after 2.5 years, and then my career came to almost a dead stop, because i was pushed to an understaffed third shift. was expected to turn the store over perfectly every night, upper management did not even try to hear my calls for help, and it just burnt me out. overall, not a bad place to work."
good,"Walmart is a great place if you are not involved in multiple activities. A typical day at Walmart is super busy, I was always cooking and serving customers. There was not always enough workers to cover the load so I would have to take late lunches, or skip breaks. I learned that in order to keep your sanity you must find a balance between work and a social life, or you will eventually completely lose one or the other. The management could have been better, there were too many things that were over looked that caused issues. My co-workers were usually upbeat, although there were a few that refused to be fair with our work load. The hardest part of the job was that there were task I was asked to do that no one wanted to teach me how to do. There were many times I would have to work past my scheduled hours, because I would have to teach myself how things were to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was serving customers, and knowing that with my up-beat positive attitude I made them smile."
good,A typical day at work was a lot of hard work at a fast pace. Kept me on my toes and never a dull moment. Hardest part of the day was the break floor was about a three minute walk to and from on you fifteen minute break. Other employees were amazing and very charasimatic.
good,"The company itself is good and stable, just depends on the store. In my almost 3 years of employment ideveloped excellent customer service skills and made some great friends. Management at my store is ok they get a little crazy at times with the decisions they make, but id have to be in that situation to understand. hardest part of the job is taking pride in what you do get done when they move you to a differant department and dont let you have the appropriated time to finish your current objective. The most enjoyable part of the job is hlping the custermer find the murchendise they need and seeing how happy they are when they recieve the item or items."
good,I liked having set hours and they worked with my school schedule.
good,unloaded trucks and stocked shelves
good,"wal-marts customers are amazing, i really enjoy working with them and helping them with anything that they may need"
good,"A typical day at work was interesting. You never know what you're going to get into. I've really gained a lot working there. I learned to hon my customer service skills and learn a better work ethic. On a sad note, the management at Walmart is very poor. In my opinion they run the store to how they see fit until cooperate is called in. Then they run things to regulation. And if they don't like you. They'll find ways to fire you. Hardest part of the job is when you have 3 different mangers telling you to do three different things at once. The most enjoyable part of the day is the satisfaction of the customer."
good,Go to work greet everyone work hard help customers and go home.
good,Has self service for managing personal information readily available to employees on updated computer systems.
good,"A typical day at work required me to clean trash out in the parking lot and finish bringing the carts in from last nights work, then the supervisor would have me do other things inside if it was slow out outside like going to the back of the store and getting the grocery bags that just came off of a truck to the front of the store, then after that was done I would go back outside and get some more carts that other customers brought out take them to the bay. Sometimes I would have carry-outs that were called in on a radio that they give us during the day. The hardest part of the job was the weather was unpredictable so like if it was storming out that would slow us down a little and slow would to if it got to high up. Then the most enjoyable part of the job was that I got to work outside and also interact with other people cause I love to help people that's just who I am."
good,I liked working for Wal-mart cause it gave me a chance to work with friendly co-workers and mangement staff. I was always looked at as an equal and my suggestions and comments were always heard and taken into consideration.
good,"It was a fast paced environment, though i did not learn new skills on a day to day basis it was good work"
good,the work environment was fun but it just seemed to be not so structured in the way the management ran thing it could just have been at the particular store i worked at but other then that the job was very satisfactory.
good,I was an unloader and tried to change to day shift. I was not allowed to. I liked working for Wal-Mart and would have loved to continue.
good,"Decent work environment with pleasant co workers, and customers. A great first job, with ways to move higher up in management."
good,"Picking up phone calls, i work with some good team members that help with putting back merchandise returns . Dealing with some mangnement who doesnt want to help make customer experience pleasant"
good,"My days of work are usually calm and quiet, until my supervisor comes and makes everyone's day bad, including fellow managers. What I've learned while at Walmart is Inventory Prep, which allows me to keep count of how much merchandise we have in the backrooms. Management is great, until my supervisor comes in and makes every associate and member of manager time there miserable. My co-workers are the best! We work as a team always, and the most enjoyable part of my job is the customers, because they're my motivation."
good,"My typical day at work is filling prescriptions, answering the phones, and communicating with doctors and patients regarding their medication at a face pace environment. Love the people, the variety of problem solving task and learning side by side with the patient, pharmacist, and associates."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work. The skills that I am learning I am able to move forward and learning more each day. I enjoy working with the people, they are great people. The hardest part of the job is when things are being demanded to get done and not enough staff to get the jobs done that needs to get done before the end of the day. But we always seem to get it done."
good,Typical day i would clock go into the office check my emails from other Walmart stores to see what kind of theft they might have had.. Such as some guys may have boosted two tvs overnight. from there i would go to the cash office to get a list of all the register that were short go back to the office and maybe start investigating survelliance from the day before then i would go onto the salefloor to look for a potential shoplifter some days i conducted waehyouse audits.. that a easy day if i didnt catch a shoplifter
good,"A lot of work, can be satisfactory if in the right department, I liked Transportation better because we seemed to be treated a little bit better that n the DC or the store."
good,associates made the job hard to enjoy...customers kept a smile on my face
good,"Wal-Mart is a pretty good place to work. The employees are friendly, the management team is very knowledgable, the benefits are great, and the work is not hard. The only thing that could be better is the compensation."
good,"Days were short and fast paced, everyone had to lean how to do everything from cooking to cleaning. each maniger is different and all want what is best for the store."
good,hardest part about work is the hours. I am more of a same time a day person and the scheduleing is different every week for me.. the pay needs to be alittle bit better to but at least it is a paycheck.
good,"wal-mart needs to strive to the customer more than the ""big business"" image that they are trying to achieve."
good,Your best is never good enough. Coworkers are always willing to help you.
good,Overall Walmart is a dependable place to work but some mangers need to read up on the policies they are supposed to be following. Seems like alot of harrassment issues and just basically need to treat the associates with more respect so that they don't have the good ones quit and make the bad ones act worse on everyone else. For the money I get there it's not worth being harrassed and treated badly when I get more than I'm supposed to done. I'm not complaining but they just need to work more as a team than as enemies.
good,Hardest part of job is the work schedule. Culture is wonderful and able to call upon any instore peer or another store for help if there are answers I can't find. Days are very hands on and I basically keep a routine and execute training and other company programs.
good,I love the 3 day 12 hour shifts. It was a good job with good people
good,"A typical day at work was the same thing all the time. Nothing really changed at all. Talk to the customers no matter what it was. After 8 hours of talking it gets old. If you don't have any customers you have to tend to your lain. straighten up the shelves, clean you belt, make sure your lain is nice and neat for the next customer. Management was ok. Co-workers weren't that bad. I became friends with most of them. There really wasn't an enjoyable part to this job. I prefur to be left alone so I can do my job. I'm not a talking kind of person. would rather be off by myself stocking shelves. I tried to get them to move me to the floor but they wouldn't do it."
good,It had its ups and down. So many task to be completed within the job code. Definitely takes a special team of dedicated people to handle the different objectives.
good,I work usually 7am to 4pm with two fifteen minute breaks and a hour lunch. I learned the inventory system and checking in site store orders on a daily bases. We also deal with on hand for the store. In my job we have to work as a team to get the job done. The hardest part is fixing mistakes and maintaining accurate counts.
good,I stocked the shelves so when the store opened it was ready for business
good,walmart has many benefits but i dont enjoy working there. management isn't great and there's no team work.
good,I cleaned and cooked food. I cut meats and cheese for customers.
good,"a good place to work, i learned alot about tires, managment was ok, co-workers were very nice, stocking shelves was the hardest part, seeing new people"
good,"My day to day job was to manage all front end and stocker. if anyone asked me if i think was wamart a good place to work i would say, yes if u dnt mind have alot o bosses."
good,Management there was ok to work for. The company as a whole is not a bad company.
good,I learned how to organize better. The chalanging part of the job for my was being time constrictive.
good,Wal-mart offers a good retail learning experience. There are chances for advancement to other departments and management. It is often hard to excel in customer service and accomplish tasks because of under-staffing in some departments Associates are generally friendly
good,"A typical day would start with myself scheduling employees duties and responsibilities for the day. I managed a team of 10. I then would monitor the freshness and quality of bakery product that is available to customers for purchase. I had amazing co workers however there will be times where disciplinary action would have to take place. The hardest part of the job was the lack of experienced employees in my department. The bakery was a new addition to Walmart and the company hires from within which is awesome, however the training sessions weren't long enough for some employees. What I enjoyed the most was pleasing customers! I love to see the smiles on their faces when their cake is ready for their special events."
good,"I truly enjoy this job. It's exciting, fast-paced and deadline-driven with moments of slow downs, which makes it a great balance. It requires a very high level technical skill set, which is challenging and keeps the day exciting. I've learned many new skill sets in the real estate world, including map programs, i.e., Anysite and Route. My co-workers have been phenomenal! Many have taken me under their wings to train me to succeed in my position. What a wonderful group of people who truly deserve recognition. I truly enjoy all aspects of this job."
good,working in the deli
good,"Work was good, constantly around people. A typical day of work always had its fun moments."
good,"I usually volunteer to work additional day when needed, I learned a lot but still need learn other works in the store like cashier, the management and co workers are ok, when there's a season holiday or event preparation there's lots of work to be done. I enjoy working during holiday where I meet other people and appreciate my work."
good,"I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with. Heavy freight was the hardest part of the job. A few people in management were approachable, but most were not. I sick, you needed to be out at least 3 days and task a leave or a point was put against you whether you had a doctors's note or not for yopu or your child(s). After six absences you were terminated. No pointsw came off until six months after the date of the absence."
good,I been with walmart fro a year and a half and I feel like Im not moving up and advancing as fast as I need too.
good,"This place is very busy at all times, some of the customers could be so rude, and the employee ratio during certain hours isn't the greatest"
good,its a job with advancement. three day work weeks. woth incentives people are more for themselves instead of a team. the hardest part of the day is when you have multiple call-outs to extend the work day. the most enjoyable part is knowning you did your best for your family when you hit the punch-out clock
good,"Good job, cross trained in every department. Very willing to work with scheduling conflicts. Great co-workers hardest part of job is not having enough help. most enjoyable part of this job is working with the people you love."
good,"Worked over nights.Had fun getting to know new people,chatting with customers."
good,"The Management would take advantage of it's associates and not lowering the sense of self worth, the planning that goes into planning also was absent as on some of the busiest times we would under staffed and overworked"
good,Walmart is to satisfy customers and they work around your schedule.
good,Nice environment because of your fellow employees. Management can be a pain but that's almost anywhere
good,"Very large company, constantly looking for ways to improve."
good,I worked there for a while loved it at first. then everything changed not for the good.
good,One thing that I really enjoyed about this job was the fact that they allowed me to do multiple things instead of just working a register all day. After a while it did feel like we were a family.
good,"Wal-mart was a good company to work for, 3rd shift was the only option for me at the time having a young child. I liked the independance and accountability of the job"
good,Moderate amount of work for moderate compensation. Benefits were lack luster. Management was friendly and accommodating.
good,"Customer Service, Sales, and Inventory of sporting and fishing and lawn and garden product. issuance of fishing license."
good,"Overall this Wal Mart is an enjoyable place to work. The sales staff is fun, friendly and productive daily. The down side to this company is the managements inability to communicate well with the sales staff. Also the lack of promoting associates with the skills to benefit the company in the long term."
good,the only job that was available when I came back to RI to help my daughter
good,It was fine for an entry position. There are worse places to work.
good,"I have worked for Wal-mart for 8 yrs, have advance from associate to dept. manager to zms, a place to advance"
good,One thing I did like was at this Wal-Mart location they really worked around my school schedule.
good,"Good people to work with , easy job nice people. cashier experience was good"
good,Having had positions from cart pusher & maintenance all way to a salaried assistant manager I can say that their are some job codes that Walmart favors over others. Department managers are tasked with to many projects in a weeks time and pressured so much to get them done that they do not take the proper time to complete them which in turn could get them into trouble. Management is so far removed from the hourly associates they have lost perspective on what it really takes to be an effective department manager. Store managers flip out and even make threats to gilt you into pushing for sales increases to the point of nearly ignoring company policies and doing things to make them look good on paper. The family atmosphere left the company when Sam & Helen past away.
good,"Very stressful. Wants a lot done with no payroll. Always cutting payroll. Upper management doesn't care about store level associates and managers. Attitude is ""Just get it done--find a way"". Not partners with the store management team. Work/Balance is good and bad. 3 days off 3 days on. Hard to get back into swing after 3 days off especially if no notes are left for you. Management always feels as if their heads are on the chopping blocks."
good,I think this job was one of my best but still not great. The management are very anarchy oriented. They try to make you feel small cause you work for them. And they also try to make Walmart your whole life and do care if you are sick or overworked.
good,For a single person looking for a caree Walmart is the place to work. But for a person that has a family its not because walmart will come before them..
good,working at walmart has its pros and cons. the management is terrible and some of the problems that occur they dont know how to handle because they are stuck in the offices instead of on the floor watching makingsure the stores are ran properly. i personally had troublle there becasue of managemnet and we disagreed alot like the fact that i am a overnight stocker but it was pouring raining outside and no shopping carts so they forced the young stockers like myself outside in the rain to get them and thats not my job and i got sick becasue of that an had a sinus and ear infection because i asked to go home to change and the manager told me i could go home until my lunch break on my time.
good,They give alot of work to do; sometimes its not enough workers in the department area. This can be overwhelming if you have 4 departments to do in one night. Overall its better to work first and second shift unless you accept heavy work loads.
good,"My perspective of Wal-Mart, as a company, is good one. The experience and friends that I met while being employed there I will never forget. I am glad that I chose this company to work for as my first job. I never felt underappreciated and always could rely on my co-workers and management if I had questions. I would recommend Wal-Mart to many first time job finders as well as to people who just enjoy communicating with others."
good,It was an overall good place to work. They never gave you a set schedule and that really hurt. The opportunity for advancement was there but it would take time. They asked to have their employees help in other departments which helped increase their knowledge in the store.
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work, but the management is very unorganized."
good,"Management doesn't seem to care about family values. Must be full time to receive benefits such as vacation, health insurance etc."
good,"I had a great time at wal mart. You meet so many people, from different walks of life. Plus the supervisors play a game called zap. The game is all about customer service. If they see you takin care of a guest with great service, you get zapped. The supervisor gives you a $20 gift certificate."
good,Working with the public made this job enjoyable. I met lots of interesting people. The rate of pay was fair and annual raises were given as promised
good,"I started out as a cashier which i mastered that got the fastiest cashier award, I then went into customer service deck. I that was more of a challenge you deal with cusotmers with other transaction like money order,chech cashing stuff like that. I then became customer service manager, it was great."
good,"I enjoy working with my coworkers in the area I work at, but managers put too much work on me and expect too much from me."
good,I enjoyedworking for the company overall. They had great things i apperciated about walmart i loved my co-workers and customer. The managment team was cool as well except for when it came to listening to complaints and resolving scheculding.
good,I have been working for walmart since 2006. when I started walmart i was a student at a junior college but walmart has helped me pay for collage and allowed me to prioritize my education over my work. it's a great company to work for and I strongly recomend it for students.
good,Usually higher than minimum wage but what you make in a position is very static and may not rise quickly unless you change jobs within Walmart. Take too long to build a suitable income to live comfortably.
good,"En el lider express en cuanto al ambiente laboral fue muy grato, los compañeros siempre dispuestos a colaborar. En cuanto a las capacitaciones, que más bien fue una segunda inducción fue tardía explicando la cultura organizacional, los productos importados, sustitutos y además los económicos. "
good,Back when I started there it was a great work place but the new changes being implemented makes me more than uneasy in my job stability for the future.
good,"The company in my specific location was good until local change in management. Overall,  "
good,Walmart is a very well nice organized job for someone like myself. I like such thing as hands on assignments an Walmart provides that for you with there work.
good,Overall management was great and work was satisfying always had a task to complete. The only issue was transportation in the area. Which made it difficult to maintain a job in the area.
good,"Walmart is a good job for those who like working in fast paced environments. You will be paid well in every position that is offered, and will have a opportunity to grow within the company. Management can be unorganized and very authoritative at times. However, if you come to work on time, do your job and keep a positive mindset, you'll find that Walmart is a great company to work for."
good,Most customers were nice and respected employees work. Employees worked best to their best. A lot  of options to move up in the company. The building was in a good spot.
good,I dealt with a lot of different people at walmart. The thing with walmart is that considering it is such a big company you are treated more as just a number than a person
good,My experience at Walmart so far is not bad or good. Personally for me I feel as though for all the work I do and for what I get paid the job is not ideal for me. Personally me as a Walmart associate I do not feel like I get compensated for the work I do.
good,"Good job, but you’re treated as a number instead of a person.  Do not go in expecting to have a family atmosphere because you are entirely replaceable in the bigger Walmart cog."
good,"Do not work here if you don't have the patience to work with customers, it can be very demanding and the hours aren't always the best, but they do work the best they can with your schedule. Hard work does pay off with this company."
good,Walmart  us an ok place to work . U can learn a lot from that  place. And u can grow a lot in that place. Walmart  management  can be changed  a little
good,"Changing work environment, Steady Schedules, If you are full-time the benefits are pretty good. They work with you for time off and schedule availability."
good,"you can be productive at this job, I would recommend to not stay there for long like I did, one of  worst decisions, leaving this place is the best thing I've done in a longtime."
good,"Good job with many people that are there to help no matter the occasion. Many opportunities to make money, many places that I felt safe with the people around me."
good,Walmart was a great experience it taught me how to handle myself in a lot of situations and how to understand people and assist them better so they leave satisfied
good,"Very easy a flexible schedules. The managers are nice people. They work with you well. The pay is good and they will give you hours if you ask, and it’s a really good job"
good,"My manager was very inconsistent with the schedule, and changing. Employees shifts. A lot of employees would always call out, and we would get stuck with extra work tasks."
good,"I learned a lot working there, management was ok but overall they needed help. It was very enjoyable because I made a lot of friends and the hardest part would have been dealing with angry customers."
good,Some days are good and some are bad. Depends on Management that's there at the time. Some days they let you do your job and sometimes they create things to complain about.
good,Its okay its just poor management and very unorganized and its alright just need some workand adjustments but its okay nothing else i can say okay okay okay okay okay
good,I loved my job 4 years ago. We all treated each other like family and I can trust my coworkers. We all worked hard and all got a long great.I just now see it starting to fall apart. My boss seemed to have tossed in the towel and gave up. And if she dont care the rest of my team just dont seem to care as much. And I want something better for myself.
good,Empresa respeita o proximo e suas diferenças. Tem como cultura excelencia no atendimeto ao cliente.
good,"After clocking in your supervisor provides you with a pallet to break down and an isle to stock. Unfortunately, many supervisors may tie you down to a single area, not allowing you to learn the stores layout and placement of items to aid a customer. Overall the experience there wasn't too bad even with the less than flexible hours"
good,Hardest part of this job was being taken of task to help others then getting told to rush on you own work to finish.50/50 some Mgrs were helpful and others were just didn't care
good,"Customer service required, flexible hours, benefits, the whole shebang. Opportunities to move up and learn management skills. Employee discount. Working holidays is required."
good,Never had a bad day always was good vibes great managment customers always nice benefits was nice the manager looked out for the employee and their opinions was heard
good,You have to make sure you let your supervisors know everything that is going on with you so they can assist you. I like it alot is is as easy as you make it
good,I learned how to take initiative when I felt I was not trained enough to do all the duties my job required. Did not feel I was prepared enough with how to deal with difficult customers from the training I received from the job.
good,Could be unfair with work load pressure but managers ajusted to each persons needs.  Overnight night crew was like afamily.  we did the most work but got blamed for everything which was kind of funny.
good,"Overall good place to work. Low stress, and not a lot of inhouse drama. Adancement is limited. Work Hours are uslaly flexiable. Best Departments to work in Sporing goods and Electronics."
good,I really enjoy being on the Mod Team and the hours I work. The hardest part would be there are not enough employees to cover all that is required to be done in a single shift.
good,I was harassed by other coworkers when I wasn’t supposed to be and the employees there are rude. They did work with me when I had to take time off and that made things a lot easier. My biggest problem was that the people there made me feel very stupid for asking any questions and they didn’t really try to form connections.
good,The people are nice and the job is fast pace. It keeps u moving and busy. I dont think it caters to it's employees like they should. There turnover rate is bad because they do not properly train associate's to better do there job
good,Hard to move up in the company. A lot of company rules far as benefits and holidays are the worst. Its a very easy and fun job. Its what you make out of your shift to help you get through each shift. At  my location some managers are fair as to others very rude.
good,"As a salary manager expect to work more than 12 hours a day and constantly working on days off. Vacation and pay are decent. However for hourly associates work is more enjoyable, its fantastic pay, and very easy to move up the ladder."
good,"Interesting Place to work. Recommended for any young adult starting out in the market place, while attending College. They are good with hours for students. Very rarely higher full time employees. Lots of activities"
good,It was a pleasure to work there at first but then my workload began getting overwhelming because some managers would take the apparel associates even though we had our own workload to handle.
good,"While at times Walmart can be a laid back environment to work in, management is very strict about making sure tasks are completed. Issues arise when expectations versus reality between management and associates do not align and problem resolution comes into play."
good,"It's certainly not worst to place to work at, but it is entry level for a reason. Expect a lot of riff-raff since as you would guess, they would hire anybody."
good,Apply for the 401k it will br of grest benefit to you later in life. Just get the job done and it will work out just fine. Life is all about making a change and its a good place to start
good,Over all Walmart was a good job and paid me well and i loved the store manager and a couple other members of management but others let their title over dictate their authority.
good,Its a good solid job attendance is counted vacation time is after 7 years.. You can move around after 6months i have been there 6 years and at first relationships with managers was ruff than it gets easier
good,"A typical day at work requires you following what is planned on your schedule while helping customers if they need assistance. You zone and stock in departments that you are assigned to. Before you start your shift you have a short meeting with Supervisor and Manager, after clocking in for attendance purposes. The culture is team oriented while expected to be customer friendly. The job is enjoyable if you are able to do what is asked of you and people friendly."
good,"Filling, input, bagging, customer service. Have learned a lot about patience and not judging others by their looks. Love the crew I work with. Very fast paced"
good,"Working for one of the biggest retailers in Canada has its rewards. The pay is based off of previous experience and the benefits you receive like a 10% discount card off of every purchase and the drug and dental benefits and potential profit sharing are more than most retailers offer. The chance to grow with the company is always an option with a lot of managers once being employed as salesfloor workers shows anyone can succeed if they wish too."
good,"I think Walmart provided lots of hours, which was really great for people looking to take extra hours. Most staff at Walmart wanted to see their employees succeed and supported them to their goal."
good,"I enjoyed it for a while, but had problems with the area. Great staff and Supervisors but I needed to be closer to home than I was. I would definitely recommend working there."
good,Time at a job and your experience should account for you amount of pay you receive and it doesn’t at this job... someone just coming in the door can make just as much as someone that’s been here over 10 years it’s not fair....
good,"I started there because I had been downsized and needed an income. Certainly it wasn't what I made $$ before but I was ok. Ended up loving it. Who knew. No stress just work. Wonderful and I mean the BEST team leads. Leave work at tg he door, go home. Fun . I am not being paid to write this. Now, I have other income making low wages not so bad for me.  Got another job recently and I was almost sad."
good,"Walmart can be an amazing company to work for, but that all depends on what store you work in or what part of the company in general. Communication is the biggest problem in this company, everyone things they are the boss when really there is a set chain of command."
good,They are needing to making sure that a full time employee get their 40 hours at all time. So the employee can afford to pay their insurance and benefits.
good,You get good hours for the most part with a good pay which increases after 10 months. After the holidays expect your hours to take a major cut getting lucky to work two to three days
good,It all just depends on the manager running the store along with the way they treat others. The work part really isn’t that bad and fairly easy. It is mostly just poor management skills
good,"Work was very easy. Management was not the best but some of the managers were considerate of your life outside of work. I’ve literally gotten injured, and experienced losing my grandfather while waiting on them to accept my work release."
good,If you work hard you can achieve more opportunity for yourself. It is a diverse company to work for. On the side of Vision Center we are very committed to taking care of patients needs.
good,"It was a good job, and okay pay. Has many different positions, advancement opportunities, and friendly coworkers. Also a fun job and I learned a lot from my position."
good,"Working at Walmart has taught me to be more opened and to step out of my comfort zone, met understanding people, uplifting, good and bad days still pulled through."
good,"A great work life balance. Although there are times were hours as well as days are and feel long due to peak season, if executed correctly work goes by with efficient time."
good,"Walmart itself is an amazing company, I have worked there a couple times for different seasonal work. But the locations with bad management ruin the job and make it the most stressful place to work at when there is really no need for it to be a stressful working environment."
good,"Walmart has been a great company to work for, if you work hard, you will go far! The company has many different career paths- something for everyone, many benefits as well!"
good,If youre in college this is definitely the place to be tney work with your school schedule and also make sure give you enough hours. Some great managers some better than others . great friendship and life long bonds
good,"Walmart as a company is everything you hear about...all the pros and all the cons.  If you are overly engaged and willing to compromise a work/life balance, the sky is the limit"
good,Always complete my work task everyday and go help someone to be a good teamplayer. Go way beyond my job task.Do anything my manger ask me everyday. Sometime after I finish I go a do another job distribution to help the company out
good,For the time I have worked at Walmart I have learned a lot but I have also seen how other people react. That has really changed on how I want to work or what's going on around me.
good,The stability was sufficient.  The management was not as helpful as I would've liked it to be.  The overall experience was good though.  I would recommend working there.
good,"Check in vendors to make sure the items they are bringing in are correct. "
good,"It's a good place to move up and learn valuable skills. But once in salaried assistant manager position the work and life balance gets pretty tough, as I've seen and heard about. How much you'll enjoy your job greatly depends on you're management and upper management team."
good,Walmart has fair hiring opportunities they allow a flexible schedule but tend to have high pressure working conditions. Customer service and communication skills highly needed
good,"I enjoyed this job that I started with bear staffing. I was hired very quickly and given a lead position. This was a nights and weekend shift only. I worked there for about three months until Walmart did a background check and decided to let me go. I had been promoted twice in those three months. However, their policy doesn't permit felons regardless of their work performance."
good,"If you cna manage to work there for an extended period of time (10+ years), it could be a good stable job. However, management and supervisors had a tendency to be unexperienced or uncaring. "
good,"Everyone was grumpy working. A few employees where nice and helpful. I loved working as a cashier but when I found a better way to do my job, my boss yelled at me and belittled me."
good,"I've been a sales associate, working in the cell phone center, to electronics, toys, cashiering, and overnight stocker. The work can be rewarding when you help out your customers, greeting them and listening to what they actually need help with makes the day go by faster. It can be fast paced to feeling like there's not much to do. But, I loved my walmart family. Everyone was a team player, and we all helped each other out when we needed it most. I learned customer service, to take calls and get over my fear of talking on the phone. To communicate better with other's and problem solve. I did try to go up in the store, but I was on overnights at the time and they seemed to overlook me and just stuck to picking daytime associates for moving up at the time. It's a great place to work when starting out."
good,When I work here I was not long I got pregnant with my son and there was no guide lines because I did not work there long I was not giving the right treatment I was told because I did so there was nothing they could do about me being sick or anything pregnant because I was not there long I was fired
good,The work there is great but the management needs to be a lot better. As long as you doing your work as good as you can do  it's great place to work at I need better Management Service
good,Unfortunately we went from 13 people working in the pharmacy down to 8. So the work doubled and was very stressful. I would have stayed had they not cut our people out.  The more people that are there the more people we could help. Common sense to everyone except corporate america
good,"If you're looking for benefits, this company offers benefts that other companies doesn't offer .The company is truly diverse and embraces the differences that everyone brings to the table."
good,"Answers are specific to the specified business location."
good,"Greeting customers, scanning and bagging there items. Always ask did they find everything they needed. Make sure your register is clean and aisle before leaving."
good,"Working overnight I had 3 managers, one of them was not a good manager but the other two were very likable people. I made very quick friends with a lot of the employees while I worked there. And the tasks were fairly easy to get done on time."
good,It was a good time  working at Walmart but i am definitely looking for something else with better pay and to meet more new people I have lots of experience stocking but I’m willing to try new things
good,Go in do your job there no problem. Not bad for a first job. The people are cool but the higher ups expect the most out of there lower level managers.
good,Walmart is definitely a great place to work and good in change but the only change is needed is working what you believe is needed and the money made in working as hard as you have been and as long as you have been.
good,"Management stuck up and all the do is talk and walk around, catch a attitude and talk to people like they are crazy, some not all, but most work is good"
good,A typical day at work is the clock in and go outside and grab the carts with the machine. I learned that the job was very hectic and tiring. The management did pretty well. The workplace culture is very less appealing. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers.
good,The work environment was healthy for the most part. The customers always appreciated our service and our management always made sure that the employees and the customers was well situated.
good,"Hard to move up the ladder. I’ve worked at Walmart for a year and a half and make the same amount (sometimes more) as people who’ve been there for 10+ years. I enjoy my job, just wish there was a chance to move up the ladder"
good,I think Walmart can pay their employees more than what they pay them. I have done the math and know that they could. They claim to be family oriented but don’t let employees take time off during the holidays too be with their families without punishing them for it. We don’t get paid time and a half on the holidays that we do work. They expect a great deal out of their employees with little reward or incentive
good,Walmart needs to choose better new hires. Turnover rate is ridiculously high! Like crazy high! New generation of workers are not willing to do much and want it all. The 20 year or longer associates or not compensated enough for all they know and the slack of the newer people they gave to do. It’s just sad when a 2-3 year associate makes the same as a 30 year associate. No incentive to stay that ling
good,"The place I worked at was fun, but most of the managers felt like if they never cared or payed attention, most of the people will talk behind your back or rumors spread drastically"
good,"- i learned to keep a positive attitude dealing with customers"
good,"I was working overnight, so a lot of shadier characters where present. they all seemed content but given they were significantly older not looking for much more. me personally I saw that I had bigger opportunities elsewhere so I took it and ran. I'm glad I did."
good,Walmart is the biggest retail store in the United States which means it has a lot of employees. So the general consensus you hear about regarding working for the company is most likely going to be fairly realistic to what you are going to experience working for the company.
good,"Management has to learn that their employees are people to and need the same respect as they do.. Basically my postion was a door host to greet and check reciepts.. There was alot of time where I called for a replacment just to use the restroom for not even 3 mins , I finally walked away and when I was returning to my door I was reprimanded … I replied I waited for 45 mins and I couldnt wait any longer.."
good,"Walmart is a serious business and if not taken seriously, it could all fall apart. Being responsible for making it better and keeping things going gave me a different sense of pride that i never felt before. It was a greater experience."
good,"Lo que le falta a la Empresa WALMART."
good,"Its not a bad job ,just like most jobs  ,,its who you work with and for. But it is Walmart  and somewhat  job security .i liked it , but at that time over nights stock person received more hours than AM cashiers"
good,I am glad I got the experience working at Walmart. It was a great start off into working in a real warehouse how we handled our jobs and how simple it was.
good,"production production production. very intensely physical being and order filler/ picker. At begging work does goes by fast that last about 4-6 months. After it starts feeling like and eternity being at work. you learn nothing from aside building your pallet so it won't tip over and learning how to work a pallet jack. One thing this opportunity helps you realize is efficiency. You pick your box place it, pick and place. Nothing else other wise you lose productivity. short breaks for 9-10hr work days. If you can't meet goal your kicked out. It is frowned upon to not meet daily goal although the weekly production will be met."
good,"I was a cashier, I checked out customers as quickly as I could because as we all know Walmart gets packed and only 3 registers are open but the managers and team are great."
good,I worked in a time where policys were changing. It was a difficult time to adjust but it wasn't bad. My coworkers were nice and got along easily. With the changing policys there was confusions but I'm sure it's all settled by now.
good,"Walmart isn't great. They often require you to work holidays (especially if you work at one that is open for 24 hrs). The management depends on the store, they're alright at my store but they could be better. There are recurring problems that have been brought to their attention but have not been fixed. IT's kind of a lax job. I get to choose when I go on break and that's cool but that also depends on who your manager is. Cashiers aren't able to choose. They also don't give most people weekends off. The hardest part of my job (stocking) is cleaning up after coworkers who put items anywhere on the shelf instead of making sure it goes in the correct spot. This is all the time. But if you like repetition then Cap  associate is for you. The hours for the position are 4am-1pm, 5am-2pm, or 6am-3pm. I work from 5 to 2. I like the hours but they can get in the way of family plans. Overall, it's an okay job for now but I definitely wouldn't choose this as a career."
good,The job over here is okay to a certain degree. It has its ups and downs. But I feel like this job has more downs then ups. The communication between one another could use some work. And no benefits after working on Thanksgiving and Black Friday.
good,"Overall Walmart wasn't terrible but they have some things they could improve for sure. I didn't like how they would send girls outside to push carts sometimes or even have me, a cashier, outside in the abundance of heat we face in Texas and then put me back on the register and I'm all sweaty."
good,"Aside from the dictatorship they call management, it was a fantastic work place. Very diverse with all age groups. Coworkers and customers were the best part about work along with a flexible schedule."
good,I like the job I just didn't like that walmart doesn't have set schedules for their employees. They set ur schedule 3 weeks in advance.  They don't allow ot
good,Depending on management the experience over all was a positive one. At the time the schedule for an assistant was three 12 hour days and three days off. Worked well with vacations and work/life balance.
good,Muitas vezes  a liderança  mistura amizade com profissional  ai é  complicado
good,Era bom q estragava era desfeito do chefe com funcionari achava q funcionário era bicho pra ser mau tratado
good,Stocking all grocery and merchandise making sure everything goes where its supposed to be organizing and making shelfs neat enjoyed making customers happy by cleanliness and perfection
good,The management wasn’t the greatest I’ve experienced. The pay is good and steady and is a quality work experience. Overall it is a good job is you really need one .
good,"My managers wouldn't really work with me when it came to hourly work weeks. Im in school so it was(is) quite hard on me. Otherwise, I ""enjoyed"" my time there. Cart pushing isn't especially hard work and 11 an hour is good compensation. Some of the CSMs are really nice"
good,"The Wal-Mart distribution center is easily the hardest job I've ever had. 12-hour shifts starting at 2:30 AM, consisting almost entirely of manual labor in a facility that is constantly kept at 32 degrees or below, and you start getting a picture of what the work is like. However, they pay nearly $20 an hour starting, which almost completely makes up for the workload. Reccomend only if you're in it for the money."
good,cleaning toilets for min. wage is not my idea to b happy to live with. oertunity to move up its a possibility but unless its mangment its a dead end job
good,"Sadly, don't assume that if you are a long-term associate you will have any kind of job security.  ""Restructuring"" is becoming a common occurrence at WM.  One day you are there; the next day you are not. And they never tell you until the day they lay you off.   Very disheartening to invest many years into a company, get close to retirement, then have to start all over again with another company.  If loyalty to long-term employees is valuable to you, as it was to me, this is not the place to work at.   A friend of mine was laid off on her 18th work anniversary date, and a lot of people who have been there for 20+ years have been laid off in recent years.  Sad to see."
good,I loved my job until it became my only life. My team was fantastic. Leading in the industry. But you were on call 24/7 . The days were long. You couldn’t make plans it made it very difficult to be part of your own family.
good,"Working in the bakery/deli. Learning layout and needs of products to be stocked, setting up for new and sale items. Working with the deli counter getting hot food ready and serving."
good,"During my time at WalMart, it was up and down. The pay was great for what it was, and the benefits were out of this world. Management had ups and downs, but working there was a lot of fun. However, don't even begin to hope for career advancement if you're trying to go to school as well."
good,"Overall just a typical job. Pay at the time was at the state minimum wage, with minimal benefits for short term employees. If you weren’t full time, then the store would work their part timers 39 hours a week to keep them under full time."
good,"Overall the workplace is good to work at. The deadlines are not hard to reach if you are willing to put in the hard work. For the most part they provide you with the tools you need in order to maintain your store for it's main objective, driving sales. At times it does lack the necessities to do that which make your job harder."
good,"Pay is just garbage. As a supervisor, i was under 10 an hour. I had my reasons for going there that were.... unbecoming of myself."
good,There is no room for advancement! The pay is minimum wage! The work is easy. The work is boring! I did not enjoy working there as I need a challenge and excitement!!!
good,When i worked there everyone literally became family i was able to move up very quickly. The best way to explain Walmart is that u work with a variety of colorfull people not as in race but as in character and personality.
good,Working at Walmart was okay. They cut my hours down so it was hard to make money to pay certain bills but I had many friends there so it made the job better.
good,It's the friendly and caring people that you work with every day that make it a good place to work. The centralized  management structure gets in the way of that.
good,got promoted after 6 months to overnight csm great job then boom corporate said no more overnights lost my position got a 2.50 pay cut threw no fault of my own doing 5 times the work lifting 50+ pounds constantly its very tuff work and i've done demolition before
good,Was a great place to work at. If you are going for management be surenits a loction you really want or wait for a location byou want to open up. Great job to move up fast in.
good,It’s Walmart. People know how the employees at Walmart are treated. Sometimes good and sometimes bad. I think that is with any job. Meet some really nice people there
good,Not a bad company it just needs improvement on the management side of things. But if you’re looking to work there and then transfer to the warehouse it is a great opportunity.
good,Try to be friendly.hours very from week to week.they try and find good honest and friendly people to work for them.stay busy around holidays.not a job for lazy people.
good,"Good job for high school students"
good,"A empresa da oportunidades de desenvolvimento de carreira, te dá ferramentas e lidera servindo."
good,When i worked there the leadership was good. Benefits where poor but i was also only part time so had none. They where very much willing to adjust my schedule to help if for whatever reason i couldn't make it in. Even let me go home one day while my mom was in the hospital(I know that sounds weird but they don't have to do that)
good,they expect you to do the work of 3 people in the same amount of time as 1 person. do your area plus wait on customers and zone an area on other side of the store
good,It was a good company to work for had a lot of hours got a chance to get overtime if you wanted it paid very good. Management was okay. Got time off for my family
good,"I enjoyed working at Wall-mart.  I enjoy working retail and if someone asked about working here, I would tell them to give it a try and see if it is right for them."
good,Not a permanent place to work in my opinion its just a place til you find something better unless you come in as management. Management didnt accommodate the workers as well as they couldve in my opinion.
good,"If I go back it would only be as a manager,because I feel Walmart need great managers with peoples skills.Walmart needs to be more family oriented Walmart need to let associates have more family time."
good,The best thing about working at Walmart is the pay. The work isn’t very hard depending on the department. Knowing how to do a little bit of everything goes a long way.
good,it's just a typical workplace they give you assignments to do you did them within a timely manner they would leave you alone if not they wouldn't like that you didn't finish your work.
good,Whichever department go to every manager for each department has no full clue as towards what to do/tell employees to do. Lack of tools/equipment to give employees. Just stand around clueless in search for who to go as supervisor and store manager doesn't really care.
good,All in all its a great place to work just no offering enough hours that I need. The environment is great but when I needed the hours they hardly got back to me
good,"Good place to work if not for bad management, dealt with harassment from the store manager and even filed a complaint about it, never got around to even calling HR after I tried having a talk with the store manager but decided to fire me the next day because he didn't want to have me report him at all."
good,"Although the pay is high for retail, it is not a livable wage. The hours are inconsistent and can and will be cut with no notice or explanation. Full-time means 34 hours or more, but almost never 40. Schedule will also widely vary. Many times I found myself closing at 10pm and having to be back at 7am to open."
good,Not enough hours some other workers wouldn't do their job properly and some management was very sketchy and I would advise knowing your supervisor well
good,"A job that offers a future and well as a life, However the biggest problem is the fact they try to hire as minimum employees, Making service terrible."
good,I had planned to retire from walmart it's one of those situations where I left my boss not my job really would have liked it to have been different but we have to move on.
good,It’s an okay place to work at & a typical day of work is on the cash register all day I learned not all people are to nice the management they are kind of okay & the workplace culture it’s very bright & loud & the hardest part is trying to deal with the csms.
good,Working at Walmart I learn something new every day between customers and coworkers. I enjoy helping customers with any questions or concerns they ask coming up to the Customer service desk.
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart. I enjoy interacting customers, coworkers and management but I have found it to be very tight and inconsistent with hours.It is nearly impossible to attain full time status even after training in additional areas with a perfect attendance and on time record."
good,Friendly atmosphere for everyone to get along and help one another out. Fast pace production job money is great but you're going to work for it. Management is in bad shape managers come in and are bombarded with alot of responsibilities to were they quit cuz it's to much for 1 person.
good,Definately need to be a self starter as training is sparce and all computer based.  Once you prove yourself doors open up for advancement.  Good team members and must love working in and with the community.
good,It was a good place to work I didn't have any issues with the jobs it was just the lack of hours after I transfered that was not good for me. It was part time hours at best.
good,"Basically this place is alright. You will have advancement opportunities present themselves. Sometimes the position you want will be harder to obtain based off your current manager. 8 hour days, some jobs are harder than others. Most are pretty relaxed."
good,"Overall it was like most retail jobs, odd schedules assigned 3 weeks out. rushes depending on the time of day and more things to do on weekends due to higher customer volume. "
good,"Guaranteed work hours, but very hectic work environment. You have to great multi tasking skills to be able to survive in this job environment. Builds great customer service skills, and always willing to advance your career in the company if you are willing."
good,I loved working at Walmart and helping customers. I would love to go back and work with them one day. Best part was the open environment they had with people.
good,Very nice place to work. love the people that work there. theres a few issues like all places of work have but as long as you are doind your job and not minding other peoples business you should be fine
good,I worked there for three years and had a good time. The pay was decent depending on where you live because it is minimum wage. Overall it’s a decent place to work.
good,"Working at the Walmart Fulfillment Center was I thought was a game changing experience until after I started working there. Lots of disrespectful people and associates, no room for advancement, and plenty of young and ignorant people who works there. I used to work in the shipping area and it was pretty long but easy."
good,I liked working here I was just expected to do everyone else’s job to much and felt like I never had enough time to do what all needed to be done sometimes
good,"I wanted to stay on to Walmart,  but to continue working for them,  it would have been, OK, until management thinks they can treat employees any type of way. I was let go and was glad at the time. If I were to"
good,"the budget for continual upgrades , and remodeling should occur maybe 7-10 years. and"
good,"Though some people believed the particular store was politically run by management, I believe the company as a whole is innovative and thus expanding. The opportunities are increasing and becoming more interesting."
good,Working for Walmart was an enjoyable time for the most part with excellent staff.  The work/life balance and inability to move to a more steady shift was my only reason for finally leaving after 18 years.
good,Everything was amazing. Friendly associates and very enjoyable break areas. Easy to learn job role and easy to maintain up keep of tasks. Would recommend as first job.
good,"The mornings are great. It's quite at times and really loud most of the time. there are always costumers any time of the day and Night. IT'S ALWAYS BUSY. Management was okay. The hardest part of the job was to complete so many tasks at once for one person to handle. I enjoyed getting payed most of the time, and also meeting great, and awesome people. I've also learn something new everyday by costumers and the coworkers."
good,If you move up you have to move around to diffrent walmarts and move in gernal if you stay were your at you baerly get paid enough to stay were your at
good,"The Walmart I worked at was ok, I mean it was a job but the management could’ve/should’ve been a lot better. My job title was a cashier but it had gotten to the point where I was on the floor stocking more than I was at the register"
good,"Walmart Distribution Center was one of the hardest places I ever worked at. It was a fast paced, sweaty, high payed competitive place to work. The people were nice but the management  was not involved with daily assignments."
good,Walmart was a good job i learned how to work fast paced and the hardest part was how the work environment was but i enjoyed the pay and meeting new people management was nice not a place i would make a career out of but it was a good starter job.
good,"The main problem would be managers and the constant lack of other employees, but being always told they’re over staffed. Other than that it’s a pretty simple job."
good,If you are in high school or college and need a decent job making pretty good money this is a pretty good place to start. It’s a good work environment once you get to know your co-workers. One big thing is there is to many managers.
good,"Some days were good; I enjoyed the colorful people I met, both coworkers and customers alike. Won't lie though, some days were rough and super stressful."
good,There is good and bad just like every other place in the world. They just wont change my hours so i can be home with my kids when they get from school.
good,"None really. It's not rocket science. Does get a little taxing, working 12 hr shifts. You also get the dpt managers work load put on you plus what you have to do for your own job title."
good,Fue un trabajo muy bueno me sentí a gusto aprendí sobre la presa sobre el proceso sobre la administración.
good,It was an easy job getting the cart's inside the store & talking with the customer's. I did an god job at with the cart's U& got them from the outside
good,"In a typical day, I have my usual tasks to do in the Fitting Room, answer the phone, assist the customers at the Fitting Room, Jewelry counter, baby formula case, Dove soap case, and Men's underwear case.  I get on the intercom and page for management and associates to answer their phone calls.  I receive numerous requests from management and associates to make announcements over the intercom.  I help out with the freight to help put the merchandise or products onto the sales floor.  I help to zone the ladies, men's, girl's, infant's, and intimate's apparel areas.  I help to process the apparel returns."
good,Wal-mart is a good company overall to work for. They offer excellent benefits and the starting pay is better than average. The overall work is not very stressful and they work with your schedules if you need certain time off.
good,"Managers rotate, and some are good, and others are absolute nightmares. Supervisors tend to act like they are well above their pay grade, and can be very rude. Customers are often horrible, but can also be the best part of the day. Mind numbing work, but relatively simple."
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work.  Advancement within the job comes quick if you stay on task and get your job done. "
good,"My shift starts at 7 am, check my emails, check sales for my assigned departments, walk through my assigned departments write up a to due list, call a team meeting to give out tasks and goals for the day, complete manager tasks (scanning outs, changing on hands, help out with stocking as needed, price changes, monthly planning for features, and etc)."
good,"They worked with customer on pricing but not to much."
good,"I loved work. It was constant being busy,loved talking and helping customers. Some management was awesome some were always down and negative. Employees were same"
good,I am not a person into working hourly jobs. At times I felt like the day was dragging. Do not get me wrong the work is easy but just so boring at times.
good,"Walmart was my first job, I left and came back and have been there a total of 4 years now, it can be a good place to work with many opportunities to promote"
good,Basically every Manager is spanish!!! When I was there if you were AA you weren't promited. They would promote Spanish people then expect for you to train them. Not a good place to work or shop.
good,Not very good at helping associates with any problems from home life to work life. They have started not taking dr's notes for hospital visits and doctors care when you miss work due to illness
good,My position is good for if you want to exercise It’s hard working being a cart pusher but it’s rewarding because you get exercise it works on your muscles it’s warm sometimes it’s cold sometimes it’s really fun and sometimes it’s very stressful.
good,Fast passed and good team work. Management is not the best at times simply because not trained to do everything in all departments. Overall a good company to work for.
good,Must be able to multitask and learn all areas of the job. Ive learned a lot about people in general.The hardest thing is time management.Making customers happy and helping them get the medications they need is the thing I like best especially when they come back because you did go out of your way. I’ve learned a lot of mathematics and enjoyed working with other employees of all cultures.
good,Lots of favoritism in the workplace. Employees would be fired for the slightest mistake with no warning or hesitation. Some managers and supervisors try their best for their employees but majority are only looking out for themselves.
good,"I was cashier. It wasn't that bad. Sometimes its flexible other times not. They can understanding. Works would include at times, cart pushing, restocking, and helping other departments when needed or slowed."
good,For the amount of pain this job puts a body through we do not get paid fairly and the volume they and pace they expect you to push out. So many safety issues.
good,"I had a problem with how management would use their clout to do less work and choose certain coworkers to be biased to. I tried to voice my opinions on the goings on around my specific department, only to receive a robotic answer every time."
good,"Walmart was a great company to work for. It allowed you to practice problem solving skills, as well as people skills. Their policy for security is a little out dated, and makes it hard to complete job."
good,"Pros:  good benefits."
good,"Typical work day was busy, there were down times when we’d zone or straighten the shelves and overall pharmacy area. Very exciting energy to be around meeting new or continuing customers and physicians. Great management team they constantly acknowledge our team efforts and rise and fall of our quarterly results and made sure we knew how appreciated we were to the company"
good,"My experience with walmart could have been better if they game me a shift that worked with me rather than shovinging it down my throat, but maybe it was only at tye walmart that i was working at."
good,"The students can easily get this job, and they can change their availability. They train the new associates properly and always emphasize working in a safe environment."
good,I was brought in for physician to work to another position open up but when that position open up that they promised me they gave it to somebody else and told me that I was overqualified for the position that she promised me that I was going to get when they open up and never did so therefore I think did they live try to get you in the door and use you for what they want you to do for them
good,It’s a good first job. Would recommend for anyone looking for a easy job that doesn’t have much pressure. Everyone is pretty down to earth and you’ll learn everything pretty quick.
good,"Pleasant environment with good benefits and training. Employee discount a plus and works around school schedules. Advancement is encouraged and supported by management."
good,"Walmart isn’t for the faint of heart , though they will give you a chance ,i wont complain I appreciate that fact that they gave me an opportunity, and a chance to grow rather quickly in the company. "
good,"It's been a while but from what I remember. Most days are fairly average. Then there is suddenly a mad scramble and management is stressing out for a corporate visit, upcoming inventory or Black Friday. So, all that stress naturally gets distributed throughout the rest of the store. The only solace is that pretty much all the other employees are in a similar boat as you so that is where the best bonds happen and can take some of the stress away."
good,"To be honest I liked working here but the pay was a little low especially sinced I worked in almost every department. All in all, if the pay was a little hire here, i would have probably stayed there."
good,"Each day at work provides new and rewarding growth. Meeting and interacting with new people is a typical day at work. Each day provides newly learned skills through people and handling of transactions. A typical day at work is working behind the customer service desk providing quality customer service skills such as money transactions, cashing checks, or sales and return of merchandise. Management skills are gained as well through daily postings and changes of policy."
good,"A typical day at work involved entering the registry, and doing transactions at the register. The job involved cleaning the aisles and knowing your way around the store. The management was good! The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly employees. The hardest part of the job were the sometimes nasty customers."
good,"By that I mean that most people are coming into a place like this with a lot of preconceived notions about it.  I knew what I was getting myself into, so most of the negative aspects didn't affect me too much.  Not too difficult or stressful.  Decent work environment.  If you're someone who likes to take the initiative and push yourself beyond what's expected you can probably make a decent career out of it.  However, if you're more prone to to just march in step and do the bare minimum you can probably make it just fine.  You get out what you put in."
good,The management is kind of iffy there but they are great people to work with.The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers.The hardest part of the job is when your co workers not doing there job and you tell a manager and they don't care about the situation.
good,Walmart is okay job depending on your stores management my  management is horrible because they do not care about their associates They used to care it was good job at the time
good,"Work days vary based on the department, but the company does take care of employees.  They offer a great benefits package and discounts that help with the living expenses."
good,Walmart is a somewhat good place to work but the management is not at its best and the people who are hired don’t always work to their best abilities leaving other associates to pick up the work.
good,I loved working there. I worked nights at my facility but the people I worked with were very friendly and helpful especially when I first started. The managers were okay.
good,"I was there for 2 years and a lot have changed since. My experience was ok, obviously it’s customer service so a lot went down. Customers are not the nicest but not all of them are like that."
good,"Overall recommended if you do work there try and to get to know every worker you can, opportunities to move up and all chances you get to move up try an do it."
good,Started working in Hanover PA the managers there were really nice and caring and they engaged with their assotiates but once I transferred to lakeland Fl the store manager their alby thinks about himself and dont assotiate with with assotiates like a manger should.
good,"...until it wasn’t. Coworkers and lazy dept. manager made it suck to come to work, frankly. The work wasn’t bad and compensation was more than fair. The job itself was decent. Bad work environment."
good,My experience may be different from others. Not sure what my review has to do with me applying for another job. This section needs to be exckuding from this section.
good,A typical day of work consists of a very fast pace. There's always something to do. I have learned how to manage my time to get the job done. The people I work with are great. The toughest time is during the summer and the holidays. It's great you meet and see lots of people.
good,"It’s always busy and stressful. Good customer service is key. There will always be irate customers, you have to learn to be patient and smile. You do meet a lot of new people. The environment changes depending on how your store manager manages."
good,its a great place to work. things are always changing so it always keeps you on your toes. tons of positions to try and alot of room for advancement with the company
good,Great job for a high energy individual who works hard. Felt appreciated by management and always felt comfortable voicing complaints or introducing new ideas.
good,Tiene excelente cultura laboral y te promociona a mejores puestos de trabajo pero el pago es muy muy pobre
good,"It was 9 hour shifts. 8 hour working, 1 hour lunch. The time flew by because most days we had big trucks to unload with around over 3,000 boxes. It'd take around 2 1/2 hours to get the truck unloaded and another hour for me to get the boxes put where they go. So by that time I was already halfway through the shift. But it wasn't a horrible job just didn't feel like I was getting paid enough, I was doing all that hard labor while getting paid the same as a door greeter."
good,"As an assistant Manager you are required to fill shelves, load unload trucks."
good,It was generally a fun place to work. My biggest recommendation to anyone who is looking to work here is to come to work. In the years I worked there the only people who lost their jobs were those who did not show up!
good,"Working for Walmart is an experience that is hard to explain. Because it's something you have to experience for yourself to fully understand what it's like. I can say that it is a fun place to work at, they are very friendly there, and helpful with new associates teaching them and answering questions."
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work. The people are nice and management can be easy going. The attendance policy however only allows 5 call outs before they fire you. It doesn’t matter how good of an employee you are, if you get 5 points, you’re fired. Which I just think life can get too hectic at times for that to work for a lot of people."
good,"I started as a cashier and was requested to work the service desk. I worked 2 days and hated it, I told 4 different managers that I hated it. They didn’t care. And the general Manager (Courtney Blankenship) told me I could work it or “go home.” So I worked it. I changed my preferences several times, and never had the opportunity to move departments. I was stuck."
good,"Its just depends on what type of Walmart you work at. If you work at a busy Walmart, then it will be pressure packed and hectic. You have to mentally tough to work there"
good,You receive good hours & good pay. Management is sometimes unorganized. You don’t get Holidays off and there is no holiday pay to compensate for it that’s most people complaint.
good,"Good opportunity for advancement. Strict managers lots of customers hectic sometimes.  Not very flexible scheduling but stable hours."
good,"Underpaid for all the work an associate has to do. They eliminated ""department managers"" and split up that work between associates, not increasing our pay. Always understaffed, and a lot of pressure put on the associates that are there to do a three person job. Failed to get an interview or an of a promotion in my department, as it was given to someone who had only worked in my department for one month with no knowledge of the department at all."
good,walmart isnt a very good place to work they dont train their employes very well they dont take care of their employess they switch your position every night so you dont know where your gonna be at i just want to find somewhere where i can be trained to actaully be able to make good money to afford my bills
good,"When I started at Walmart I was welcomed with open arms and happy faces which really helped me because I was a shy kid. However...after  2 years it became clear that the store beginning to get rough. They removed express lanes with self checkouts to seem more modern but very little amounts of customers went and used them creating outrageous pile ups."
good,"Typical Work Day was cleaning shelves and counters in a certain department,depending on what day it was. I learned by trial and error. This was a newly created job and management didn't have any guide lines set up. Management and other employees were not helpful. The hardest part was not having anyone to ask for help. Best Part was helping customers find what they were looking for. Without any Coaching I was let go because I was sick with the flu and missed one to many days during Probation. I had worked at another store,and knew you were suppose to have Coaching when something was wrong. I believe they wanted to do away with the job,and should have given me the opportunity to work in another department."
good,"My experience at Wal-Mart was good at first I knew the job well before I got hired so it made it easy to do my job, when I got there it was fun and exciting to work there I felt proud of myself because Wal-Mart isn't and easy job to get it took me two years of applications to get in, all in all it was good just the people and management"
good,"It is a good place to start and build some work experience. The employees are nice, the managers are ok. There is always room to advance if you are self motivated."
good,"My time spent at Walmart was cool. Started out full time and was shifted to part time where the pay started being funny. My hours were cut significantly and it caused me to find another job. Other than that great company, fast paced, and room for advancement."
good,"For the most part this is an ideal place to work. The hours are decent, the employees are good to get along with. Management needs help, I feel like they are not always there to support their workers. The focus for MasterCard sales is frustrating, especially when 6 people have to meet goal for whole store, and only cashiers are required to do this. While part of the job to get them, it is hard when the staff is harassed to get them when no one wants them. Most enjoyable part can be customers, you get to know what they want and need from you ."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart, the benefits in my opinion were great. They offer health, dental, and vision insurance to full and part time workers. The only downside about Walmart is they aren’t really good about giving raises to their associates."
good,"Your standard retail environment. Fast paced, low stress, easy work. Managing employees and a department are fairly straight forward. Work changes from day to day. Hardest part of the job is communicating well with upper management and creating a solid flow of operations."
good,"One of the managers had an attitude, but other than that the work and people were very friendly and fairly Easy as long as you were willing to work. Many fun and different personalities and the people in Tyler just make the job that much better"
good,Working at Walmart automotive has been a totally new experience. When I applied I had zero experience working on vehicles. And in five years I'm the best technician in the shop. The environment can be fast paste and energetic and my co-workers are very friendly and knowledgeable.
good,"I liked their 1 hour lunch they had, that was nice. It's definitely not the job for those who aren't mentally prepared for dealing with customers. Everyday, you deal with all sorts of different customers out there you just gotta shrug it off in the end regardless if they're rude, nasty or not. You also get wacky schedules sometimes, if it happens, probably best to inform management about it"
good,"This was a good company but is not family oriented like they state. Other than that, I lived it. My coworkers became a family and it's nice to work in am environment where everyone can be so close. I think this job is more for high school/college/or elderly. Not someone with a family to provide for."
good,"My responsibility was drop off for new & refill prescriptions, customer service and registration ,  inventory control, stocking shelves and fill prescription and prepare it to the patient"
good,"This is a job to get by, especially those who are young. I would recommend working for Walmart, but it has to be a certain place in order for you to have a pleasant experience."
good,"Fast paced but relaxed. Some departments barely do anything and others work their butts off.  Management was poor, was never enough employees hired, work environment would become unfriendly"
good,Para que las personas se interecen mas nesecitan aumentar un poco el salario y los vales
good,"Fast paced work environment but you find your pace after you get used to it. Great manager, gives me my days off when requested and helps me whenever I ask in his best ability."
good,"Walmart was a good experience. My typical day at work went by fast, and as I was a student, the flexible part-time hours made it easy to navigate school and work life. However, whenever I wasn't in school, I was booked and that made it difficult to have a social life. I loved being around people all day; if you have good customer service skills, it seems like you're just hanging out with friends all day. The hardest part of the job is the big rushes, when you feel overwhelmed and stressed."
good,They all about productivity even when they say Safety First no productivity first speed speed speed get to work done they look down on you if you can't keep up
good,Fast-based and customer demanding work environment. Amazing organizational learning opportunities and a place for professional development. The PPTO policy allows for a great work-life balance if PPTO and PTO (Vacation) are accrued.
good,"Its a ok place to work decent pay and the people are nice, but depending on your position it can feel like your getting shafted on some things, some positions have way more responsibility then some department managers and get way less pay."
good,"Walmart can be hit or miss. One one hand, you could be forced to bust it all day every day putting up boxes and enjoy your work environment because of the people, but on the other it can be monotonous and you may be working alone. It's also very inconsistent with scheduling so it makes it hard to set things up in your social life. The point system sucks too and they will not work with you if you don't have ""Protected PTO"" which you rack up over time, but it's the only thing that will save you if you have an emergency."
good,Production is by far the most stressful part of the store because of a lack of workers for example sometimes I was in production by myself for a few hours and I worked mid day. I was told there would always be 2 or 3 other people working with me. Management still has the same requirements for 1 person working there as 3 or 4 people working there
good,I hated Walmart they manger was horrible mean and unprofessional everybody just talked about each other or tried to get you into trouble I had some good team mates besides that
good,"in this company they give you a good training and the necessary tools to do your job in the best way, the work environment is calm and nice, they listen to your ideas"
good,It was hard to be yourself but the work not benefits were worth while. Gave me nearly 4 great years. The management is willing to help you as much as possible
good,Its a good job for someone who is not living on their own and is still going to school or someone who is still deciding on their future career. I wouldn't just say its a bad job overall but I feel like like the pay is too low to make a living.
good,Good company to work for.  People just don't do their job as told .  Everything is out of order. Overall the team I worked with were nice people friendly to others as well as myself.
good,The less of staff they have the more worn it’s being put into the associates who are hard workers already on top of trying to get different departments done within a certain time period.
good,Pay could’ve been a little better for the work required. Need to have overtime for those that need to make a little more. The staff was nice and friendly.
good,Store manager is the best. She’s very fair and looks out for her employees. The point system has changed and doesn’t seem fair. If you want to work here just don’t get sick or have a medical condition even if your medical condition becomes after your employed. I was not able to be accommodated. When the point system changed a lot of employees got fired no matter how many years you were there. No paid holidays just pto time was accrued. Was a great place to work and there was chances for advancement.
good,"Every day had its stressful moments, but seeing the kids and parents faces after receiving their order made every day worth it. "
good,"Really loved my job I wouldn’t of stayed 15 yrs if I didn’t, but the company, I believe stopped caring about their people. I know it’s a business but if you don’t have good dependable trustworthy people you can count on it becomes just a paycheck for people and not a career. It’s really hard to find hard working people and to keep those people you need to treat them with respect."
good,"it all depends on what store you work at , worked in 4 different stores and last one i worked at was the hardest , store manager threaten her management team and made it hard to work for the company"
good,The only thing is that it’s hard to grow in this company but I will not bad mouth this company just like any other company it has it up and down. I like this company because it though me a lot of new things I’m grateful for that.
good,"A place where the managers sometimes are going to help you, most of them are nice, but some of them really think that you don’t need to rest or take care of family problems"
good,Es una transnacional grande con amplia trayectoria que te permite desarrollar tus habilidades como gerente de unidad.
good,"The jobs were pretty simple if you were trained properly, however you were usually battling against management to actually do your job most the time. My biggest issue was they never kept the same manager over you, they'd cycle them. So some would only show up when things were bad or you'd get one that'd bring in negative support."
good,"A typical day at work involved running the cash register. It involved scanning the items the customer bought and then properly bagging them. Also, when free one was to clean up in the area around one's aisle. Overall, it helps enhance one's interpersonal skills."
good,"Not much to really say, it was a great opportunity to meet new and interesting individuals. Fun environment and always room to advance to a higher position internally"
good,Mostly new upper management who don’t have their associates backs. Store manager is also new and isn’t very friendly. Severely  Understaffed and over worked.
good,"Walmart is a great and welcoming place to work.  Starting pay of $11 is decent but still not enough to live on in this economy.  They have a really decent training program and it is all paid on the clock.  The opportunity for advancement with Walmart is very good and can lead to a very rewarding career."
good,I had to work with several different kinds of people. Employees and customers. It's a good job to be at to learn how to handle different situations. It's a hands on job.
good,me gustava mucho mi trabajo de operador de apilador electrico.....me gustava trabajar sobre todos los feriados  sobre todo si caian de lunes a viernes...( aveces por avaratar costos no nos sitavan )...en tanto al casino y buses de acercamiento muy buenos servicios....relacion tanto supervisores jefes de area muy buenos....
good,Walmart is a great company to promote within. Work hard for it and it will be yours. Pay ranges depending on your level (position) and how long you have been with the company.  Quarterly bonuses
good,"I work typical 40 hours a week and their are days where it's  hard getting up and going in. I like a lot of my customers and fellow cashiers. My front end management to me is not all that organized at all and it does make it hard to do the job. We don't have our cleaning supplies we need half the time to clean our registers. "
good,"Fun place to work but make sure you really think about your availability before you put it down because it is near impossible to change after you are hired. It is also hard to ask for time -off. Make sure you check the schedule regularly, the management changes it with out notice and they have a very strict late policy."
good,When I first started Walmart it was such a great company. Over the years leading up to today it has forgotten what Walmart stood for years ago. The tactics of scaring employees to cutting hours and associates has hurt every value Walmart ever stood for.
good,"Walmart exemplifies the changes and lack of ethics and caring that occur after the passing of its founder. It's all about the corporate greed, no consideration for the workers who helped to build and grow the company."
good,"A typical day of work at Walmart consists of the before work meeting, letting everyone know where they are gonna work for the night, then prepping for the area you're going to be at. You stock your freight, zone then clean your area and move on to the next task."
good,Seniorty is a big plus only if you are apart of the seniority. Shifts were not well rotated and management over the pharmacy was horrible. Other than that the pharmacy was an ok place to be in.
good,Its not so bad a company to work for if you need a job but they do run you crazy doing other jobs for the same pay. The benefits aren't bad but its not like ir used to be but i guess its all about changes
good,"its mostly a passing by time job, i was working as a unloader so the job was very demanding with little pay, good benefits tho. But the advancement opportunities just weren't there for me so it was time to go."
good,It pays well. Terrible management. To many chiefs not enough indians. Employees work their job and leave most managers dont do anything and pretty much just hang out and walk around to look busy
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral mucho aprendizaje"
good,"I was hired as an overnight cashier at the Super Walmart, I then started to work stocking shelves,and putting up mods. Management was strong but friendly. I learned how to accomplish more in a shorter time. The workplace culture was minimal since you really worked by your self.The most enjoyable time of this job was when the night was over and the morning sun was shining."
good,"Could be a excellent place to work, but need hear more the employee necessities and ideias. Pay more for a hard jobs and recognize the employee effort and skills and position them on what they do best"
good,"A typical day at work as a cashier consists of communicating to customers in a friendly & polite manner, ringing up their items, handling change accurately, & bagging customer’s items efficiently. I learned the importance of cashiering & how to be a cashier. However, I had difficulty with my work schedule as it interfered with my school hours; & I was not able to contact manager."
good,"Good paying job, but time off is very low. Very good schedule. Set schedule Tuesday-Friday 7am-5:30pm. Management is good, but favorited with individuals."
good,When I was employed with Walmart I had a bad experience at the store I was at specifically I can't speak for all store but Management at my store was terrible a lot of the workers there would always be in other's personal business including some of the managers. Customers needs were hardly ever met just the store I was at was very terrible.
good,Its not a bad place to work for. People are semi friendly. But it is stressful at times. If you do your job they leave you alone most of the time. All in all not bad. Pay is decent.
good,"A typical day work was to just ring up people and push carts "
good,Walmart was an ok company to work for!!  No job security with all the changes being made. Really wish I didn’t have to leave but they eliminated my position
good,"Excelente cultura, como supervisor me toco estar en la mitad de los beneficios quedando afuera de los que poseían operación y fuera de bonos de jefaturas"
good,"Job Is great, but hours change every week.  Schedule don't  Fit with the employee availability and can be mornings or nights."
good,Walmart has its ups and downs. It’s just like working at any other retail store. I worked in the bakery and deli at Walmart. It was a very fast paced job.
good,My duties were to perform customer service handle money at the cash register answer customer question also Stock ends of the cashier and sweep the floors
good,"At Walmart, I worked as a Stocker and assisted customers with finding products.  I enjoyed helping customers find their desired products. Teaching a new employee how to stock and assist customers was another skill that I enjoyed."
good,This job can be stressful at times. Be prepared to deal with all kinds of attitudes customers. Management can sometimes be stressful to work with. To get hours u must have opening availability.
good,"Working at Walmart will get through college but I do not recommend working there full time. The company is way too involved in employee's work stlyes. They literally time you on everything, ad if you do not meet quota, you get fired. Its gnarly."
good,The people who work there are great. The company didn’t take care of their employees. The third shift was always understaffed and everyone had to work hard than the should of every day
good,"Walmart was a good Job, they’re willing to work with school schedules and that’s great. Most of my coworkers where friendly, and task where very easy and organized."
good,"The work environment was cool with a good crew to work with and a hard working manager! A week before X-Mas, we were given a $5 gift card and had hrs cut"
good,i wish i had a set work schedule working for walmart. Especially being a single parent. i know that you have to be fair and rotate to days and nights but its difficult for some.
good,"Walmart Canada it's a good company with proper benefits, but it's workplace environment is no fun. No one seems to enjoy their job and it shows. All people do is coming to work and complain. For this reason the managers need to force peolle to work and creates a hostile environment."
good,"Walmart is usually always hiring, especially around the holidays. They have benefits and their starting minimum is more than most other jobs (depending on state). Easily can transfer if you move."
good,"When I showed up the first night, the three person crew decided I should run the the floor sweeper. That machine would put the Y in Yawn, after about two weeks the supervisor said I was to qualified for that job and that he had something better for me to do. I started training with the forklift but nobody at my shift had the time to train me. One week after another of broken promises. So I left for better opportunities."
good,It's definitely a job that you would want if you have bills to pay. The hourly wage is ideal. The only issue I have is advancement in thus company is very slim and hours are very inconsistent. Other than that Wal-Mart is an awesome job to have.
good,I worked a afternoon shift. There wasn't really a flexible schedule for this position which sucked. At the time management was not that bad but things was a mess and stock was inconstant. job was easy just hot in the back and wasn't any fans really. The enjoyable part was my co workers and you get 1 hour lunch. and you aren't always in the back.
good,"At Walmart, you're always busy helping customers or stocking shelves. Benefits are great, but the hours given to employees seem to be constantly decreasing."
good,"Has a lot of impossible guidelines to follow it over all it’s a good company to work for, if you don’t have kids and you like to work a lot. Their very good at providing hours"
good,Walmart is a good company with great benefits. Walmart has great opportunities for management positions. Walmart values diversity & abides by their non discrimination policy. Walmart offers many different positions to best fit the desire of the individual.
good,"The Pharmacist and Techs were great to work with, they were welcoming and very helpful in the training process. We all worked as a team and communicated well."
good,"Always a need for every department.  Being able to work in other areas is a plus. Attendance guidelines are easy to follow and a bonus is offered each year,"
good,"Months and  days varies at Walmart for business, Walmart isn't at all like it used to be, it used to be all about the customers and family's, but now its all about the $$$$."
good,As you develop and grow the  opportunities becomes less available. The sacrifice will cause you to have less time with your family causing you to miss out on those special memories with your love ones.
good,Walmart is a fast place environment with lots of new things to learn everyday.  The associates you work with are like family and we work as a team.  Some managment can be real leaders and some need more experience but overall Walmart is a good place to learn many different skills.
good,This was a retail sales position for me. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the management. The vibe was always happy and to help through sales to make customers happy.
good,"I Am been working at Walmart for 11 years most of them were cards, but do to a physcial injury I moved to light but. However, I must find another job that fit my writing needs."
good,Great place to work. Great environment everyone was super friendly. It was a simple and easy job for me consider g I broke my back 6 years ago and i have asthma
good,I was the last person that the customer was going to interact with. Some customers would be very upset by the time they got to my register. But I didn't know what that person had had through that day. No matter what I treated everyone with respect. I made sure to greet them with a smile and tried to make sure they left with one too.
good,My only complaint was being put in an awkward position of asking customers for ID above what is usually required. I fully understand the need to requiring ID but I could not defend policy this store has.
good,I loved working at Walmart's pharmacy! The job keeps you on your feet both literally and figuratively. The people are wonderful and the pay is good. Job security sucks but overall I learned a lot and and have developed a great deal of skills that I can use to further my career
good,"This job started off really great! It was fast paced when was perfect for me.  I felt I was challenged enough and worked with great people. At this time I was pregnant and the 10 hour shifts weren’t working so well for me and I want able to cut back my hours, so unfortunately I left this establishment."
good,Stocking shelves in the chemical isle at the Mt. Juliet Walmart. Also I helped unload trucks and used pallet jack to move boxes out to the sales floor. Assist customers in finding products.
good,"I wouldn’t recommend working at Walmart. Mainly because of my experience but there are other locations, so it’s possible for other locations to b better."
good,In order to work at Walmart you have to have some thick skin. People will test you all day long. You have to learn to ignore. Other than that its a pretty enjoyable work place.
good,They could work on staffing more customers and helping them a lot better than what iv seen when I was working there and mangers need a better attitude towards co-workers
good,Walmart got the bills paid. However I was in school and they never tried to work with my school hours. Most of the managers talked about you behind your back and had favorites.
good,"From personal experience, the managers make it hard to come to work and enjoy it. They often make mistakes and will blame you for the directions they gave you. Promotions within the company usually come from who you know rather than the work that you put in. With all that being said, the checks are pretty decent, and the company does give you the opportunity to make good money. Walmart does offer flexible hours and the opportunity for well needed time off. You will make friends within the company (which will make the job less stressful), and that will be one of the things that will keep you there longer than you expect. Would I personally recommend Walmart as a job to someone? My answer would strongly depend on a few variables such as where the store is located and the managers that run said store."
good,"Things are constantly changing at Wal-Mart, sometimes too fast for my taste. I enjoy the people I work with. I have learned to be adaptable to change. The routine is set, but there are always bumps in the road to deal with."
good,I made a lot of friends there. It use to be a happy and fun place to work until they started changing there policies and they started cutting hours and some managers were pushing more work on our shoulders for little hours.
good,Honestly you have to have a certain mind set when working for Walmart. It’s honestly not meant for everyone. I worked there for years and hated it but others worked there longer than me and loved it. All I can say is do your best.
good,"Alta exigencia con falta de recursos, pero como empresa te capacita y prepara."
good,"Working for walmart its self was not bad. I loved my job and most of my co workers. The dress code, point system and pay were all pretty fair. What i didn't like about working at walmart is some management has too much authority go to their heads. Specifically at the Ottawa Illinois Wal-Mart. "
good,"Really flexible scheduling to meet school needs."
good,Walmart is a good place to work for if you want advancement in your work career. The company is changing and some of the changes don’t seem to good. I just want to try something different.
good,been working with Walmart for about 3 years now. easy to move up from one department to another. It's alright. Not somewhere I can stay for too long but it looks good on a resume
good,It's a fast pace environment that many won't be able to survive. Working there will teach you a lot of things about people. It's a place I'll recommend but not for a long period of time.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good company, but I just didn’t get enough hours when requested or days off when I requested for them, even when I first got hired when I was told to do it them. Cashier spot is difficult through management and customers but another spot would be a dream"
good,peaple there are nice and helpfull hand you always have something to do you stay busy most of the work shift its was a fun place to work for most needed money
good,"The job at Wal-Mart was hard work, but working in the frozen department we had a great team of keeping the frozen department stocked and then putting away any overstock."
good,Never minded the work or what had to be done. i just believe that if you have an employee that's willing to work 60-80 hour weeks then utilize them not suspend them when all others would rather go home. Workaholic at its best.
good,It’s a good work experience. Glad I got to work there as my first job and it’s very outgoing. Stressful but you get the hang of it. That’s how I became outgoing due to working there
good,Communication in the store between each individual manager lacked severely. Hardly ever on the same page. Everyone had their own way. Hourly associates worked together as a team. And helped each other
good,"come in and down stack pallets of freight, put them in buggy’s to work each isle, zone after done stocking "
good,working in Walmart was an good experience but the managers where horrible store manager was good but the other department managers was very childish and didn't like to be taught or told how to do something they didn't know and if you did tell them how to do something properly they will fire you like they did me they waited for a day i was drained physically-and wasn't working at my usual pace they knew what they were doing and they got away with it. I am not bashing Walmart there are good stores out there but just be aware of the Walmart located at centerville rd in Wilmington Delaware
good,"My issue is that not all store policies are adhered to. Working at customrr service, certain items have a return period such phones and laptops. Some customers a have learned which manager to go to get their way even though it is against store policy. Certain CSM will push the transaction and will not back up the associate."
good,Work was a fast paced environment with plenty of room to learn new things. Great co workers. However they did not respect the fact of life outside work including doctors appointments and new excepted doctors or hospital notes when those situations are out of your control they still held it against you. It was easy to get time off and the management was very one sided meaning they had favorite employees and made it well known who wasn't one of them.
good,It was a good job just barely got any raises in it was hard to get moved would of took few hours to get moved up in pay and position it was easy money and easy to pick up the responsibilities there
good,it was fine when I I first started working at Walmart and very good to me and I loved my management staff and the co-workers that worked with me but then they changed the manager and the store managers and department managers and it all changed and went down hill.   The only good thing about it was my fellow co-workers and my paid time off vacation pay and benefits
good,Walmart is a fun enjoyable place to work at because of the great customer service that is provided with the ability to move forward to different departments.
good,nice first job to know how to deal with customers and find out how to make them leave the store happy. if youre working in the back unloading the truck i dont think the pay is worth it but 11/hr for stocking isnt too bad.
good,I loved my job as a cashier at Walmart but the managers were rude and had no sympathy for even a new person that was learning. If it wasn't for the management team I think I would have spent my life working for Walmart.
good,"Working at Walmart had changed over the years. They are trying to restructure management and it’s become harder to please upper management. The atmosphere has changed from friendly to  not so friendly for those in any form of management. It can be a great place to work  for the flexibility of scheduling, benefits are good if you are full time."
good,"everyday was something new and crazier, never a dull day. coworkers were pretty cool as well.With all the crazy things going on it made me know how to handle situations."
good,"Good place to work at just need better management learned a lot how to provide customers with information they needed."
good,"I feel like working at Walmart is highly dependent on the location. For example, my store location was pretty well run and management was nice and helpful for the most part. It is a decent first/part time job. I was a part time cashier and didn’t mind it. There was always something to do and time always went by quickly since it was always busy on the days I works. They also give good breaks, a full hour for lunch+ 2 15 minute breaks if you work 8 hrs. However, my coworkers that worked there full time had many more complaints about the lack of benefits, low pay, etc. "
good,"the store always care for the management team, for normal associate"
good,It’s always busy at Walmart.  The customers was nice some off them. The managers was awesome. I learned how to keep myself calm in a situation where someone was angry. I learned that I can’t please everyone no matter how hard I try. I enjoyed talking with customers while taking care of them.
good,Great job for paid learning of skills for future reference. Unless you are looking to move up to management the only thing to expect is change. Learn and grow.
good,Walmart was interesting to work at. I met many people and having just a few minutes of a conversation with someone I could turn their day around. The pay wasn’t enough for my cost of living.
good,"It’s a paycheck nothing more , I’m looking for a company that respects their employees and that sure is not Walmart. I’ve had a lot of time at Walmart and been trough way to much ."
good,"It is a easy ,fast pace to work in.  The job title assigned to everyone ,is usually the job that are in titled to do. The hardest part of the job is when  other associates don’t want to complete their task/ job ,but everyone offered their help their co workers if they need it. The atmosphere is friendly."
good,If you walk in with a possitive outlook and as long as you put in the work you will be ok.     But if you are a slacker this ia not the place for you.
good,A typical work day was smooth. I learned a lot about interacting with people. Management was organized with Job specifications/duties. The Workplace culture was safe. Hardest part was customer service.
good,"My manager was very cool and relatable, made the hardest tasks and information I needed to know very simplistic and understandable. My coworkers were ready and willing to work"
good,Walmart is a good place to work they just need to work on how they treat their employees they pay good and they have good benefits if I didn’t have to quit I would stay
good,"Enjoy all aspects of the job and the employees. "
good,"Great place to work, alot of nice people there. i liked the fast pace of everything because i love staying busy. I enjoyed helping the customers as well any assicoates... It always kinda fast pace working in the back unloading the trucks. over all its a great company to start out with."
good,i liked workig for walmart  kept me on my toes with each day. always doing something different to learn other areas for future help in those areas. had a very unique pattern of customers.
good,"•	Maintain positive conduct, confer with customers by telephone or in person to provide information about products or services, take or enter orders, cancel accounts, or obtain details of complaints.    "
good,Walmart is a decent place to work for. There are a lot of different positions you can apply for. It's nice a place to work for because you get meet new people and see how your community is.
good,Work was the most physically demanding work I've ever done. If one case was missing or fell of pallet incentive bonuses were lost for the week. Mangers demanded associates stay longer than shift hours frequently
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with. The store was a very diverse workplace. I enjoyed that it was close to my home. They had a flexible schedule.
good,Walmart was fun but also very stressful because there was never enough staff. When i worked it was just me and the pharmacist on weekends so it was a bit stressful.
good,Most of my time with Walmart was rewarding. You could apply and transfer with a promotion and they would move you and pay for temporary housing. Cross training was the key.
good,Productive  and fast pace workplace with a team of leaders to help train you to complete all your tasks in a timely manner. Also a fun and family like environment.
good,It's job friendly and everyone there is nice and kind. The one thing I loved about working at walmart is you meet new people Wal-Mart have good thing to offer the employees
good,It’s a neighborhood Walmart I work at right now. So I can not really compare to a Supercenter. But it’s not bad to me so far. I don’t know everything about the company.
good,Empresa otima em crecimento  de envolvimento ao fucionarios
good,"Empresa estable con compañeros sociables, tiene oportunidad de crecimiento"
good,It was very scattered but fun to work at. I did a lot in different departments but all in all it was good. Management was ok. The hardest part is we are very understaffed.
good,Face paced and high standards. 3 or 4 day schedule. A few managers are easy to work with. They have all kinds of incentive programs and bonus to earn more money.
good,Walmart was a very good paying job that consisted of many tasks for you to do. Nothing was too much but you were busy very often. That’s always a good thing though.
good,Was an Okay place to work. To many clueless managers and being told 3 or 4 differents things to do with something because of lack of communication with managers.
good,Very stressful environment. Department Manager position is under paid equivalent to the tons of responsibilities they want you to do. Lack of manpower
good,"I loved working in the pharmacy at Walmart. Although the store management was often hard to deal with, the pharmacy management was excellent. We were giving opportunities for training and continuing education."
good,Very relaxed and independent. Good overtime options. Good pay rate and ability to raises. Option to venture outside of job requirements. Very little sick days and unexcused by doctors note.
good,I did not like the management team their. Work conditions was really taxing and tiring. It was a part time job that got me through high school and my first semester of college.
good,"El trabajo es algo estable, ya que dependiendo del walmart, el gerente cambia y por consiguiente la organizacion. El horario algunos managers me lo respetaron otros no. El salario es un poco bajo pero para, un estudiante, esta bien. Walmart tratra de ahorrar dinero lo mas que puedo y devido a esto y en algunos casos abusan del trabajador. En el area de OGP, mi manager trabaja mas como jefe que como lider, no me agrada el echo de que no se mueva y solo da ordenes. A pesar de que walmart tiene sus lados malos, tambien otorga prestaciones a sus empleados como seguro medico, dental y educacion en los colleges que walmart esta asociado. El walmart en donde trabajo siempre nos otorga donas los dias viernes. Es una sensacion de amor odio, porque no puedo descar lo suficiente, ya que paso mas de 7 horas parado y solo logro descansar un aproximado de 35 min en toda mi jornada laboral."
good,most days there is either one or more customers that come into the store with attitudes or get an attitude during their experience with walmart while in the store and its our job as employees to make it right.
good,"There is always something to do. Management isn't always helpful or knowledgable but answers can be found. Most of the people that work there are hard working, fun, kind people."
good,"It's an interesting place to work.  Management is pretty well structured and organized.  The job itself though is near all-consuming.  At least what I did was.  We were required to unload trucks, stock aisles, clean the back room, and sort through clothes as well as loose items referred to as ""breakpacks"".  All within an 8 hour time frame."
good,"I found Walmart a very interesting place in terms of salary and overtime hours. But Walmart doesn’t stand as one organization and their structures are very complex. Even they didn’t consider the experience of 1 dc in other dc. As like, someone has a good designation at 1dc and after getting transfer, which is a very hard thing, if fortunately someone got transfer into other dc, they’ll have to start from zero or starting position again. The management have a open door policy but it is not supportive for immigrants."
good,I Worked with a lot of great hard working people. Great managers and costumer.  The hardest part of work was the stocking. We did get free donuts.  I learned a lot about customer services.
good,"As a cashier, i rang tese up all day. it got pretty redundant but thats the job. the staff was friendly, although some of the managers were hard to work with and came off rude. You could get fired for the smallest things here so be careful"
good,"I love my coworkers and my management team. Us old schoolers who have been there for 5 plus years stuck together like one big dysfunctional happy family. I miss them all. I have learned throughout the years that management has favorites and if you aren't part of ""the click"" then you better watch your back. Thank goodness that wasn't the case for me! And if any employee went to corporate for an issue or problem within that store..WATCH OUT! The management team amongst other high end employees will retaliate!!"
good,"A typical Day is usually on the lighter/slow side in the mornings, around noon people really start coming in and then by dinner time it either gets steady or busy. Very nice employees and managers, everyone communicates well. The workplace is pretty easy and relaxed if you know what you're doing."
good,"You won’t move up in there unless they like you. Everything is based off favoritism. If you aren’t a manager, assistant, supervisor, you don’t matter."
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience when I was younger. I was able to balance work and home life, however weekends are a must, so I rarely got to spend the weekend with my family. Benefits did include a shopping discount, Retirement plan, medical insurance, and room to grow within the company."
good,Go to work and work don't talk to anyone. Walmart is a company so people only care bout themselves. Just do your job and as your told nothing more and nothing less.
good,"Working at Walmart is not really all that terrible but depending what department you are in you can run into things that make it dreadful to come to work. Besides some of the older associates, I have to say that most associates I come across describe it as ""just a job"". A typical day at work for me is never knowing when I will get to go home for the day. I am a personal shopper and we are very very busy at my store so I will come in at 4 am and sometimes not get off until 4 or 5  in the afternoon. I can't make plans due to this and it is honestly EXHAUSTING. But when I was a cashier, life was a breeze. I had my share of difficult customers but I always remained kind and tried to be understanding. When customers would ask where stuff is, I have never been one to tell them ""this isn't my department so I do not know"". Just help them find it instead of being a lazy bum. It is incredibly hard to find associates in there (not so much since online grocery started since we are ALWAYS out on the floor) so JUST HELP THEM. You can literally look up the item on the Walmart app and it often gives a location. Also, just learn where stuff is in your store. The culture is a kind of like high school honestly. Everyone forms groups of people they like to hang out with. I would assume this happens anywhere. Management is practically useless because you can never find them but some departments are easier to find managers in such as Produce and Meat. Forget about the regular grocery aisles though. The most enjoyable part is honestly going home and knowing you have an off day.  But everyone is different"
good,"The people in charge of Walmart continued to find ways to cheat people out of good raises. When the new people would get raises, the old associates would not get a penny. People that had been there for years would shorty be the same as a new associate."
good,"The pays not bad I mean some factories pay less and work harder, sure it's not the greatest job but it's also pretty alright management can be a little eh but overall wouldn't mind working there again"
good,"The job pay is great, but advancement is based on who you know. It suppose to be based on skills and quality of work, but definitely is not the case. I have a total of 7 years with Walmart and never was given an advancement opportunity, eventhough I Passed the supervisory assessment test. They need to train their employees better because they don't provide enough safety train when switching positions or training."
good,"The job is really easy as long as you do what your suppose to do and stay on task. It can also get stressful at times, but on the most part it is a calm environment."
good,"Process and label new freight, cap bins from freezers and coolers that are to be stocked on floor, stock freight, customer value program process, ( pull products that need to be discounted and sold for that day), as well as pull outdated customer value program product and donate or dispose of. Set new modes, displays and section work as needed. Bin overstock product back into freezers and coolers of all Fresh Departments assigned daily - and keep organized. Also, fill in for Bakery/Deli departments when requested. Work with management and assist fellow associates on daily tasks."
good,"relaxed atmosphere, easy going, people. I learned that a lot of customers will ask for help just to talk to someone. the hardest part of the job was having to return random items to the right shelves. customers are lazy and just leave items anywhere. the best part of the job was that there was no stress or drama."
good,"The company is amazing to work for, the break down comes with different markets doing their own thing. The advancement opportunities are endless you can literally do anything in this company"
good,"I worked here about a year and a half while I was in college and enjoyed it for the most part. I met some great coworkers, most management was friendly, and I learned my job very well. I worked second shift which was a bummer at times, due to the hours. Since my team was always low on people, you could always pick up hours if you wanted and work full time. After a while though, the job felt robotic, doing the same thing everyday. I liked being in one touch the most since I could work on my own, though it's very physical work and a lot of continuous lifting and pulling carts & pallets. Being on the truck line and stocking freight is okay, but the supervisors really get on you about time limits and getting things done. It's difficult when you don't have the people, but they have the same expectations no  matter what. I wanted to switch positions, but could never get off that team, which is the reason I left. It's difficult to leave cap 2 and hard to move up, even if you're a good worker. The hardest part of the job was basically the physical stress of keeping up."
good,I worked here for @10 years. Through it I was a customer service manager and a department manager. Working both nights and days. I worked at a smaller family like Walmart. The only problem was advancement within the company.
good,"I was able to go to school and work here at the same time. They allowed me to work part time and if I needed to leave early, I was allowed to do so if I planned in advance."
good,"If you consider the Job responsibility and workload, salary is not even decent for the hourly associates. Otherwise, pretty good place to work. Culture is good, management is good other than salary as well."
good,Honestly I enjoyed my time at Walmart in the beginning. Then my favorite manager left and everything went down hill. My off days got switched around and because of that I never got to see my boyfriend! I didn’t have my own life anymore Walmart consumed it! Then I put in to get my points taken off because of a (work related) injury and they still denied taking my points off! I’m still paying for the drs today! I also may need surgery! My managers and store managers where amazing but honestly Walmart itself isn’t a place I would want to work for! I seems good because of the competitive pay but I stood there 8-9 hours a day in one spot! Everyone hates the self checkout host! I also had to take on csm  responsibilities when I wasn’t one! I tried to move up to become a csm and I couldn’t even do that because of my injury! The system of Walmart is messed up and they don’t take time to understand hourly associates. They assume the store managers can handle that but they have to much on their plate as well! It’s just a very stressful job all together!
good,"Fast paced team environment with emphasis on routines and goals. If you are a routine-based person who enjoys working in a fast paced environment and working hard every single day, this is the place for you."
good,"The work was easy and the manager's were fun and relaxed, but the downside is that it was stressful still. Another downside was that the mangers weren't helpful with working with my shedule."
good,"Maravilhoso lugar para se trabalhar, porém o valor salarial não compensativo."
good,Ok place to work for but things have changed so fast the last couple years that make it not worth more then a part time job. Not worth trying to move up in the company anymore.
good,Empresa sempre teve a cultura americana muito forte. Pouco adaptabilidade à cultura local.
good,"Must unload shipment in under two hours or less. Constantly getting tasks done such as: "
good,I stayed busy until lunch and when I got back it was back to being busy. The people who work around you will help you if it gets too bad. The schedule can be adjusted to work around your busy life.
good,Walmart was a good job for me I loved it except management they were rude and talked to you dumb they need to work on their attitudes. I get they’re stressed and busy all day but so are the coworkers.
good,"they have a ping pong table and video games to play, with a 15 min break and a 10 min break no time to use in fact I have never been in that room, I see it thru a glass window."
good,"I had a great experience with my co-workers and the customers. Management left a little to be desired but all in all, it was okay. None of my co-workers were ever rude."
good,"I had a GREAT time working at Wal-Mart I set up the store when it first opened, it tought me alot  like planograms and teamwork and hard work pays off. Loved it and would do it again."
good,I like working at Walmart because you other people & make friends. The only thing I quit working there is because of a sexual situations. Things very reasonable
good,Store manager and up does not help promote team work with all associates and all store. By working together you could get a lot more completed and have top management and upper management have others giving out the wrong info and than you having to redo the same thing over again when it could have been completed right the first time. All associates should be treated the same but this is not being done throughout the company.
good,clock is and then be assigned to a register hoping you can find a CSM near by. Once there at the register make sure that everything you need is well stocked. during the course of the day you may see management once in a while looking at the ends of the features set out to change them.
good,Inventory and stock merchandise. 
good,"You will either love it or hate it. If you have an outgoing personality, love people this a place for you. You will get breaks 15 and hour lunch if you work 8hrs a shift."
good,"all my past manager and supervisor are great,ive learned a lot from Walmart,they alawyas open to help and listen from my opinion, they trust me the way im working."
good,Walmart is a great company to work for it’s just not the field I want to work in. I love working with cars and although Walmart pays well the hours and job aren’t for me
good,Management is great. Everything else is horrible. Hours are not Based on ur availability. The point system they have is horrible especially if they don’t work with you. The pay is alright but not enough to live off of it.
good,"A typical day in Walmart leaves you feeling accomplished; there is always an associate or a customer looking for direction and guidance, and I'm happy to share my knowledge with them. I've learned much over the years about what ""issues"" to ""tour"" for. Ironically the hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is the problem solving aspect."
good,Some people here were very good people and really nice. they knew what they were doing and they even knew the whole store and where everything was located so that helped me find everything i needed help with when i needed to help customers find certain things.
good,"é um ambiente muito agradável, você terá um ótimo apoio das equipes, ruim é que você não terá um tempo de lazer com sua família."
good,...depending on what store you're at. Some stores run fairly smoothly with proper staffing and an open minded management team. Other stores don't do so well. Mismanaged time and priorities are Walmart's major areas for improvement.
good,"not horrible. The new manager just doesnt seem to really care about the store as a whole so no one is really moitivated to work under him anymore"
good,"Average place to work, advancement is easy for those who really want it. Benefits are quite good. Management is pretty good, though of course some need better training."
good,Walmart is a stupid job and its not all about family like they say and they dont even give you the position that you work hard for and they make you believe that your gunna get the position and they dont give it to you.
good,I really enjoyed working for Walmart. it was a fun and easy job but my availability and their path of advancement didn't align so if you plan on working there make sure you can open every day up for work if you want to move up.
good,"cant say Walmart is a bad place to work, it just depends on the person and situation.  Overall their benefits are good for full time employees, wages aren't too bad, but the part time employee is somewhat overlooked as an asset."
good,"Walmart was an interest company to work for. I like to always be honest in my reviews. That being said, Mixed. I believe they are improving but at a snails crawl on purpose because honestly they don't care and seem to have terrible trouble even pretending to. There getting better. I think!"
good,Stay aware of surroundings and makes sure you do your job to the best of your ability. Ask others for help if you don’t remember how to do your job. Because you not knowing doesn’t hurt them but hurts you.
good,"Walmart is an enjoyable place to work because of its employees. As an assistant manager, my favorite part is teaching and training. I also enjoy working with them when they need help which they love. Creates their positive attitudes and ambitions."
good,"Empresa está passando por reformulações, para melhorar sua atual situação."
good,A good place to work if you looking for a start. But it is easily to get fired from there also. No real job secure. You have to really have a certain availability to work there.
good,Managers do not hold all employees to the same standards and are very laxative with their favorite employees. I worked very hard every day but advancement was given to the least qualified person.
good,"You started of your day by getting your work assignment and work area.While being employed here I learned a lot about logistics. The management team was fun to work, they real did try to set you up to make your numbers. Most enjoyable part of the job is all the friends that have made over the years."
good,it was horrible but you made decent money if you were in management. okay coworkers but upper management sucked. defiantly not a permanent work place.
good,"Walmart has great benefits for their employees, people are friendly, and they take care of breaks fantastically. Wonderful when busy but quite a bust when not."
good,"Learned alot of skills on the Lube and tire sides of the shop,great manager.Also learned the importance of being a team player.Always striving to be #1 in customer satisfaction."
good,"This is a great job for youth, slow paced environment with plenty to do.  Hardest part of the job is the call out penalties.  Wal-Mart seems to forget things happen, and sometimes out of ones control."
good,"I love my coworkers and my job for the most part.   Walmart spends more time worrying about their bottom line than how working conditions are affecting its employees.   Management isn’t very concerned about employee complaints or issues.i have been given the opportunity to learn many new things and ideas, some of which are good in theory but not so good in practice."
good,"Assist customers"
good,"Customer service upon customer service where I learned that no matter what the bigger the company the bigger the profit. My Management team here was one of the best teams I have had the pleasure to work with it's just to bad it was for Walmart."
good,"My experience working for Walmart was not that good. Indeed, it was very easy job but it was also very stressful. There weren't that many people in my department. Which caused me to be alone to do the work most of the time. I was always asked to work in other departments, because there never enough people to help in certain departments. All while trying to do my work in my department. My hours were constantly getting cut. I've had 7 hours for just the week alone, which is not enough to survive off of. I wasn't even full-time, i was part-time. Very good company, but the management no so good."
good,Empresa con proyecciones y apoyo para ejercer fácilmente cumplimiento legal
good,"- amazing staff to work with and the culture of the store was very welcoming "
good,"Expectations include mentorship of associates, communications with customers on project status and management of budget."
good,"I really enjoy the type of work and my coworkers. Corporate can be very demanding when they come, which fortunately isn't that often. What really makes me angry is that Walmart is phasing in new job duties for pharmacy technicians which include blood testing and eventually giving vaccinations. I never wanted to do this kind of work as I have a fear of blood. However I like my job enough that I will stay until I get fired. If this happens, I plan on filing charges of discrimination on the basis of a disability."
good,Working at Walmart showed me how companys worked. Working was a experience and it showed me how different work environments could be. This changed how I see the company.
good,I worked at customer service and managed to get customers out of the way within a good time period didn’t want other customers waiting for long. Cleaned my area make sure area was organized and also did take backs and got carts was also pregnant at the time too
good,"This is not an easy place to work, you must adapt to environment, especially if you work in the cold.  You have to work hard to meet production standards and sometimes there is a lot of favoritism."
good,When I worked there they made me not work for 2 weeks twice because of them fixing people shifts. Also kept resigning me to different work stations and even when I told them I didn't never want to be reassigned to anything else!!!
good,A typical day at work i walk in clock in and go the front end and load my bags on my register and get my jur and count it. I learned with an Employee how to do the lbs/ amount and enter give you the right total of lbs when counting fruits or vegtables by lbs. The Management here is great there always there when you need them. The work place is mostly cleaned all day and organized. The hardest part of the job is Customer Service you can not make all customers happy but you can always try withba Smile. My Enjoyable moment of the job for me is when my Customers ask for me by my name and if im not there they will leave and come back and say hi and ask how i am they made me feel like family and that is what made me come to work. I would work here if you have patiance to work with the public and others and can do Customer Service. I did my job to the fulliest and got Rewarded by the Ceo of Walmart for all my hard work i did as a great Cashier for Walmart for 5 years i reccomened this job anytime. I also helped customers online to do orders sent to their home and got alot of buttons for my jacket at Walmart to show my apprication to help cuatomers at all times where evervi am in that store. Just Remember when a customer needs help and so does another one at the same time help the first one and then tell the other customer nicely ill be right with you when im done with them okey Thank you for waiting.  Just treat a customer like you would treat your family.
good,"Work was hard but do-able. Only time managers checked on cart pushers was when it was busy and we were struggling. Hours were really crazy and some employees were rude, but some employees were really great and helpful. Never really spoke to managers."
good,"Fun place to work"
good,Walmart was a great place to find your first job as a student. I enjoyed working there and am happy to have this job experience. The managers were all excellent and easy to approach.
good,The people are nice and the work will make you sweat if you're not used too it. The management is competative. I've learned to be more organized and how to interact with customers an a professional level.
good,"All of the changes seem to be coming from a group of surveyed associates. But I dont know how that is possible. So,e of these changes seem to not benefit the employees."
good,good job right after hgh school. not a long term place to be . management i had was super friendly and eazy to work with . gave me a chace to put myself out there and thats how i found out i liked being out there talking to people
good,"very busy store through out the week fun place to work and friendly employees from different backgrounds and happy customers, understanding supervisors"
good,"A typical day at work was drama filled. I learned to just go with the flow. Management was poor. We never knew when we did well, we only knew the negative things we had done. The workplace was very unfit, but it was some people (as in myself) who could brighten the day."
good,"I work overnights because I don’t do well with customers, and since I started working my 10pm - 7am shift, I have gotten sick more times than usual in the past years of my life."
good,"Hard working,loyal employees,safe work area,awesome staff. I learned be yourself and hard working make u awesome person and good dependable employee. I always come work on time. Unless i was sick or family illness"
good,I typical day at Walmart I would start out by cleaning my station make sure my trash as were empty greeting each customer I see I would start by making sure my register was checked on to me then handle each transaction that comes to me. They were very Lenient when it came to clothing and hairstyles
good,"Working at walmart was fun they even worked around my school and everything, it was great while it lasted. Only problem is when I started college my hours got cut."
good,I loved the benefits and bonuses  plus the stock share. Some managers was nice and understanding. Some take Advantage of their title.  Overall Walmart is a good company I work for
good,"The people i worked with was good. Just the management was something else, like the store manager stalked me all day when i was doing my job and was uncomfortable."
good,"There are pros and cons and it all depends on which Walmart you work in. A lot of the time management sucks and the customers in Walmart are even worse. However, we do get a 401k and a discount card for 10% off the whole store and Walmart.com purchases."
good,Money was decent. Job was stressful due to lack of good management but I made it work. Loved the pay and benefits. Great experience and overall pretty good job
good,"Looked forward to going to work everyday because of the great people that work there, you truly do become like family. It is a fast paced and at times stressful however worth it for me at the time."
good,Retail experience here unfortunately not a lot of on hands training it’s all on the computer.ability to move to different areas of the store as well as cross training
good,"It is very fast paced. The front end needed to be ran better by the head supervisor. I did my part as a CSM, but I can only do so much with what I had"
good,I realize it could be just my store but the management there was lacking. I had some problems with a employee harassing me and just being down right rude and they did nothing in there power to stop her. I went to my manger a couple of times then I went to another manger and got the same results. They finally decided to do something when I went to HR and talked to them. Then there has been a couple of problems with a manger that didn't like me so she was very rude to me and a couple of other girls that worked there. I enjoyed it the most when I worked up front as a cashier.
good,"If you don't have patience don't work here or just work in the back because management, customers and fellow associates will test you everyday, you basically get hit from every angle. but the benefits are good if you can make full time."
good,when you come in go to your work station and start  your work for the day. the thing I like the most about my job is helping the customers. my managers were very helpful and cheerful.
good,"Loved working with my other co-workers. They made the job fun. Management wasn't too bad, could be stuck up over stupid stuff. Lunch breaks were an hour long, but unpaid, however you were able to leave the premises if you wanted. Discounts were given to employees on food and non edible essentials."
good,Management can make completing the job challenging. Running around getting groceries for people is the best part of the job. I have managed to learn multiple new skills however.
good,Well Sam's is really a place to find out who you are as a person and it can be stressful but anywhere you go can get stressful but if you just do the best you can you'll be good
good,I never had any trouble because I always did my job and then some and never complained and enjoyed helping people. Everyone was nice. They had a nice break room.
good,"Sometimes it can be pretty stressful because you have to cash people out quickly and accurately, but I've learned to deal with that better now than when I first started. Sometimes because of long lines, people will try to sneak into your line even when you are closed so be prepared for that! I enjoy interacting with the customers and I think that the most rewarding part of the job is making the customer feel at ease while you are cashing them out."
good,"i was a cashier at a busy store and the lines would never stop lol i had to beg my manager for morning shifts, and they would have us work in other areas of the store"
good,Employees are nice to work with. The job itself is fast paced and a job that has deadlines. Overall it is not a bad place to work and you will learn customer service and communication very fast.
good,Interacting with customers translates to interpersonal skills; most job categories require some level of customer care or interaction with colleagues.
good,"I learned a lot about food, whats good quality vs bad quality what food looks when its going bad, and what the best brands. The most enjoyable part of my day was costumer service"
good,All about production do the same thing everyday it gets very repetitive. Breaks are annoying because shortened by 5 min walk to break room. Job is easy but fast paced.
good,"Fun workplace when everyone follows correct process."
good,The people that I've worked with are amazing and friendly people. Was definitely the environment of a second family. Though management at Walmart is extremely poor. Rarely does a claim get taken seriously nor your availability for the job.
good,During my time there lack of communication between supervisors and managers lead to stressful work place for associates. Work pace was set at a rat of 120 PC's and hour very exhausting
good,Overworked and underpaid for the amount of freight coming in daily. Need more workers. Lots of physical exercise. Supervisors are very nice and also my co-workers.
good,Random 2 week schedules are the worst system I have ever experienced. Not knowing when you'll be off next month for instance is very irritating. I also often had non consecutive days off which are miserable. I worked in the garden center under a good department manager. My work in my department was good. The quality of department managers vary. They determine how comfortable and productive your time at Walmart is.
good,"A typical work day was assisting customers and ringing them out. "
good,"It was a fairly good job. The management wasn’t the best, but I learned things working there. Overall I don’t regret working at Walmart, and I would like to work there again in the future."
good,"In a non climate control warehouse you need to stay hydrated. Some managers are fair, others don’t care if you like your job or not. You’re there to make production and numbers and they don’t care to hear your excuses. There’s always new policies being made that you are unaware of until the last minute. Forget asking for time off, they go by seniority. It’s either kill or be killed with this company and the turnover rate is extremely HIGH!! Senior associates are unhappy and they don’t care for change. They really do go by the good ole boy system. If you’re not afraid of hard work and being criticized then this is the job for you. Give 150% and they’ll want 200% from you. Good luck if you decide to work for someone who addresses you as a number and not a person!! Felt like I was an inmate most of the time and not an employee. Follow the line, be prepared to be timed on your break and pray there’s not a long line for the bathroom."
good,management isn't for the employee good place to work but they don't look out for other. too many changes within the company benefits not good  need raise for the amount of work we do
good,"Worked with friendly people. Cross trained in multiple postions and was open to multiple options. Managment was fair, some good some bad. Hardest part would be rude customers."
good,Great opportunity to advance or move into various roles throughout the store. Supportive experienced associates willing to train and teach you. Culture dependant upon store manager. Salary is low for department managers considering all that they do.
good,A day at Walmart Pharmacy was busy.  You had to put out the order when it arrived.  You have to go thru the medications to check for out of dates.  You helped with insurance problems when needed.  You helped fill prescriptions when needed.
good,"the place i work in has good and bad managers and has its good and bad days so i would not say that the job is top or anything but it was fine for an entry level job if you are going to college or are planning something bigger than the job is fine. "
good,good job but I was forced to transfer 3 hours and 15 min. from home and I was not going to relocate ' I tried to drive but it was to hard to drive that far to work.
good,"i would help people with there grocery and bagging them for them. cleaning and stocking shelves, helped customers who need extra care, i leaned the self checkout at walmart i tell you not a lot a peaple like them at all. the people you work with are nice and fun, so night there is a lot of laugher and good times. the hardest part of the job is christmas time and not having all the cashes opened, that is streefull"
good,It is a very busy place to work fast pace and there are a lot of things you have to deal with. Management is a chance thing I like most of my managers some not as much. They no longer offer overtime which is not a good thing in my opinion.
good,Working in the Pharmacy is pretty nice. You don't have to deal with all the crazy customers. But we do get some crazy customers that want their meds fast. i liked it overall
good,i been given the 40 plus hours but im getting paid as part time not full time worker pay rate. it is productive work place. I enjoy the working there. ive learn a lot there. certain management wasn't good at all
good,"The Walmart I work at has very friendly management. It is very fast paced, which I like. I would have no complaints with the job of it wasn't for lack of help by other employees and being scheduled alone constantly to run the entire deli. I do not believe that I am compensated properly for my job performance.They also have recently change their paid time off policy, which is absolutely ridiculous. I am able to gain 1 hour of paid time of per 41.5 hours worked. The job could be great if it had better vacation pay and more employees willing to actually work."
good,"If you can keep on your toes at all time and reach your scan minimum of 1,000 items an hour, it's a nice place to work. You can make friends with your fellow employees and customers alike."
good,"the store is very busy, I worked at the beach on Hallandale beach blvd. learn customer service and pleasing the customers. the hardest part of the Walmart was pleasing the customer and following the policy."
good,"I liked working at Wal-Mart with the employees. Over all it was an okay place to work. However, upper management could have used a little more help. They did not respond to customer service calls with a sense of urgency. They expected way too much of an employee in one day. Did not want to give certain departments enough help."
good,"Walmart is a great way to start your career path, it is very considerate of your outside obligations and  great paying job , especially if you're in college."
good,belle esprit d'équipe. belle complicité autant avec les gérant que les employés
good,They have a lot of opportunities in many different departments from stocking to cash to food prep to management to driving trucks if you want. The people are mostly friendly and willing to help whenever they can.
good,No tip u have to work hard to get what u want but that but I'm ok even my boss told me to apply with in 30 days but I think I'm good  and also I like my job and my boss even like me the way I work but sometimes I really like my job but sometimes not
good,Wal-Mart can be a good place to work.  Management needs to be more cooperative and understanding of its employees and their needs.  This company needs to hire more full time employees rather than install self checkouts.
good,I've been working at Walmart for about three years and i never had an issue that couldn't get fix. Management is always there when you need them. With me being in school they are excellent in making sure my hours can work around my school schedule. When things need to be done its always a team effort. Everyone is friendly and are great people to get along with
good,its an ok company to work for especially if its a first time job for somepeople. the most enjoyable time is communicating with people that you never met.
good,I have done almost every  job and advanced in walmart. However some of the upper mangagement is not inclined to work with individuals with hearing impairment. As well as they perfer to use intimidation as a tactic.
good,"good pay good benefits,management was terrible they change your schedule often wich its bad, orientation its bad they don't prepare you its like they prepare you for failure they have a lot of preferitism"
good,"Walmart is a big corporate company, seems as though everything changes from day to day, sometimes hard to keep up with, but always seem to learn something new everyday. Management was willing to help out as much as they could"
good,"Équipe souriante, On ne manque pas de travail donc les journées passe plutôt vite."
good,"I would have had better reviews, but there has been some recent changes to the company that are making it really hard on all of the employees. There is some opportunity to move up in the company. But there are so many changes in the company that they are calling good, but are cutting jobs and making working conditions stressful with a very rigorous point system."
good,"take certain items and stack them on pallets"
good,Honestly sometimes you would frustrated because you’d do the most work but you’ll still get treated poorly  especially in the front end. You deal with the most bs up there for no reason it’s actually dumb.
good,This company is a company that ive done business with in the past as well as worked for. My experience there was pretty positive and I learned a lot while there.
good,Walmart has lots of room to grow in the business.. lots of different fields of work that will for you and what your looking for. Great benefits and lots of friendly people.
good,"I worked at the Altavista, VA Walmart for almost 2 years. It was nearly always busy in the 4 different departments I worked it. "
good,The job is very fast paced and stressful. Management team could use some work but overall its not terrible. The benefits Walmart gives you are great but the pay does seem a little lack luster considering when you go into the management field. The responsibilities out weight the pay most days. The experience as a whole had been fun and a great experience but I like to try new things and work a little more closely to the field I enjoy.
good,It a place u can move up in position and also a good place to meet new people and also good customers so I’ll say overall it a good place to work in I would say
good,"A job like most others. Great benefits and stock options, and lots of potential for growth. Managment is lacking, at least at the store I worked in, but not the worst place to work."
good,They work with you but speed is important and moving at all times they won't allow you to be lazy some times they have gaps in management and you have to think on your own.
good,How well you did depended on popularity and who you were favored by. If you work hard you are normally recognized. The work is never TOO hard or beyond your means. They also usually favor promoting in store rather than out of store most the time.
good,"Doing the work at the job was very easy just tiring when throwing the truck but that was my favorite part of the job , I just feel if they had fair management at the one I was at I’d still have my job"
good,I enjoy working there just that I don’t get many hours and it’s hard trying to live off of how many hours they give me without overtime . Sometimes feels like they don’t care about the employees
good,"Walmart is a very good place to work, but they do need to offer more pay and do better with the hours of how they do the schedule. Overall, this a place I would love to remain at cause they do believe in promoting they staff and as long as your doing your job it can be a really fun place to work."
good,Walmart is a very beneficial job. The job pays well and they allow several benifits however they are unprofessional and the management is ran terribly.
good,"Typical day is just getting the pallets you needed to stock for the aisle or department you were assigned that night. I learned good stocking habits and organization from here. Management was a bit tough at times but that was because the district manager was a stuck up know-it-all that thought everything we were doing is easy and should be able to keep up with the ludicrous demands he put on us. The hardest part was when you were put in a new department or aisle and was pretty much forced to learn on your own where everything went AND dealing with the department manager when you couldn't, even though you never work there before and had no idea where things should go. Best part were some of the people you worked with they were caring, funny, and chill."
good,"Once you get through all the training (there's a lot), You clock in, either up front or in the back, and then make your way up front near a desk. A CSM will place you at a register. There are many things to learn when it comes to working as a cashier, such as using the computers, which updates frequently or bagging efficiently, taking the unwanted item into the returns area, etc. All the associates are very friendly and helpful. When you have an experience with an unpleasant customer (which will happen), they are understanding and try their best to help. The hardest part was learning how to use the computer system properly. The most enjoyable part was the associates and the nice customers."
good,i enjoyed the work environment. it had a diversity of people and the job was fun. I liked the different skills and job opportunities that walmart providied.
good,"Every store is different, and each has its pros and cons. In a large supercenter, your average work week will be at least 50 hours, and in most instances it will be more than that."
good,day started on a run and ended on a run.  great people to work with when there was people scheduled to work.  hardest part was getting caught up with the back stock.
good,"just basic warehouse work.  you went in and did your job.  people worked together pretty well to get things done.  management was willing to actually ""work"" with you when we were short handed.  overall, it was a pretty decent job in hindsight"
good,They arent really a family oriented company when they fire you for taking time to see your sick or hurt family members and hurt ur hrs when your sick.
good,Walmart allows advancement based on work performance which allows you move up through the company. Walmart allows you to learn any position in the store and allows you to move around throughout the store to gain experience. Since it is retail be prepared to work various hours and shifts. The people make the job well worth it. Biggest downfall at Walmart is that your hours are not guaranteed and you can expect your hours to diminish based on current sales. Also Walmart is constantly restructuring which can make your position obsolete without notice.
good,"The Associates are fantastic. The teamwork is phenomenal.  There are different challenges each day, and in most positions, never a dull moment.  It was convenient to buy virtually anything needed before/after shift."
good,"unload trucks, inventory, operated pallet jacks and power jacks and walker stacker and fork lift and telezon gun. Helped customers helped build new stores."
good,Walmart is a great place to work as long as you stay in your position lane. Advancement is an opportunity however do not get your hopes up. More times than not they express how you will move up but actually don't. I do enjoy working here as long as the associates would actually care for their position. Many of the associates are young and or first time job holders and it shows.
good,Walmart follows the format of taking care of customers and the associates alike.  Management is often forced to take up the slack of many that are not present for work or those who hours are cut significantly.
good,"Walmart does not except doctors notes, there policys are not for everyone. If you have the flu or/and neumoa  still must come to work and don't hurt yourself or can't walk or stand hardly, hope you don't need to be under doctor's care ,still have to come to work can't mess that many days."
good,"What I like most about my job is to be able to talk to many people from different cultures, in the short time that I worked in this company I learned how to be able to handle different people."
good,was too far to drive for not enough hours I would drive 60 miles round trip only to be told I was not needed for the day and that I could go home that seemed like a waste of my time and fuel.
good,break room was nice management sucks but the place is nice overall. pay as well. the people that work there are kind of messy as well so it makes the environment unpleasant.
good,"The pay was nice, walmart tends to screw people over a lot but for the most part its easy to make friends with your coworkers the discount card is nice, theyve changed everything. The more you work the more pto you get so you work x hours and you receive 1 hour pto."
good,"I worked third shift in the frozen and dairy department. It required running the carts from the coolers out to the floor, and putting everything away in a timely manner. We were also responsible for rotating and checking for old and new stock already on the floor. Customer service skills is of course a requirement as well."
good,The company benefits outways anything the company has to offer.  Some of the hours have changed and are more of a work-life balance than when I currently worked for them. Being a manager at the time I was with them was very stressful. High demands and expectations which sometimes made you feel as though you were set up for failure
good,"In  the deli, my coworkers were rude to other associates and to the customers. The associates, managers, and assistant managers were all judgmental. Wouldn't recommend working deli, but cashier, apparel, cap 1 or 2, they are all great departments."
good,"very stressfull if you dont have a good store manager"
good,Walmart is a good job for young adults who need easy money with no experience required. The only downside is poor management and bad policies that have a negative effect on employees.
good,"Working at Walmart was the worst experience EVER. Primarily,due to my position. The working conditions felt like modern-day slavery. Lack of staff and proper materials made the job more difficult than needed."
good,"Okay place to work but often times get treated poorly by customers and even management.  "
good,"steady work pace"
good,"The work is to be expected, However the current management team lacks communication skills and are very unprofessional. I use to love working for walmart but now its just another job. The actually work environment is enjoyable on some days and others it is very hostile."
good,Walmart is a great place to get some customer service experience. It has many friendly co-workers and can be a fun workplace. It has good hours (even though they can sometimes be long).
good,"You gotta be physically fit,good endurance..constantly moving at ah fast paste, frm beginning to end..you go frm one rm at 65degrees to another at 34degrees, then to one thats -30..So basically,after you leave the1st rm, your clothes gne be wet frm sweating and whn you hit da nxt rms and dat cold air hit you,while you wet...chances are, you going to get sick"
good,Walmart has it good and bad. It doesn't really help you when you have a family you just have to suck it up and do your job and maybe get to see you kids.
good,It was a good wprk envoronment but not enough compensation for the type of work that was assigned. I recieved aa decent amount of days of per week. i worked at least fourty hours.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work for because of my coworkers, it was hard at sometimes because management did not always want to assist you or the customers. It was a hard place to move up in because everyone that worked at Walmart has been there for I was born."
good,"A typical day at work would be me going to my work area, zoning everything, helping the customers, dealing with rude customers, and rude workers. I learned a lot about the customer service of a retail job."
good,Unless you are a cashier the hours are not very flexible. You do not get paid enough to survive. Health insurance is pretty cheep and the PTO is easy to understand and use.
good,"This is a very fast placed environment that is micro managed. It's hard work and you're expected to meet production requirements. You're give two 18 minute breaks, that's it, no lunch. It's decent pay for the area but unless you intend on becoming a manager, your salary is capped out. From my experience, the managers are great."
good,"On a typical day I would start work by breaking down and stocking deliveries in storage areas.  Once completed, I would check sales floor for outages or shortages in retail displays, restock as needed.  Set up up new retail displays as needed and help customers as needed."
good,"When you make overtime, they cutting off as they wanabager need to take courses of how to lead and how to treat people"
good,I had a 21 year career with Walmart.  It is a good company to work for.  Benefits are good.  Walmart culture and beliefs are practiced in stores.  I have learned a lot over my years with this company.  Walmart afforded me many opportunities to grow a career and the pay is competitive.
good,Walmart is a good place to work . You can find good friends . The managers are okay. Half do their job very well and the other half don't even care. (:
good,"Walmart was a great job for someone that is just starting off , you cant raise a family working at walmart . But overall it was a great working place and everyone got along."
good,You work in retail so you work with a lot of people that don't wanna be there or their kids and just don't care. The only reason I stay was because I was full time and had benfits and couldn't find that any where else.
good,nice environment to work in. management is very poor. when i first started the job associates were not helpful at all during training period. the job isn't hard and you are not over worked.
good,Had to always be aware of your surroundings. Make sure customers are happy and well taken care of while keeping an eye on those who come to steal. Have to get to know your customers.
good,Stable job security with good pay plus yearly bonus. Management varies from store to store but overall needs more work in how they communicate with employees. Coworkers are great to work with but the customers are the most difficult part. They are very rude. Managment is usually good flexible with schedules. Typically get the time off you request as long as it is not over Christmas.
good,Staff was pretty nice along with very accommodating in terms of schedule. Everyone in the end of the day wants to make money and get the job done as expected.
good,"Job is repetitive, and things you complete one day will be done or removed the very next day so you don't feel like you accomplish anything when the day is done."
good,"Very Busy, but the people you work with can make the day or break it. A positive out look helps when dealing with customers and co-workers. Management is not always the best."
good,"Stocking Frozen and Dairy aisles.  Made picks from bins using a MC/40 or TC/70, printed labels for overstock items, binned items into the storage bins, unloaded trucks, customer service and cleaning as necessary."
good,"Very friendly, family type of work environment.  Extremely focused on company wide sales goals. It is retail so sales is the biggest focus next to customer service. Focus is clean, fast, friendly."
good,"I enjoy working as a Pharmacy Tech, but it can be a very stressful position. I feel that Walmart could do a better job at supporting the pharmacy staff."
good,"day in day out the same job aspectations. job title doesnt really change unless you go through a huge process, and trained for the next position. the management here works like emails do on a computer. overall ok place to work for basic job duties"
good,The managers here are very demanding and dont know how to make a schedule properly. Most of the time the place was understaffed. Customer service was a really quick paced job but it was really stressful.
good,The Union City Walmart is a very challenging store but it is a very technical store. The processes are excellent. It's too demanding of a job. I learned a lot but it's hard to work here.
good,"Just like any job you will have, there are aspects you'll like and dislike. Overall, Walmart wasn't a bad job, I would have stayed if the pay was higher. It can be fast paced or slow, depends on position, shift, time of year (i.e. holidays) The more you show you want to be there, the more it will be noticed."
good,its an ok job will have to work hard and get things done by the end of your shift and its gets stressful at time but usually you'll get help management is kinda of bad tho
good,Clock in go to the back see where the brand-new supervisor put you in the complete opposite place from where you should go for the day witch makes everyone work a little slower witch makes management a little angrier people are going to be slower in a new place there not familiar with we stock items  help each other out and work for 9 hours.
good,"A typical work day consists of unloading truck onto designated carts and pallets within a set time frame, assigning areas to work based on individuals strengths and periodically visit the associates in their assigned areas to see there progress"
good,"I worked for Walmart for over half a year and even though I loved my coworkers and and the customers were amazing. There were times where the job itself was really stressful, and even though I had no intention of leaving so soon, I was let go to an incident with my work schedule."
good,I started out as a cashier. I was a Department Manager for Office Supplies. Next  I was a Department Manager for HBA and also Electronics. I made sure shelves were stocked properly. Responsible for ordering and inventory control. Cleanliness of my department. Did Stocking and helped in other areas at times when needed. Helped Customers and did Customer Service. Very fast paced retail store. Always busy.
good,"management leaves much to be desired."
good,"From the GM down to area managers, poor desicision making across the board."
good,"Walked around on feet for majority of the shift, it was a smaller neighborhood market and with the position I had at the time I worked in all departments except produce. a little stressful trying to accomplish all tasks"
good,"can be very stressful and have to pick up the pace when people slack which is very often, management has its ups and downs depending on what manager it is, hard dealing with the people who lack but the good workers are fun and good to work with"
good,Would be a good job if the pay for department managers was enough to deal with all the stress they put you under. And if managment would actually listen to their employees instead of bullying them.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help our customer, train and promote my assoicates, along with seeing the direct positive impact you were able to make in the store/company."
good,"El buenos dias compañeros , con una buena cara aunque fuese un dia agotador,ser positiva ya que formaba parte de la gerencia. Aprendi a cocinar para 20 personas ,usar cepillo industrial,hacer inventarios , hacer rotacion de mercaderia, pedidos de provedor segun las ventas de este para no provocar exesos, recibir mediosde pago { monedas ,billetes,en aquel tiempo chequesy dolares ), entrega de planilla al banco ."
good,"If you're planning to work for Walmart be prepared for rude, confusion, and uncoordinated behavior. The workplace was hectic and the managing wasn't that great. The pay was unfair because every new employee would be getting paid $11 while i was being payed $9/hr. I did my Walmart Pathways (Walmart online training services), and did not get my raise."
good,Pay is decent lower management is cool upper management not so much hrs not regular very stressful I love people I work with but to upper management it's all about the dollar not the customer or the employees the ones who pay there Bill's smh at them
good,always under staff never enough front end help not enough will need another part time because Walmart only hire parttime associate so they don't have to offer insurance
good,Great work environment and lots of great people working there. Managers can range from greatly involved to being barely there. They keep pretty much anybody they can hire even if that person isn't particularly productive or good at their job. They will schedule you for ten days in a row if they can. If they were more willing to discipline people that need it the store would greatly improve. Many people there in vital roles in the store are simply just collecting a paycheck
good,"Working at Walmart had its ups and downs like any job, but when I was there management seemed to not care about anything. Employees would clock in early and clock out late to milk the clock, and management would ignore safety hazards."
good,Walmart is a good employer to start. Have a good pay rate and outstanding benefit. I recommend work there. Be prepare to work hard and be able to do anything.
good,"A typical day at Walmart for inventory control involves scanning the bins with merchandise and stocking shelves. If that particular item is overstock, then a correction is made on the handheld inventory device to ensure inventory control. If an end cap has a weak feature, then that item is removed, reboxed in case quantities and another item is placed on that end cap. Management walks the store, daily every morning to go over new features and changes. The hardest part of the job is being unable to advance, some associates who have been with the company for several years do not Always get considered for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to take pride in stocking the items that a customer needs, and doing it neatly while providing great customer service."
good,I loved the job I wouldn’t mind going back . I loved the hour breaks because sometimes standing up so long is boring . I love seeing and making the customers happy . Learning new things about each customer that came through my line .
good,"Upper management can be task driven at times. Corporate belief to use negative reinforcement for motivation. Fast pace environment. Can be challenging,  but believe in empowerment and diversity."
good,Expect no less. Numbers and percentages are the only thing they go by.  If you are not used to working on your feet 10plus hours this is not for you.  Look elsewhere!
good,"If you do your job management will leave you alone. The downside, you have to hear about other people not doing their jobs during meetings and it’s directed and said to everyone and made out to be everyone not doing them. Not much good gets said during everyday meetings just how everyone is not on process and they don’t want to hear excuses as to why people are not."
good,"It an easy job. There are alot of benefits including health insurance, discounts, and on holiday they do meals. I had a good time working here. really loved my job"
good,"I had amazing and equally awful coworkers. The people that pulled their own weight made everything go so much smoother and team work was key. However, you had just as many people there that seemingly did everything in their power to screw all of that up at every given moment as though it was pure malice on their part. Management had about the same ratio of great and bad workers. Depending on how good you are in general with people determined how well you did with customers. More than once I talked an angry customer into being sweet as could be. About a 5th of the time however you had a nearly insane person to deal with. Just typical life. It all depends on whom you work with really."
good,it wasn't the worst place but it wasn't the best especially if you had a rude or ignorant customer but most of us has been there and can't wait until they left
good,It has it's ups and downs. Long lines to check out  overnight. Not enough help on sales floor. When there was a problem with management nothing was ever done
good,"I was working in Walmart  2 to 11 in the cap2 team, Over basically work is Unloading the truck and fill out on the shelf, I learned their teamwork, management, the value of time, better communication,"
good,"Good Job. Management is more or less a mess, and from what I've heard, it's like that at most Walmarts. Benefits are okay. Job is easy but sometimes frustrating because of management wanting you to stay over, but not wanting you to get overtime. Aside from the store manager, there are several assistant store managers. These assistants often step on toes with each other and each have different jobs they want you to perform aside from your main responsibility, and often are angry when you either don't perform your main tasks in favor of their tasks, and vice versa."
good,Pushing hard on production and making job hard to. As long as on time and making production levels job is good. Got a misdemeanor charge and they would not let me return.
good,This is a great place for you to learn and to respect customer service as long as the management team is good.  As long as you dont get management that is only out for themselves you will be fine. Lots of options to move up in the company.
good,"No family time."
good,"be on time, do what you have to do get the job done, move on to the next tasks, management is very fair just communicate and you'll be fine, be a good employee and you have nothing to worry about."
good,"It could be a fun place to work but not sustainable. Managers, more times than not, tend to pick favorites and if you're not a favorite you will have a harder time there."
good,"Es una buena empresa en general ya que da facilidades de crecimiento, pero la carga de estrés es muy grande cuando se tiene falta de personal"
good,"I've enjoyed working there. Just another job, nothing special. I was a cashier and that was boring. The fun part was when they told me I could go and help the sales floor associates."
good,Good people great atmosphere can be very stressful at times but all in all I would recommend it to everyone who needs a job csms are nice and managers are helpful
good,I stock the same isles every day. I unload a truck every day and deal with customers everyday. This gets very repetitive and annoying. My management is fantastic and I have no problems with them.
good,"stressful, understaffed, insufficient tools for the job, no training, poor morale, no support from management, uncomfortable temperatures supply your own uniforms/ clothing,  no team work"
good,"greetings welcome to walmart."
good,"12 years of management experience. ups and downs opportunities. "
good,"A typical day at work was being a cashier, waiting for someone to come into your line, while walking up and down the aisle picking it up. "
good,"I honestly don't recommend Walmart as a career choice, but as a good job on the weekends. In the last three years that I have been employed at Walmart, I have worked stocking merchandise, been a cashier in the pharmacy, and now a cashier on the front end. I enjoy our team of managers and associates that I get to work with, and with the new changes happening company wide, Walmart seems to be hiring more people constantly to fill positions that's available. Walmart is the largest retailer in the world and that means there are plenty of opportunities for advancement if the company is a good fit for a career move."
good,"Able to move around in different areas. Enjoy and fun to learn different things. Nothing are the same everyday. They are willing to teach u how to do the price changes, stocks, and cashier.  They moved me up to be a dept manager of the bakery even with my hearing loss. They were very patient with me and teaching me how to run the dept."
good,I have learned a lot while working at Wal-Mart. I have been promoted twice within a year and 4 months. I have gained a lot of customer service and leadership experience that will help me in my future endeavors.
good,"Enjoyed the job, the benefits and the pay but completely unprofessional management. A lot of drama and power hungry individuals. Theres no steady schedule and if your schedule is not practically free then they won't give you much for hours. Enjoy a chaotic ever-changing schedule."
good,They were flexible with my schooling hours and the discount on everyday items was a nice bonus. Scheduling was often unorganized which resulted in missed lunches and late nights.
good,"Decent place to work. You make well above minimum wage. You get breaks and lunches. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and not being able to depend on your assistant managers to back you up on policy when you have a difficult customer. Most enjoyable part of working here is the work culture, you make a lot of friends if you're young."
good,It was a fast pace fun environment to work just management wasn't together maybe because store was new. Learned a lot of work related things why I was there.
good,A typical day at Walmart is always fast-paced and hands on. I learned how to work independently and with a team. I learned about inventory processes and how to be a supervisor. Management is all different they each work different ways and require different work ethics. The hardest part of my job is often lack of coverage. The best part of my job is meeting customers who love shopping with us and love our low prices.
good,I typically had the same processes to execute daily.  If there was freight present from the night before that took precedent over regular daily  processes. The hardest part of the job was assuming the responsibilities of other department managers when they took time off.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily interaction with customers.  I worked well with all levels of store management.
good,Job was stressful most days. If you did the job you are required to do you are left alone for the most part. Keep your feet pumping and you will be fine.
good,"When I worked at walmart everyone started off friendly, but in the end if you didn't get your aisle done fast enough they considered you a ""bad"" employee. Even if you didn't get it done in time because you were helping a customer find an item. They always told me the customer comes first..... I guess they meant second."
good,"A pretty normal entry level job. I met some great people that I'm still in contact with today. Management is Atrocious and almost useless. Multiple managers may dictate different tasks for you to do. Working in the back was pretty fun. There was a lot of horseplay and goofing off, but be careful no to be spotted by managers. Expectations are generally way to high especially with the high turn over and lack of workers. Overall I would say go for it if you really need a job, they have good benefits and can be pretty flexible with scheduling and stuff."
good,Great company to work for if you dknt mind working weekends and holidays. This is a 24/7 retail world leading company that can be stressful and rewarding.
good,Relaxed and calming work environment.  I enjoyed the department and hours I worked.  Management was laid back yet very helpful when needed.  I learned to be knowledgeable and take pride in my department.
good,cooperative work area with good co workers andl a very productive as a working enviroment .The hardest part is what you put in as your work effort is what you get cause on who you work with the experience of working with someone can become amazing as working together as a union to get the job done of if you are finish with your work ask if its okay to go and help someone else.
good,"A typical day at work would involve either working at MoneyCenter or Customer Service. I've learned about money transfers, bill payments, etc. The hardest thing about working at Walmart sometimes is the customers, they can be very irate over things you can't change. The fun thing about working at Walmart is meeting new people and becoming friends outside of work."
good,"As with any job there are positives and negatives. The Asheboro store vomplains about high turn over but gives you so few hours its not worth stsying half the time, and when you get the hours you are doing the work of 3 people."
good,"I loved working at my original location but once I transferred because of school the pharmacy worked a little differently and are short staffed and tempers run high because of it. Some days are better than others, a few of us go to school but yet still under a lot of pressure at work."
good,At Walmart I helped our loyal customers find there way around our store I also stocked dairy goods and produce and cleaned the stool and fruits and vegetables .
good,Our support manager would have a meeting about how we did day before then we look on a list that tells our areas we are working in then we stock or unload truck till day is over. I have learned retail and how to take care of customers and stock and zone in retail stores. Management in cap 2 is great and helpful to others when help is needed.Full of life outside of the back room. The hardest part of the job is stocking at the speed the management want you to go. The most enjoyable part of that job was the people and employees you meet while working their.
good,"I enjoyed my time at wal-mart, i was garden center and that was great because i enjoy being out side i was head leader of the fork lift, water plants every day, even handling with ""unique"" customer"
good,Walmart was a great job and paid well!! i enjoyed the people along with the customers at the oxford location. i recommend working here it just was not the job i wanted for longterm.
good,"- Walmart provides many opportunities for employees to learn and develop including flexible hours, friendly working environment teaching and training program, and other programs provided to employees."
good,I had a wonderful time working at Walmart and learned much. It is an excellent place to learn and grow. If someone has good work ethic and wants to devote themselves to the company they can go far.
good,Walmart was a cool place to work breaks and lunches were reasonable. the management was great. the only thing about Walmart is the pay. the cost of living is to high for the low pay rate.
good,Working here was great as a teen needing to get a few extra bucks and to have a flexible schedule for school. I wouldn't recommend it for the long haul unless you are willing to pull long hours and not be appreciated for the time that you put into your work.
good,No one is ever held accountable for not finishing their job. Everyone always leavsat 11 weather they are finished with ther job . No overtime. We have no more paid Holidays
good,"As a customer service manager, I loved my job, I got to schedule breaks and lunches for the front end, preform audits on the cash drawers, and take care of customer issues. It was a fast paced experience and I loved that as well, there was never not anything to do and I got 2 15min breaks and a lunch hour to do as I pleased. In my experience at Wal-Mart, everyday is generally different, as you are working with different people all the time and the customers are not always the same."
good,the set of level of production that they set is above ability to achieve with the amount of product and team taht they were hiring at the time no consistent  influx off the incoming trucks to move it around the warehouse and if they was not enough work they sent you home early with loss of pay
good,As someone who closed on weekends the work was very stressful as there was alot of tasks to do but not many people wanted to work the weekend closing shifts.
good,I feel with Walmart being such a multi million dollar company that they would be more appreciative of their long term employees. I really like the job just not where it was headed. I did not like the fact that our manager and lead tech were slacking in some of their duties therefore making it hard on the techs that were doing the job plus more
good,Before the holidays it wasn't terrible still had your usual a**holes but not nearly as many as during the holidays and it was literally non stop the whole day with at least 20 people in your line at all times.
good,I start my day scanning in the backroom for merchandise that is missing from the sales floor. I stock the shelves and unload the truck whenever it comes in. I am given four to five different directions a day. Because I have been with the company for so long I know a lot about the merchandise.
good,Poca honestidad.  No hay ética y poco profesionalismo.  Mucho discrimen racial.  Esta fue mi experiencia en una locación en Houston TX.
good,"A good place to work, nothing really to hard. Some associates are nice, and some management. some of the management have favorites and it makes it hard for other to get experience and move up."
good,"I learned teamwork and hard work here as a cart attendant. It was not an easy job, but it was not a difficult job. the worst parts were the weather. if you can handle that then you can handle this job and company."
good,Never felt that management cared for cart pushers. That just threw us outside and didnt really care for us. Had great coworkers who had worked there for a while which made it a bit better working.
good,"A typical working day at walmart would be fast paced. Making sure freight is being worked, verified, labeled, and binned. Top stock is being done and making sure we are following One Best Way."
good,Home office was the ones that decided to cut out hours. Yet we hired new associates for holiday when they could have gave the vets hours. They always would put not trustworthy associates on service desk.
good,You're on your feet 8 hours a day while you sit down during break and lunch. Some of the teammates are lazy and you have to pick up their slack. We have no supervision at the moment so it's a little chaotic
good,"I wholeheartedly believe in the EDLP motto from Walmart, however the work balance life tends to be stressful at times.  I'm not sure if its just the store I worked for but it seemed we put out small fires instead of doing our job as Assistant Managers.  I loved the people and the customers, there is no doubt."
good,"Every day is different, but always very fast paced. you will always be moving whether it be moving or filling a feature or assisting a customer in some way. You are expected to cross train in various areas of the store in order to better serve customers. The pay is good but turnover is not great."
good,Flexible hours that allowed an appropriate balance between high school classes and work. Provided a good foundation to entering the work force prior to completing high school diploma
good,"Its literally just routine. Straight up repetition if you can say hi, operate an cash register and put stuff on the shelf you'll be fine. It does become boring if your associates are unsocial"
good,Coworkers and managers care for you a lot and are willing to work around troubles that you may have outside of work. They are pretty good with arranging your schedule for what best works for you.
good,"Work was busy.  Repetitive in essence but different due to different customer personalities.  Clicks in every area,  especially as you moved up in management.  Working with different people was both fun and difficult."
good,"While most of the managers were great, both in personality and leadership, there were a few who ""weren't up to code"" as some of the other associates would say."
good,"Before they changed the location of the jewelry dept. I enjoyed  it there, but after the relocation of jewelry it seemed like most of my hours were in apparel and fitting room.  I was still coded as jewelry but only worked over there when they needed coverage.  I busied myself working in shoes and zoning.  I also cashiered as needed.  I really enjoyed the regular customers and also helping other customers."
good,"Depending on your position, working here can be stressful. I learn a lot of management skills. The upper management in this store were hard to work for. The hardest part was dealing with the managers and customers. The other employees were easy to work with."
good,This job just isn't made for me but the management there is so nice.  Would recommend the job. Unless you do not like call center like jobs.  You talk to people all the time and they can be awful.
good,"Initially, very good place to work.  Profit sharing rewarded ALL associates for their efforts in making the store, company, profitable.  Work environment positive, salary great.  Culture eroded and managers, including assistants, didn't have backing of company when it came to personnel decisions (hiring, firing practices)."
good,I worked their for five years I loved my job but also had times I hated it as well. the job is what you make of it. If you give it your all it well have rewards and if you come in with a I don't care attitude you well be stuck. Remember retail is detail and have a good attitude towards staff and consumers. Because at the end of the day that's why you'll have a job.
good,Always understaffed and I mean always so management expectations are way to high one person shouldn't be forced to do the job of multiple people. The wage isn't high basically pays less then the local McDonald's which is part of the reason we can't keep people as a Manger I can't even afford a 2 bedroom apt.
good,"It was a nice job, it was very busy. You were costantly on your feet, there were never slow days they always went by quick. It was fun but just wasnt for me."
good,"Walmart is a good company management is never on the same accord, the benefits are good, the pay is decent, and the job isn’t hard. Lots of freight makes the time fly."
good,Fast pace always something to do.  The environment is usually friendly and always ready to help our customers.  Always a way to move up in the company.
good,"Enjoy the work, but the scheduling has gone automatic and is not working out. Managers should go back to making the schedules. Enjoy meeting the associates and customers."
good,"High volume pharmacy, stressful, reasonable hours with lunch break of 30 minutes, bad upper management provided no support, good work place associates"
good,"Walmart sometimes seems to have a bad reputation, but my experience there was actually pretty nice. They worked with me on my schedule, since I was also going to school. They paid decent wages, the work environment was always alright and the people I worked with were nice. I honestly had no complaints working there."
good,I started out working in the garden center and it was fun the managers were really accepting and friendly that is until I switched to automotive out in the shop for full time the manager was nice for a few months then he just turned and it was constant yelling and we just couldn't get along.
good,A typical work day you needed to be prepared for the unknown. Never knew what going to happen. Have your typical routine you completed daily. However if something else happened that took priority.
good,The hours and money are good. Management needs to communicate more effectively. Some of the managers through they were too good to talk to you or help you. I’ve never worked at at Walmart that was as bad at #916. The communication was awful and nobody knew what they were doing.
good,Was probably one of my hardest jobs very stressful at time I learned to be a little more relaxed in other job opportunities.Best part was being able to help people and learn how to work in a fast pace and stressful work conditions.
good,"Usually I enjoy my job, but I think that the management need more training  to follow the phylosophia initial of the company. It is a great company but had to work more in the human resource."
good,lack of focus on real subjects that matter. they seem to only care what the corporate managers wanted them to focus on. i think the focus should be day to day on improvement and customer care
good,"I worked hard tried to please vendors as well as my employer, but management made it hard for me to do my job. I enjoyed the vendors I dealt with day to day because they respected me and what the company approved of. I came into a messed of overstock when I took the position but before they started treating me as I was an enemy I manage to get vendor receiving to an minimum. Management doesn't like for anyone below them to voice there concerns and opinion because it makes them look like they don't know what they're doing."
good,"The job was hard as a whole, The management was very unsupportive, No sense of achievement, No one notcied how hard i was actually working, I felt very uncomfortable working for this company as i was walking on average 15 miles a day in the heat and no appreciation."
good,I'd recommend working here while building your career platform...not when starting a family or wanting to maintain to career/work lifestyle balance. This job helped me build a skillset that I utilize everyday.
good,There were good co- works there. They made it nice. And we did have many works.There to zone and get stuff done. We were short of people to help us. The support manager we good to us.
good,"I learned a lot at Walmart customer service,maintenance,forklift driver, baler,stocker, automotive technician,service writer. It was mainly the benefits of the job that made me leave."
good,"On était beaucoup d'employer,donc beaucoup de plaisir. Les gérants ne sont pas très productif"
good,"I had a wonderful Manager, she was encouraging and helped me with my career, I enjoyed learning and assisting others in the pharmacy. I enjoyed have relationships with others."
good,its ok. would recommend to stay hourly. being a salaried manager can be stressful and its hard on home life.  if u decide to be a manager be choosy about the store u go to.  stores in lower income areas and diverse areas are way harder to manage and deal with.  a store is a reflection of the community it is in.  you hire from the community so being in lower income areas that deal with lazier people can make work life much more stressful than it has to be.
good,"Posibilidades de crecer laboralmente ,estabilidad laboral ,buena alimentacion ,buenos beneficios ."
good,Competitive pay and 40 hours per week. Health benefits are good. Some management can be difficult. I worked 3rd shift and enjoyed the slower pace of customers.
good,Pretty good work environment and very fast paced. Always something to do or be done. Your required and hour lunch and two 15 minute breaks. Overall a great place to establish your work career if your into retail.
good,"If you are hard struck on getting a job then Walmart is an option.  The pay is going to be the lowest compared to any other competitors, and it is difficult to get a full time position."
good,A typical day at work would be coming in to a broken cart machine. Meaning every cart has to get pushed by hand.. very tiring. Annoyed costumers taking attitude out on us. Walking to bus stops to get carts..
good,everytime I changed my schedule it remained unchanged and was not touched at all. other than that it's a great job for teens that are used too standing in place.
good,At walmart there are great managers the one on the front end was not very good so just quit rather then have a confrontation. Our front end manager does not have good people skills.
good,Okay place to work as far as pay and bonus but managers are unprofessional. Your outside life is not considered highly unless an emergency. Store is very short handed most likely to do work for 3 people at once.
good,"Hired in as a cart pusher while attending college, after a few months I moved to the electronics dept, did that for 3.5 years and then I moved to Texas and shortly after I was promoted to shift manager and then to assistant manager."
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for as an hourly associate but, when you move to management the work life balance is not there. The GM can never say thank you or give a complement and your always scared that your going to loose your job."
good,"this was my first cashier job for a major retail, it was a good experience and I was able to be considered for a promotion within a few weeks of working there because of the positive feed back that customers gave back to management"
good,Not all the time the trucks be on time or the managers was going to be fair with u it thought me how to deal with  pressure n work with the costumers to the point got a award my picture put up for happy to help for the costumers
good,Hiring was definitely a challenge. Turnover rate was extremely high and had to hire constantly to replace employees that just started but could not commit to the hours or the job. Pay at that time was not all that inviting either.
good,"was a convenient place for shoppers to pop in for vaccines or minor health issues"
good,"I worked at walmart for just under 5 years and enjoyed my time there, great first job. Hours fly by and easy work that keeps you busy your whole shift, plus most workers are nice"
good,Its a good place towork. my only complaint i the location that i work the costumers are kinda mean and management not backing us up on policys. other then that its ok
good,I started working at walmart right after high school it was great for that time. Customers and employees were sometimes great to work with.We got a dollar raise each year. There were times it was hard to get help from CSM and Management at the front. Never was enough cashiers to work in evenings sometimes it was maybe one or two of us if we were lucky.
good,"I worked for Walmart for 3 years back when I was still in college or over the summer to get those extra hours. Back then full time you barely made over $8 average was $7.65. I left Walmart after my junior year so I could focus on my senior year and graduate. I also didn’t know I would be moving to a different state. Back then my store didn’t have it together. It was low pay, drama, management picking favorites or over working the ones they dislike or coworkers slacking off and making everyone else do more work. Overall the company was great to work for I just didn’t like my store. I tried transferring to a different store but they did not allow me to do so. Now that it’s been almost 5 years working for them they raised their minimum wage to $11 which is now more than most jobs out there atm. I would work for them again. As I said I like the company just not my old store."
good,"Walmart offers stable employment with benefits. The typical day can be great or terrible depending on your attitude. Walmart can be a great stepping stone to more gainful employment, within or outside of the company."
good,The actual job is very easy. You help unload the freight from the truck then stock all freight and zone. Managers can be unappreciative of your hard work and demeaning. On nights where there are two trucks you are expected to stay several hours past your shift to complete all freight and zone regardless if the amount of freight hours calculated exceed the working hours.
good,Butler Walmart is a bad place to work they understaff and expect you as one person to do the job of three people. Most managers do not care about their associates and aren’t willing to help when things get busy. The pay is good but not worth the stress of working there
good,Walmart provides a chance for growth for the average man. I enjoyed working here because i was able to perform in different departments and because of this every day at work felt a little different.
good,"The job was fun sometimes because I had some friends that worked there and, I made some friends with some of my co-workers and customers that ask for help."
good,"Fiquei no projeto apenas 5 meses, saí por corte na verba do projeto"
good,"Promised a move closer to home. Kept being put off by DM . Would prmise to move then fill position with local people. My position was hard to fill, so I was kept on the road til I quit from pure exhaustion"
good,worked with many customers and really built a skill to deal with different kinds of people. moved around the store and were trusted with many tasks at a young age
good,"As an assistant manager, you review schedules, plan the day while touring your areas and making notes for the day.  Hand out the notes to the appropriate employees.  Follow up on any positions that you may be hiring for and set up interviews.  Review schedules due at the end of the week.  Time and attendance done daily to stay compliant with policies."
good,"Great pay, love the customers , but the management team needs to appreciate their associates more ! Great PTO program which helps a lot on checks that you make !"
good,"I managed to learn a lot in my area. I would be fine working where I was, if it wasn't so stressful. My area tends to be understaffed, so we end up getting out of there around an hour later than we are supposed to be out."
good,Working at walmart is a good job....yes the way the schedule your hours is bad..but all in all a very good place to work...the holidays can get a bit crazy but its fun
good,"Working at Walmart you will be stocking all day as a stocker, all kinds of product so you must be able to do a lot of lifting and be able to stand on your feet all day."
good,Wal-Mart is a very good place to work at. But just like any job you have your stressful moments.my manager's I worked with were great always willing to help.
good,Managers make it happen daily. All aspects of the job require flexibility and adaptability. Must be able to accept change and react to priorities quickly.
good,My main focus outside of pleasing the customers was to make sure my area stayed stocked.  I ordered when i needed and deligated projects to make sure my job was done right.
good,Provided alot of opportunity to learn a large scale operation.Workplace culture is diverse and inclusive. The schedule is a great feature of this job.
good,It's a really fast paced job. The people/ management were nice. It's not good for a first job though. I was remodeling which made it harder work supposedly.
good,A typical day at work is getting drawers put out in the register. Make sure that check out lanes are nice and clean up. Go around making sure that we get to cashiers that have training questions that pop up on our handhelds. Helping customers fine thing that the need that  they cant fine in the store. Everyday you learn something new. Like how to do audits.
good,I didn't like working at Wal-mart. Especially unloading the trucks and palletizing product. I wouldn't recommend this job. I was there 9-10 months. Thank you
good,It was a good place to work but managers are unprofessional but in all it’s a good job to meet new people it gives u a good experience on how to talk to new people
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart as a cashier, you get to meet lots of people the employees are a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was not getting regular breaks on time. The hours at the job vary if your not a permanent employee."
good,"I really enjoyed the job.  The hours were great, the job was fun, and I had great benefits.  After a while of being there, however, I felt stuck with no way to advance and use my degree, and I felt that I was easily replaceable and that it was more about the company than the associates.  Those paired with the drama within the store were the downsides to the job, but, they were tolerable.  In the end, I left primarily due to relocation."
good,Wal-Mart is a stressful job no team work managers don't know how to do their job over work certain employees because they know they'll get the job done well others slack and get no trouble for it
good,"The best part about Walmart is seeing all the regular customers come in on a daily basis, as well as other associates that you’ve became friends with through the company."
good,"The amount of associates has dropped and continues in our store. We work short handed everyday, and can not seem to get people to apply. Seems they are only concerned with the bottom line."
good,"When I work here first second third day is hard for me "
good,Typical day at Walmart is fast paced customer friendly retail company
good,"walmart was a great place to work. good benefits not great pa, good career advancement opportunities. the uniform is jeans or black pants with a blue polo shirt. the people were pretty nice to work with the management was decent. you get an hour for lunch but its not paid so you are at work 9 hours always."
good,"Walmart is not the same company it was 15 years ago. And all stores and store management teams are not created equal. The culture is drastically different from one store to the next and one store manager to the next. At teams it seems Walmart has a clear vision for the future, and at other times it seems they’re grasping for straws. The salary is good, the benefits are OK, and the atmosphere is OK if you end up in a good store. Otherwise... good luck."
good,I enjoyed the company experience. Upper Management could value employees more and train with the intent to promote their staff more so more people could move up. There were times were it seemed employees were able to replace fellow management (often doing their required duties and more)  and were not offered the opportunity.
good,I enjoy working at Walmart because the pharmacy is Heading in a more clinical direction. Pharmacy is constantly adhering to state laws and align to CDC recommendations.
good,clock in unload truck do instock how to talk to customers management down to earth work culture new orleans vibes hardest part of the job unload truck
good,"I've had two managers at Walmart. One made me dread going to work to the point of tears, while my new and current manager has me happy to go to work. Knowing that she is understanding of a busy full-time college schedule makes work less stressful."
good,"i think they should do more training for new hires"
good,the staff was fun to work with in the cashier dept. the shift scheduling was something to be desired. they would not work around shift changes and time off.
good,The work environment is very fast paced. You're expected to get all the tasks complete with minimal staff. This leaves very little room for breaks and or lunches.
good,"Challenging and demanding, numerous hours of off the clock work encouraged to meet demands.  Stringent computer systems that needs upgrading.  Required counseling of patients is a great idea, but can be challenging and not wanted or respected by patients who have been taking the medications for years"
good,una empresauy seria y buena para trabajar da mucha tranquilidad y estabilidas
good,"I enjoy the overall work environment of Walmart. Just my location lacks the decency of positive management. The Store Manager affects the store as a whole. If the management fall off, the whole store will fail."
good,a typical day by working at Walmart and being a cashier you get a lot of rude customers coming up to trying complain to you for a situation you cant handle you gotta have a strong min to work at Walmart
good,"when I was little I always wanted to work at Walmart, but when I got there it wasn't that cool. instead of an employee, I felt like ""employee#009823."" there was a few managers that did know me but only because they would go around rushing us to get done faster. plus it was night shift I worked so everyone was a little tired"
good,This job is very challenging but its worth the challenge in the end. I learned some new trates that i didnt know i had within me. The pay is great and the days was great as well and you get as much overtime you need.
good,"The Walmart Corporate Office is a great place to work, but don't count on being there long term.  Once you think you know what your team is set to accomplish, the team is eliminated due to company reorganization."
good,"Good company to work for, lots of opportunity for advancement and great job security. Unfortunately, stores are often short staffed and retail hours are terrible."
good,My hours shifted and changed often unless I put restrictions on them. Overall I would work this job again but it wouldn't be my first choice. A great job for getting retail experience but not something I personally could do for more than a few years.
good,"Pay starts out ok but if you are able to complete all your cbl's, you will get a raise. I was never able to be scheduled 40 hours. Only way to get full time is to pick up hours."
good,"Working at Walmart started off at 4am ,we would come in a nd work carts which means stock food that was left out from night shift.Sometimes when there is nothing left we will start cap -ing bins which meant pulling items from the back which needed to be put out, During my shift around 6am is when management comes to check on us and tell us what needed to be done.During inventory was the hardest part of the job ,because you had to make sure nothing was over stocked or it would be a problem and we would have a overload. For the most part walmart is a decent place to work"
good,"Work is not bad overall except the part when unloading a 7000+ item semi-truck, and the lead and 5 other workers left for a concert leaving only 3 of the crew unloading the truck with no help from the other departments and finishing three more trucks after before 9pm, AND lastly, for three days in a row...was not worth staying. Also the Walmart was new and the manager of my department just gave birth and came back 4 months later after the Walmart opened and have no idea  what to do or didn't care about a long 3 month ago request for a weekend off caused me to lose my cool."
good,Manager has responsibility for OTC dept. Connexus software is good. Closing for lunch on weekends or whenever there is only one pharmacist. It is very helpful to be scheduled an hour prior to opening to allow a good opportunity to get the day started on a positive note. Better ancillary staffing than some other firms I have worked for. Good financial support for physical plant.
good,Its an okay job I didn't love it but I got used to it when I always got my paycheck every week it was easy when I got the handle of cashing people out
good,I enjoyed my job and the people that I worked for. Love the opportunities that were given to employees in corporate offices to further your education.
good,"Highly busy environment, I really dove into it the first night, I was so excited. Management was very helpful, and they even helped me with improving my organizational skills, and to perform better on the job such as completing tasks on time."
good,"I started working at Walmart in 2002. I left a previous job where I worked for 13 years because Walmart started me out at what it took me 13 years to make at my previous job. I now make $6 more! It’s a good place to start for a young person or someone wanting to work part time. You can also make a career at Walmart if you are an ambitious person. For the most part I enjoy working at Walmart. No one is %100 satisfied with their job, you just have to make the most of what you are doing."
good,"Lack of communication, they need to be there for their employees more. Have better communication skills. Typical day at was fair (most of the time), but it could’ve been better. I’ve learned better customer service skills. I feel that the management could’ve been better than it was. Dealing with difficult customers, and communicating with employers."
good,My duty at Walmart was to make sure I performed my job correctly and finish on time and move at a timely pace.  Also make sure my customers had a good experience.
good,Nice place to work! Great hours but management wasn’t fair to his employees at all...Certain employees could come in clock in and leave on the clock and have no reprucussions.. I loved working there but I couldn’t see myself advancing in an environment like that...
good,management was very good. compensation however i felt could have improved. I noticed management did involve employees. i felt the company really cared about the employees needs. they went above and beyond to show they cared.
good,"My Job was to assemble all displays , Customers online orders or in store purchase. I also did some repairs in store. I assemble bikes for bike Rack , toys children  battery operated  ride on car's and trucks "
good,Never enough people working a shift and the pay was not worth doing everything in the store. Stocker employees have to do everything from frozen and dairy to general merchandise even when outside of pay grade.
good,Working there was good minus working 3rd shift. It was a physically demanding job. I was on my feet for 8 hours cleaning. I would rather work cashiering.
good,"The work environment is very fast paced. In order to complete your job/tasks you have to stop what you do, help customers, and get back to what you were doing. It is a very competitive job and definitely tests your pace."
good,"As a cashier  its the easiest job, just greet the customers, help them purchase their items and keep your area clean. As a sales associate in my experience it was hectic always moving place to place zoning but never having enough time to finish. And when it got busy we are expected to somehow keep are areas neat while helping customers at the same time. the place is also littered with favoritism where some people can get away with mistakes that will cost others their jobs if they did the same. Overall this place needs a serious rework of their management and priorities."
good,Not my favorite job but I did it for nearly six years. Decent environment with fun management and a variety of co-workers from many different backgrounds and age groups.
good,The work was extremely laborious. The pay wasn't great . But whats worse is that the employees where toxic and negative. The older associates worked at a snail pace and the younger associates caused drama and was more into gossip then work. That would leave the couple of individuals to pick up the slack. If you were to bring it up to management you've pretty much targeted yourself for criticism from everyone else. The turnover rate is high for a reason. If you need a job quick go for it but be mentally prepared for whats to come.
good,Upper management is horrible I believe if they were more on it instead of chillin in the back office and doing there procedures it would make it easier for lower management to get what we need done and if everybody was on the same page it would help. Loved the job at first and was looking to further my career there but in the end I didn’t want to stress out on things I shouldn’t be I am way too young
good,It was good expiernce but  when I told them about my religion they negated my days  and I want it my vacation so I can be with my mom because she had an emergency on hr legs had to be operated but it was a week noticed and I knew the manager was gonna say no and I decided to go
good,"They need to do a better job at recognizing the employee who do good"
good,Good hours and decent pay.  Good benefits and paid time off.  Management could be better on all levels.  Good people to work with.  Some paid holidays.
good,Walmart is a fast paced customer oriented business. They do not take care of the management team or train adequately when advancements are given. But overall they do offer competitive pay to the hourly associates.
good,It was a very good work place learned every position in the warehouse and became a trainer to train others and work the computers to make trailers easier  for my co workers.
good,You are able to work Full time hours if you are willing to work in different departments. Management is okay but can be make work stressful. Management can have you re due projects at times when the store manager doesn't like the directions that were give to you by your department manager. You are placed in a certain department but can be relocated to another department to gain more hours but you don't get a pay raise if you work in  a high shrink department and your job title hasn't been changed. Benefits are good.
good,the only bad thing about walmart is on 3rd your doing 3 peoples jobs they expected me to pull picks then go out on the floor and do new stock and then pull me back to bin and get mad if not done by 7 wouldnt hardly ever allow over time and would makeyou set in break room or leave easrly to cut it
good,faced paced work enviroment with opportunity for career advancement for those with strong work ethic. Many postions available for anyone easily bored or overwhelmed in any area. most managment is compassionate and friendly.
good,"They don't care about the people that work for them, they only Care about the money they make and how they look on paper. Will replace you in a her beat."
good,"I worked overnight from 10pm-7am,"
good,Job security moved up very quickly from a cashier to a manger within 6 months dealth with alot of costumers I always clean fast n friendly I would recommend walmart
good,"Most days were relaxed with not much going on, most fellow associates were helpful and supportive. I enjoyed interacting with customers and helping them with their purchases."
good,It was nice working there until management got all jacked up managers came though that place daily and when they would tell you would get a raise they either forgot or you had to keep reminding them over and over
good,"You pick and pack items, it's easy to reach the rate once you get the hang of it. Sometimes there won't be much work throughout the day and all they have you do is clean all day. It gets boring since it's long hours. They also check on your time if you're being productive or not which seems too much to me. 4 days off but sometimes they have mandatory overtime and it gets exhausting. The employees are okay, some are nice and some are dramatic and rude."
good,"My typical day at work is getting dirty with oil and tire changes. What I've learned is that not all Wal-marts are created equal, and that its the management team that makes the particular store. Speaking of management they are by far one of the better teams that I've had the opportunity to work for. The hardest part of my job is that I find that we are way over worked and not have enough staff. However the most enjoyable part of the job is that when not overly stressed it is a fun place to work especially when in the shop."
good,A typical days would be assisting customers.  Crazy busy at times.  I enjoyed working there.  The hardest part was when we were short staffed and the customers were upset about the wait times.
good,Money isn't bad but management is poor. Hours very. Work is easy. It's hard to get fulltime. Asking for time off has to be approved. Not a bad job if in need of employment.
good,"As a result of low employment numbers, I usually find myself working on my own in the department. Sometimes the different managers give me conflicting instructions, which adds to my confusion and frustration. I would rate my experience above average, but not stellar."
good,I liked working at WAL-MART. I worked with my disability and does with alot of employees. I have fun working there because i have fun. My manager is not great to work for things change all the time.
good,good job with ok benefits. Hard physical job but worth it sometimes. Be prepared to be hot 90% of the time. Dealing with the heat and working hard is all they ask for.
good,Walmart offers great benefits to their employee's and properly train their employee's for specific jobs before putting them in their roles. Walmart is a great company to grow within. I have personally seen people go from cart pushers to store managers b/c they hire within and fill positions within the company before outsourcing
good,no supervision others were not held accountable to be on time or to come back on time from lunch.  Management was hard to locate.  I enjoyed the customers and other workers
good,I worked in sporting goods and enjoyed what I did. I sold guns in our location and was a good salesman. I often helped people make decisions they were indecisive bout also sold them extra amenities. Although I had a specific location I was a floor general floating throughout the store helping whomever I could because I held a lot of knowledge in my store.
good,Working as a cartpusher at Walmart was a very productive and interesting experience. You were always busy gathering carts as well as helping customers
good,"Has the ability to multi task "
good,This company changes procedures very often creating issues for current and long term associates. It does have many oppurtunities for advancement for people that are adaptable. Also had very good benefits for long term associates.
good,"They've been mostly good to me, but the only thing that I would complain about is that the payment is just not enough to sustain me when i'm trying to pay bills and mortgage."
good,"a lot of change, part time, much work for little pay, discount is not a lot, black out months where you can request a day off (holidays wise) under staffed, moved around (taken to advantage), really like the job duties but expected too much in little time (not enough hours)"
good,Working at WalMart you can have a good day or a stressful day.  You meet different people with different cultures.  You have to work different shifts.  You don't work the same schedule each day.
good,I liked walmart it was just no money to be made unless you were management. If you worked hard you were recognized  but its not enough to feed your family.
good,"I worked for Walmart for 10 years.  I have experienced several department management positions and 3 zone supervisor positions.  Walmart is pretty demanding and expects a lot from its employees.  I liked working for Walmart, but felt restricted to department manager level.  Not enough associates to handle customers.  I wanted to be an Assistant Manager but then the demands for this position and hours would impact my family. This is retail and you have to work weekends and holidays.  I guess I got tired of it and wanted more quality family time."
good,"normal working environment, generally efficient, some disconnect between pharmacy staff and management because managers are not pharmacists (as there are to normal pharmacies, ie.e walgreens/cvs)"
good,Honestly it depends on the day. They do not have many opportunities to advance. I have tried to multiple times. Some management does not know how to work with people and when brought up it is ignored.
good,"The way i experienced it, it is either a decent start right out of high school (if you advance up in management early) or its a last ditch effort to fine a decent job. because from what I've seen they'll hire anyone, and its usually the people who couldn't get a job anywhere else"
good,"A lot of management is hired from outside of walmart and have no idea what there doing with limited good training for the actual job before hand."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work at. The salary is pretty good and there is tons of overtime opportunities if you desire them. Training is usually a week long in a computer lab and yes, you do get paid."
good,"Work overnight tours, issues employee's call ins and turnover. Overnight store recovery and freight to the floor. Amount of delivery trucks per night. Getting freight out backroom to sales floor and nothing return to back."
good,"The Walmart DC 6035 is a great place to work if you have a strong back and good work ethic. With those you can go far and succeed there. You'll bust your butt almost 24/7, but that check will be nice."
good,Walmart Mcdonalds was fun relaxing feel like your at home only you clean up every day and talk to people you normally wouldn’t talk too the managers there have you a run for your money but if your strong you hang on and keep it pushing no matter what
good,each day you punch in you are unsure what it is that you will be doing that day or even how many hours you will work that shift .. you are not guaranteed 40 hours a week
good,"typical day at work well you help customers have a great experience while they shop "
good,"A typical day at work would be me cutting fabric, stocking materials and zoning."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, A equipe é agradavel de se conviver."
good,"It was okay, great for a teen to work there and experience work skills and decent money starting off. Lack of management don’t know how to do some things, changed schedules to much."
good,"Cross train and learn as much as you can also love people and provide excellent service to your customers. Get along with others and management."
good,Don’t get discouraged when working there. Walmart is full of opportunities if you are work under the right management team. Also a good place to advance.
good,"I don't know about other areas, but the place where I worked the management was not effective at all. They had inconsistent or little skills to manage their departments. Sometimes it was fun to work there but most of the time you felt like you were not important. When sales were up you were all heroes and when sales where down you weren't trying hard enough."
good,I liked working for WalMart. It always fits my schedule and I liked the management. I liked what I was doing and the pay was ok for me. I like helping customers and giving kids stickers and making people laugh and looking at happy faces.
good,"A typical day at work was busy and consistent. There was always something to do, work that needed to be done and customers to take care of. Working at the customer service desk, I learned how to talk to people and multi task in a fast pace environment."
good,Walmart has a great culture and does provide a healthy work-life balance. The constant change does afford the opportunity to expand on skillsets and build experience.
good,Hace falta mejorar muchos aspectos de la tienda Walmart Plaza San Pedro
good,"Lower management weren't the most productive at times and too much gossip. Not much room for moving up in the company for those who truly earned it, favorites were picked regularly."
good,"Walmart is such a big store with many opportunities to promote, when you have a strong work ethic. It's a fast paced job where there's always something to do."
good,"I was on a team of about 6 people in our area of the store. We were the sales team for Verizon, sprint and  AT&T. We later also became pre-paid cell services. We were required to memorize all plans and services for the 3 major companies. Walmart made it easy to work in this area. They made sure we had monthly training."
good,Si se trabaja de una forma agradable pero los superiores en ocaciones piden mas de lo que ellos mismos pueden dar
good,The job isnt really that bad but you have to interact with people constantly throughout the day and it can be a bit too much sometimes. You'll get all sorts of rude customers that ruin your day and then it makes you grumpy which causes management to give you a talking to.
good,"Pay wasn't great, but keep in mind this was before they announced better wages sometime in 2016ish (I can't remember)."
good,"as a team anything is possible.  i have the experience of working with 60 associates to finish a job as well as 20 associates to finish the same job. A ""well Oiled Machine is a Quiet but efficient running machine""."
good,"Deli is incredibly fast paced, but also a very clean field to work in. Maintenance was a indirect route to not seeing any people, as I worked in a Walmart that wasn't 24/7 so it gave me time to clean the store properly and not deal with the typical Walmart civilians."
good,Starting at Walmart was a great experience. It gave the experience I needed to be in other retail management positions. It was an easy job depending how you use your time.
good,"I didn't mind the work and you pretty much have it made other than being tired after unloading so many trailers during your entire shift, but that comes with it."
good,Fast-paced work environment. The company was alright but the pay wasn't great. Great company if you're looking for part-time employment. Great job for high school and college students.
good,It was a fast pace job especially if you had to work on the floor and your department had a register. The managers were ok and the other employees got along pretty well.
good,Nice people to work with enjoy the company and friends made there. Do not like that they took all of our holidays from us. Now there is no reward for working those days.
good,"Walmart is a great place to be.Friendly  pcentives,eople,good hours,great incentives.it is fast paced and goal orentideted.the management is very understanding and helpful."
good,"Empresa responsable, brinda muchas oportunidades de trabajo y comprende a sus trabajadores."
good,Uma  ótima empresa para se trabalhar porem a nao e bem admistrada
good,Assist customers in anyway I can. Assist where ever management needed me. Assist and help train new incoming associates. Supervise associates within my department
good,"Start work @ 4p.m., unload trailer, sort merchandise, deliver merchandise, back-stock, and make floor needed picks. It was good yet hard work-enjoyed doing it, as I worked with a great bunch of co-workers.  Management was great at the supervisorial level, but upper management seemed for the most part not effective as to the ""truck crew"" that I worked on.  I truly enjoyed customer service, and working for and with other associates in the store was a wonderful experience, as most people are friendly and helpful to each other."
good,"being in customer service you never really know the day you will have, for the most part the job is fast paced I have learned to manage people (breaks & lunches) knowing what is needed when & where to make the front end run smooth.  I enjoy Walmart for the most part I have had to keep a level head even on the worst of days & try to keep cashiers upbeat & working strong. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing everything come together by the end of the shift, I have built a team that works together & helps me be the better manager."
good,Walmart has a well relaxed environment. Little to none stress working there. Great work place but their schedule wasn't very flexible.Would recommend.
good,"Communication helps you get through the days and the weeks"
good,I hated going in because I knew they would have me unload a difficult trailer that one man by himself would not be able to unload by himself in time but yet they expected I made my quota every night. I've learned that Wal-Mart is a very stressful place to be at and is not worth being there.Management was poor as they had favorites and had all there favorite employees unload the easiest trailers for them to make their quotas for the night. the people I worked with were pretty good but it did seem like we would need to fight each other  just to be able to reach our quotas and it felt like you can't trust no one there. Hardest part of my job was unloading heavy trailers alone and still not being able to reach your quota. The most enjoyable part was the benefits and pay.
good,"Loved my job paying bills working with the associates and management.   Enjoyed walmart "
good,Very flexible hours . Been awhile since I’ve worked for Walmart. Late shifts decent pay good people . Best part is the flexible hours .................
good,"The jobs that I had at walmart were not for me personally, but I did try at them and they are good paying jobs with the management usually being pretty understanding and good people."
good,Some days go really slow. I get schedule in areas that my job title doesn't play in to and a lot of time for weeks i'm not scheduled. The managers don't do their job and they don't sit down with you when their is a problem.
good,Working as a cashier at Walmart is very stressful because its 100 and something customers with only 3 or less lines open. Which means you have to try to go quickly to keep everyone happy and to get your line down.
good,"I worked at Wal0Mart straight out of high school in the auto department area. I think it's a good job for people when they are young, and maybe even older people as long as you have management expeirence, but there isn't much room for advancement and it takes a long time to be given the opportunity."
good,Keep your head up and you can make moves work hard and you can do great things if you make management mad there is a good chance youll stay at you level.
good,"A typical day at work: Work flow was consistent. Duties typically stayed the same on average."
good,"Was a cashier would check customers out at the register, if there was no customer we would straighten out shelves on isles that was by the register. Really friendly place to work. I liked meeting new people. The hardest part about the job was trying to be nice to the unpleasant  people."
good,"I worked nights rearranging shelves for new product."
good,I have worked experience and learned better ways to work really hard with people and show great customer service. In Portrait  Studios at Walmart i got their always on time ready for work I had a wonderful manager and gave wonderful work.
good,"working at walmart as a cap 2 supervisor is a decent place to work if you are able to adapt to frequent changes to the general process of your job, though the job can be stressfulat times."
good,"Being a cake decorator is actually really fun, but this job was was also a challenge of my speed and my ability to work under pressure. Management was alright the only thing they lacked was proper communication. A typical day at work can be stressful but at the end of the day I survive. Hardest part about my job is trying to get all the cake orders done in time especially because there was always either one or two cake decorator. Kind of impossible to finish 30 plus orders with only two of us. But besides the hard part I loved working with the girls in bakery it was work environment but it was also fun. It’s okay to have fun but still work of course otherwise the day will be a drag."
good,"A typical day at work for me was pretty uneventful, aside from the occasional spill that customers and other employees cause."
good,"I had my reasons - but would still go back to work there. People were great and fast past environment.              "
good,"Good job, crazy hours, always work late ,coworkers always smiling i enjoy doing reshops  anf scaning people items and helping then find items they need."
good,"The management team is okay, most of them don’t know what they’re doing. It’s extremely hard to move up in Walmart because they write you up over the stupidest things. The customer service managers get treated like dirt and don’t get paid as much as they should."
good,"Pulling skids from the back to the floor. "
good,"hours were good and they were flexible, management sucked but pay was good and the quarterly bonuses were great and also a discount at the store. could request more hours as needed."
good,"The workload comprised of weekly objectives that were to be met based on a store remodel blueprint. Each department in the store had a separate time to be restored and remodeled. I reassessed my communicative skills when executing tasks alongside my co-workers and supervisors. During my employment, I learned about the culture of the workplace as I met upper management whenever I had any questions. Some department managers were strict on how things were to be done to avoid confusion for the other employees and others were lenient as long as directions are followed. The most challenging part of the job was to maintain a sense of cohesion with the entire project team to make sure things get done correctly and in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was that there were meetings everyday at the beginning of the shift and after lunch break. This was a vital asset that enforced problem-solving and communicate on updates."
good,It had its up and downs but really management only cares when they absolutely have too and the sales associates were what made work a decent place to go too  managers only liked you or pretended to like you only when they felt like it
good,They offer good benefits and pay but the managers don't do a good job and they treat some employees worse then others even tho said employees work just as hard as others
good,Place is really fun to work for you can move around a lot and meet new people. Very paced place sometimes you can transfer to different areas but not always. I have been trying to get trained in management but had to go on medical leave and having some issues trying to get back to work. Hopefully soon personal person will call me back it’s a very hard to get a hold of them cause only one personal person and not always in. I really like the company and would love to move on but thee aren’t many options on things like that.  I would highly recommend people to work for them and be able to get a job there. If anyone would like a job stocking and cap 2 they are really easy on jobs to get. Unloading trucks and stocking shelves. Our Walmart is always needing cashiers but we can’t always hire. Management is really good to talk to about any issues that you are having in the work place. If customers ask for help and you can’t help you always get another associate and see if they can help. Please if anyone has concern they can call 1-800walmart and be able to rate us or complain. The store is very clean and we try to help each and everyone that comes in there. We also have electric carts for disabled people and people that need them. Now we have small carts that people love and also have the children cart so a parent can’t push with at least three or more kids. I just want to say thanks for choosing your 24 hour Princeton Walmart where we care for the safety of our customers.
good,"Working for Walmart can sometimes be stressful because of customer and management demands, but the group of people that I work with make it a good place to work. The neighborhood market that I work at has done very well. We rank very high in our regional market and have always (except for one time) earned the maximum amount for quarterly bonuses for the 2-3 years the store has been open."
good,"Front end cashier for the Christmas season.  Management was fair.  Strict requirements as cashier; i.e., so many transactions per hour, meeting all competition pricing, Food Stamps, WIC, etc.  Long hours standing, but fair breaks.  Most enjoyable part was interacting with customers during Holiday Season."
good,"ratio of Customers to associates are like 5 to 1 "
good,"As an unloader, most of the heavy lifting is your job and you dont get paid nearly enough for the stuff you do. Luckily the benefits are good and you get plenty of hours compared to other departments, so it does have its merits. If you're not a strong person, this job will also buff you up a bit with all the lifting and pulling you'll be doing. Management could be better, but it's the people from other shifts that tend to be toxic. If you have the strength and patience for this job, then it wouldn't hurt to give it a shot."
good,You usually know what your job is going to be on a consistent basis.  There can be good days and bad depending on the type of traffic there is coming into the store. Management tends to be on the up & down side. Usually it's based on the type of person they are outside of the facility. Overall workplace culture is good. Won't have too many problems as long as you're doing your job. You receive quarterly bonuses once you finish your training requirements. There isn't a strict dress code.
good,"Got fired because I went to see my grandpa that died. But the people were good, I got good training and got valuable experience in being flexible and helping others."
good,I have a great manager who is willing to work with associates who want to work. The customers for the most part are very friendly who just wanna get stuff and get out. The other associates are easy to make friends with and work with as a team.
good,It was a good company to work for. Probably would've been the best place I worked until my hours got cut forcing me to quit and relocate. Aside from that it was a decent experience
good,"Workplace with good benefits for the full-time employee."
good,Its a great place to work however when others start to relax it puts to much pressure on you getting things done because you pickup others workloads. Bu otherwise teammates make it bearable to work their.
good,"Great benefits, flexible hours, over time offered."
good,There always something keep you busy however customers and co-workers made the work day go by fast. Management was very friendly and helpful. I Enjoyed the fast pace .
good,Ten hour shifts on a set schedule was nice with three days off. Pay could have been better. Company is constantly changes job roles and responsibilities.
good,Walmart was great I loved to worked and it kept me business. I really wish they would of work with me with my pregnancy because I really need my job. I was great at what I did.
good,"very dangerous work environment, over worked for extremely high production standards, management could care less about your well-being as long as the job got done, there was a lot of favoritism with management who were friends with some of the employees, the hardest part of the job was the meeting the extremely high productions standards, the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay"
good,Learned skills had a good pay helped me with many things. Great teammates who helped me in things i didn’t quite yet do completely right because I didn’t have any experience yet.overall i got plenty of knowledge and I Loved doing my job.
good,"Only way to advane is for someone else to be fired (Often)"
good,"there are so may mangers there and they are all on different pages, so it's hard to keep up with what they really want done. i loved the manager over the deli. sometimes what they wanted done wasn't what was really best for the customer. overtime never happens. it's a great place to work at overall, but it has its cons."
good,The typical workday was long and had a lot of work that needed to be done. I learned to provide a fast and friendly service to hundreds of customers a day. The management was kind and always there for the employees and customers. The workplace culture was friendly towards the customers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and the amount of customers every day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the breaks.
good,"Working at Walmart aint hard. Just takes common courtesy and common sense, but a whole lot of patience. Management will ultimately determine how your experience will be there."
good,"Walmart will pay you to work there, and pay you well. Though they will almost always refuse to work around any schedule confliction you will ever have, and eventually point you out and fire you for it. I went from working in the deli for three months to running the entire store four nights a week. The only hiccup is that they let the upper management do absolutely whatever they want, especially if they work third shift and nobody else wants to do that job. Overall a great paying job, just terrible management skills displayed by the at the time store manager and third shift assistant manager."
good,It always helped when you love working for the management team that you had. We had a great management team and good employee's. We had a fun working environment and still got the job done.
good,"Customers aren't worth dealing with. I worked here for a year, most customers knew who I was and made an effort to be unbearable. This job is what made me decide to never work directly for the public any again."
good,wal-mart is a good company but is ran different from store to store store managers run each store differently either from store manger or district manager direction should be more consistent and allow lower level managment to do there jobs and show more care and concern for hourly associates.
good,I have nothing good or bad to say about Wal-Mart. I did love my job while I worked there. The benefits were good. I especially liked the people I worked with.
good,"Uma empresa no geral parcialmente boa,tem seus altos e baixos e suas burocracias como todos lugares tem,funcionários de todos estilos,classes,culturas,gêneros..."
good,"The sales associate and cashier positions aren't too bad most of the year. During the holiday season, the job gets a lot more stressful. Depending on who your manager is, you may be required to accomplish the same things without extra help. My store didn't hire extra help until just before black Friday and only provided just enough people to keep the returns going back on the floor. There was not enough staff to keep the product on the shelves presentable and on the correct prices. I found this very frustrating and stressful. A lot of the department managers would step down because the job was too stressful for them. I had 5 different department managers within one year in the Health and Beauty department at the store in El Mirage, AZ. Two of them stepped down and transferred to a different department, one quit and one was promoted. The last one was still there when I was transferred to a different department. I personally would not choose to work in management at Walmart. I got the impression that the managers that did well were those who were good at delegating and getting help from other departments."
good,"My experience at Walmart was bittersweet. I came from a corporate office job to retail was a major adjustment. At first, the employees there were not as welcoming but they were eager to teach me what I needed to know to do my job. Often caused by a large turnover rate I understood that they were not as welcoming and they often tested my ability. But over time I became friends with these people as well as the customers. I did a lot of growing up mentally because of the high demands. The hardest part of the job was not the job itself but leaving behind the people that I became close with. The management was not terrible but probably not the best because how short staffed we were. The turnover rate for management was high because of home office demands and store demands. My only suggestion is to listen to the employees because they are on the ""sales floor"" daily and know what is routine and what resources that can aid in a better work environment."
good,"Working at Walmart has been a learning experience and I am thankful for the skills I've acquired."
good,"I have worked at walmart for a total of 9 years 8 months.  It is a good place to work.  It could be more flexible with employees that have children, including those raising their grand children.  Recently hours have been cut.  Moral is not high because of the cut hours.  The most important part of the job is pleasing and helping customers.  The hardest part of the job is being on your feet 8 hours a day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with fellow employees as a team.  I have learned alot about customer service with Walmart and how to defuse a bad situation when it arises."
good,a typical day a Walt-mart no break was a very fast pace had to serve customers 24 hours again i had to deal with Spanish speaking customers and associates .
good,I would recommend Walmart to anyone who has never had employment so they can test the ropes I would also recommend it to people who have social security benefits that want to work part time. They’re pretty flexible with them and veterans.
good,"Make it stop. I had a good experience working there learned a lot and was about to barely pay my bills, Met great people there and fun from time to time."
good,Walmart helped me in many ways it’s just time for me to work in the field that I went to school for. Walmart went around my school schedule which helped me to get my associates in Medical Laboratory Technician!
good,In the past Walmart had clear company direction.  Some ideas worked and some didn't.  The new upper management is initiating programs that are a bit more complicated.  The premise of their ideas seem sound but there is too much that is left to get lost in translation.  To many variations of the original idea end up plaguing the store operations.
good,The job is okay depending on the attitude of your managers. The jobs are not difficult but require you to actually try. At any point if you feel like your upper are not doing their jobs go straight to the store manager.
good,Management was pretty chill and tried their best to help me learn the ropes. Like all places management can be bad but most did attempt to teach me about their roles in the store.
good,Photolab requires 'multi-tasking' and does not allow you to do your job once a customer needs help. It was very stressful and management didn't seem to understand the problem.
good,Wal-Mart was a great working experience for me. Wal-Mart taught me responsibility and patience because sometimes work can get stressful. Favorite part about the job was zoning when you neatly display all your night hardwork by making sure this section is most presentable.
good,"Walmart was an easy job, but rarely offers more hours or full time positions. It was a paycheck but could not take much else from the job itself. Very mediocre."
good,Wal mart was a pretty decent place to work. I really didn't like the ladies in the HR office they seemed nice for the orientation. You will have no problems if you are constantly working
good,I worked here for a time and had different managers and worked different departments. Hours were few and got less as time went on. They do not regularly keep registers filled.
good,Very good environment and people.  Very competitive with other employees. Very busy so we have to flow at a good and safe paste. Meeting a lot of good new customers
good,"Stressful but can do it, friendly poeple to work with. "
good,"At Walmart, there are opportunities to advance in pay grades in a quick amount of time. Hard work and dedication are key. However, during certain times of the year, there are cuts in hours that take place. There are also times when it feels like some people are favored over others, unfortunately. You need to make sure you are able to help customers daily and have a personality for it. There are a lot of times when salaried management will tell you they'll do something and it won't always happen. Sometimes you have to push them to get things done."
good,Good environment workable hours good people to work around always with a smile clean stations dress code and Will.                Help when needed and just get to greet people
good,Management at times would ask for an opinion Nd if it went against there's or any thing they said it was looked as if you were trying to make them look bad and they would hold a grudge.
good,Although it is a great first job for some people. The ability to go anywhere but down is really a problem. There needs to be a more effective system to help those that want to advance more instead of dragging them down and forcing them out.
good,"Walmart started out as fun, but about January we had a major management  change in which nearly everyone had changed, there were  around 3 people there that had been there longer than my self at the time of  my termination,I had intended to begin searching for jobs in the following week prior to my termination."
good,"Walmart is and was a nice place to work, my only real complaints is that management took no responsibility for mistakes, or foul ups that may have been caused by them.  "
good,"I liked working at the walmart i was at because the team was great and was there to help and support you. The expectation where high, as is many jobs. I caught on to the routine quickly and got the approval of my manager. The down fall is the drama amongst coworkers. Over all good place."
good,"Trabajo estenuante, demanda gran parte de tu vida y rara vez se reconoce, crecen los que se ganan al jefe."
good,It was an alright place to work at the time. The hours are depended by the time of year and most of the time your hours will be cut. Some times you will have to work in other areas that you are not trained for. For example: I was hired as a cashier but I had to spend four months pushing carts due to management firing all but two cart pushers at the time and didn't bother bringing in anyone else to replace them.
good,Some nice customers some very rude customers same with coworkers it’s Walmart which attracts every and all kind of people to come through meet someone new like every couple of weeks cause someone either quit or got fired and they rehired
good,While this company does offer a wide variety of career roles; ultimately it struggles with communication between management and employees. This can result in a loss of production ouput! The company tends to struggle with providing an optimal work/life balance; which has resulted in higher turnover.
good,the hardest part was getting everything done with a short staff I learned how to read labels and communicate with costumers better the management team did not communicate with one another the most enjoyable part of the job was pulling the merchandise to the floor so overnight could stock it
good,Working at walmart was a great expirence i got to learn new things picked up alot of skills about communication and working as a team the people there are amazing to work with although they have poor management
good,"Walmart needs to remember that it is there to serve the people in the community it is located. That means providing adequate staff and services to meet the needs of its customers . It needs to be more customer service driven, which in turn,  will promote more sales and a better bottom line."
good,"very fun, friendly and also very communicative place to work at. If you have any question you can always stop by the office on your lunch or break an speak to a supervisor or manager."
good,"Employees don’t quit jobs, they quit the people. There was so much high school type drama that you literally could not go a work day without people slacking off to gossip. There were cliques and stereotypes that was beyond ridiculous."
good,it was a decent experience but I hated working the overnight shifts & at times the overnight management didn't what they were doing which was stressful
good,Walmart was a good job as my first job in the Dairy Department. After a while you do get sick of it as the job requires you to go in the freezer and as the new employee you will be forced to go into the freezer by the employees who have been working there before you.
good,"In produce it is full of fun with diversified customer and variety of natural products, which give an art aimable.the hole shift you are stocking fresh fruits and vegetebles in vacant places or by replacing the same items which looks less to be purchased."
good,"Family like culture. Management :some are good, some micromanage. Fun enviroment and fun people."
good,Walmart teaches you a lot about diversity in a work setting and being a team.  You get to meet your community and get to know the people that are shopping in you store.  I enjoyed my job at Walmart doing the accounting and administrative duties.
good,"It was a good job and I enjoyed working with a number of people, I like it when everyone comes on board and work together to get the project done. But there were a few that did not work well with the company."
good,I would work there again but I wouldn't want to make a career out of it. That said if you do want a career its not that hard to get into a supervisor position if you want it.
good,"The hardest part about the job are the hours that you are required to work, holidays are the days that you work the most. life and work balance does not exist."
good,Decent place to work.  Can be trying at times.  Home office can be limiting in what they tell you about what they want.  Store runs as good as its managers.
good,Walmart is what you make it. You have to be willing to grow and be self motivated. There's a ton of room for growth and you get to meet some awesome people along the way>
good,"Different management change a lot, I like associates, fun place without being stressful at times, everybody work together with each other without member of management"
good,"My workweek started at 6:30 am on Monday and I usually Stayed out until Friday in the early evening. I delivered and picked up freight to and from stores, clubs, distribution centers and vendors. The pace was fast but not unreasonable. Our local management team was always professional and ready to listen to ideas and help with problems. The culture when I was hired was what led to my desire to work there and then led me to retire. The change was so quick and so total that I had to go ahead with plans to retire 2.5 years earlier than I wanted to. The things that I miss the most are the great people that I worked with. The drivers, shop and office were second to none and I miss them most of all."
good,Not enough support staff. Management was asking for too much production.The necessity to create a profit was more important than the customer or the employee.
good,"I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart, there are a lot of great associates working for the company. As a manager I gave a lot of direction, I followed up hourly and management associates. I maintained control over inventory and sales within my store."
good,"People were awesome to work with! Management turn over rate was rediculous. Lots of room to move within the company though! Pay was reasonable, raises were offered."
good,"It was a pleasant experience. I worked there for 10 years."
good,it was fine for the pay. the people were kind and the management tried to work with you to the best of their ability. i would not mind working there again.
good,it was a very fun and exciting place to work with family oriented atmosphere. Job advancement was limited as it was cut throat. People and customers were very limited to area and company seemed to care more about profit than their associates
good,"1. Stocking and organizing shelves"
good,"the job offers good pay, starting at 11. if you have the drive for the job you will succeed at doing it. i enjoy working with the public and with the fixed schedule i am able plan personal thing accordingly."
good,"Really not as bad as people make it out to be the managers help you, and there is room to move up however it is difficuly sometimes. The people are great though and its not a hard job."
good,En la empresa aprendí a tratar a los clientes así como solucionar problemas bajo presión.
good,Clean jewelry and the area. Check for price changes and stocking products and items. Zoning around the area. I learn about the system of working in Jewelry its quite a bit that you have to learn and know about things. The management is fair with you and customers and the workplace I enjoy just learning and keeping occupied with whatever needs to be done. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that try to get over on you. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co workers its pleasant to have someone there with you besides you being the only one there  mostly.
good,it is fast-paced. There is room for advancement. you can't really call off and it can be difficult to use your sick time. the team can be great depending on your location.
good,You earn every penny they pay you.  Schedules are hard for a decent family life.  You either have to get up really early or you work evenings.  There is no A/C so the summers are hot.  High productivity and quality goal.
good,"If you just want a paycheck it's a great place. In order to advance you must be in tight with the store manager, if she doesn't like you, you will get nowhere. I have a set schedule but the hours are late and hard to move postitions. Gives yearly raise when minimum wage goes up than 2% if you have had no trouble"
good,my experience was a nice easy pace work. had reasonable break times. and the employs were kinda as such as the managers were there to help in my situations
good,"Management team suck, and their pay rate doesnt match the job duties. Must be flexible theres no set job schedule. Breaks short and the customers are rude."
good,"Assisted customers in finding what they needed. Implemented inventory management, process transactions, sell fishing licenses, make keys for customer cars, process paint orders in hardware department."
good,"working at Walmart was very stressful, it was a lot of work, and they expected a lot out of you. management always was very indecisive on what they would ask of their employees. being understaffed at one point would require one department to cover the surrounding departments as well as their own. but working for walmart as far as pay was very fair. the raises and bonuses were great as well as benefits too. working in a team environment was amazing and i really enjoyed the other employees"
good,"its a good place to work. Its fun and great people. Its fast pace and lots of opportunities if you try, its easy to get to know where thing are located at for putting items away."
good,"i like do my job as a cashier it was very good learning take advice from customers  helping them out was the biggest  plan , i admire doing my job but the pay was not enough."
good,Walmart Distribution was a decent work place. Everyone was treated far and every was taught very thoroughly how to conduct their job. At that particular warehouse a team of two people had to print and tag our own flow stickers & also had to unload and load our truck
good,The job was what you would consider a job at Walmart to be. My immediate supervisor was awesome. I would recommend working at Walmart to friends and family.
good,"My District manager was the problem here not the store manager, The DM had no idea what they were doing as they were new to the role. Pay and benefits were great."
good,"Long shifts, extremely active, exhausting job.  Walk at least five miles a day, lift 30,000lbs+ of frozen product in -20 degrees F.    Position at the absolute bottom of the hierarchy."
good,I worked well with co workers and the building was clean and always neat my supervisors were very helpful and professional my job position did not pay much
good,If I had to work within the Walmart company again I would take a different approach on scenarios. Clusters are great and they make things very interesting when helping them make sections on what to use during different meals.
good,"Fast paced, interesting work.   Can be rewarding, but associates never feel comfortable in role due to constant threat of layoffs at home office.    Leadership is strong in some areas, not so strong in others.   Very important to be well connected throughout organization, as typical large company politics exist and are important for advancement and retention."
good,"The management team I worked with was great. The goals set by corporate for less man hours in the store and low pay overall has negatively impacted the culture."
good,I think it’s a great place to start a career if it’s your first job you will learn a lot of new things for future work it’s also easy to move up in the ranks
good,Walmart is not a bad place to work as long as you can physically keep up with what is expected of you. If there are good management in place at the store you work for it is a wonderful place to work. If not it can be the worse place to work as in any business it depends on management to create a good work environment.
good,The system in place is very misguided to say the least. The managers are incompetent and have no desire to inspire their employees. The work consisted of unloading and stocking over and over again.
good,I didn't mind the job itself but I always seemed to get the rudest customers. You explain a policy to them and they just scream at you and ask for your manager. Then the manager tells them the same thing and they quit. It's stupid. Working with customers was the most stressful part of my job.
good,"I learn a lot working on the backroom like how to use electric pallet jack, how to stack properly, work safely  and I'm still learning lots of things."
good,"They start you off with the first six months where you can only call off four times, because they function on a point based absence system. While that sounds decent a no call/no show ends ip being worth four points and is therefore instant termination. Aside from that, any tardy, regardless of excused or not, counts as half a point, and points do not roll off annualy but six months from the date of the occurence. So it is a very stressful workplace, but the pay is decent, as you start at 9$/hour and after six months and the completion of your CBL’s you get a raise to 10$/hour but the only other raises you can get are yearly, at only 10% a year up to 15$ at most as an hourly associate."
good,"Manage a group of sales associates, department manager and support manager in retail. Support the associate in the daily operations of a retail store. Supervise the store and provide oversight functions on which the drive for excellence in sales is achieved. Responsible for carrying out scheduling and merchandising duties."
good,Walmart was a good place to work for me. I learned a lot of information from customers and coworkers. If I ever had the opportunity to work for Walmart again I would.
good,"I started at Wal-Mart almost 7 years ago.  Our first day on the job was suppose to be our orientation day.  It was about 100 or so employees that arrived that day.  The store was completely empty, only the floor shined brightly in the building.  Our orientation day turned out to be our building day.  The employees and I put every shelf together.  We stuck every sticker on each shelf.  We built and put together for about 2 months.  Finally, on a beautiful day in January 2011, we opened.  I felt so proud to be a part of such a wonderful experience.  Every day wasn't easy, but it was definitely worth it.  I enjoyed my position as a Certified Pharmacy Technician.  I enjoyed forming relationships with our patients and doing my best for them.  The workplace culture was blended and management, in both pharmacy and the store were awesome.  I have learned so much from Wal-Mart.  The hardest part of my job will be leaving after being there for so long.  I want to grow with a company. I do not job hop.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with wonderful people.  Although I have decided to leave Wal-Mart, it is not a reflection of my feelings for them.  At this time there is no room for growth or advancement at Wal-Mart for me."
good,Experience can very from location to location.  Increases in hourly pay has brought cuts in hours available to associates.  Changes in management structure has caused difficulty in advancement.
good,"Easy job to get and keep, easy work, lots of options for different positions (if you apply at a supercenter), generous with overtime, schedule and other information was very conveniently accessible (even from home, on your cell or computer), very easy to request days off and schedule changes"
good,"If you have real bills to pay such as rent, electric, water, car payments and insurance, this is not the best place to work because your hours are base on the store profits from week to week.  So you may get 40 hours one week and get 12 hours the next week and this is because everyone is pretty much hired as part time employees so they do not guarantee a 40 hour week.  This makes a lot of other jobs better than Wal-Mart and Sam's Club.  So if you are hired as a full time employee, just consider yourself a lucky person."
good,"Being an Associate in Walmart is a great life experience for because it is a great workplace, I have learnt a lot in terms of the steps in which you take to accomplish a job and also observing safety measures."
good,walmart was an overall great company with associates who provided great customer service. however our customers had a lot of complaint about what kind of products we didn't have compared to a bigger walmart considering this walmart was fairly new.
good,"Not all shifts are the same, but the overnight shift is extremely fast-paced. You are assigned an aisle or location and only given a certain amount of time to finish stocking. Sometimes you also cover breaks or are called up front to cashier."
good,"I was initially hired for 3rd shift stocking ( the gentleman that hired me told me that I had to start 3rd shift and would be moved to a different shift after my training.) I was fine with this but had made it very clear that I was starting school within the next couple months and could not stay on 3rd shift. I was told it would be no problem, but when it came for me to start classes the manager refused to move me to another shift stating I had agreed to 3rd shift and that is the only shift he'll give me."
good,it was okay could have been better. I probably would never work there again because of some problems I had with them about respect and disrespect threw out the store with the mangers and workers.
good,"Empresa que oferece muita chance de crescimento, passei por todos os setores operacionais sempre através de promoções. Tudo sempre direcionado ao atendimento ao cliente com vários treinamentos e algumas viagens para dar suporte em outras lojas.Nos últimos anos trabalhei diretamente na frente de caixa e tesouraria. O ambiente é muito bom e temos apoio da gerência quando necessário, acredito que não tem uma parte difícil quando trabalhamos no que gostamos."
good,"The management staff above me is rude, inconsiderate, and always picking favorites. The hours are completely inconsistent, you never are really able to plan anything, you cannot request off for anything without regretting it because no matter the situation it goes against you, and you are never guaranteed hours."
good,"Regardless of how much you work, its never enough. Not very flexible with availability. Management is very favorable. Learned all aspects of the department and still was hard to move up."
good,"Like I said above, pay isn't great. I don't recommend working there unless you're good with change. It's a decent company to evolve in if you really want to make it a career. Pay raises are horrible to say the least."
good,Fun for a job. Good people. It seams like you are the only one that ever works everyone else seams to play to much and not get anything done and expect you to bail them out at the end of the day.
good,"Walmart is a great place to start off working for students and elderly people. A typical day at Walmart is also a learning day at Walmart you can expect the unexpected. Walmart is a place where you can meet new people,how to become more people friendly and is a great place to help with your talking and people skills. You have different  variety of people to meet from different cultures. The management was kinda poor but over all this place is a great place to work meeting new people and learning new things was a great achievement for working at Walmart"
good,"The staff was very helpful they also worked in a team setting and was attentive to everything that was going on in the store, the supervisors was always available when needed. I enjoyed working with the customers and staff"
good,"walmart uma empresa multinacional fantastica mais os diretores que dirigem as lojas nao seguem procedimentos da empresa,falo pelas lojas que trabalhei."
good,The managers are rude at times. I was not allowed more than 5 hours a day due to child laws? The atmosphere is good most of the time. The employees are nice.
good,Never Stay Consistent with Programs. Management are never on the same page. It's never staffed to better help the customers. you can lose your pay if your position is no longer available.
good,"I learned a lot working for Walmart. There was always opportunity to learn new positions and possibilities for promotion. I started in the bakery and I came to learn every position before moving to automotive department in 2010. Once again, I was given the opportunity to learn all of the positions and I received certifications for 4/5 positions as a automotive technician. I was one of the top tire salesman in our district. I was asked to run the department for 8 months while the manager was on leave in 2012-13. In June 2013 I was promoted to Zone Merchandise Supervisor."
good,"Once you see all the beginning benefits and what not it seems great but the longer you are there the less and less you receive and even have the opposite effect. Hours, pay,and higher wages all go to the new employees."
good,Working here can be an up or down thing. some days are good some are not. its really not the job its the people they hire and the people they hire for managers.
good,"Fast paced, can be very stressful especially during the Holidays. Do your job and you'll be fine, practice customer service is something they really look at as well."
good,"expect too much from one person to get multiple things done in only 6 hours of working time, not enough staff to ensure all gets done in the shift, lack of issues not being resolved, not being trained to the fullest before starting the position"
good,"I don’t want to get too much into it.ill try not to be negative.it was and OKAY job.pay was decent.Management it would depend some are annoying and could get to you  and some are nice.thats life.i didn’t really get Benefits cause I was part time.all in all,just do your job and listen to talk back and everything will be okay.sometimes you may have to speak up for yourself but if you do so,do it in a classy way."
good,"Worked in several  dept through out the store."
good,It was a good job i loved interacting with customers i just didnt like the hour decrease. I enjoyed learning new things i worked in different areas of the store and learning all the products
good,My time there was brief unfortunately. Most of my tasks were fairly straight forward. Restock new products and help the occasional late night customer.
good,You would take care of customers and stock as well as keeping the store clean and safe. The management would usually have a crisis and take you to assist with it and some of the management was pretty clueless.
good,Work days are long but depending on your shift you have three to four days off. The pay is pretty good on the hour and the managers work with you if you need time off. If you intend on going to school they will work with your schedule so you can keep your job and still get an education. Same thing goes for the brave men and women who serve in the military. Walmart will secure your job if you get deployed overseas.
good,i liked working at Walmart. i loved making customers happy and feeling at home. i just felt  it was time for me to try something different . I would recommended Walmart as a first time job
good,"I like the people I work with, but the corporate culture leaves a lot to be desired. Their motto is 'respect for the individual,' but that only goes so far. The company comes first, not unlike most other companies."
good,"* decent pay"
good,"Lugar onde a muita comunicação, as pessoas trabalham animadas e com excelencia."
good,it was ok i love working at walmart...i wish i could go back and work again at walmart.....i would recomend this to my friends to work in this company
good,The typical day would be when employees put freight up and help customers. The most enjoyable part of my job would be getting to know my coworkers while working.
good,"There is always work for you to do at Wal-Mart, if you're done with your task, there will be another one for you. Your supervisor keeps you busy, which is great. I learned at Wal-Mart that not all jobs are the same, when I say that I mean overall. Management was really different from my previous. The management was not very great. But the work was actually, you are kept busy, which is a good thing. The work isn't very hard, you just have to keep a steady paste, no slowing down, you have to work fast in order to get your job done. The most enjoyable part about this job is actually the customers, depending on your mood, the customers will make your day good or even better for you, just by conversation or even a little smile."
good,Wasn't the worst place to work but they pay is extremely low. Management was decent and they some what care about you .. Decent discount on merchandise.
good,"Pay was a little higher than minimum, they worked with my schedule, had a fair attendance policy, there were many opportunities to advance or move to other departments if you wanted."
good,"Managers did not like for us to talk and joke a little just to make work fun. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with the customers and the members of management. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be my amazing coworkers, and getting to work on the cars. A typical day at work consisted of a high paced work environment."
good,I did to a certain point enjoy my time at walmart but after a while it really is hard to work for a company that thinks very little of thier employees
good,"A typical work day is you show up and start working where you are required to work. What I've learned were people skills. Management were some good and some bad. The work place was sometimes friendly and sometimes not so friendly, it was a mix of all types of emotions. The hardest part of the job was working out in the cold and storms. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company cookouts."
good,"management changes a lot in cap 2, employee turnover is really high. word of advice, tell them you are doing the best that you can all the time, otherwise they will work you until you to exhaustion, and keep track of the amount of work and the time you complete it in. some of the managers are incompetent with the details about your job and will offer suggestions. politely acknowledge them. the workplace culture is very distant, very cold and unfriendly although you are expected to reflect the opposite to the customer. if you don't get involved with gossip and keep quiet and do your job, you'll be fine. pay is decent. it's enough to live on, i can't do it full time and have another job so i don't get bored and lose my focus, with something as pedantic as that job."
good,"Arrive early every day never late. Greet fellow employees and customers alike, always with a positive greeting.  Always walk thru my area to have idea what priorities. Walked thru back room to check current stock, to see what may have arrived overnight. "
good,They have opportunities for anyone to advance up into management. Co-workers help build each other up and come together as a team to get the job done.
good,"Must load trucks daily with diversified merchandise, no fun time, good benefits, management may seem fair to certain employees. Need a change from the company"
good,Walmart is a nice company to work for.  It is in the middle of a major transition from a regular company to an internet giant.  They are struggling to reach their goal but I believe they will get there in the next 5 years.
good,"Great place to work, awesome people and a great environment. The employees are very helpful and kind, worked there for quite some time and I enjoyed my time being there."
good,Walmart is a nice beginning job for someone trying to gain experience. For an family man or woman as a career move you most have tons of patience’s. Would I even work for Walmart again if the pay was right yes otherwise no.
good,Depending on your department your work experience will vary. My department (CAB 2) was fast paced and will give you tasks and times for the task. But overall if you can keep the job it is a positive experience.
good,"Une journée en tant que caissier chez Walmart, c'était pour moi une journée remplie. Au fil du temps, j'ai compris que le plus important était l'entreprise et non l'employé. Nous étions traités comme des numéros, sans vouloir nécessairement dénigrer l'entreprise. En tant qu'étudiant au secondaire, je faisais 25 heures par semaine et des 8 heures, même 9 heures par jour la fin de semaine. Pour certains, ceci n'est pas une source d'inconfort ou de négligence, mais pour quelqu'un qui écrit un maximum de 15 heures par semaines et un maximum de 6 heures par jour sur sa feuille de disponibilités, c'est négligeable."
good,"I started working for Walmart as an overnight stocker. It was hectic and fast paced to get as much stock put out each night. I liked it. I switched to the bakery when my child started school, because it was  hard to get sleep during summer vacations. Bakery wasn't as fast paced by it was busy. I helped bake bread, packaged donuts, took orders for cakes. I liked the work but the manager could have been more supportive in the teamwork. Less criticism and nagging, and more praise and smiles."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people with whom i worked with. They have many different areas in which to work so it is easy to learn different skills.
good,"Honeestly, it's a decent job for awhile. But, not a long-term depending on how the store's being ran with whoever managers they have hired. Because everything can be unfair for everyone else if the managers aren't either well-trained or reasonable. Overall, CAP 2 is okay if things go as planned or the manager's aren't getting on your nerves though."
good,The managers walk around the store and ask you about when the work is done several times a day. They don't seem to understand that more people doesn't mean quicker work.
good,Overall WalMart is a good place to work. I learned a lot about diversity. Everyday was different except the same customers made it more comfortable.  The job was easy to perform as long as you like people as I do. Management changed a lot.
good,"As long as you come to work when scheduled and do your best, you can succeed at Walmart.  They have a variety of positions so you transfer to a position that is best suited to your personality."
good,Enjoyed working with all my co-workers and employers.  Loved learning new things. Greeting the customers and making sure they were satisfied.  Helping solve problems
good,"I enjoyed what i did for the first couple of months, but management and other factors of the job made it harder to enjoy working there. I would step inside a freezer/cooler for hours on end doing back breaking labor."
good,"It is a good place to work, with a lot of opportunities for growth. Management can be both very amazing and sometimes not much help, but overall they try their best. There is something for everyone there and it is a happy environment, laid back in a fast paced kind of way."
good,"i learned customer experience "
good,"I don't know what people expect. It's a job at a large retailer."
good,"As a regular associate I found working at Wal-Mart to be a fair and reasonable place of employment, but as a manager the hassle has not been worth the stress and aggravation."
good,Associates are very friendly and are there to help whenever you need. As a customer who shops there as well the staff is amazing with helping. Also being a working member there it makes it easier for me to help other people with their needs and inform myself with general knowledge of the place to ask less questions when i shop for myself.
good,Typical shift would start at 11pm and end at 7am.  Would clean restrooms and restock bathroom supplies.  would sweep and mop all floors as instructed by supervisor.  Strip and wax floors per supervise and Walmart schedule.  Would gather carts from parking lot when needed.
good,When I first started working there everyone showed me the ropes but I kind of knew what I was doing though and I mean even knowing how to read the bar code.
good,"Walmart's best quality is the opportunity to be promoted. Any starting employee can qualify for the next pay grade. The first skill I learned on the job was time management. I was usually given several tasks at the beginning of my shift and was expected to finish them by the end. Upon promotion, I learned to deal with issues fluently. Almost daily, I have problems that are completely new and unique. Through watching my peers at work and experience on the job, I learned to never be overwhelmed. This is perhaps the most difficult part of my job. The pure variety of challenges can feel stifling. Ultimately, however, I enjoy the challenge. This makes me a better employee every day."
good,"Always room to progress and learn new department, but challenging to move toward management possibilities.  Wal-Mart Distribution can be a physically challenging environment to endure, but the reward is the pay.  Wal-Mart offers competitive wages for the area.  Over all if you enjoy fast paced logistics this is the place for you.  Decent benefits(401k, Health, Vision, and Dental), stock options, sweat shirts for meeting production goals, and a Wal-Mart discount card after 6 months of Service."
good,"This was my very first paying job and ti was okay. Walmart is a huge company and working there, you don't really get to know anyone outside of your assigned department. Management can be rude and tricky sometimes but they can also be very helpful. Supervisors for my department were rude and always made sure to find something wrong with how you were doing things."
good,A typical day at Walmart was always busy and never a dull moment. I was a cashier and was able to meet all kinds of personalities and characters. I learned how to be more patient than I already was. Some customers challenged you with their attitude but I found that if you continue to smile and be nice they pretty much give you that same respect. There was a lot of diversity at Walmart. working with many different nationalities was quite interesting and intriguing. The hardest part of my job was going from cashier to stocking in the same night. I held both titles. So just as I was beginning to talk and laugh with the customers management would need me to stock some merchandise in another department. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to create new relationships with either the employees or the customers. I am a people person so interacting with people is at the top of my list of things I love to do.
good,I enjoyed the people but the lack of life wasn't worth the money.You can make a good living with this company but at this time in my life it wasn't worth the time I had to give up with my children
good,I wanted to work at Walmart because they never had a cashier available when I went in so I thought ...why not apply. I worked very hard and really enjoyed it.
good,"A typical day at work was always fast paced. Breaks had to be on time all the time, even if I had to give the breaks myself. Covering the front end when we were short handed was always very difficult, leaving customers unhappy. "
good,"I didn't mind my job in the slightest, however I had issues with certain management as far as regulating my schedule to meet my daily living requirements as well. They refused to give me the hours i needed."
good,I stayed busy for my entire shift. I was able to learn just about every aspect of the store. I was promoted very quickly and the culture of family is evident every day. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with my customers and providing them with the help they needed
good,"I rather enjoyed working at Walmart. There were some slight personal issues I've had. Worked part time, Learned to run multiple department. Hardest part of job would be aggressive customers."
good,Management was unwilling to work with employees when something happened. They also didnt resolve problems within the store. I feel as though they need better training instead of throwing people into their positions
good,"What can I say? Walmart is a leader in retail and marketing, and it shows in their production. Outstanding growth within the corporation and benefit oppurtunities makes this the place to be."
good,It’s a good company to work for management is easy to work with On a normal work day would do truck PMs change oil and grease trucks and inspect for any DOT problems fix as need
good,"I have learned that some people will target you and you just have to work through it because you will be retaliated by management; especially, if you don't agree with them."
good,the company invests in the associates training they have a lot of long term associates there it is a family like work environment it is a great place to lean about retail
good,"night shift: 2-3 skids per department to be unpacked every night. clean shelves as you go and keep your work area clean."
good,"As a  cashier your'e always busy, most of the time your'e one of the two cashiers there and constantly getting yelled at because ""Your'e moving too slow"" other than that it was pretty decent."
good,"I started in the backroom overnight. I worked very hard and was promoted about once a year. With in 5 years I became an ASM, ASSISTANT STORE MANAGER. That is where I lost who I was. My work life balance became work with life sprinkled in. The Pay Difference from associate to management is vast."
good,The work days would felt short because he work was fun and I felt like I was actually being productive. The other associates were easy ti get along with and if I was ever doing group work it would get done quick and well.
good,"Greeting customers to handle sales, returns, complaints and other issues. I learned to operate a cash register, push for incentives. Sometimes management is Great and others are so disrespectful."
good,"The management at Walmart was poor, very unorganized store. The hardest part about the job was not having the available tools to work with for ex. the TC and Printer were never charged they also only had one for each department  which would make it difficult for one to get the job done sooner."
good,"I learned alot working there on how to order clothes, baby items, how to set mods, mark down per percentage and continue to take down until all items were sold."
good,"Fast paced work. The volume of sales and freight flow can be demanding. It pays well for the work, as a member of management. There are some good opportunities for advancement."
good,"Working at Walmart is fun, collaborative and stressful. If you work with a good team and respectful department manager than you're in good hands. If you have the opportunity to advance, DO IT!"
good,Walmart is a great place to move up in a business and there is always new and improved information and implementations that make it a great place for customers and associates.The hardest part is inspiring people to do the right thing no matter who might be watching or listening. The most enjoyable part is helping whether its a associate with a issue or a customer who needs an item. I have learned how to build a successful team that can handle anything.
good,The Walmart Culture is very strong and help associates to be focus on the company mission.I work on Sams Club format for 15 years and I enjoyed work with them.
good,"Walmart can be a great place to work, but the culture and guidelines that impact your day to day responsibilities can and do vary wildly between teams, even if they are in the same area!"
good,"This job was good for earning some extra money while I was going to college. Schedules could always be changed to fit my availability. The work itself never felt satisfying and the wages are not something you could live on. Additionally, hours for the entire store would be frequently cut, and while I do enjoy the extra time off, the decrease in pay hurts greatly."
good,While the money was pretty good. The co-workers were awesome & some days it was the easy job ever!! There was times where they would want you to work over 8 hours and not pay you for the time you worked!!! Managers wasn't the best. The thing that got me was  not being a frozen and dairy associate but having to work over there a lot and not getting paid what frozen and dairy associates get paid. Even when I was working over there a lot I tried to get moved over there.. they said no but continued to put me over there (frozen and dairy associates get paid than normal grocery stockers. They get paid $12 I got paid $10) It wasn't the worst job Ive heard most walmarts are great to work for by people who have been at them for awhile. Just the one I worked at in particular wasn't ideal!
good,"I was able to move up from a part-time associate to a Co-Manager in five years. Walmart recently restructured Co-Managers, 3,500 Co-Manager positions were eliminated. Very difficult for all affected by this change."
good,"This job is physically demanding. The pay is good but you will work for your money. Great benefits package, especially the 401k and stock option. There are opportunities to advance."
good,"Some management and priority issues but overall a good job. Flexible hours, good pay that keeps increasing, holiday gifts and discounts. Good management filters in and out and sadly poor management mainly remains but most shifts you do your job and don't interact with them."
good,"I go into work on time usually, I learned what a stocker has to do, however my management didn't teach to well. I enjoyed the employees since they were all very positive to work with."
good,"Working for Walmart can be very busy on most days. Long lines of customers needing your undivided attention, and having to move at a fast steady paste at all times. While working there I saw management come and go so rules was changed up a lot. One of the hardest things I had too deal with while working for Walmart was management due to the pressure that was put on them and taking out on the cashiers wasn't easy but I kept a smile on and didn't let that affect my job. The most enjoyable thing about working for Walmart was being able to interact with customers."
good,Always something to do so the day goes by fast. Management micromanages a little too much. Good benifits after time with the company requirement has been meet. Hard to get full time unless you are a department manager or higher.
good,"I wouldn't work at Walmart again. All business have pros and cons. From a personal perspective, to many cons for me. The retail industry is not for me personally. My days are over with dealing with stock and counting cash."
good,I worked here more as a stepping stone to get a better job. The people were great to work with but they weren't always clear on what exactly to do in certain situations.
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart because it was more than a team, it was more like a family.I was fairly paid and treated properly and evenly among the other coworkers."
good,Its an ok job to work but managment was not organized nor communicable. Its a fast paste work place always busy will keep u on ur toes great benefits.
good,Some days the job can be challenging but as long as everyone is working together the job will run smoothly. I feel that management could be more active with workers.
good,I have learned a few things from walmart such as quality assurance and production management. Management could be better. the actual workplace is not what i would called great. hardest part of the job is 12 hours of standing.
good,It is a special place for people who have thick skin.I personally would not recommend anybody apply for the deli. I've heard that other departments are less of a hole but I don't know.
good,I learned great customer service skills and learned how to be competitive. The workplace culture is good as long as you're doing your job correctly. Most enjoyable part of job was working with the people of Walmart.
good,"Walmart is the perfect job for someone who can multitask and doesnt mind floating around the store. from cashiers to deli associates, you wll eventually become a floater with no job offer."
good,Loved seeing & talking to my customers. I loved working at the self check out registers the best because more space. You did your own thing over there
good,"I learned a lot , but working hours were not suitable to my family and my kids. If I were single, it would be a good opportunity. I did my best, helping my coworkers and enjoy working with everyone."
good,i enjoyed my job but the management wasn't cooperative with my school schedule when i told hem i would be staring my college classes. they wanted me to work all hours of the night.
good,"You really have to pick and choose your battles with this company. I've been here for 3 years and in the beginning it's really great. You have great benefits and managers are generally pretty understanding. Once you've been with the company for over a year or two though you start to see the issues within the company. Walmart as a whole company is incredible, but it seems management at a store level lacks to take action when problems arise and don't really listen to their employees problems. They are always taking the side of the customer which makes the employees just doing their job look bad. If you're okay with having maybe one good manager out of 20, but have amazing coworkers and decent pay, then I would highly suggest applying."
good,"Constantly lifting, staying productive, great people to work with, minimum room for any mistakes, break room has game systems and basketball goals, management easy to get along with."
good,"Not a bad place to work at you can make your schedule out to as you see fit, but depending on what department you work. you may cut your hours or they wont give you any especially if you been there awhile."
good,Wal-Mart  is a huge business. Many managers and associates. My time working there I developed great work ethics. Working many departments. It was an ok job
good,It was and team oriented environment which share multiple ideas that would drive the customers to enjoy their spending and shopping experience.  We also kept the stores stocked.
good,"Good people, was a good place to work.  The hours moved around too much and could not plan anything more then two weeks out.  Good place to work if you like customer service."
good,Walmart is a decent place to work for like most corporate companies they don't want to give you full time hours because they don't want to have to give you the benefits that go with them. I was told that I did a really good job and could move up to be an apartment manager and eventually a store manager if I pursued it. I enjoyed being able to set up just blaze and the freedom to be creative. Not a big fan of Christmas time Black Friday with their lack of cashiers
good,"There are many entry level opportunities within the company. It is possible to advance through supervisor and management positions, however it is difficult to reach a certain level because of the reduction in positions that has taken place across the complany."
good,"I learned a lot about running a Deli and Management. I met a lot of nice people to work with, still in touch with several of my old coworkers. Decent discounts and bonuses."
good,I have been at the company for a while  now and it has been ok to me but they are not the best company to work for if you have a family don't take doctor noted and are very impersonal
good,I don't work there anymore it was fine while I was there they did try to keep an uplifting feeling among the associates. Encouraged associates to advance
good,"Typical day started with working pallets out on the floor, then working any extras in the back. at the end of the day, everyone would work on blocking and facing."
good,i liked working there but you cannot do over time unless your management . so no extra moneys ! they don't approve sick days so you will get a point and if you get 9 you are terminated.
good,"Limpa, organizada fisicamente, bem ampla e novos uniformes."
good,"Job Requires you to throw yourself into their world, and for the most part it's sink or swim. Yes, you do get training, however, the management all want you to attain a high level of speed."
good,I am still employed at Walmart.  Fast paced environment for single people that don't have children to care for. I am a manager and I spend 13 hours a day at my store which makes it impossible for me to balance my life at home. Schedule conflicts with personal goals.
good,Its an easy place to work but can be stressful and some positions are badgered. Most customers are reasonable but some customers can cause minor trouble.
good,"Walmart taught me the skills needed to advance in other companies. The employees were diverse. Management switched often, not leaving much for bonding and growing as a team."
good,I have worked in Produce for several years.  The processes are always changing.  They want the new process to be up and running completely by the end of the week that it came out.  They put a lot of duties on you and expect it to get it all done by the end of the day.
good,I do not want to write a review so I will give minimal facts about Walmart.  Walmart is a big company.  They have stores in lots of towns.  You might have shopped there.  They do good things.
good,my typical day at work is to come in work on my everyday duties and if their is time help with other duties around. I learned a lot working in the retail business. Good management team that will work with you. Good workplace culture. the hardest part of the job is not having the tools and the support when dealing with customers. A good day a t work is seeing a smile on a customer face.
good,"In PFL, your by yourself and working so fast paced doing the same thing for the entire day. Some days drag on and sometimes they change to work schedule to an hour earlier. For weekend shifts, they went from 530 to 430, it was rough."
good,"Nice place to start working as a student. Get to know the basic of customer service. In term of marketing I learnt how to do ""facing"" of the many products."
good,"Being a costumer service associate I was responsible of costumer and cash registers. Greeting people and being helpful for them. I really like to work there the pay was good but I would like something better, I need a full time job and a prefer a Monday thru Friday shift."
good,"a good place to work with good people."
good,The people that are put in charge of you do not understand your job they just know the numbers of what you are suppose to be doing and don't understand that
good,"As an associate optician at Walmart, I had responsibility not typical to the usual retail job. I dealt with patients and doctors and held many clerical responsibilities that would normally be applied to typical doctor's office work. I also got to tinker with glasses and apply myself to helping patients with a variety of specific personal issues. It was a good feeling when you were truly able to help people."
good,"The good thing is that they don't check much on your background and the drug tests are not so invasive. Unfortunately, there is little chance of a raise or a promotion and they cut your hours on purpose."
good,Walmart when I first started I loved it. They managers were easy to talk to and was a fun place to work. In the past yr management has went down hill and they have high expectations and not enough people to perform the duty.
good,I would recommend this job only if you are flexible and willing to work Walmart is a very busy place with opportunities to grow if you put effort into it
good,"stockyards Walmart Is a place that is very focused on customer service, giving the benefit of the doubt to the customers, it is organized, caring, and careful with their security. I enjoyed working there, very lenient and very forgiving."
good,I loved the job as a Deli Associate. However there was not enough management on site to make sure that the safe work environment guidelines were kept in place.
good,Walmart offers you a good work environment. The management could be better but isn’t all to bad; they are usually good about trying to be flexible with you.
good,Providing the best shopping experience you can for each shopper that enter your store with respect and the will to help assist and provide an enjoyable visit each time. Making sure you properly stock the shelves and keep work areas nice and neat.
good,Walmart is a good place to gain an understanding of an entry-level job environment and the pros and cons associated therewith. It gives perspective on the opposite side of the shopping experience.
good,"worked as a cashier in the front end on Chemong."
good,"the management was the worst i have ever had. i have gotten really sick and they fired me when they should have done a LOA, had a seizure at work and they still took points off my missed days."
good,They offer two 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch which is great for employees that need breaks in order to do there job to the best of there ability.
good,"its fast paced and the managers are not very great, if you are fast then they expect you to do everything and if you are a slacker they wont do anything about it"
good,I loved working at Wal-Mart. I made a couple of life time friends there. The pay was great. Custormers was great most the time. Co workers were awesome. Just managment was awful.
good,A typical day at Walmart is usually easy I learned how to communicate with the customers . I learned how to control my attitude .the workplace culture is fine everybody was cool with me. the hardest part of the job was when the customers have a lot of groceries and have to hurry up and scan the groceries so your line wouldn't be long. The most enjoyable day is having the customers happy.
good,I have worked the overnight for years and i hate it. My co workers are the best but management is the worst. I have tried to move to the day shift for two years and they have came up with every reason not to move me. I have put in for every job opening that came up n got turned down. If i was not making almost $13 i would be out.
good,"Buena empresa, diversas áreas y posibilidad de moverse internamente. Cultura potente"
good,"Cap 2 is an easy department to work in. At the start of your shift, you are either in the back room unloading the grocery truck or you are in the grocery aisles zoning (Pulling all products forward on the shelf / making shelves neat). After zoning is finished or tuck is unloaded, everyone is assigned an aisle to restock. Management was decent most of the time as long as you were on their good side. The only difficult thing is remembering product placement for when customers need help. A lot of products go in places that seem weird (e.g. Monster Java goes in the juice aisle while other energy drinks go in the soda aisle). The best part of the job is the staff. Everyone is really enjoyable to work with and really friendly."
good,"You get what you expect at Walmart, a deal to make something of a living. The pay will hopefully get better but in the meantime you better hope you live close enough to talk there otherwise the travel costs will take a chunk out of your earnings."
good,"the pay and benefits are good, but they really didn't take doctors notes. sometimes it feels like the management doesn't really care about their employees."
good,"If you like a job where you are constantly on the go, dealing with unique individuals and situations.  This is the place for you. However the down side is constant micromanagement from home office, unrealistic expectations from home office, and a general lack of awareness from home office."
good,"this job helps employees come together and become a team in order to help do the work in a timely manner."
good,"A typical day of the week at Walmart consisted of non-stop business, pushing carts, helping customers, helping others avoid car accidents, helping the handicapped, give loose directions, etc. "
good,"Great energy throughout the store, if you are a people person and enjoy helping people you will find satisfaction in this job. The staff is great and there is room to move up in the company."
good,"Management wasn't really the best in my opinion, they didn't care about the associates. Working with friends made the job easier & much more productive & fun. Learned a lot about the business, the culture in a fast-paced environment."
good,Overall it was a nice place to work at except sometimes management team wasn't very clear on what they wanted done and how they wanted it done. It was learning by yourself on the spot.But loved the co workers there!
good,"I was the freight person in the bakery area. It was not a hard job and the day went kinda fast if you didn't look at the time, it could get very overwhelming however, if there are 3 pallets needing downstacked and put away and nobody to help. Yo definitely have to make sure though that if you are hired to be full time that you are actually full time in the system or you will not get your promised $1 raise or any benefits"
good,Great place wonderful people it was like a family.  Some managers were very friendly and understanding. You do get bonuses sometimes..  the bad part is you miss holidays with your family’s.
good,"I enjoyed working for walmart but I think they stiffed me with my hourly wage. I honestly believe cashiers do so much and get paid so little and some don't even work at all. It has been a while sine I last worked with them, although I would enjoy working there again. I just hope that management is more adamant about making sure that they work as a team and not slack off. The last time I worked there I was a customer service associate and cashiers weren't very helpful in their tasks. Some would just leave their carts full of returns and just walk around doing nothing and I would have to sort it all out when that was supposed to be done by them. When I brought the situation up to management they just brushed it off and nothing was done about it. But I enjoyed meeting new people and being social with those around me."
good,"I stocked shelves and set up displays for a vendor not Walmart directly, but had to work with Walmart Associates and Management to do my job. Very poor customer service observed. Customers were always coming up to me a VENDOR-NOT A WALMART EMPLOYEE, for assistance because they couldn’t find any other Walmart Associates to help them. I mostly worked in the electronics Department. I liked my job and pay Through my Vendor was good. Just not enough hours. I work Part-Time."
good,"Taking care of customers, slicing meats, and cheese, frying food and cleaning up for the next day."
good,"Corporate Walmart is still subject to the same rules of Retail Walmart, and when you have a Corporate presence in a city with other major corporations, that won't keep quality associates. "
good,"it was an ok place to work it has its pros and cons like any other place. its fast pace. you just have to make sure you have an outside life, because sometimes they forget that"
good,"The company offers flexible hours. However, I was pulled to to other departments without orientation. Coworkers are great, always willing to help each other out."
good,"While I was happy to go to work each day and do my jobs, I found that the company did not care about me.  While I got a good severance package they did nothing to help me stay employed."
good,I really had no big issue working for Walmart. Mainly suggest it as a school time job. Nothing permanent. They are some balanced mangers. Some that use the power to their advantages. And some that you didn’t mind working for.
good,"Worked for Walmart for 10 years. Started as cashier and made up to Support Manager. Good company, sometimes inconsistent advice from management. Fast paced"
good,It was okay. It was fun working their the people were super friendly i had absolutely no problems the time i worked at wal mart id do it again if was interested
good,"This is my first job in States. My job  include moving inventory in the backroom,  r helping customers while stocking shelves. This job is physically demanding."
good,For the amount of work and sacrifice the pay should/could be a lot better. Not only that but walmart should look to oromote emoyyes instead of hiring into a set place.
good,"I'm recently employed by Wal-mart, however I've had an excellent experience so far. The management is wonderful and so are my peer associates. The opportunity for advancement is high and when working in the Pharmacy, they pay for all your training and certifications!"
good,Here at Walmart I learned how to work in fast paced environment and multitask things. I also learned management skills and things like that. Here I also learned good customer service skills
good,"I would have barely enough work to bypass the day, it was really to simple of a job i would do as told go outside, clean the lot, pick up trash out of trash cans take it to the back and dispose of it, then pick up any carts that were out on the lot. after I'm done i would go inside to see what else the manager would have me do, usually would be zoning items on shelves or stocking a bit."
good,"Need to be very adaptable.  Walmart isn't for everyone, so much going on with limited staffing so it is a lot of being able to think on your feet and move people to accommodate what needs done."
good,"the main thing that Walmart need to realize is that if they want there stokers to work harder then they need to pay them right.... i was told on several occasions that we had the most important job but payed us the same as the buggy pushers. being a full time stoker for walmart is worth at least "
good,good job but benefits is not all that great. pay is really good. another downfall you could be working in a really cold environment. they got hydrogen batteries that are not good at all. they spend more money on things that don't really help out employees.
good,"Working in the Pharmacy was a great experience. Being that it is my future career goals, i got to see first hand what it was like. some days were stressful, hence the first of the month, but we got the work done."
good,walmart is no 1 whole sale and  retail industry.there work environment is good.i have to learned how to convince to the customer and  how to talk to person.there management is good.
good,Stressful and fast paced but a really good pay and good shifts. Get to cross-train for different positions. Can also transfer to other buildings in the states
good,"When shorthanded and positions not being filled it became very stressful, management would only help when it came close to where an employee wanted to walk out, when closing the deli alone and asking to close early because you have no help they send someone to help for an hour or two."
good,"Walmart is a good option if you really need a job. The company hires all sorts of different people. If you are applying as a cashier it can be difficult to become full time if you want to. At my location I was the only full time cashier that worked til close. I was able to find good friends among other employees. The store is open most holidays which can be frustrating if you want to spend holiday time somewhere else. The attendance and PTO policies are strange and confusing. New employees have to complete training procedures on the computer which I didn't believe properly taught cashiers how to use the register. The wages are a bit low but the particular store I was employed at offered higher wages than most other Walmarts and the local Target store. At my particular location a lot of equipment such as the registers, the card readers and the self checkouts were slow or faulty all together. The equipment would rarely get fixed or stay fixed. This was very annoying when I need that equipment in order to do my job. The store can become very busy and it can be stressful if you're not prepared for that. As with any customer service or retail job customers can be very rude but it's worse at Walmart stores and my particular store had a reputation for the worst customers. I actually had a customer threaten to beat me up and my manager got spit on by the same customer."
good,"Benefits are good, pay is acceptable for the job, and the work environment is pretty relaxed as long as what needs to get done gets done. Overtime is occasionally available if wanted. Management has been great."
good,"Como funcionário da empresa tive um amplo conhecimento e comunicação direta com clientes, por se tratar de uma empresa no ramo de comércio atacadista."
good,As expected with part time employment. But needs more staff. Had to cover several roles at the same time. Pay increase about .20cents every six months.
good,"Typical day: Assisting customers in receiving their medications through the use of McKesson system. Welcoming customers to the pharmacy. Answered questions of over-the-counter products, selling additional products such as medicine flavoring. Calling customers regarding medications."
good,A typical day at work for me is clock in run register and stock. I learned how to operate a cash register and work customer service with the customers. Poor management. The hardest part of my job is trying to stock and run back and forth working with The customers and making sure they are helped. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers and meeting and talking to new people.
good,"At First, Walmart was a great place to work and meet new people, make new friends, and get a paycheck in order to pay for tuition. Over time, I've seen people come and go, I've seen policies change and change, I've seen the company going gung-ho for its assocaites and I've seen how things work on a manager's level and how the system works behind the scenes. The easiest part of working for walmart is working with the customers, the hardest part is getting talked down to when a project goes sideways and takes longer than ""expected""."
good,"A typical day in the deli consists of slicing cheese and meat for customers, making sure the slicers are sanitized after every meat used, cooking for the hot case and selling the food to customers. The hardest part of the job for me was the constant influx of people and my introverted personality, but the most enjoyable part was learning how to do all these new things."
good,I will get to work at 9: 00 am. i learned how to stock sheller. Management was good. Everybody was nice to each other. IT wasn't really nothing hardest about the job to me. the most enjoyable part of the job for me was get to meet all the people that like the same thing as me.
good,Very productive and fast pace. Which I enjoyed working in retail. Most enjoyable part of the job helping and asking customers how could I help.  The hardest part of the job were poor management and poor work skills.
good,Love to work hard love to work with us I love to see you achievement in a company that I'm working for easy to learn love compliment I would love to work with y'all in Grove
good,"I liked Walmart but it could had better management, i did a lot for Walmart but my main concern was the mangers who didn't recognize employees for their hard work. and their chances on moving up with the company was slim cause you had to literally be friends with mangers to like you."
good,Depending on what store you work at it can be hit or miss. Management is constantly changing with little time for each supervisor to implement their work style. Turnover rate is small for the rest of the store.
good,As a manager they expected you to basically babysit and get your work done by 9 o'clock with very little help. Usually only 1 person in the deli in the morning with more work then 1 can handle. Understaffed.
good,"Over worked, under paid for the type and amount of work done. Will cover for other managers but will not go to bat for the typical associate. Say's one thing but does the other"
good,"i decent job overall, can be a bit stressful at times but its not hard to make the most of it. the pace can be quick or slow depending on the season so work happiness can be iffy there"
good,"Walmart was ok I guess. I didn't learn anything at Walmart the hardest part of my job was pulling juice pallets to the floor. a typical day was me filling milk, breaking down pallets and filling eggs."
good,There were days when we didn't have enough coverage and we would have to take the place that one of the cashiers.  It could be extremely frustrating at times
good,I would not work at the Newburgh NY store again. Very click and workers very prejudice amongst one another.  I was threatened the last time I worked there after a week when I returned for a temp job and had to resign. I’ve heard however other store are a lot better to work for
good,Taught me how to multi-task in a fast pace environment. Helpful to customers and to fellow associate that need a helping had. Followed every instruction given to me by upper Management.
good,La empresa es exelente para crecer. Conocí gente maravisllosa que me enseñó muchísimo.
good,"It's not a bad place to work, if you're a college student looking for ways to make money. It's a great place to make some new friends and interact with guests you've never seen before. The only bad thing I would have to say about this place is that it gets boring, when it's slow."
good,I was responsible for the ordering and stocking the shelves with product. Helping customers with Tires and whatever else they needed to find. Would help other departments if they were short staffed.
good,"My experience there was very demanding, fast paced. You don't get paid time off unless you're fulltime. You discounts on food and 10 percent off any purchases."
good,Some positions were more fair than others. The work made the day go by extremely fast. However policies changed in my time there along with management and demands became rediculous. Management will literally kiss your rear until your no longer useful. My coworkers were a steady mix of great and just plain dead weight. Work at times got stressful due to demands. Hours were great and steady everyday same times which is one of the best perks a job can offer. The pay was great at first and is very competitive to keep employees there. The longer you are with them the more benefits you recieve. If you can handle the job I would say it is for you  if you can't handle a decent work load don't waste your time. Management was great at first except for a few bad eggs. Most were caring and very understanding of issues and tried to resolve them rather it be customer or employee. Some were not as passionate about others though. Over all it is an okay place. Not the best not the worst.
good,"It was fun, the coworkers were nice and good to have around. The managers were nice and they pushed you to work harder. At times working there was a pain, but all in all it was a pretty good job."
good,Enjoyable workplace. Provide training opportunities for students in areas to enhance their educational skills. Room for advancement. Upper management has an open door policy.
good,people dont do their job they are always with attitude walmart floor is nasty always walmart bathroom is nasty they want u to do 3 to 4 things at once
good,"High paced, stressful, and physically demanding. Lack of breaks for the amount of work. The upper management only saw hourly employees as numbers. Lower managements words didnt matter to upper management."
good,Fun and productive workplace great commraderie amongst co-workers was great meeting new customers everyday their was always great items you could buy at a marked down price.
good,"this was my first job ever here i was responsible for gathering carts out of the corrals and helping assist customers with the loading of groceries to their cars, as well as in my down time helping cashiers bag groceries."
good,The people i worked with were great. Management needed some work though. other wise it wasn't a bad place to be. If you work hard enough the opportunities for advancement are plentiful.
good,Loved coming in to inviting customers & staff. Everyone is inviting and helpful. i LEARNED HOW TO BE BETTER with handling customer concerns and complaints while adhering to conpany policy.
good,"Walmart is very fast pace it is learning experience each and every day. If you love servicing the public and have a positive attitude, their is room for climbing the ladder."
good,"Its An Ok Job, Especially If You're Looking For A Steady Paced Job. Customer Service Plays A Big Role In Jobs Like These."
good,"I have worked at 4 different Walmarts. Des Moines, Milwaukee, Maquoketa, and Dubuque. Des Moines, people were nice, but there was not opportunity. Milwaukee was the best, quick advancement if you actually do your job. Management actually cared and let you know. Maquoketa, very cold shoulder, a lot of workers and management were rude and snobbish. Even though I was a transfer from Milwaukee they told me they had no place for me, even though I had worked as a cart pusher, cashier, electronics and claims department. Dubuque, to be fair I worked overnight so probably didn't get the best taste of ""Dubuque Walmart"" management was rude and very I'm better than you. "
good,I had the worst experience working for Walmart and it was never I job I planned on turning into a career. They don’t make you feel comfortable or needed.
good,The hardest part of the job is making the rate. If you cant keep the rate up they will let you go.  They give you plenty of paid time off.  They most enjoyable part of the job was having 3 days off and working 10 hour shifts.  They have great benefits.
good,they don't spend enough time making sure all employees are trained completely. Once you get into the routine its very easy. You get to meet a lot of different people while working there. Whether its another employee or a customer.
good,"Like many retailers wal* mart have its own problem, compensation is good but you have to work many hours, it's been a while since I worked there so may be things change. I appreciated the opportunity that was given to me. I highly recommend for the company to invest in people leadership."
good,I didn't really mind working there but it was a check. I enjoy what I do now because its what I am passionate about so I don't regret leaving walmart.
good,"Everything about Walmart is not perfect but very conducive place to work due to their benefits, orientation about safety and many more..All staff benefit some discount on purchase"
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, lots of different cultures and mindsets. Very friendly workplace. I had a few altercations with one or two coworkers but nothing serious."
good,I love the fast pace work environment. Management really needs to learn how to communicate with Associates and how to listen to them. Wal-Mart need to learn a lot more about preparing for holidays. They really need to learn how to manage time management. It was a fun place to work. I loved my job.
good,"Baging medications, have to have great customer service, communication with patient understanding customer concerns and payment options, hippo certification. Refilling filling station checking in medications,light cleaning"
good,Good job nice benefits. Not enough to handle my bills. When hired was told I could move up within the company. 2 1/2 years several position opportunities store manager refused to give me the chance to get higher position.
good,When I clock in I get the handheld that I need and then head to the meeting.  I give some associates tasks that They need to complete for the night and then I walk the floor.  I then clean the back room and walk the floor peridoically to make sure that tasks are being completed and the associates are still working. At the end of the day I review with the opening managers and make sure all pallets and fright is off the floor so that customers can have a good experience at our store.
good,"Poor management, other than that it was an exceptional place to work. Focused on customer service, availability, freshness and quality of product. Managed wages, P&L, cash management etc."
good,In the department I work at it is considered one of the easiest departments to be assigned to. Because of that I would be moved to the department next to mine and make sure everything is finished before I could finish my assigned area.
good,My overall experience for the time I spent working at Wal-Mart was great. It was wonderful to be in a environment filled with nice people with positive attitudes. I can honestly say I loved going into work and couldn't wait for my shift.
good,"Typical day starts early.  It is a physical, fast paced job, but pay is competitive, and there is job security.   members of management have different methods, so trying to incorporate these different ideas into a coherent message could be difficult."
good,"The people make this job. The duties are that which you expect and management can be overbearing and downright disrespectful on occasion, with some very note worthy exceptions, but the people you work with are really good folks for the most part. Some may not show up to work but when they are there, they are great to work with."
good,"boring'"
good,hard work- not good salary -the work place is good - after 2 years you will have a problem in your back . this place is good for young people .. some managers are races
good,"A typical work day at Walmart consisted of zoning, stocking, working freight, helping run layaway, and helping at the front end, i.e. registers. I learned a lot while I worked there. I learned how to run layaway, how to use a MC40 and label printers. I was also taught how to set a mod."
good,You are eligible for benefits after a year and advancement is always possible. You can own parts of the company with stock and you can be as involved as you choose. Opportunities for bonuses after a year and the more flexible you are the more flexible they are.
good,"if u have kids make sure u have a permenant sitting situation"
good,"It's been 4 years, the place changed since and the employees too."
good,Anything is possible if u work hard and keep trusting yourself and your co workers.  Above all I like to work around here even I don't have any talent at all.
good,not much to say if you have worked any type of retail you are gonna know how Walmart is compared to other ones a good entry level into the field of retail
good,"En si , aprendi bastantes cosas , agradesco lo aprendido , pero la empresa cambio mucho."
good,"Walmart expects alot out of the employees. They've added A lot more duties to the department manager's job description. Walmart is overall a good place to work, they offer benefits, promotions, and quarterly bonuses."
good,Weekend shifts are about 14 hours per day but good incentive bonus and base pay. Only 3 days so you get the whole week to yourself. Best offered benefits around.
good,"Most days are stressful at Walmart due to the fast-paced work we accomplish everyday, and management putting a lot of pressure on the team's shoulders because they want tasks done as quick and efficiently as possible. However, I do love the challenge of trying to get the job done as quickly and as professionally as possible. The team that I work with (CAP-2) can vary from being a really positive group of people, to them creating a very toxic working environment. Most of the customers brought a very positive attitude with them which made the job very pleasant at times. It helped me gain a new level of patience and confidence in my work. I have had trouble however with learning how to request time off, as throughout the year I had some difficulties with moving, school, and family emergencies. Learning from my mistakes overall helped me become a better person than I was, and I am ready to make the next big step in my life."
good,i leardned good skills helped customers it was a decent pay but benefits arent great managers were cool with me but pushed foreign worker or people with lague barriers to the side
good,"Loved my job and company up until the time they had to put my back up against the wall. Technically not their fault because of construction delays. My career decisions are made for what is best for my family.  Now that we are ""Empty Nest"" parents the decision I had to make back then would probably be different now."
good,Each daily task was consistent. There was always something to do at Walmart. People are friendly. Work was good. I only went to work because of the paycheck.
good,"As a sales associate the hardest part of the day was having to deal with customers as well as the list of chores management wanted done by the end of the shift. I often found myself doing tasks that were suppose to be management task as well as overworked in the just the five hours I was there. The workplace was often stressful especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas. The best part of the job was when I was dealing with customers that were really appreciative of the service that I was providing them (trust me many aren't, and act as spoiled children). While i was there I learnt inventory management, cashiering, sales, inventory ordering, photo center maintenance, Sporting Goods license sales, mixing paint, setup displays, and inventory control."
good,A typical work day is long lines with angry customers. I learned that it's okay to deal with different customers and different attitudes. The management is great. They are willing to help you out with anything.The hardest part of the job is maintaining a positive attitude with people who are rude.
good,"Let's see I started working there in April of 2017."
good,honestly would have stayed with them longer if i got more hours and they offered me a little bit more money but other then that it wasnt that bad there.
good,The associates get along very well and try to work together but WalMart has a very unrealistic expectation from their associates and unfair advancement and pay
good,High pressure to meet all goals and demanding to reach expectations set. Opportunity for self promotion great experience to have in the Logistics world.
good,I feel as though i wasn't given the same opportunities as everyone cause full time didn't receive that much hours that they we're supposed to i just wish everything would have been better. I honestly like working at walmarr when i begin working there but they don't work as a group sometimes most times other employees are against each other i feel they don't want anybody to prosper.
good,"Ok place to work. Always busy, Lots of customers everyday. some good some bad. working there is a job. the benefits are good if you can get on full time."
good,It was a high paced in an out mechanical work place! Management was fair and employees were nice as well! The hardest part of the job really was keep everything cleaned and the work was enjoyable!!
good,"Walmart is a good place too work, but you will earn every dollar. It is a great place for advancement if you are willing too get to where you want to be in your career."
good,Decent place to work if i wasn't moving would stay with the company. Good people. So so benefits. Medical leaves a lot to be desired. Must have a degree to move up. They dont promote from within like they used to.
good,"Working environment is pretty good, associates are super nice as well as managers and customers. Hours are great if you’re part-time, pay is okay not too bad. Terrible clocking in system, never calculates it right ."
good,The job wasnt all too difficult at all. But I was employed during school and I worked right after school til 10 pm every night and It was not working with my school schedule so I had to quit. But now that I am graduated I am looking for more of a career job and ready to start immediately.
good,"- priorities change daily and throughout the day"
good,Working at this place is not bad at all. The offer good pay and good benefit programs. They have certain company policies I do not agree with. How they conduct themselves is at times questionable. Unfortunately like every work place there are favorites and people that get special privileges. Instead of recognizing these and changing it the tend to look the other way when the issues are brought up.
good,they want you to work as fast as you can for such little pay. i still enjoyed the coworkers were good. The store manager always said no overtime. Managers were cool.
good,"Every day typically started with morning meetings. I would go man my register. If other departments needed help,they came and got me. I pushed carts, cleaned restrooms, unloaded truck, stocked grocery."
good,"The job was really stressful and unfair at a lot of times when it came to the crew working in the back room to the ones on the floor, the amount work for the amount of pay wasn't equal to me"
good,Work is available in many positions and many shifts to fit your schedule.  Cashiers work on their feet all day and when they are not busy they return items to their shelves.  Stocking is mainly an overnight position that restocks the shelves and breaks down the boxes.  Department managers maintain the stock in their departments and put in their orders.  Great entry level positions and flexible for students in college.  Job is pretty easy and the relationships you build with the people to me are the best part of the job.
good,"Nice place to work, they don’t pay well and you work hard . Management are ok, co workers excellent. Not to much respect tho. They need to pay better ."
good,"If you want to work at work Walmart please don’t be afraid to ask questions, cause you don’t ask questions they not going to just tell you everything. And you might just be lost, so please ask for help at anytime."
good,"The managers generally care about their employees, but everyone is very Pro-Walmart and very fake. We sang Walmart songs before work instead of working. Yes, Walmart songs, and even a little dance that was MANDATORY. They go overboard on safety on things that don't require a safety concern and then the things that require safety concerns, they don't touch because it means less production. It's just a very contradicting and irritating job.They do offer great benefits and compensation though. They hired me full time with promises of 40-50 hours a week and I rarely ever got more than 25 hours."
good,"night shift stocking was a littler hard, because most workers was half sleep or tired, the job itself was easy for me because I'm use to physical work."
good,"was a fun atmosphere! The crew that I worked with was hard working but knew how to have fun. a typical day at work was aat the register and front end and if I worked the night shift I was in the fitting room and doing the night time announcements."
good,"To many bosses to please. Fast paced. Must enjoy servicing customers. Must be a people person because not only do you have to wait on customers, but also get along with coworkers."
good,working for walmart is a big step i say that because your there most of the time then at home working on holidays crazy shifts and on top of that you don't know what your day will be like. I can say there is a lot of team work a lot if guidance chances to advance at walmart.
good,"Didn't care to work there anymore, i haven't worked there in years. so I don't really don't have to much to say about this company, with all due respect"
good,It was my first job and I learned that work requires dedication and responsibility working there gave me a sense of what the world would be like after school.
good,my typical day at work would be going in making sure everything was cooking for dinner time n cleaning stuff that needed to be done. I have learned that if you help don't be scared to ask for help.
good,"Working here has its own pros and cons. Though work life balance in some departments is excellent, in others like Finance is a bit demanding, and involved consistent late sitting."
good,"Most days especially on weekends a morning can go by in an instant. For example, in as early as 6 and before you know it it's 12 o'clock and you feel as if nothing has been done. Being apart of the Wal-Mart team can be rewarding, between customer satisfaction and being apart of a committed members.  Opportunity is very possible and the ladder can go where ever you like."
good,Job advancement is there. Just havevto work extremely hard for it. Higher bosses don't do there job so they blame everyone else for store looking bad. Just do ur job and go home. Bottom line.
good,"Management lacked a lot of skills. Management was rude, disrespectful to all lower ranks. Too much favoritism. "
good,Bad management doesn't know how to communicate with the coworkers overall a great place to work you meet a lot of different people great customers some rude
good,"graveyard responsible of stocking merchandise, everyone stayed in their own department and rarely moved around. I learned to work heavy machinery. walmart takes care of employees, however management needs leadership training. the hardest part was meeting deadlines set by a computer that only considered numbers. my co-workers were awesome, the benefits were great and the pay was decent."
good,Working at Walmart it can remind you of high school at times. But if you all about your coins and less business friends you would be awesome for Walmart company
good,"Typical day: I feel like a zombie"
good,Nothing is permanent recent changes eliminated my job. The process was poorly handled as i was informed by telephone while 700 miles from home. After i was told to return to the location.
good,Walmart is a good place to work I worked at two different locations as a Cashier and Sales associate  They always worked with my needs.  I always received a good amount of hours.
good,"For the period i have worked at Walmart the team is friendly, there is no discrimination on race, culture or where you from. "
good,The management at Walmart I found was very horrible in the sense that they cared about no one but themselves. I had not once witnessed a manager helping me or another employee when we need it. They were always in a room laughing with each other and would talk behind other peoples back. In my eyes very unprofessional and rude because they are there to help us and the store.
good,Great atmosphere inside work. Tasks were challenging to complete on time. Always felt like I needed to do more than I was able so not to put more of a load on anyone else.
good,I don't work there anymore  things have changed I am sure  when I worked there on 3rds we were a pretty close knit group  theere were good to give us 2 days in a row when u work 3rds   we were reak busy until about 11 with customers  and again starting at 6 am
good,"Not all teams follow the ""walmart"" culture. It is really hit and miss. Team member turnover is very high here, lots of the work is contracted out now, very little is ""in house"" like it used to be."
good,Walmart has many opportunities to people that want to get a start in the work force. It can be a fun and upbeat place to work but sometimes management pass on too much stress to low level employees
good,I started out okay but it got to the point where they lowered my hours and/days to 3 days per week. The workers were really friendly and it was a lot of work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, but at times it was stressful. At times they have me doing more than one thing at once, they had me doing more than I could handle at times but overall I met some really great people."
good,"Salaried managers hours vary from 50-60 hour work week."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar eu gostava bastante de atuar com vendas de eletrodométicos nunca tinha atuado na área, mas depois q eu entrei nessa empresa aprendi muita coisa."
good,"Wal-Mart is a ok job to work for but the time that I been there some of the Mangers don't have your back, if you need help they want you to do it yourself they don't treat their Asso. fairly. I have been there 17yrs. and been treated wrong."
good,I had a fun time working at Wal.-Mart.  The people were great and it was a blast working in produce.  I had to leave Wal-Mart Early though because I joined the U.S. ARMY.
good,I was only working at Walmart to pay my way through college. I never intended to stay. The job its self was fine and challenging. It was only the management that I had a problem with. They did not support or back up their employees with matters regarding customers and disagreements.
good,"I really enjoyed working with customers and managing departments.  Walmart had great benefits, and the pay was reasonable. It was a positive working experience."
good,start the night with the meeting to find out who was going where and doing what.  the managers were always available If you needed help unless it was the end of the shift and then it got harder to find them as they  were like busy bees all over the place.  the hardest part of the job was waiting for management during the end of the shift.
good,"There are so many different positions at Walmart. I was a pharmacy associate, so my position was very well, but there are many lows to this work place. Over all, I loved my job!"
good,"•	Scan the products, check the price and, help customers with any question;"
good,I enjoyed being at Walmart for the first year and a half then as the associates become higher in management like customer service supervisors they wasn't ready to be full team players.that made it harder on a few of us that were team players
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to work with my friends and to help the customer's who appreciate the job we do. The hardest part would be trying to keep up with the work we are supposed to be doing when management puts us everywhere else but where we are supposed to be. Management is decent, but has begun to go downhill. I've learned more things about the products in my work area and have more of an extensive knowledge of things that I always wanted to learn more about. A typical day at work includes being yelled at by management, getting productive work done while still enjoying coworker's help; directing customer's on where products are, and giving information on products the didn't know about."
good,"I always make the place I work a fun place to be,   it you cant love it and have a good time where you are then you should not be there.  I get along with everyone and try to keep everyone in a great mood,  we joke and just had fun.   It makes the day go fast"
good,I was hired as a temporary worker with no benefits working only 30-32 hrs weekly. I would love to remain there as a secondary job however its simply not a company you can make a decent living at unless you become a manager.
good,"I liked working with Walmart. It was a great place to start and work your way up. I love interacting with people and strive to make the customer happy. I consider myself a great team player. I'm not a person who sits back when It's slow, there's always something to do."
good,"Over the course of my time at Wal-Mart, (a little over a year) I worked as an overnight merchandiser at a neighborhood market.  Overall my experience was good! They pay decently (in Sonoma county CA) and the benefits are great if you choose to get them. My managers were excellent!! (The others on staff, not so much..) I would recommend Wal-Mart for anyone looking for entry level work with room to grow that works well in a fast paced and stressful environment."
good,"Bad customers, fun coworkers, management doesn't really care will fire you instantly and you are pushed to your limits and beyond. job was easy enough"
good,"They always want you to be faster and always top of your game"
good,It's a good place to work i love working with new people work very hard to make the customers Happy. They look out for there employees and they take pride in there products
good,"Empresa com bastante movimento, bastante trabalho, um lugar gostoso de trabalhar salvo algumas exceções."
good,WM is a great company to work for if you like retail. There are many policies in place to keep things fair and working nicely. As far as retail goes I would say it is one of the best paying places. I only left because I was capped money wise and I needed more time with my family. When it comes to management the hours are very very long.
good,"While a cliche it is true in this work place, you have to work hard to get where you want to be in the company, anything less would be a waste of time"
good,I work at night had cart with predicts that I put in shelves. I learned how to read the scanning bars to but the predicts on the right shelves. no hard
good,A typical day at work is sometimes either busy or slow. I learned how to read the codes to find out  where an item goes. The managers there are pretty cool.
good,"they are always looking for new hires, the work is really easy, and those who stick with it do move up. what I'm trying to say is that it's a decent minimum wage job and nothing is wrong with that"
good,"my manager was outstanding. she was hands on with helping protect the store assets and personnel."
good,It's a steady job. There were days where it could get stressful but as long as you have patience it helps. Working there really helps with your customer service skills.
good,"Stressful, poor work home balance. very, very long hours, and high turn over rates. Management job is very stressful. "
good,"Though the job was stressful at times, the friends you make is like your extended family. Some you get along with, others you don't, but together you got the job done. Team work makes the dream work."
good,Being a manager for Walmart means working long hours. However the job is challenging and rewarding.I enjoyed working for this company. I met alot of good people.
good,"Wal-Mart was an incredible first job and they put a huge emphasis on education. This job is great for entry level work while in school. You can even find good promotions available within the company. However, there are some managment disputes and an eventual limit to the growth within the company."
good,"Had no problems with Walmart. I really enjoyed the people I worked with, they made the days go by faster. I also liked learning all I could through the whole store."
good,me dieron la oportunidad de aprender y de desempeñarme en otra rama
good,Walmart will work with your school schedule. Management could be better. Diverse culture. The job was straight forward. I enjoyed all of my coworkers and customers.
good,"My experience at Walmart was nice. I got to learn a lot about the overnight experience. Customer service was a big priority and the employees were friendly. Stocks, 401K, medical and dental benefits is something I wish I would of use to my advantage. Overall, if you are positive, love to be around others and work as a team this is the place to work."
good,"Was a good High school job not something I wanted to do long term, "
good,"This place was so boring and tedious, that it was actually depressing.  It's hard to explain how something can be so slow-paced and relaxed, yet also fast-paced and stressful."
good,If your cool with your management team and do your work and stay too yourself that job is easy i say the customers are the most stressful part of working Walmart
good,"great place to start working for a first job. Has different departments to grow in and move up in the work place! The company offers great benefits,stocks,medical insurance,dental,and vision."
good,Had a great time working for Walmart till we got new younger managers that were too green and had zero communication skills making it extremely hard to work around
good,"Walmart lacks proper organizational skills in some areas because of how big the company is. There is a lack of communication between higher management, lower management, and employees. Rules are not followed by all employees because management does not properly enforce them. Overall there is always room for advancement and they allow you to have a fun day at work. Booking time off is a struggle. You can request a day off a month in advance and still not get it off, so always double check with personel office."
good,"While working at Walmart was not exactly a dream job, it certainly wasn't all bad. Breaks were scheduled fairly, most of the coworkers were great, and I felt properly compensated for my time."
good,"Fast pace,rapid change,customer relations,learn something new everyday,team players,advancement for hard work,good benifits, a willingness to learn,willingness to be fexible"
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and always busy. The trucks come in and you have to  unload the trucks then put up the stock after sorting the pallets according to the departments.
good,"Never a dull moment working at Walmart. Always fast paced and busy, especially during holiday time. The management team on the front end of the store was very helpful. but the hours were always all over the place, which made it hard to  see my family. I would do it again if i had to but, but i would need better hours."
good,made a decent wage of $12.10. but there are days where you feel like you don't get paid enough. job just helps with experience. management is incompetent.
good,"I love working there, meeting and greeting new people. Some are very nice people some are rude I know how to handle rude customers I always keep the same positive attitude."
good,A little stressful and under paid for the position I was in as an associate but once promoted to supervisor still stressful but A lot better pay. Has A lot of benefits and paid time off you earn per week.
good,Walmart has been a good two years of working but towards the end I decided to go on and pursue my career. Management wise they were ok and fun bosses but overall the work experience I got was incredible and I loved everything I learned from it.
good,"Due to them not being able to work with my disability i could not make a career out of it. The pay raises topped out very quickly with low career advancement, due to the amount of people hired and the amount of positions able to advance to."
good,my experience at wal-mart was decent. i learned a lot about customer service and i think from my experience their made my people skills improve along with my communication skills.
good,"I enjoy the work pace and flow, its not a bad job . the management is easy to get along with which makes the work more enjoyable. the hours aren't to bad either."
good,It was the easiest job I ever had. I worked there for 4 yrs as a part time sales associate and could not get on full time or change departments. I applied for every full time position that was available (even in the deli) to try and get on full time but was stuck in my department.
good,"This was an interim job for me going in. Cap team is responsible for taking inventory of merchandise coming in and replenishing shelves according to what goes out. Overall, was a fairly physical position that required lifting up to 30lbs, climbing up and down a 4 step ladder, and moving at a brisk pace. Favorite part was once you learned the routine you pretty much worked at your own pace in accordance with your schedule, oh and the hour lunch was nice, too. Only complaint was the pay definitely should be getting more then 11.50 hr. Managers and co workers were pleasant employee discount was a joke (℅10) unless you were purchasing a big ticket item. Not a bad place to work for a student or someone living with their parents, otherwise impossible to make ends meet."
good,"Empresa num geral boas de trabalhar, grande bastante desenvoltura, alguns incentivos."
good,"it can be tough to meet the production goal especially if you end up with a truck full of heavy materials, and only one person to do it will take it's toll on your body."
good,When you try to be nice to everyone you spread yourself so thin that people begin to just tolerate you as opposed to developing an authentic relationship. That is what Wal Mart corporation reminds me of.  A big friendly guy who wants everyone to like him.
good,Its an I'm job.  I enjoyed customers and most of fellow employees.  As a customer service mgr I had to lead and delegate responsibilities of cashiers and others.
good,"While the time that i've worked for Walmart, I was able to be cross trained in much of the store. I've learned how to cashier, answer phones and direct calls, I've learned how to pierce ears and change watch batteries. I have learned how to unload trucks and been able to properly stock the floor. I love my job, but due to the ratings I am looking elsewhere. This company does not pay me enough for me to be able to pay my bills comfortably and there's just too much going on."
good,A typical a at Walmart is busy. I've learned that dealing will the public can be both rewarding and challenging. Management here is a stressful job because they are never in agreement with much of nothing it causes confusion and problems. The hardest part of the job is when there is stress for no reason. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to provide good customer service to the public.
good,The managers thought that they didnt need to help employee. They would often schedule little to no employees for a department that required at least three every shift
good,"I work in the deli where we are like a small family. My supervisor is great with alot of laughs. Pay is unfair but hours are great. Our ceo has made it so that new hires make 11.00 an hour as I make 11.22 an hour. I followed the steps working different jobs to get better raises, now that means nothing except experience for myself. As associates walmart tells the public they treat us great but not the same company as it was. Managers don't work nor care unless visitors are coming. Short staffed but management wants more but unwilling to learn and help."
good,"Fill store orders daily in dairy deli or the freezer and sometimes on the dry side."
good,"It's a great start , many opportunities! Gotta have lots of patience with dealing with the company (managers and customer) but it's a lot of job offers in the company from cashiers to do doctors!"
good,You'll have a steady job guarntee as long as you're on time and attend work when suppose. The customers make the day go by fast. It's an excellent work environment for a people person. Good pay if full time 40 hours a week guarnteed.
good,"I worked as a Pharmacy Technician, and I learned a lot working with this company. I worked for great pharmacists who knew a lot and helped us out when work got to be too much. The best part of the job was learning about all different types of medication and mixing some medication. Walmart overall was not a great place to work. Management took too long to respond to an issue, and break times were not consistent."
good,"As a cashier it's a great place to work for students especially, flexible hours, and a very welcoming environment for new workers.  "
good,"A typical day at work was never spending more than an hour in my own department. The store is understaffed. The managers are stressed which causes you to be stressed as well. The other associates are really great and most of the lower level managers are as well. The thing is though is that whenever the managers decide that something needs to be done then they'll pull every available associate away from their area to work on whatever. At the end of the day your department ends up looking terrible. Managers never said a word to me about it but I know of certain cases where they made certain associates stay until they fixed their department, which is not fair because they were not in it all day to keep it looking good in the first place. It's a rough job but the pay is great."
good,Es una empresa con mucha cultura y seguridad ante todo para sus trabajadores
good,"Helped set up the store, and collect carts for years. many managers worked their way up, and plenty of benefits for being an associate. For the first few years management has been exceptional."
good,"the begins with making sure your set up for customer service,while working with people ive learned that you will run into different personalities ,yet you must be professional with all customers regardless of their behavior;i worked with alot of good people and managers.on any job irritate customer are the hardest to deal with,but we must be apologetic and calm the moment ,and solve the problem"
good,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill.  I used to come in.  I clocked in went to register.  I had a really good time interacting with customers."
good,friendly and safe place to work. You learn new things and skill. Work place was okay as long as you completed your work.  Customers and co-workers were great to work with.
good,Fue extresante ya que no te dan oportunidad de crecer solo a los que ya tienen años de experiencia más si mantiene buen equipo de trabajo y dan buenos bonos y apoyos. En general fue buena experiencia más lo mio no es trabajar en supermercados. Tengo más actitud para empleos de cuidado a personas mayores y niños.
good,aprendes a conocer un ambiente  manejos de planogramas
good,"Walmart was just a place to get by. At the store I worked in it was hard to move up or receive the training to be able to move up. A lot is expected, but little time given to be able to complete tasks. Too much middle management."
good,Typical day at Walmart is greeting customers helping them find what they need.  Employees at the store was pleasant to talk with and we helped each other out.
good,"Very large company, so always room to grow. A large variety of departments to work in, a lot of room to grow with the company, as well as decent breaks and lunches."
good,"work assigned or a task set for the day of work is a good start, make the difference for our customers. "
good,Working with Walmart was the worse because they were never able to work with you. You have to wait 6 months before you can change your availability. There just a bad company
good,"The hardest part of the night was to pull everything needed from the main aisle into the designated aisles to begin the stocking process. It was randomized so everyone would finish at different times. Those that finished quicker were pushed to help others, and most did without complaint. The workplace was nice, most of the employees were nice and courteous to their co-workers, easing in newer people that had just been pulled aboard. Management was very active, there wasn't a day where they weren't walking around the store and speaking with the employees."
good,Being a cashier at walmart was the most stressful job I've ever worked. It was very demanding and super long days and hours. The pay was decent if you don't want to have a social life at all. The hours were all over the place
good,I had a laid back day at work it was very quiet and calm I also got to meet new people everyday I also learned new things everyday if I wasn't doing something right I always went to managers for advice to make sure I was doing things right.
good,Entry level experience. Fast paced environment. New training programs are being utilized to improve upon associate training. Most positions will require associates to work weekends and holidays.
good,"The pay for similar retail jobs is competitive.  Management can be inconsistent in expectations.  I worked overnight, so the job can be extremely physically demanding.  Customers and co-workers really make the job enjoyable.  Management across different shifts do not  communicate well.  At times unrealistic expectations are demanded."
good,I enjoyed my job at Walmart made a lot of new friends the only thing I did not like was the shortage of hours they try to work you under the 40 hours so you don't get full time so you are not covered on the insurance less you pay for it
good,Walmart is a good place to start as a youngster. Many people even retire from Walmart. There are possibilities for advancement if you like what you do. You have to be patient and understanding in any department you work in.
good,"While employed at Wal-Mart I worked mostly in the garden center. My daily tasks included running the register, stocking the indoor and outdoor section, watering the plants, and operating heavy lifting equipment to unload the weekly shipments of plants/freight. While our department manger was absent or working over night, which was at least 3 days a week, my duties would overlap to the responsibilities of his. This included setting price points, handling customer complaints, making displays of merchandise, and mitigating the daily tasks my fellow associates. This eventually became exhausting for me because my responsibilities, in the eyes of my managers, became elevated to that of the department manager position while only technically being a cashier. Unable to move up or out of my garden center position, I submitted my two weeks and moved on from Wal-Mart."
good,Its an ok place to work at its just the managment and there is alot of favoritism . You can go up as a supporviser but you have to be there favorite .
good,"I liked it, it got kind of hectic after a while. It was just a paycheck for me. I think it was more of the people that made it a bad experience for me."
good,I liked working there although it was very stressfull place to work expecially as a cashier and with great prices combined with employee discounts. they offered a lot of overtime.
good,"A typical day at my work is that I come in to clean. Cleaning up after first shift, and slowly break down some stuff as I go along until we close. Taking care of customers and helping them with whatever they needed."
good,It was a good job can't complain you have bad times an good times but you go there to do your job an make your life better!...am a stocker an work at the back room most the time unloading the truck move around an do wat my manager told me to d
good,This was a very upbeat job that was only seasonal for me. I unloaded semi's of merchandise for the store.  I than would bring the products to sales floor and stock the shelf's.
good,Walmart is not the a great company to work for.  They do not pay their employees well.  The only thing I enjoyed about my job was my supervisor and my co-workers.  They made the job bearable.
good,I really enjoyed the work and felt I was compensated fairly. The management made working there very difficult. They did not seem to understand the working conditions and limitations
good,"To be honest, Walmart was a good job, but between fellow employees, and management, it left more to be desired. There could have been more communication and less personal matters to handle with. Employees range from all kinds of backgrounds, so some days you'll have hard workers, while other days you'll have employees who don't work at all. Everyone making the same pay for different amounts of tasks, it can become a bit stressful mentally, as well as physically. However, apart from unfavorable employees and management, the job itself is rather menial and if able to handle, worth the decent check."
good,"Work was always busy, there is plenty to do. It all depends on the management. They are usually always hiring, both Wal-Marts I worked for were terribly understaffed. Due to the under staffing the job was incredibly stressful. They pay well, which makes the job a bit more tolerable."
good,Walmart is a great place to work at for starters. Great job opportunities but not a place that I would want to stay at forever. Discounts are given to employees as well as benefits.
good,They were ok with flexible schedules pertaining to days and hours. Very diverse work environment. Pay is ok. Benefits is ok. Company discount is nice.
good,It was ok. It was a ok place to work. The cowokers was not helpful at all. I dont recommended that job to nobody. Find another job to work at. Just being honest
good,Fast paced and fairly clean store. They will not allow full time. Management was okay but even some of them complained no full time. Registers were easy to run. Sometimes long lines.
good,It was a great environment to learn retail and I loved it. I loved my co-workers and their amazing open door policy. I liked the advancement in this job.
good,"It was hard at first but I adjusted after the first four days. They have a very friendly and understanding staff who were willing to teach me about the job and show me what I had to do. And whenever there was a problem, the staff was always right there to explain whatever it was."
good,"I love working with the public. I enjoyed the cashier job and seafood job i had. I needed more benifits for my kids, and more hours to pay bills So i had to leave and find other work. The employees and management were great, and the job fun. I just needed more."
good,Buen conjunto de equipo local que trabaje tranquilo y entretenido menos el sector de gerencia
good,Muy buena experiencia laboral buenos aprendizajes te desarrollas muy bien dentro de la empresa aprendes a desenvolverte y conocer otros departamentos
good,"Walmart is fast pace and ver y crucial on time management. It was not a bad place to work, but pay was very low and raises were not always guaranteed."
good,"Working with Wal-mart is a difficult experience, as most hours of the job are left to you, with management and supervisors being hard to communicate with and often lacking any understanding of the job that you do. Many times it is easier to ask the associates you are working with, if any, for how to solve a problem. The entire staff seems to feel overworked and downcast, with consistent hiring and attendance issues."
good,I loved working there just needed more hours. It feels like a family when you walk thru the door. The supervisors are not very nice but the work and atmosphere is rewarding.
good,always busy how ever breaks are managed correctly lunches get pushed without asking sometimes you dont even get your break unless you say something they have a device that they carry around with them that says when everyones breaks are at
good,"I loved working at Walmart. Everyday, something interesting and exciting happened. There was never a dull moment! The employees were also great to work with."
good,"A typical day can be calm, productive, and positive. On the other hand, it can be chaos. If you are not ""in"" with management, it can be hard work with management regarding schedules and job functions. I had fantastic managers, and I had ones who saw only $$$ and advancement for themselves. They would back stab other managers and provide conflicting instruction to each others employees. In the end, the workers took the heat for it. I can say that I was ""in"" with the management. I did not personally experience too much of this until I had made it known I was leaving the company for another career option. However, I saw the consequences for not falling in line with the right manager."
good,I like the enviroment and I like the associates there.I feel like the pay is too little for the amount of work that I do because sometimes I help my manager do her job.
good,"I used to love working here, it just has been very stressful on me these past couple weeks between school and Walmart management not wanting to work with my schedule."
good,It's really cold and the work tools doesn't really work good. I also don't like that I couldn't get 40 hours and I didn't like that I got pay bi weekly .
good,"Always busy, not enough people to get everything done. "
good,"Contract work only."
good,"I wanted full time with "
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. 2) Issue receipts, refunds, credits, or change due to customers. 3) Count money in cash drawers at the beginning of shifts to ensure that amounts are correct and that there is adequate change."
good,"You have to adapt to survive. If you show you are a consistent, reliable, hard working associates promotions are available. You have to be willing to prove that you want to be an associate at Walmart by being a reliable associate."
good,"Walmart is a great starter job for those in high school or working through college wanting a little extra money. It can be a career if you work your way up, however that usually means moving to another city or state for an opening. Can be a stressful place, but also can be relaxing."
good,Over all Walmart was a great place to work the best part of my job was my Customers. When they come in I'd make sure they had a great shopping experience . If they could not find what they were looking for I would go help them licate the merchandise they needed.
good,"Working with Walmart was ok, it got boring once you've learned everything there is to know. Overall it's a good place to get a first job, and they pay well."
good,"I'm currently an overnight manager, as a manager I work 4 12+hr days. I have no family time as a result, I sleep my 1st day off and have to stay up all night on my 3rd day off, leaving 1 day to spend with my family. Don't get me wrong as a whole Walmart is a good company, I've been with them for over 10 years, I just no longer enjoy going to work."
good,"I would do the same thing a push carts everyday, it honestly got old but the environment and workplace wasn't that bad. The people I worked with were friendly! Pushing carts in the snow was the hardest part."
good,Great people to work with. They really do make you feel like a family. The only draw back is the rude customers and the lack of sick days. If you are a single parent Wal-Mart is almost impossible to work for.
good,"restructure changed a lot of the positive aspects"
good,uma empresa que da muitas oportunidades para quem se interesa.
good,"This job is a good place to start if you are just coming out of highschool or if this is your first job. The management does not train other employees often do. Assistant managers are really out of touch with the daily workload of the department that they run, most are rude and will only speak to employees for disciplinary reasons. Despite that fact the Departments managers are great. The employees are great.They do the best with what they have."
good,A typical day at Walmart is working at a fast pace on a daily basis. It a hurry up job that required you to finish your job and then go on to the next project.
good,"This used to be a great company. Now, there are too many programs to keep track of. Market Manager chooses which programs he/she wants to run at store level. Associates are now just overworked and treated like they are just a win number."
good,"If you like the challenge of working at a brisk pace, then you might want to look into working at Wal-Mart as a stocker.  If you are hired as a stocker, you will be responsible for helping to unload the truck when it comes in the afternoon.  The products must be organized onto different pallets.  Next, the pallets are wheeled away to be stored in the back.  Then, you get to load up your cart and take it out to ""the floor"" to put the product on the shelves.  You must keep up the pace.  Otherwise, you will put the next shift in a bind."
good,"Most entry level positions pay poorly, but it is possible to quickly climb ranks if you're motivated. Company guidelines reign supreme when it comes to tasks and how they're handled. This leaves little to no room for being creative, but at least you'll always know how to handle a situation. I would recommend the company for someone either wanting something very short term, or very long term, Short term, they'll hire anyone for just about anything. Long term, there is really no shortage of different roles you can fill with the company."
good,Learned how to manage time in office environment. Enjoyed assisting Associates with pay and insurance concerns. Trained all new Associates so they could ease into their new job.
good,"Everyday you come in you should give a 110%! The more productive you are, the more of an asset you are to the company. Recommend to anyone just out of high school and looking for something to give you the hours you need to pay rent!"
good,Walmart your job as an sales associate working the floor is to do whatever your department requires of you. You learn teamwork skills and management can sometimes be unfair. The culture is diverse. The hardest part is getting them to give you some time off and also if your in school their not willing to work with you.
good,Working the freight staying Productive. Downstacking the freight making sure your work is done in good amount of time. Trainig is not hard neither is the work its all left up to you if you want to learn during your training
good,Basically I had to organize cooler area and view the areas of where to place new stock rotate and place pallets to be carried outside along to arrange cooler for milk delivers. Plus had to maintain cooler to keep area clean. Also had to rotate milk each morning for the next working day.
good,"My time spent at Walmart was an informative experience into the retail job field. Friendly associates, good hours and a very dynamic workplace. Daily routine consisted of cashier, aisle management, box loader/unloader, cart pusher, and various odd jobs. Working a job like this has increased my appreciation for the average retail worker. The hardest part was adjusting to the cash register, but come the third day of working there it was no problem. I truly miss some of the staff who I worked with there, especially the friendly and helpful customer service managers, and would say they were my favorite part of the job."
good,"I enjoyed Walmart and working with the customers but, the management was poorly handled and the air a our location went out all the time. It was very hot in there and uncomfortable work environment. Gardendale location"
good,It's a great company to work with and the environment is fast paced and can get stressful at times but I wouldn't say it's a great company to retire from when the time comes
good,"Great place to work for,not enough pay for amount of work you do,no chance for advance for higher position.Management does not give full attention to any issues one discusses.Co workers were awesome to work with,we all worked as a team."
good,This store is okay to work at depending on your ethnicity. Ive had multiple people say they felt the same way being at this store and being a black or white person is hard because they do favor a certain race and its shown
good,"I wish I could have had more job training before I was put out on the job. I was promised a longer period of on job training with experienced personnel, especially since the holidays were coming up with lots of challenges and lots to remember."
good,The unloading the truck but enjoyed stocking the shelves. Like meeting new people. When I complete with my assigned job had to wait to long on something else to do.
good,"have a lot of members that look for me to come thru my line.  Nice"
good,"Good place to work, friendly and clean, good benefits, job security is good overall its a good place to work. Learned a lot about retail doing mods stocking correctly."
good,The managers at this company really do not care about the employees. They over work you and don't have good communication skills. It would be a great place to work for someone who just wants a job for high school.
good,"1. check work area makes products are in order/stock"
good,"It all depends on you on how fast you progress. Everyday is different, if your looking for a fast pace job then walmart is for you he company promotes from withend"
good,"clock in go get my equipment do a safety check on it go to start up. the coach tell us the volume for the day, we stretch and go to work, ive learned to work well with others and most important is focus on safety and team work. management is pretty prompt on resolving issues. lately the moral has been low because of a lot of rule changing, hardest part of the job is when people don't work as team, the most enjoyable is working with good and friendly people"
good,The pay is ok and acceptable for someone maybe in school because the hours that are available are almost limitless. They do offer benefits but are not the best.
good,"Work environment is good.  Some of the management has not had proper training on encouraging employees.  Can be rude."
good,"I felt needed and wanted when I worked here."
good,The work itself is extremely strenuous. Hence the pay rate. High Turnover in the most basic position. Can Cross train and relocate after 6 months. Long hours. 3 Shifts open 24 hours. 3 day / 4 day weeks.  Definitely helps to be physically fit. Dry side has no A/C Cold side varies from 40 degrees to -20degrees.
good,"A great job , was there when Katrina hit the coast, we were running water and food to everybody. The boss made a deal with the power company to let them park n our lot if they could get our power up and running. we were the only store open in Mobile to provide relief. It was great. Management was considered a father figure of the 'family'."
good,The workplace is good as far as coworkers go. The management are too stuck up to care about problems with their workers. If the cashiers needed change or a managers code we had to wait until they were done talking for them to make their way around.
good,Wal-Mart is a great company to work for can no better customer service management need to be more attentive to the store needs than their needs sometimes then it will work out fine.
good,Fast paced work with good associates to help get the jobs done always makes sure that you have the days off that you request. Vacation time isn't really fair if you don't work a lot of hours
good,"good hours good pay good security management could do a better job instead of discriminating on employees as well as with customers. "
good,Work is fine. Having to work Sat-Mon night shift doesn't allow you to spend normal family time together. Not a lot of opportunity to move up in company.
good,I enjoy working for walmart for the fact that the pace was quick and the information was provided to get the jobs done. I enjoyed working closely with customers and the ablity to manage my departments with qualified managers who did not hover or micro manage.
good,"learning new things controlling stock working stock into displays, working with manager meeting different people,getting paper work done on time with price changes,having fun doing things with other staff at work."
good,"Good people to work with and a great environment. Sometimes fast and sometimes not so fast but always something different to do. There are a variety of jobs so if you can, try them all."
good,"good work envirement nice co-workers,good schedule ,nice boss if pay were better it would be a pretty good place to work,free lunches,bonus time a little stress but pretty much typical pharmacy"
good,The hard part of the job is working in departments you aren't trained to do. The best is when returning customers find you because you impressed them.
good,Wal-Mart is always busy so there is no time to relax whatsoever. Customers arrive to the register every thirty seconds so always be prepared to support the customer and their needs.
good,"Too much work to be done and not enough time in the day. Can't keep help, they keep quitting. Stressful work. This is my second time with Walmart and I'm ready to retire and find a new career."
good,Working in the produce department had its ups and down. It was very demanding and required a lot of physical work. The pay was higher than the general paid associates.
good,"Walmart doesn't follow processes to ensure the store is stocked, needs to be better managed. Treats associates like slaves. Treats their management staff like dirt."
good,"eu gostava muito de trabalha no big porque "
good,I was a temp when I got hired at Walmart for the remodel of the store at 1st it took some time to adjust I work the graveyard shift The team I worked with were pretty cool my managers were awesome
good,Although Walmart offers lots of benefits to their employees they are not fair with pay. You get a raise based on work performance from 1 to 5 & mostly everyone gets a 5 even when they don't deserve it. The highest they can give is 50 cents & you don't get recognition from Walmart itself unless a customer calls corporate to share their experience with you. They are not fair with their pay.
good,Opportunity for promotion and growth if you take it.  Consistent work.  I enjoy most working with the patients.  Walmart offers a great work/life balance.
good,Walmart is good for young kids looking for a job after high school or young adults looking for a stable job. If done right Walmart can also be a good career. work environment isn't always pleasant and can be very stressful at times do to other employees and management.
good,"I worked for Wal-mart Neighborhood market. Opened the location in Bentonville across from the harps, The manager at the time was a great guy and I enjoyed working for him. His assistant managers however is a different story. They where too passive aggressive and looked down upon the other employees. one in particular I did not agree with nor he agree with me. I did what I could to keep our interactions to a minimum so that I could avoid a workplace dispute. But he had his plans and would seek out trouble with the other employees and make it difficult for them too. When we all reported it to our manager little action was taking besides a light reprimanding. When it came to Verbal abuse from the assistant manager I spoke with my manager about but still nothing. I put in my two weeks and haven't bothered to seek further at Wal-Mart after that."
good,"loved working there very straight forward, good management, loved learning about good customer service, teach you how to properly handles freight and fragile equipment."
good,"There were good and bad days. Management was rocky, depending on who was working. I enjoyed my coworkers that I worked with and made coming to work enjoyable."
good,Walmarts been good to me even thou i dont agree the way things are done we are very under staffed and some managers are very impersonal..buts it a secure job which is hard to come by and getting benifits is a huge plus ...and yearly profit sharing plus a deferred profit share for retirement as well as a staff discount helps its not alot but better than nothing and i work with a great bunch of poeple..and the option to buy stocks and walmart put a extra 15% in for you..
good,Walmart can be a a great company to work for if you know the right people. You can also be the hardest working employee there and not recognition if you don't do some networking.
good,It has ups and downs like any job. I think more downs than ups though. Many other associates feel the same way. There is a lot of favoritism. The hours are always all over and if you do not have open availability then expect them to be cut.
good,"it overall was a good experience until i hit my 2 1/2 year mark and was terminated without a cause by the new management staff, until then the hours were good and it was a fun job at the end of the night."
good,"To elaborate, I realized this was going to be a tedious process, but I can't ""spit out"" an honest, concise answer to the question without being intellectually dishonest.  This will have to do for now."
good,"It's a job, that's all it is. Hours are only good if you're full-time. Full hour lunches plus a ten-percent discount are a plus. Don't expect too much from it."
good,"Typical day was presenting sales floor with nice presentation filled with fruit and vegetables.Also leading my associates to pushing sale and keeping our department extremely clean. In charge of making sure tasks were finished, which were assigned from higher managers. I really enjoyed the aspect of pushing sales, but my favorite part of it all was simply learning how to be a better leader everyday I work."
good,My experience as a Cart Associate at Walmart consisted of a routine day of pushing carts from the stalls to the bay beside the front doors in a timely manner so customers had access to them. I learned that there is a right way and a wrong way to accomplish a certain task and that there is a reason to do it a certain way. The management at Walmart could have been better due to the fact that cart pushers and customer service workers seemed to get the worst of the trickle down effect. Workplace culture was generally friendly and co workers worked hard together. The hardest part of the job was staying hydrated during the hot summer as you sweated just as much water as you took in. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my co workers.
good,Walmart was a nice place to work for. There were always ups and downs to working there but what job doesn't. There was never a dull moment. I loved working there.
good,I worked at Walmart for 10 months and felt like it was sucking the life out of me. I worked the overnight shifts and hated the management. They threw me into the job with litre to no training and expected me to know it all.
good,I like my job in electronics but the politics in walmart is for the birds. The cut throat back stabbing that is encouraged on the hope of having a member of management in your pocket or one day advancing in the company makes the work environment very tense.
good,Every store is different. First store I was at was great and the associates were great. Store i transfered to makes me want to take a knife through my skull. Minimum 10 hours a day which usually translates to 11 or 12. Depending on your location you won't be noticed or considered for promotion if you only work your 10 hour minimum.
good,"Hay un buen ambiente de trabajo, tratan bien al personal."
good,"It's a alright job, laid back, tasks are typically simple, it never is the same twice, challenge to learn aisles, but is able to be coped with. Having the discount for walmart is also a win for when you shop there."
good,It was okay to work for Walmart didn't treat me well when I went on maternity leave. Didn't explain the benefits of it. Very disappointed by the company at the time.
good,"Start your day unloading trucks, stocking shelves, and straightening out the shelves.  Learned the ability to lead by example and how to lead people.  Most enjoyable part of job is to move the freight from truck to shelf."
good,"Management was very lazy and didn't do things right. There were many things that we needed in the shop and they weren't ordered until a month or so later.. Again, poor management."
good,"Overwork the good workers, benefits are good, coworkers are awesome..managment sucks they have favorites and allow certain people to get away with doing absolutely no work, the employee discount is 10%"
good,"You will always have job security. Walmart isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Most days its okay. The hourly co-workers are great to work with most of the time. I was an hourly employee."
good,Decent Workplace... Management is decent but it all boils down to the facts that they make sure you always know that you are replaceable. Lots of high school-like drama between co-workers. Good place to get skills...... not a good long term job.
good,Worked at this company for almost 10 years and spent many holidays including Christmas day giving my time and attention to this company. The company has recently gone through a major restructuring plan and my position was eliminated due to this restructuring.
good,"Walmart was a very fast paced environment, but they compensated well for the hard work. There were plenty of times i was able to outshine my peers just in my first week. It was an easy job, just a lot going on at once,"
good,I really don't have much to say about Wal-Mart. I work there for many years. Good job to have and retire from. Just have fun and do your job met alots
good,Working here at Walmart was a bit of pain at times but the pay was actually pretty good. Some employees seemed to be a bit angry which lead to bad customer service in the long run.
good,"In my opinion Walmart can be a very fun place to work at if it wasn't for some of the managers that are running most departments and the store. I've had my fair share of getting mistreated, they do show a lot of favoritism and they don't work fairly with their employees. Too many complaints on how they work with employees and customers. They don't show enough appreciation for the employees."
good,Really wasn't too happy working at walmart customers and employees was rude. The hardest part was trying to keep my cool when they was rude and disrespectful
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart I learned a lot about retail and working with money as CMS and I learned how to be patient with people from all walks of life
good,"This place taught me how work better on a team and also, at times, as an individual. It allowed me to heighten my abilities to work with the public and my communication skills."
good,Making sure all trucks are unloaded for the day In a timely manner . Breaking down grocery load and having it placed on the sales floor for overnight crew to stock . Inventory everything that his a high theft.
good,There was a lot of ways of working towards an advancement if only the Managers would not have been so one sided and helped the employees that was in the in crowd.
good,"The job is great for those who aren't afraid of hard work and multitasking. There is an expectation that many do not realize. Some gain a job with Wal-Mart assuming it's just an easy job to go in and goof off, however, it is much more than that. It's family, it's zoning, it's customers, it's above all how you hope to be treated within the store."
good,The job its self isn't hard they just work entirely too much. the money is great but you have no time to spend it. They work 7days a week and holidays.
good,"It's an okay place to work. There are staffing issues and management issues. With the right people, its a place of unlimited growth. But sometimes it's time to move on."
good,"What can I say? It's one of world's largest corporate entities. You do a lot of grunt work, but it's fairly straight-forward. As long as you can handle customers, it isn't the worst place to work."
good,I would come in and go to my register and that is where i would stay for the duration of my shift. i learned who to operate a cashier and i also learned how to interact with all different types of people.
good,Managers will cooperate with you if you have a good work ethic and attended work regularly.  Great experience for learning how to deal with the public
good,The other workers are great but sometimes management can be too much. They often disregard policy in most departments. I mean it is a job to get by. Decent pay okay benefits
good,"i loved working at walmart , great work enviroment , food was half off on breaks , shifts was productive and fast, great hours managers was fun to work with."
good,"Walmart expects a lot of you of ,but not willing to compensate competitively. It is difficult to move up because managers often have their own replacements in mind."
good,This can be a fun place to work and there are always chances for advancement. This is a place to work part time for extra cash or full time to advance your career.
good,"A typical day of work was interacting with customers through out the day and being any assistance I could to customers and my co workers.I enjoyed working and meeting new people, the hardest part was when I was unsucessful to help a customer. I had a good realtionship with my mangers being that it was a open door company."
good,"Working at Wal-mart for two years was a rather positive experience. Of course there were ups and downs but overall the experience was well received. I was able to provide effective work within my role in the company and with all the training I had, I was able to provided excellent customer service and advice."
good,"Warehouse work is very strenuous physically, but you are compensated for it. the pay was good as well as the condensed schedule, but most days, I went home aching. physically, I have paid the price, but cant find anything else in the area that can compete with the same pay or schedule."
good,a good place to start to learn the people the culture and more of the retail industry.to deal with customers to help them to maintain the store in neat tidy and orderly way
good,"very stressful and fast past company ,not much support from most management,no help with lg work loads , always changed your work load and duties with no assistance most of the time and very unfair daily expectations"
good,"Walmart does a lot of fund raising for charities which is wonderful. I enjoyed having a set shift of 7am-3:30pm. The hardest part of the job was getting others to do the work properly and follow through on voids, credit card payments and properly counting down drawers and coms at night. I really enjoyed most all the employees that I worked with. Wished I didn't lose all the sick time I had accrued from never calling in sick."
good,"A typical day here is fast paced. Management lack communication with each other. You will be pulled from one assignment to the next. The most enjoyable part of Walmart are the benefits. Ive learned that you need patience to deal with management because they  work under too much stress , so they will try to stress the employee out."
good,Most of the management team are decent to work for. I work at night so we're a pretty close group since there's only about 15 of us. I do madular resets which I love.
good,it's what you expect from an entry level job. Its good enough for a minimum wage job that doesn't require prerequisites or unique skills. If u want higher pay for no skills hit up McDonalds.
good,"Walmart is an average retail job really, do your job and you will have no issues, some days were chaotic while others were fairly relaxed. However i would not work for walmart if you have anything going on in your life that prevents you from going to work. i was attending school and working here and while i did enjoy the pay and i did like my job i did get fired for 5 absences over the course of 8 months. They need to realize that people have things pop up out of their control sometimes. I had strep throat for 5 days and thats what caused me to lose my job regardless if you have a doctors note or not, you have to go through their stupid program called sedgeway or something like that and that can take up to months. One of my co workers was fired before Sedgeway could supply the proof of his absences. Its very risky if you have bills you need to pay monthly. Luckily i had a huge amount saved up and was able to pay my vehicle off before i lost it. Some walmarts do not have this issue but this is still a really big issue for those that do. Hope i helped!"
good,"pues en cuanto al sueldo y salario es un poco castigado pero en lo que se refiere a la cultura dentro de la empresa, es una de las mas completas y competitivas la organizacion y el trabajo en equipo es la clave de su exito."
good,"some days are better than others, easy enough managment and higher ups put a lot of stress on you. processes changed frequently along with company rules and policies, overall it isn't the worst."
good,"One of my first job related with customer service."
good,Management was a problem for me when i worked there i heard the management has changed but when i was there it was bad.open door policy yeah rite if u had a problem there u were doomed i left after 5 yrs.there because of Management.
good,"At wal-mart we deal with many customers who some may be upset about a situation and we, as employees must resolve the situation and make the costumer happy. We must also provide customers with quick and easy services and answer any questions they may have."
good,Everyone got along but the management kept bumping heads with one another. It was nice within the sales floor area we would help one another. But the management team wanted to always one up another.
good,Has good culture and advancement. I guess you have to like speaking on the phone to enjoy this job- and helping people of course. Its not as bad as customer service/Customer relations. Here you can actually help people more and its a smaller team. Less than 30
good,"lots of fun, learning and development"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart. My manager was great and treated the employees well. Working the photo center was nice and I enjoyed making products for people. The starting pay was on the low end, however it provided me the flexible scheduling to attend school."
good,A typical day at work would consist of rumors coming from managers and upset employees. Certain people had their picks in which resulted in all employees not getting treated fairly.
good,Empresa con posibilidades de crecimiento para quienes estan dispuestos a un compromiso de 200% ya que es un trabajo muy demandante pero cuyos frutos se ven a corto plazo.Una buena escuela para aprender de retail.
good,Great place to work. Could improve with management team. Enjoyed working for the company. I like the fact that they believe in cross training. Which also teaches you how to multi-task.
good,El trabajo en Walmart es interesante y entretenido
good,they work you hard and sometimes forget about you for your break but over all its good money and the benefits are good as well. You get two 15's and one hour or 30 minute break.
good,"Days go by faster when you're constantly working."
good,Dynamic and fast paced environment in which no two days look alike. If you have no family or are a workaholic than welcome to paradise. It is an incredible place to learn skill sets that can build a great career but the cost is high and the lifestyle is extremely draining. Enter at your own risk.
good,Stressful and overwhelming. Less consideration with personal medical excuses for leave. The pay is good and very diverse company to work for. The job tasks is unfairly and is high rank of losing employees.
good,"Working at wal-mart to me was a completely different kind of enviorement. From management to customers, Its not a bad company to work for. Its very cultural. In order to advance you really have to stickout for you can be noticed. As long as you do your job and have a great attendance."
good,Temperatures could get a little overwhelming at times but the money is pretty good. Some of the benefits are pretty good as well. Some of the managers are pretty friendly and work with you.
good,"It is an ok place to work however it is still retail, and as we all know retail is not very wanted thing to do. However, they do start off paying better then most jobs do for the same positions."
good,"To be discussed at interview, however, treated fairly by all levels of management.  Great relationship with co-workers.  Minimal stress.  Fairly mundane yet rewarding."
good,"*Trabajo contra reloj para abasto de tienda y facturacion de proveedores"
good,"typical day:check in and what ever position I had at the time do to the best of my ability ."
good,"Good group of people to work with for the most part. "
good,"Work here is good if you're looking for a part time job or for a temporary job, great company it's just that there's not much opportunity for advancement ."
good,"Typical day would be checking out customers, receive their payments and coupons, stock shelves, clean the front end. I learned how to smile when you deal with a difficult customer and how to use their point of sale system to the fullest to help employees and customers alike. Management seem to be on different pages as I would be told to do one thing by one and another thing by the other and get in trouble for doing one or the other and not what the 2nd manager told me to do. The culture in the workplace reminds me of high school. Everyone has their own cliques, many love to spread rumors, and a few just don't care of their coworkers or the customers. The hardest part of the job is when you have to smile and continue on your day when a customer is verbally assaulting you and the management isn't stepping up to defend you. Honestly, I don't know what part of it was really enjoyable for me. But, if I was to guess. It would probably be when you got 10% discount for all foods but alcohol and milk from the beginning of November to the first of January."
good,"The work was not that hard it was kindof fun sometimes but the problem for me was that people would be VERY lazy even to the point of not doing their job and managment would not do anything about it, or they would take a long time to do something about it."
good,"They have good pay, good benefits and change schedule. The hours aren't the best. The workers there are Productive, nice, and fun. It has been a great place to work for me."
good,"if you are looking to take it easy this is not the place.!  "
good,Walmartgreat place to work with many benefits for the employees and after staying employed for a while the employee gets a raise which is a good plus.
good,Its a great job to have if you enjoy being busy and helping others Its very fast paced and you have to be a very fast learner you learn new things by the second .
good,"I would come to work, fellow employees and supervisors would greet me with a hello and a smile.report to the area where i'm suppose to work get instructions and began my day. I learned how to work with different kinds of people on a daily basis.most of my supervisor were very nice to me,but there were one or two who would yell and curse at me.for the most part people I worked with were friendly to me.they were very helpful to the customers who came in and most were very helpful to me also.the hardest part was working with the one or two supervisors who yelled and screamed at me.i have a disability that people would not notice at first,but when they find out some people treat me differently.the most enjoyable part was working with the people who were nice to me,also the experience I got was good for me."
good,"Work with other associates in a friendly and respectful atmosphere, where customer service is priority.  Big workplace sometimes one doesn't get to know the other associates.  However, the break room allows a lot of socializing between the rest of the store."
good,I feel I worked at a not so good location. The hours and benefits are good but the lead cashier was very rude. She left a bad impression on me. The overall of Walmart is not bad
good,"Although the environment of Walmart Superstore is great, the hours they have available for part-time works are terrible. With only 10 hours a week, it feels as if I will need a job that sustains more hours a week."
good,"I wouldn't work there again, but for the time I had there it was fair enough. It was hard and the customers can be a bit demanding. All in all the hardest part was the management team. It was hard to get them to agree on what needed to be done and how, each manger having a different way they did that task. "
good,"Fast pace job that can change on a daily basis must be flexible, a team player, good attendance a must. Must be a team player, "
good,"I enjoy some of the duties, the work atmosphere like you listen to music while working they do gave you some breaks to rest in the middle of the shifts, sometime they will recommanded some food for the associates once a while, they always have meeting to discuss some issues where we strong at, and where we need to work on better."
good,"A typical day wasn't that bad depending on what department you work in and your age. Everything was wonderful while working there. That surprisingly is a lot to learn of your position your working. "
good,"Walmart is known for saving people money, well I worked up at the Customer Service Desk.   Most of my job was returns and problems and how I was going to fix them.  Which most of them were easy.  But above all else we always were having fun because we were helping people.   You don't do a job like that unless you want to help people.  You can get a lot of abuse some days and some days you get a bunch of nice people.  never knew what it would be.  Either way it was an interesting time.  Policies in place but not always followed is a frustration."
good,"Younger, hard working people do best here, depending on the position. The majority of associates either load or unload trailers, orderfill (label boxes and transfer to a conveyor belt), or operate a forklift. Shifts are 10-12 hours. Some days are cut short and some are extended to 13 hours."
good,"fast pace, there were so many managers all different ways of thinking. diverse culture. hardest part of the job were the hours, no weekends off. split days off. new"
good,This is definitely a great place to start your career with. You learn great customer service skills as well as proper work ethics. The management is poor depending on location.
good,"Not a bad place to work for. Pay was good, co workers are very nice and friendly. Management is decent but not that good. Hours vary on what time you get off work."
good,"I worked PRN. The daily script count was between 200- 400. The computer system is decent. Coming from a hospital setting, it is difficult adjusting to having access to physicians for order clarifications. Clarifying orders from retail pharmacy is much more difficult. The customers were generally receptive to the staff and respectful."
good,"It can be simple working here. You learn the job and you do the job. Very easy to get yourself set in a daily routine when being a worker here. Can be fun, but also can feel complacent."
good,A lot of older white people.  Not very ethnically diverse.  They try really hard to keep young people there.  It's not really a good place for single people.
good,"Aprendizado e experiencia profissional,bom relacionamento interpessoal,atendimento a clientes e funcionários."
good,Day to day work changes a little depending on which department you work in. The company is a great company but individual stores can be troublesome. Management can vary greatly and either be great or not so great.
good,"I worked at Walmart Distribution. This job pays very good. Production is hard to meet because it doesn't stay the same. If you know what you are doing, you are stretched thin in order to make up for people that don't do their jobs. There is a HUGE turnover rate... a lot of people can not do the job. I worked there for three years and got tired of the way they were treating me because I knew every area. They over worked me to compensate for others and I got tired of it."
good,"very great experience"
good,I really didn't like working there cuz people are not into working as a team and management  treats u like they completely control them but I had fun with some of my Co workers I met alot of friends from therebut over all it was really stressful
good,"This job had fluctuating hours , no set schedules and would not allow even 1  minute of overtime to get work done.  They would put you by yourself to work / break down up to 8 pallets of live freight, stock shelves and inventory back stock into the back room. If you want to learn time management skills this is the job for you."
good,"A typical customer service job. Decently flexible hours for students, decent pay for a part-time job, but poor management. Patience is definitely learned, with both customers and coworkers."
good,I think it's a great workplace to work in. the co-workers are helpful at helping other co-worker when they need help and it's very productive place for a person who want's to work.
good,"Pros"
good,"A typical day at Walmart can be hectic as well as good. Your around multiple people at all times and will face many challenges. However we try to make the best out of it and satisfy our customers. Anytime the store has been accident free we have refreshments and it adds on to our bounces, that's the exciting part."
good,I was a vendor for Walmart I worked in the Hallmark Greetings cards. I came in signed in with a hand held machine they give you and go to the back of walmart where the stock is and bring everything up front that needs to be replaced or replenished. Its gets really easy if you stay on top of things and its always disorganized and you will always have something to do.  It was ok pay but not enough hours it was only part time and never got any more hours for working there. Never received a pay raise even for traveling to other stores to help out. You are your own boss pretty much and don't have someone looking over your shoulder the whole time. You just come in and do what needs to be done then leave.
good,The hours were plentiful but the work was boring and the management had a huge workload so it was hard for them  to be as productive as they needed to be
good,I actually liked working here but they did not give me my days off that I needed. I absolutely could not go into work those days because of family issues and out of town.
good,its a job if you don't have anything else to turn too.  But the customers can be awesome if you get the ones that are in a great mood and found what they were looking for and then some!
good,My job was to provide customer service and ring customers. I loved working there because you see alot of people you know and its always something to look at. My breaks were an hour best part of day really.
good,"Productive , busy always something to do never enough hours in a day to get everything done.  Pleasant place to work good benefits and enjoy helping customers."
good,My supervisor was never really there so u wasn't fully properly trained the whole time I was there just winged it most of the time. But for minimum wage pay guess I can't really complain.
good,"I've been at Walmart for almost three years, it has taught me a lot. How to be patient and how to deal with customers in the appropriate manner. As well as how to deal with how fast paced Walmart can be. I learned how to multi-task and do everything from cash, customer service and self-checkout. I was the last person that they saw before they left the store so i had to make it memorable so that they would come again. The hardest part of the job was definitely the fact that it was fast paced and always busy, so you had to be on top of your game at all times. There's never a time where you can just relax and talk, you are always doing something. Which is good, because the time goes by very quickly. I met some of my best friends at Walmart which was definitely the best part about it."
good,aprendes muy bien de logistica y decomo manejar personal
good,"Learn the policy for yourself. Even if unaware if wrong doing, a write up will still be produced. Management does not proper train and inform new hires of information pertaining to the environment."
good,"Walmart has tons of opportunities to advance your career if you are willing to put in the time and effort.  There will be a lot of holidays and weekends worked.  It is retail, so that's a given.  Minimal staffing can make a workday a nightmare with call outs.  You may also find yourself picking up other peoples work loads quite often.  Overall it is a company going in the right direction but just needs a little more focus at the store level to help improve daily operations."
good,I was only an employee for a short time in 2009. They did have decent benefits available. I did get normal amount of hours and the pay was above Texas minimum wage at the time. There is some room to advance in the company.
good,"Most of the people who worked here were fantastically helpful and kind, except for the store management. Needless to say her style of management was driven by intimidation, however, when the manager in her was off the clock she was actually a very sweet soul. That made it easier to work under her intimidation knowing that wasn't really who she is. The workplace was a fun yet fast paced environment of a tight knit Walmart family that always looked out for each other."
good,Walmart is a good place to work. the pay isn't too bad and the benefits are great. good hours and a pretty good work environment and some pretty awesome people to work with.
good,"As an invoice clerk it was busy from the moment I walked in until I left for the day."
good,"It's a stressful, fast paced job, that is always busy. Sometimes members of management aren't  on the same page with each other, as it's always busy and priorities are always changing. You can get stopped from working projects by one manager and another member of management can start you on another. By the end of the day you can have multiple half done projects, and multiple explanations to give to managers as these priorities and busy workflow change throughout the day. The workday is consistent as it is busy and the day goes by quickly. The benefits are fantastic. Not a job to do leisurely."
good,"Good starting hourly wage, pretty good opportunity for lateral moves in the store and promotion. I worked as a cashier, the job was dreadfully boring and the customers make your life absolutely miserable every single day, but the co-workers can really make your day."
good,"Working here was great! I love the people I worked with and loved my job! Always had working for Walmart as a goal in my life after meeting Sam Walton. Unfortunately, with the new restructuring my position was removed. So even though I loved my job, got nothing but great feedback on my work, and always had a positive attitude, I was just a replaceable as the associate next to me. Nothing but a number that can be let go no matter how well you do your job!"
good,I have worked there for 24 years and I have steadily seen it going away from caring about the associates to more about the management making bigger bonuses every year.  They continue to make cuts and we haven't had a pay raise in several years.  One month they are telling us we are the best in the division but when febuary rolls around we are told we are in a recession and we are lucky to have a job.  Every year we lose more benefits such as paid personal time off and sick leave.  It gets old seeing maintenance workers at other places in the area starting pay is more than I make after 24 years of dedicated service.  It is time for a change.   My bills are not getting paid.  Cost of living keeps going up but my pay doesn't.
good,"I have been working at wal mart for a almost 3 years now and have made a bunch of wonderful relationships with not only my co-workers but as well as the customers. Working there I have learned to count money way faster than usual, how to deal with different personalities even bad ones in such a positive way and lastly learn better leadership skills. The part of love most about this job is that you get to meet new people everyday. The hardest thing about this job is when it becomes very unorganized on a daily basis and everyone is not on the same page to fix the solution."
good,"Supervisors don't do anything, And Management doesn't care much about how you are being treated supervisors abuse of workers and make you stay overtime then take the hours away by making you take longer lunches."
good,"Friendly environment...more of a find things on your own type of work place. And people of authority talk to you like trash, but other than that it's ok."
good,"A typical day at work will consist of greeting all employees and working in frozen section with my co-worker.  The management could have been better, the hardest part was to walk in the freezer to get to the products. The best part of the job was working with my co-workers."
good,Gran ambiente de trabajo y buena oportunidad de crecimiento.
good,A typical work day was relaxed and sometimes hectic depending on what was happening on that business day.  Its an easy going environment and management are resourceful.
good,"Advancement was impossable thats why I went to walMart, I did love working for the day shift it was wonderful I learned the most at sams, my merchandising and retail skils there."
good,very stressful customers were rude but can also be pleasant job was fun at times but also days where I wanted to walk out due to poor management skill
good,It was a great place to work for. I loved helping the customers and had no problem performing the daily tasks I needed to do. Mixed and or messed up communication between bosses and associates was what was the issue. Too many people telling you different things to do and none of them have the same goal or tasks for you to do.
good,"If you like retail and want to make good money without schooling, then this is a great place to work.Stable job for a single person but would not recommend if family is important. Open every holiday and all hours of the day so it takes out the fun of having a family and the holidays."
good,"Overall working at Walmart for me wasn't hard, it just was a little irritating. The managers can be a bit of a pain and you can also get frustrated with the type of position you are handling but they pay really good."
good,Typical day..helping customers learn how to use self check.assisting them when needed. Learning to be more patient..I generally am. enjoyable part of my day making ppl smile customers.co workers..laugh.getting to know ppl better  ..but still doing my job making the customer wanting to come back..they always come first..I'd go out of my way to make sure they get the help they needed.. satisfied customers..
good,"Wal-Mart was a great place to work if you needed the job experience or quick buck. If you're looking for benefits , meaningful pay or a career look elsewhere. You are required to fulfill your duties which wouldn't be so bad if your co-workers were as diligent as you are. If not you will have to pick up their slack which makes your day more stressful."
good,a typical day your managers walk around and dont do anything but eat and be on the phone the cashiers help each other and the people in the back not enough cashiers and the work material always break
good,I was a customer service position and i had to make sure to get through the lines as fast and efficient as possible. There was little room for growth unless you stayed there along time.
good,"Walmart is an great job to start of with especially for a first job, it's not to much work that any other job wouldnt put on you, it's a well balanced and organized place where they focus on nothing but the customer's satisfaction"
good,"job can get highly stressful with change of schedule everyday "
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for as a starter, perfect for young people like me who lack major work experience but are trying to make some money while studying or looking for a job that can start their career. The company's major core values are centered around customer service, which is a great mentality that guarantees a good customer-base and therefore a constant flow of profit. The problem is the treatment of their employees does not match what they expect of them: management will regularly deny days off that have been asked for a month in advance, use exploits to keep an employee at part-time on paper while working full-time hours in order to get them less Paid Time-Off, or having multiple associates constantly running around in different departments, no matter the circumstances in their own department, showing no sign of planning to hire new associates to fill those missing positions; just to barely increase the overall profits in that specific store."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company to start with. They teach and train their employees and expect nothing short of excellence. For those looking for a first time job, this is a great starting point."
good,"Great place to work. Fun, and fast paced. Also, Wal-Mart offers a wonderful chance for advancement. I would recommend Wal-Mart to anyone who is looking for a fun, faced paced work place."
good,You can actually get your job done without managers watching over your shoulder. Fast paced job but it's worth it to see your day fly by. 3rd shift gets paid $1 more than other shifts.
good,I don't really have a review because I don't remember much about working here. Its been a long time since I worked at wal-mart so I don't have much of a review.
good,"It used to be a great job,  but as the years change corporate just makes the job worse and worse. With these rules change so much it's hard to enjoy your work."
good,"I worked here for about 6 months I learned very quickly. but some of the managers weren't the nicest. I worked a lot and didn't get mant dats off. But it was decent pay and if you don't like communicating with people especially ones that can be rude, then don't be a cashier!"
good,stressful managers are a little over there heads ask for way to much and don't give you the time to do the job correctly never enough people to get the jobs done
good,"Trabalhava no período da noite."
good,"Management isn't very personable. Work was demanding on your body. Various shifts available, with paid lunches. Great benefit packages available after 6 months."
good,"sou um rapaz responsavel no trabalho e pontual, gostei muito de trabalhar la, aprendi varias coisas sobre a funçao de fiscal de loja..."
good,"The environment was very friendly and welcoming.  My coworkers worked as a team and were easy to get along with, however the downside is that management often don't see eye to eye, and this causes issues in daily work routine."
good,"Walmart is an fair place to work depending on the stores culture. The associates as well as management should all be on the same page working together to accomplish the one best way,"
good,High demand retail with management having unrealistic expectations of how much freight could be moved in one night.  Other associates didnt take job seriously making it harder for those of us that did.
good,I left the job because i found a new one. The management was also a big role they hwlped me out alot of times. I would love to work there again. Its a good place to work.
good,"Good entry level job, not career material if you don't intend on becoming an assistant manager. If you are looking for money on the side or a part time job, this is a good place because they are very flexible with availability."
good,Its a safe job with steady hours and pay but the pay is not great and management is horrible. You are asked to do to much in too little time and will become very annoyed very quickly.
good,"Typical day was either filling prescriptions or inputting prescriptions, usually all the techs would take turns doing them. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment and how to deal with angry patients. The Manager their was horrible, they would talk about their employees horribly behind their backs to other techs, very unprofessional. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the drama in the workplace, the patients were mostly always nice and understanding especially with the long wait times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the other techs usually all got along and the patients were mostly sweet."
good,"Es cansado y muy difícil ascender, en horarios de 10 horas no pagan extras y el presupuesto para gastos de las tiendas es muy bajo por lo que no se tienen las herramientas necesarias para laborar."
good,"I like working for Wal-Mart, however they can provide better opportunity for its employees to advance. All managers are to be personable and well-rounded, able to handle the personality of ALL employees."
good,"It's a fun place to work Walmart, great people, but the pay rate is to low for the job to do. the management it's great, they are really kind. save place to work. you have to do a lot of lifting. but the co-workers are great."
good,"Walmart teaches you the true meaning of customer service because from the time you clock in, that's exactly what you have to use and keep a smile. if you can not maintain a job with Walmart working with people may not be your forte."
good,get money for our cash register drawers. zone the department for items that does not belong in the department i work for. Greet people when they enter the department and thru out the store. i work on freight which means that place merchandises on shelf to be sold. the hardest part of my job is having to pull TV's that are 40 lbs or more out on the floor.  the most enjoyable job is that i get to meet and converse with different people.
good,Had an great time working here the pay is great but managers have ducky  attitude ..It was too hot for me to EVERRRR settle down witcha daddy but we can get charged with animal abandonment and they had they friend
good,nice to start for people without experience . to much to learn out there. work is fun and management  depend in the person you dealing with but Walmart have a strong policy about relationship between management and flows. the bad thing is the pay it low compared to The direct competitor
good,"A typical day at work would consist of, answering phone calls, helping customers, stocking, cleaning your department, organizing, customer service and online orders. I learned to multi task and to be fast and efficient. Workplace culture was not always the best because sometimes management would not manage every employee. Hardest part of my job was trying to complete my task for the day while helping others who did not care for their job to do theirs as well. Most enjoyable part of my day was to work to satisfy customer needs."
good,"-Safe working environment"
good,"A typical day is a good day for me. "
good,I have learned how to drive a forklift. The hardest part of my job was being comfortable with operating a forklift and making production and getting use to the cold.
good,great place to work but the production quotas are too high and some of the managers care only about themselves and their friends.and way too many bling eyes for the people who try hard
good,"Job load is not too difficult, pressure on customer satisfaction is key. If you put in decent work, it is not hard to become management material. Working on holidays is often encouraged, and comes with greater discounts on store goods."
good,"Usually work too hard on the job just to meet the expectation of the job."
good,"I started out working at for this company in May 2015, I am currently a cashier here and I like the pay. As far as customers, I get along with all of my customers and I know my customers very well. This job can be tiring though because they will give you a schedule where you work 6 days in a row then have 1 off day and come back again for 3 days in a row with 9 hour shifts. Overall it's a great company!"
good,Nice part about this job is that it offers a full 40 hours and has a very early morning shift. Also nice that they work with your schedule and have nice amount of breaks.
good,"My supervisor and management were wonderful. I was not mistreated. I would have stayed if it hadn't been for a better job offer. But what I could not handle was the lack of direction, lack of support when I needed it in the beginning, that so many others before ruined it for those after them. Not everyone who has a genuine family issue is faking it. "
good,Very great work environment to learn and grow. Easy going culture that is welcoming no matter what position. Great location for people all over Charlotte to commute to.
good,"It was a good time for me to be working there, I had just finished my freshman year of college and was looking for stability after moving out. Walmart provided the stability I needed."
good,Working in the pharmacy is bust but it makes you feel like you are helping people who are not doing well health wise. I would recommend the Wal Mart that I work at to a friend if they were looking for work.
good,The company as a whole is a good company you can learn a lot of different functions in the company if your willing to learn. Great pay for associates and good pay for mangers.
good,"Its a great company to work for but could be stressful. Management could be a lot better because they lead and we follow, but overall a great workplace."
good,Wal-Mart was fun. I loved working there but I got fired for attendance even though I did everything correctly. Management was gravely lacking. Managers were allowed to mess with attendance and sabotaged the system.
good,Advancement opportunities and school opportunities. Easily move up fast . Ability to learn as much as wanted . Open  to pick up hours. Could travel help open other stores and train there staff
good,"Taking merchandise from back and placing on shelves."
good,"Was an overnight stocker for a few months, and was surprised  how I much I liked it. Yeah Wal-Mart doesnt seem a great place to work, but overnight was alot better than I imagined. Managers left you to your work and werent constantly breathing down your neck. Not to mention you didn't have ro deal with customers."
good,Walmart aloows you to advance with many incentives they give you paid time off and discounted items great place o work always willing to give more hours and the pay rate is superb
good,"Manque un peu de minuties, peu de fignolages mais dans l'ensemble la communication avec les cadres supérieurs est bonne."
good,you have to have a clear mind to work there because your eyes are constantly looking around everywhere you are always on your feet until you catch someone and then you apprehend them and make a report call the cops and see what happens from there
good,"I'll never forget my coworkers in the Photo Lab and Electronics Department. The best part of my shifts was working with my coworkers, management needed a lot of work and improvement"
good,This was a fine job. Nice culture. Nice employees and employers. Hour long lunch breaks. Nice coworkers. Comfortably in doing your work in a semi-safe environment.
good,"If you work in corporate, in the SF bay area, this can be a great company to work for. It can get polite to the point of being passive-agressive. Still, one of the better places I've worked."
good,"A good fast paste job, works around your schedule. Lots of customer interaction, some customers can be rude but the overall work place is easy going and reliable"
good,The work schedule is fair for employees to balance work and home life and the financial benefits are very accommodating. However the jobs of the facility are physically demanding.
good,"Everyone is surly always in Walmart and we were overstaffed as well, it was hard trying to get hours but they made it work for everyone. I really think Walmart help me deal with obnoxious people better walmart led me in my great leadership/ customer service."
good,"Customer Service is important even if they are having a bad day.  "
good,Better than fast food but feel like I could be doing something better. Pays some employees more for no reason which is frustrating and unfair. Good way to lose good employees.
good,a very okay place to work.fast paced. kind of stressful at times. good pay. nice work schedule. good discount. management would listen sometimes. great coworkers.
good,I have been with walmart  for 8 years and I really enjoy my job in the money center. I enjoy it because I have a opportunity to help people who doesn't have a bank account to cash their checks.
good,"Management was great. People was great. Hours was a bit confusing, great co workers, everyone did what was needed. Bit crowded at time, low on staff at times."
good,"Walmart's expectations and their pay don't match up. Also management is a joke, not all but most! There is good and bad with this company,  but when you are a single mom and doing the work I do and getting paid what I do it doesn't make it easy."
good,"The big things I took away from my time at Walmart was a strong work ethic and a love of connecting with other people, colleagues and costumers. Management was great, people were very friendly, and everyone worked together very well. The hardest part of the job was always trying to find new ways to be productive everyday."
good,"Typically your experience working for Wal-Mart is going to be the one you make it. You can choose to get to know your coworkers and build friendships and network with management, or you can choose to be a cog in the machine, constantly complain and have a miserable time. "
good,"The work at Walmart can be stressful, but the company and it's people are dedicated; my immediate work team was very helpful at providing balance.  You team up to work on major projects that support store operations or compliance.  There is a very strong feeling of ""getting something done"" and making a difference."
good,My experience at Wal-Mart was not all bad sometimes the management area can be not up to par. Sometimes i would come in and be the only one in my dept
good,Wal-mart is an ok place to work. It has good benefits. High turn-over.  Cashiers change very frequently and managers change often. Less turnover on the floor would be better.
good,Some of the managers did not care for the crew and would always require employees to stay later than scheduled time. The other employees made the job easier to manage working with supervisors.
good,"unloading trucks, stocking, set Deli trays, cut meats, spoke with customers, change dates on meat products - unloaded trucks - stocked merchandise, weighed meats fishes and poultry"
good,i would usually clock in five minutes till 10:00pm. we (3rd shift team) would have a small meeting in the back by the restrooms. this is when we would put together a game plan and discuss everyone's responsibilities for the night. after that we would get started on work. breaking down pallets separating merchandise into carts so its easier to put away. at midnight we would take our first break. the good thing about working overnight with no customers you have a set break time schedule. the first break is only 15 minutes . when brake time is over we returned back to work untill 2:00am when we would have another hour lunch. then  we would work up unitill its time to leave at 7:00am. many times we had dedalines or a certain amount of freight  we would have to cover before 7:00am. the job was very easy. the most enjoyable part was being able to work alone and being responsible for YOUR work and only your work. the hardest part would maybe be how unprofessional the staff were how they treated the employees. or their lack of knowledge they had as leaders was quite disappointing.
good,"10 to 7 staying up all night working"
good,really great pay but not so much room for advancement if you don't know people... management can be a bit picky about how you take your lunches and breaks...
good,"Being a cashier is very easy, but just very boring. Managers take awhile getting to you when you need them, which is frustrating for you and for customers."
good,Una exelente empresa un pago salarial muy bueno trabajo x pruduccion
good,"This was my second call center expierence, for roadside assistance. I enjoy helping ppl in need. "
good,Being professional is an atmosphere that is supported and passed down by all employees. Strong team work and communication develops work ethics of new employees.
good,I stocked shelves for a few months until I grew agitated by my supervisor yelling at all of us and the other employees not bothering to respect me. I changed my position to working carts outside and ironically I had a MUCH better experience in the parking lot (with various weather conditions) than I did in the back room unloading trucks. The guys I worked with outside were actually nice to me.
good,everyday i face new people and different kinds of people. some day i deal with people who get mad just because we dont have an item they need and other days we get understanding people. dealing with different manager and different coworkers. some of the managers show favoritism and a lot of the employees are drama filled
good,"Its an okay place to work at. The pace picks up around the weekends. The won't allow you to work over your schedule hours which means no overtime, but they give quarterly bonuses."
good,"work days always different "
good,"Retail is an ever changing beast. You have to keep up with the changes. However use common sense. It's not brain surgery, read numbers put it in the right spot. Not sure why corporate over analyze the job trying to be ""efficient """
good,"Great co workers, good environment, very demanding, no consistency, hours vary from from week to week. Great management. The pay is good, and I love working with the public. If I have some consistency it will be a better place to work."
good,"Starting out, seemed to be and was a great place to work. Times change and so do companies. Worked both overnight and day shifts in my many years of employment. Basically controlling inventory and making sales was the biggest responsibility. Doing these things by hand, such as stocking shelves and keeping overstock at a minimum, but being sure to have enough to fill the sales floor. Management here changed quite often, you get some that drill you constantly and some that will work with you. Those that worked with me normally stayed around longer, others not so much. The hardest part of the job was trying to listen to assignments by more than one boss, knowing that there isn't enough time to please all of them.I liked the atmosphere and people I worked with mostly, some became like almost family. The physicality of the job was demanding but reasonable. Pay rate could have been better for people with a lot of years of seniority. Management over the years I would have to grade at a C. Too many changes, in a short period of time for management I feel isn't a good thing. But I do understand the want or need to move up in a company, and this was a fast paced company for managers to come and go. I',ve seen it affect both customers and associates."
good,I worked at a newly opened Walmart and the management was not the best by any means. My manager in Automotive did so many things wrong and got away with it. If we had a problem and reported it he would not do anything about it.
good,I enjoyed working for walmart I loved the customer service aspect of the job I enjoying working with the public. The only thing I didn't like is the fact on breaks there were many times I didn't get a break or lunch and they wanted me to register that I did which is not right
good,"I'm thankful for WalMart being my first real job out of highschool. Back when I worked for the company, Hawaii based, it was a Great company to work for. I appreciated the family based company &'the ability to learn & grow within. Over 12 years w/the company I've learned A LOT and basically learn how detrimental my role plays in the company. Teaches you Respect for the Individual & to Strive for Sucess!"
good,"Typical work day was 8 hours a day. I worked as an assembler, so I had to put together grills, bikes, and displays. Management was good. Hardest part of the job was having to work under all of the department managers. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be around people."
good,"Checking customers out, exchanging money. Insuring that customers have a positive shopping experience. Keeping store/ personal area neat and in order."
good,plenty of room for advancement flexible with hours and fair wages a lot of interaction with customers while stocking the sales floor learned to work well under pressure and to work as a team to accomplish company goals
good,good place but the company need to improve the employer benefits. at my walmart excelente customer services manager. sometimes the managment dont give too much hours
good,This company has many opportunities to work in other areas but also you are able to advance in the store but also furthers you customer service skills
good,I loved Walmart just need better customer service and more people to cover positions so the lines wouldn't be so long other than that they hood management and cool employees i would love for any one to try it because they have positions for every one
good,"A typical day involves long hours, and sometimes little to show for it at the end.  All the effort you put in to meet your goals can be brushed aside by last minute changes.  ""An exercise in futility...."""
good,"En la empresa donde laboro actualmente cuanta con varios benficios para sus asociados que sin duda alguna ayudan mucho a la gente que se encuentra ahí dentro, sin embargo también existe una desventaja competitiva muy fuerte que es el sueldo ya que es demasiado bajo para las actividades y responsabilidades que se realizan dia con dia dentro de la misma."
good,"You have to be physically able to withstand lifting heavier boxes and constantly either stocking or cutting fruit daily while on the job. Since Produce is one of the most visited department at Walmart, members of the team need to be efficient and manage stocking accordingly. Also, maintaining cleanliness is vital because you're working with fresh food. Keep rotten foods off the floor and throw them out."
good,"It was an okay job. I did what I needed to do and didn't ever call in or miss work, so I didn't have a problem with management. It was sometimes a long day and the day is never the same. I did learn how to run a the front end and other management skills."
good,Working on the team I was on was special. We were the do all team. We put out fires around our store and other stores as needed. Personally picked by the store manager.  I enjoyed the daily challenges my team had to work on. I enjoyed the team I was on. The hardest part was going into other supervisors departments and trying to get them to understand why the changes we were coming to do were necessary.
good,"Fast pace ! Challenging job associates are great , management not to empathetic! Very easy to move up in the company ! Great benefits for full time staff. Very big on fundraising for charities!"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if you like retail or working to help a retail store function. I worked in the maintenance dept, which was responsible for the overall cleanliness of the store, but also pulled freight, stocked shelves and helped customers as needed."
good,Making sure that i get the job done at  appropriate timing. I learned that working together with coworkers makes good job efforts. they will help you with any questions that you have so that you can be on task. you deal with a lot of good heart people. Getting things done in the appropriate time frame. knowing that you can talk to management if you have any questions without hesitation!
good,"Stand at register ring up items, quiet atmosphere, learned customer service, Management was ok, Workplace culture was a little boring and quiet, but is getting better. Hardest part is the really long shifts, enjoyable part wasn't there."
good,Wal-Mart is a decent place to work for. There is lots of opportunity for advancement. It is a great place to meet people and a great place to learn. I would recommend Wal-Mart.
good,I enjoyed working there love my shift and my days I had to work third shift 11 to 7 Sunday thru Thursday would have stay if they didn't cut the money every 2 weeks by 10 percent. Other than.that great place to work
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work with lots of job choices. Advancement is almost guaranteed, and the environment isnt so bad. If you can't handle people then I would find something else."
good,"Great benefits. Can apply for 401k, Walmart stock and my share profits which are paid out quarterly. Flexible hours and fair management. Looks great on the resume. Fair pay with nice benefits. Great company to move up in if your interested in going higher in the company"
good,"Una empresa estable, con habiente laboral agradable, te da crecimiento en la empresa muy buena"
good,"Management isn't the greatest. They just put you to work no actual hands on training. Get really good hours, can only call in 4 times the first 6 months before you get fired."
good,"It was ok. Management wasn't the best ,not good at communicating with associate.change a lot of thing on there benefits, lost my job for no reason didn't get the right to get help to not lose my job."
good,Kind of felt like the employees and the management were very close but at the mercy of the company. The pay increase recently was an attempt to try and put a smile back on employees faces but the company has a lot that should be offered for the experiences in the average day.
good,"La calidad de vida no es la mejor no hay un buen balance entre tu vida personal y laboral"
good,"I enjoyed working here. I had a great crew on the front end and my supervisor was awesome. They have some new management since I worked there, which is a good thing."
good,The benefits were good and you got garunteed hours every week. You kind of just worked at your own pace. It's not a bad job overall. The co-workers are nice.
good,"I enjoyed the work I did here.  However, with constant Management shake ups, there was always a change in how to do the same job.  I didn't mind, as long as it gave good outlook.  The downside here is pay and benefits."
good,Walmart isn't a bad place like everyone says it is. It's easy work and decent pay! You work with a variety of people so you're bound to make relationships. Moving up in the company isn't very hard and they are very open to the idea of good people moving further with the company.
good,Walmart is a great place to work for if you love to talk to people. I just go around with my carts talking to all the cashiers and backroom members like a giant family.
good,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company."
good,"Trabaje para una sucursal de bodega, la operación de las cajas era sencilla pero lo único estresante es que solo hay un encargado para las 4 o 10 cajas que se abren y es la encargada de hacer cancelaciones cambios de precio y en ocasiones se mueve de su lugar lo que ocasiona que se generen filas y la gente ataca al cajero, fue lo único que no me gusto de ese trabajo, de ahí en fuera, la gente es muy amable, y los jefes comprensivos."
good,"- Learned how to use all the equipment available at the store. "
good,Very busy and fast paced. Learned to be well rounded in all areas of the General Merchandise side of the store. The management changes a lot. The hardest part of the job is around Christmas time. The most enjoyable were the bonuses and the discount. All around a good company to work for. Only wished they worked around schooling a little more.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consist of stay productive, serving customers to the best of your ability and displaying professionalism throughout your shift."
good,"I had stable hours when working for Walmart and the benefits were better than at some of my other jobs. There are opportunities for advancement if you fight hard enough for them. Management is terrible, however. Don't be surprised if you get yelled at daily for something you didn't do, or are expected to cram 10 hours worth of work into 8 hours. Management has unrealistic expectations for their employees and are quick to blame people rather than finding out what actually happened."
good,A good place to work that is fast paced and continually busy even though there are down times. Training program could use some work with actual help with hands on training.
good,"Some managers are good, some are bad.  Just as everywhere else.  Decent pay with decent benefits.  Co-workers are nice, overtime is not available often."
good,Walmart is a great place to work if you enjoy customer service. Their pay and bonus is nothing less than competitive. I believe the management needs work. Overall the company has been a pleasure to work with.
good,"A lot of management treats employees badly. Policies change so fast that its difficult for even management to keep up with them, which makes it harder on other associates and customers. As a CSM, I never get breaks, aside from my lunch."
good,They have really nice co workers htere but ther eis lack commincation between workers and managment and lack commincation in mangement but be nice place work therer pay is good if hard worker and like working alot it be good place for you.
good,only left cuz got an offer i could not refuse had to leave quickley so i can no longer work there i regret it cuz the job i got did not work out would work there again if i could
good,"was easy day. i lean to management my time, help the people every day on new things, the hard on this job is undentand the people needs, but i enjoy to help the people when they need ."
good,"The nighttime management has a great attitude. The nighttime associates, however, are an 80/20 split. 80 percent are mopey and always in a bad mood where 20 percent have an upbeat attitude. It is very hard to work with the negative people so your personal attitude is everything.It is also hard to get used to working nights. Your body and mind aren't programmed that way. Its also difficult to do your job properly in maintenance when you don't have all the supplies you need. We let management know we are completely out of something and it takes weeks to get what we need. Overall I enjoyed working for Walmart but it really wears you down after a while."
good,The customers were awesome along with most coworkers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management team. I learned something new everyday and also how to work in different areas of the store. The thing I enjoyed the most about this job was the customers and the friends I made while working there.
good,"It's easy to get in, but not so easy to move up. Worked okay for an in between or temporary place of work for me. I got along with my coworkers, and was able to perform daily tasks without issue. It was convenient to be able to do my shopping at my place of work, and the discount card was kinda nice."
good,Wal-mart was a fun place to work with amazing coworkers and amazing benefits for employees. Things got very hectic a lot of the time and it seemed as if management had to scramble most of the time to fix issues.
good,Working for the company was favorable there were plenty of opportunities for advancement and a nice package of benefits. management experienced shifts every now and then bringing fresh faces.
good,Good experience if you would like management experience. There's always a place to start somewhere and I think this is a good start for beginners. Good experience.
good,alot of hard and dedcation  i will seek to new oppurtuinties and desire pay and learn about more jobs and have a job that will work and comprehend with me
good,Muy cómoda en mi puesto de trabajo;buen compañerismo y personas muy solidarias y humanas ;en la tienda que me inicie que fue la tienda de caballito; un director excelente .
good,"Walmart is currently in the midst of an internal campaign to change it's company culture in an effort to be a better place to work. I don't know if it will work or not. Your experience could be highly dependent on the management at the store you work for."
good,"Walmart offered flexible scheduling to allow me to work and go to school. The people were great and fun to work with. The pay is low, but the health insurance was good."
good,You get paid more then you do at a restaurant at least. There's lots of screaming kids so id recommend ear plugs if you have sensitive ears. You will come across very interesting people of all kinds and small talk comes so easily. There are some rude customers but honestly not as much as I thought there would be. Pretty safe place to work. It might even be a living wage if you live at a cheap apartment.
good,"Management prefers you run around with your head cut-off rather than cool and collected, they perceive a calm demeanor as lazy.  There are too many managers all wanting to do different things so getting things done can be stressful as one will tell you do something  as a priority only to be stopped and told to do something else by another, and when you try to explain what you've already been tasked with as a priority, they will shrug you off and still expect you to do it."
good,I only needed the job for something to do while in school and it was very annoying. Pushing carts twenty four seven is indeed tiring with little breaks.
good,Working at walmart was amazing wish i never messed it up but it was a good pay was always on time. The managers were really nice and generous and they made sure fo help you out when needed. Walmart is a good job.
good,"its good for a job, definitely not a career I would choose. Work is steady when its comes, though can get tedious. Distribution Center far outclasses the stores in quality and professionalism"
good,"Walmart is a place where you learn so much about yourself and others. Everyone is different so the culture is very rich and enjoyable. A typical day at work consists of handling customer concerns and problems. Sometimes that is the hardest part of the day because some customers aren't very difficult to please. Although some customers are difficult, talking to and interacting with the customers is the most enjoyable part of my job. The management team at Walmart is very easy to get along with and are very efficient with their job. I love the management team that I work with."
good,"Retail is a tough job to be in. You have to be willing to schedule your personal life around your job. Some employers will be flexible with your schedule when you have family obligations, or are going to school. But they normally won't guarantee your hours if your availability is not open."
good,"The people I work with in the shop are really nice people, its the company that is getting bad. I think I should get paid more than what I do. its not a job I want to be working at for the rest of my life"
good,Walmart is a good job when it come to benefit and that's all. The Management in the store is so off. There never ok the same page and all of them wants the work don't for they area before finishing priorities. The departments never stays fully staffed because the company has a high turnover rate so high so the store are always seeming busy and looking dirty.
good,"A typical work day at the deli was not always busy but you had to be always maintaining some type of work. If you had no work to do inside the deli you could zone the aisles. At Walmart I learned how to maintain attendance using a point system, how to zoon, learn and remember policies, and how to use a slicer."
good,Trabalha la foi umas das minha melhor experiencia empresa otima.
good,Stay proficient and punctual. Also keep an accurate and responsible account of your attendance. Put customer service and regards above all else. Dress according to code and presentable. Stay busy with work for your entire shift.
good,Job wasn't too bad at first but then new rules came into play and the whole environment changed makin it worse. Other staff members were really cliquey and management are very rude ignorant and like to talk about other employees all day
good,"The hardest part of this job was working with people who didn't like their jobs."
good,the typical day at work was we would have a meeting to start out then we would get assigned to our areas then we would split and work threw out the night. i learned how too properly handle merchandise. Management wasn't the greatest but i never complained. Workplace was very fun when you unloaded the trucks.
good,"A day at Walmart is like a worker bee, its non stop. Its busy and full of productivity. A manager from each and every department can pull you in any and every direction. Its filled with different nationalities and the hardest part is being sidetracked when you're doing one job and someone needs you to stop immediately and do another job. The most enjoyable part is seeing you're products that you've stocked or you're displays that you built being looked at by customers."
good,Good job with good pay and benefits. Management is caring and attentive. Concerns are tended to promptly. Ideas for better of job are taken in and utilized if deemed beneficial.
good,"Bonne façon d'apprendre à parler avec le public, quand on travaille sur le plancher on a la chance de voir se quils ont sur les étalages du magasin."
good,"Lugar agradável "
good,Well the management worked with me pretty well. I loved to work there and took and changed work days with others got many friends from working there. It was also well kept up and people where also nice.
good,I enjoy working at walmart but their pay scale isnt fair. People with less experience are starting at higher wages than someone who has been in retail for years.
good,"Working at walmart has been a good experience...lots of potential,lots of relocation possibilities...you meet great people along the way....I believe retail in general got to me...Christmas has never been the same....holidays seem like any ordinary day....at the end of the day, you choose to stay or make a change..."
good,"Everyone who works at Walmart, from my experience, are some of the nicest people I have met. My favorite part of work is being able to ask them how they're doing, how is the family. My least favorite part of a day is when I don't have enough coverage during the busiest hours, but one way or another I always get it done, with help from management or solving it myself. Working with Walmart I have learned how to keep my cool when having a rough day in a busy environment."
good,"I have been there less than 5 years and have held and promoted 5 times.  They offer  benefits after a probation period including health, 401K, and stock purchase."
good,"There are pros and cons to every place you work. Overall, it is a good place to work. Hopefully you can work up into management. A place to grow with,"
good,A typical day at work was to come in and make sure your cash register was counted and your area was well maintained. Management acknowledged your hard work. The hardest part of the job was to make sure every customer was satisfied. I enjoyed the fast paced environment because I like to stay busy.
good,"I was a loader when I worked here and I have to say despite all of the uneccessary write ups from AP or Management, that this job was fairly laid back. None the less this position was very productive and kept you in constant motion."
good,"a cat jumped over the ship, where it landed, I do not know. I hope that you do not read this post in hopes of real insight as I am not writing it to have any."
good,"All the days come with new challenges in retail industries and walmart is one of the leading companies."
good,"excessive training before you are placed at your position, management is fair and workable, the hardest issue to deal with was with difficult customers, but over all the staff and job are bearable"
good,had agreement to work so many nights a week and agreement was not adhered to...was very faced paced environment.. Was in an area with very difficult customers
good,"Typical work day is crazy and nothing is organized. I usually am teaching the managers how to do their job. The hardest part of the job is being patient with people who should know what they are doing, but still need help every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay."
good,"It has a good environment, but alot of people are grumpy, or in a bad mood , the customers can be hard to handle. The breaks were always right on the dot though."
good,Starting Walmart was great.  I actually caught on better than most would.  Hours started off great but after a while they began to take away employee's hours.
good,I enjoyed working with the Walmart family. I've learned to open up more as a people person I connect with others better. I love the work culture everybody work as a team
good,i was young and i had fun here. this was a great job i learned a lot from here. if you get to work here i would stay if i was you. i still go to the one i worked at and i see all the people i worked with still there
good,"Fast pace work area. Must make rate to keep job. Work has been low lately. Hands on, equipment training done at job location. No experience needed. Good management team!"
good,Good place for hard working and dedicate associates to advance into the management field.  Fast pace working environment. Needs more associates on the floor and in the backroom.
good,"A typical day at work was actually pretty busy on my side. Stocking shelves, basic physical work but i really like that type of position. What i learned was that no matter how organized you can be, on a day the company falls behind in some areas, always be prepared to change up a routine so you don't fall behind on your assigned duties. The most enjoyable part of it for me besides the hour lunch was independent work they trusted me to complete on my own."
good,"Walmart is a company which you have a choice of what you want to to do, but you have to be mindful on what you ask for. The work is pretty much simple depending on where in the company you in (store, corperate, etc)."
good,"gostei porque tem  plano de carreira, tinha plano de saúde etc..."
good,I have learned very much from the different positions held at this job I have met and maintained valued friendships. This is a diverse culture and there are many unique individuals employed here. THe job is rewarding on a small scale level .Managment just do not acknowledge the good things that we do on a daily basis or when we stand out.
good,"I enjoy working at Wal-Mart, but in times of low staff (which happens quite often), it is extremely difficult to enjoy working. I love to work, and i work hard. I just don't like to have to do the work of two other people on top of my work as well. The pay is pretty good and plenty of advancement opportunities so that is a plus."
good,"overall it isn't a bad company. the problem is due to the management. not all managers are the issue. the issues come from them hiring people with no people skills and no experience in retail, that causes unrealistic goal setting and improper attitudes towards the people that are working for you."
good,"Uma boa empresa, boas oportunidades crescimento profissional, bem estruturada."
good,"Empresa focada em ser exemplo de excelência no atendimento ao cliente dando sempre oportunidade primeiramente aos associados quando surge uma vaga dentro da empresa caso não preencha internamente ai que divulgam a vaga externamente."
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart and in the time that I worked there I learned a lot about retail. I enjoyed what I did but was ready to try something new with a new company. There was no room to grow as Walmart was a huge company.
good,"Although this is a great company to work for there are many flaws. Work/life balance is non- existent. Yes, the pay is competitive compared to other retailers but you work 60 hours a week. I wish this company was more family oriented and helped salary employees maintain a better work/life balance."
good,"The training program is lacking at Walmart, and they move you around a lot. You are thrown on different jobs with little or no training and expected to know how to do it. For the most part, I enjoyed my job at Walmart."
good,"Aprendi muito com a Empresa, contribuiu muito para meu crescimento profissional, sempre trabalhamos muito em equipe, um sempre ajudando o outro, muitas vezes dando suporte em outros setores."
good,"É um lugar bom para se trabalhar, mas na filial que trabalhei não estipulam funções faz meio de tudo"
good,My time spent with this company was fruitful and decedent on my future as becoming a man but what I'm capable of then and now are horse shoes to hand grenades
good,They work great with your schedule. They have great customer service. They love hiring people who are willing to work and those who eager to learn. Walmart is a great company to grow
good,Make sure your stock was out all your sales had singes department was clean every thing in there right spot folded hanged on the right hangers
good,"It was easy to advance there,they dnt have set schdules snd weekends were mandatory.and they dnt let you get overtime. Its a great job depending  on the manger at the store you work"
good,"In my overall review Walmart was a great learning experience as a first time job, I learned more than I had expected and met some really amazing people and made new friendships, my manager and supervisors were always friendly and helpful whenever I had any questions or concerns, many of the employees there became like my second family, they made work feel like home and everyone always had something new to teach me, whether it was something as simple as  learning how to make price changes to more advanced like on operating certain machines, Walmart definitely helped me step out of my learning comfort zone and I will forever be grateful for the learning experience and the amazing people who became my teachers, my friends, and second family."
good,"Working for Walmart was a new experience and one I will not forget. Most days were moderately paced at the cash register and the customer service job was something I rather enjoyed. I learned how to run a register, safety in the building, reporting suspicious characters, and how to be a polite person even in the presence of a rude customer. I learned the importance of maintaining retail and keeping a neat, tidy and positive work environment. I had communication with management and got along well with everyone. The hardest part was days of being understaffed at the register or not having a manager available to assist in purchases requiring an override. I enjoyed most getting to train new people to cashier even though I hadn't been there as long as most people. I took pride in my ability to do my job and tried to instill that in the people I helped to train."
good,"In an average day, I dealt with a multitude of customers needing/wanting several different things.  I returned merchandise, signed in vendors, handled complaints, took in compliments, dealt with customers about the scanning code of practice, put away products to be returned to the shelf, and took in products to be shrunk out of the inventory.  I was also dealing with cash sales, and purchase orders from government organizations, not to mention credit sales from organizations around the city.  We handled fundraising posters, and put together the charity ""tokens"" to be put on the wall.  I learned a lot about customer satisfaction, but I really learned that no matter what, if your managers don't back you up, the customer gets what they want, 100% of the time, regardless of policy.  The management at the Wal-Mart store, were notorious for making customers happy by ignoring all policies about returning merchandise, doing it ""just this once"".  I enjoyed the employees I worked with, they were all very friendly.  The hardest part of the job was being harshly reprimanded by a customer over something that I had no control over, then having a manager come up to the front, say the same thing I did, and the customer being completely and utterly fine with it.  I loved the people I worked with.  They were awesome to be around.  We really enjoyed working together."
good,I found the companies beliefs and values to be true to their employees. The benefits and compensation offered were comparable to the area. The only thing that made me look to other companies was lack of advancement opportunity. The local market was not big enough for the volume of people looking for advancement and relocation was not an option at the time.
good,Wal-Mart can be a good places to work for if you are willing to accept the pay of $7.65 and will not have any benefits until 6 months later.
good,I love the people I work with there. I learn a lot work with different personality and have a lot of patient with difficult people and I really like the management team. The best part of my day was putting a smile on customer face.
good,Walmart was generally the same thing most days when i wasn't helping with customers i was working on the cars. i started off in toys and sporting goods til i gradually moved to automotive
good,Teaching. U customers service. Life goals how to move up respect. People. Benefits. Are good job training. Good management helps. As needed. Good starter. And life goals
good,Some of the things that I liked about working at Walmart is the divers work experience and opportunity's for advancements. Management was not properly ready for there requirements as a manager.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be getting up early and preparing to start my day. Driving to the location of my employment. Next I would prepare my department for the upcoming day. I would greet incoming customers and answer any questions they may have about products within my department or where they may find what they are looking for. I would make sure my department was neat and tidy."
good,I work for Wal-mart from March 2015 to December 2015. In the time of me working for this company. I learned that you can move up quickly if you work hard. I worked on nights and I worked on days. they are really good with working with you on your schedule. if you need certain days off as long as they know a head of time they can comply. It is a good job to get your foot in the door and advance into a career. It just was not the place for me.
good,The Staff was very welcoming and fun to work with. I learned a lot about individual needs that customers may have. The hours were complicated. The overall experience was wonderful.
good,"incompetent managers, but trustworthy and loyal colleagues. I learned much in my time there, especially as it was my first job."
good,Busy and fast paced environment  with one on one customer relations.i have improved on my multi task skills and problem solving . I have gained knowledge and experience in a management position . I enjoy the customers that come in from young to old . Development and growth are very important to me as well as furthering  my knowledge and gaining more confidence and understanding .
good,I unloaded a lot of heavy like 75 lbs. I had been work so hard to obey and follow the manage directions. I love to do unload all truck and warehouse all time.
good,assigned tasks.worked solo or sometimes with others.learned display and social skills.needed management when questions arrived.sometimes stressful near holidays and seasonal times.became a extended family.shared poductivity.worked in several areas.people learned to help others.clean enviorment
good,So mangers seem to tell you stuff just to get you out of there face a typical day  is do more less help .Everyday seems to be some new rule.
good,good and hard working associates with mediocre management. Hard to ask for certain days do to difficulty in schedule changes
good,The job is time dependent and very rushed the unloading department is a big job with high expectations the managers make things difficult but other associates are rather a pleasure to be around
good,I didn't stay long because I moved out of town. I will say this it does depends on what location your in the environment and attitude of the store varies.
good,"couper les fruits et légumes au besoin, assurer un service à la clientèle à la demande du client. les employeurs étaient toutes et tous gentil et nous accordaient du temps si on en avait besoin. Les horaires de travail était flexible. Le plus difficile dans ce poste était de soulever les caisses ou les descendre dans le réfrigérateur puisque certaine d'entre elle était très lourde. l'aspect le plus agréable était d'interagir avec les clients et placer la marchandise."
good,les journée passe vite quand ils y a beaucoup a faire
good,"A typical day at work was very busy all the time as there was always projects to work on. I learned to deal with the public in a positive way no matter the circumstances. Most of the time management was very helpful, at times we were disciplined before the circumstances surrounding the occurrence was understood. The workplace culture was quite diverse which I enjoyed very much. The hardest part of my job was dealing with irate customers. I, however, became very good at calming situations, letting the customer know I was on their side and doing anything I could to help them. The best part of my job was helping customers and making them feel good about the company and its friendly service."
good,Doing your job is what will drive you but the expectations from customers and management will make you want to get better or make you want to quit. Days here can be stressful but for the most part I enjoyed it.
good,"Great place to work if your young and either in school or still trying to figure out life. Not an ideal long term career imo, contrary to loyal assoc."
good,"A typical day I walmart you get the opportunity to interact with many different kinds of people. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to satisfy the customer. Working in the deli wasn't difficult at all. It consisted of cooking, cleaning, sanitizing, and attending to customers."
good,"I've worked the overnight shift at walmart and it was quite a challenge, but it worked well with my schedule, the management team was great, i enjoyed working at walmart"
good,A typical day at walmart can be fairly smooth. There is always work to do. I learned a lot about returns and cashing checks and other different services working in the money center.
good,This place can be fun sometimes but can be hectic you do have some people some nice people there's always something to do sometimes I feel like it over work you sometime sometimes you get your 40 sometimes you don't just kind of have to roll with the punches when it comes to Walmart
good,"setting up front end working with cashiers and taking care of 26 tills."
good,great place to start off but not long term for adults too much drama in Walmart even if you try and avoid it. Good place if you want decent money and if you go in work and go home.
good,"Enjoyed working here, great people and culture, but no room for growth. Management very confused and not clear on goals. Leadership not very helpful."
good,"je rentrais à 17h et je finissais à 21h et durant mon quart de travail, j'étais appelée à répondre aux demandes des clients et à les conseiller sur le type de produit qu'ils voulaient acheter. Puis, je devais garnir mes tablettes et contoire de fournitures pour que le département est une belle allure."
good,Walmart offers a lot of advancement opportunities and good pay. Job can be secure. Breaks and lunches are very reasonable. You can definitely learn a lot at Walmart if desired.
good,"I have worked at Walmart as a Self-check out host, helping customers, and maintaining a clean and well organized environment. Cleaning, stocking merchandise, and handling cash with care and expertise."
good,Best shift to work overnight if you can. Overnight is straight forward and usually only one manager on duty. Just go in and work hard and you have no problems.
good,"A typical workday would include lots of moving in order to pick up carts that are scattered throughout the parking lot. The management, however, to me is a little odd. For example, why would there only be one cart associate in charge of the entire parking lot for an extensive period of time. The hours were exhausting, but the pay was decent."
good,"I had crazy hours at Walmart, I was hired as a part time but I couldn't turn down the opportunity to make a lot of money so I had to put in more hours which made me like a full timer sometimes. The coworkers were very frienldy. The job itself was very physical but we had machines which made it easier."
good,"Great group of people in the workplace. It have a great 3day, 4day schedule. Good company to work for if u like to relocate, easy to transfer anywhere in the world."
good,"estaba yo feliz hasta que me despidieron"
good,"A empresa e Boa para se trabalhar mais eu não quis mais, pois eu queria algo melhor."
good,"good pay and raises. t was an okay job, few hours but for the most park okat theres not much to say but make sure you do youre availibity correct the first time"
good,Good education opportunities and benefits for all workers. Low pay for hourly workers. Decent opportunity for advancement. Not a bad company to work for overall. Good opportunities for veterans.
good,"Currently, I am a personal shopper for pick up today. When people order online, I go get it for them. Now I am training to work at service desk. My manger is not the nicest out of all department managers."
good,"Unloader work days went from 4pm-1am. As long as you have a good crew everything will work out. (I did)"
good,it ok to work day by day.not very fun but not hard.i like it here .the think is i need make more money.i learn alln kind of forklift machene s to operate.the management wasn't very good.
good,"stock sales floor, bin overstock into bins, zone department. Management is decent. Hardest part of my jobs is being forced to work outside my availability. And most enjoyable part is most days go by quickly."
good,During my time at Wal-Mart i can honestly say that i enjoyed the the work environment. The core values of how employee's and customers should be treated made itemployevery famuly oriented. My daily task were always accomolished in a timely manner. I can say without a doubt that i went over and beyond and the level of appreciation was reciprocated through my peers.
good,Wal-Mart is a great job with a lot of work. They have good benefits and they let you get overtime. Wal-Mart is a workplace were you can retire from. They teaches you everything you need to know to become a great employees.
good,its very easy to work there and easy to learn how to do all the task and safe but not enough your rating to pay all your bills.its hard to do sometimes the every month computer task that not match you work job and some time you have an uncompromising work not include to you
good,Good overall experience... management could have been a little better and could have gave better hours. I enjoyed the employees
good,"Walmart is a great company to work for. Advancement in walmart ia not an issue as long as you come to work and do what is asked of you. Be friendly, open minded, care about customers. Always keep merchandise in stock and shelves stocked."
good,"Buen hambiente de trabajo. El tiempo es bien ocupado, hay compañerismo"
good,Working overnight was cool.Kept my mind focus.Stocking is pretty easy.I worked at a fast paste to make sure my job was done on time.Sometimes ill get done early and would have to help others.
good,"good working people , good working job site . just isn't paying good enough . very manage , cleaning after every work shift . sometime not enough hours worked"
good,"A good place to work , no room to grow. Management needs to work together. They offer paid time off and health care , but have no accountability for the people that don't do they jobs. Raises are across the board so there's no incentive to be better"
good,"Typically good for hours. Management there is not completely developed. Some managers are good , while others have some skills they could work on(Leadership Wise). Managers there always expected too much while not actually helping achieve the goals set. Benefits as far as paid vacations hours where good though, they basically started racking up after training. The sick policy is lacking though. I almost lost my job because I was sick for a week with a really bad stomach flu(They did not care about a doctors note). They told me that if I called in one more day after that I would lose my job. I had do go 3 months without 1 sick day."
good,"my days was always a good day in walmart. i learned alot knowing the customers and also knowing your job i learned how to use a sku gun scan items how to look for items in the backroom of the store."
good,Work was very demanding on you physically. You had to meet your quota or you can get in trouble. The people where very nice to work with and very friendly.
good,a great place  to work..you learn something new everyday..its ok management team..everyone is friendly and helpful...dealing with rude customers sometimes get hard..helping customers accomplish what they need done for the day feels good.
good,Retail work is very challenging. Fast paced but many corporate changes take place. Most of the associates were very friendly and fun to work beside. Management does their best to work with you and accommodate your needs for schedule changes. Hardest part of the job is crabby customers that don't treat the associates very well and the high rate of customer theft. The most enjoyable were the great people that made the day a little sweeter.
good,When you are willing to learn new things in the store there are a few people who are willing to teach. it is not easy to move up but be persistant. keep a positive attitude and the customer always comes first.
good,Its an ok place to work. I didnt like that i couldnt get major holidays off to spend with my kids and also they have favoritism going on to. I wouldnt work there again
good,"I liked working at Walmart, it was a good job and I would recommend this place but keep in mind if you have a medical condition you may not want to apply."
good,"Ensured excellent customer service for the electronics department .	"
good,"When I first got hired I was already knew that I am going to be dealing with more customers then I ever experienced. During my days as a cashier I showed my abilities to adapt to the customers and new challenges that was put upon me. The workplace was and still is understaffed, but I will continue to work hard as that's why I feel that no matter what job I do I will continue to show excellence in the category of work ethic. The hardest part of the job is to keep your head up and stay professional and stay focus to the task at hand. The only part that was enjoyable where some of the co-workers even though the job is stressful sometimes a laugh or two will help keep my morale up for the rest of the shift. Nevertheless I need to find a decent paying job for the new life I plan on living as an individualist and one I can be interested in if possible."
good,"Some of Walmart's policies are impossible to deal with, the attendance policy being one of them. I understand why the policies are in place but if you can't meet them you lose your job and Walmart doesn't care. I got marks against my attendance on days that my managers sent me home early due to not much work to be done. I also got marks against my attendance for being late due to weather conditions."
good,Worked back in the electronics department and also the cell phone portion. Dealt with a wide variety of guests. Helped them select what was needed and answered many questions
good,It was fun productive people were friendly they have Flex time and it's like when you come in from work you be happy to work. People were a lot friendly in the people you work with or cool and calm I always seem to know what to do.
good,"Hard working, reliable associate is treated the same as an associate that doesn't show for work or has bad work ethics. WalMart seems to not care about a good associate ""they are easily replaceable"". I disagree with that culture. I believe that every employee and employer should be treated with respect but rewarded only for there ability and ethics."
good,"Great Opportunities. Long hours. Interactions with customers, and great associates. Great management every now and then. Friendly customers and decent pay."
good,"Wal-Mart as a company is a great employer in my opinion. However, I had a hard time with my training and management. Once I learned on my own I was able to be very effective in my duties. But it took my own effort at times to learn."
good,"Almost always busy. Learned how to deal with difficult customers, and learn from really nice and friendly customers. Sometimes, workers feel like the management doesn't hear their concerns. Hardest part of the job is finishing all tasks assigned in my department after being sent to other departments that managers felt like needed more attention."
good,I worked overnight at Walmart and it was basically like working in a factory. We had to do so much labor for a such a small pay. The good thing abut working at walmart is that you can advance easily in the company if you stay within 6 months to a year.
good,"I think Walmart is a good job if you're just starting out and looking for a job. You don't have many bills or responsibilities, then this job is perfect especially if you get the job as a cashier. But after a while your hours are being cut and the money you make after taxes isn't enough once you start to accumulate bills. Then eventually you start to feel as if your working more than your earning."
good,Wal-Mart - is a very good company to work for they have very good service and its easy to find what you need. they also have a huge variety of things in there stores.
good,As a cashier at Walmart it is always busy and can make the day seem to go by quicker. I learned how to quickly bag and sort groceries. I enjoyed helping customer with their purchases and loading their cart for them.
good,Walmart is a fast past environment. Learning quickly and able to adjust to changes in environment and job tasks are key. I was able to advance quickly in this environment. Multiple managers make it hard to have a concrete long term goal however quick short term goals that are able to make positive change happened often.
good,"Overall great place to work at. The people are easy to get along with. They offer very good benifits. The money was fast and easy. Managers were okay, some had attitudes but the coworkers are friendly."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart would be helping every customer checkout their items for purchase. While i worked at Wal-Mart learned multiply traits from being better at multitasking and public speaking.
good,there are a variety of positions available in this company. The better you do your job the more work you will acquire. There is room for advancement. You will likely have to work many holidays.
good,Very solid overall workplace even plane as far as moving up the chain and management involvement. During my employment with Wal-mart i experienced tough situations and a healthy amount of customer service.
good,"Not really a job my speed, but it's decent enough.  The nights are sometimes unpredictable, sometimes we were busy, sometimes not, and sometimes the break times change for each person (as well as when the bathroom is closed for cleaning).  The other people there were nice, though the managers need to keep a closer eye out for safety violations.  The site has a commissary for dinner, which has nice food, but they really need to restock the silverware more often.  Also, break is twenty minutes getting there and back for a job that you'll spend seven and a half hours (at least) on your feet.  In closing, decent pay, but a little disorganized."
good,"MY particular Walmart was difficult to work in because of many reasons such as non-prudent CSMs (who authorize your orders+help with the occasional customer) but not all of them are so. Most likely, your experience will be decent."
good,"Its what you make it. You have to keep a sense of humor, and stay to yourself. the best advice i can give. Management can sometimes play favorites. The co workers take a lot. The hardest part is the rude people, or the attitude from co workers. But i stay to myself, and do my job."
good,"It was a good store people were nice and the district manager was great , it was good to learn the RV books and everything in and out of the store."
good,"Everything about working there was great. The people, the management great culture. The hours were terrible but that's the retail industry."
good,Foi muito bom trabalhar lá a única coisa que desanimava era muitas promessas e poucas é ram compridas
good,"A typical day at work begins with helping the customers standing and waiting for assistance. After finishing within them I begin to start on daily freight to insure that the shelves are full. When I'm done with that, I typically clean and dust the department until its my time to leave. I think the hardest but most enjoyable part of my job is customer assistance. I've learned to be patient with uncooperative and angry people, but in the end I do enjoy my job."
good,"A typical day at work involved:"
good,Walmart was not the best but certainly not the worst. They took way Holiday pay to replace it with PTO which was not good for me. Most of the time you know more than your own manager but a job is a job.
good,A typical day at Walmart isn't what you expect it to be. Its more a game where Management play favoritism which this is not what a company should be based on.my co workers are awesome to work with we get the job done. The hardest part is them over working their best workers because of the next persons slack. the best part of the day is the customers they really make your day better with the positive vibes and smiles they bring.
good,"A typical day at work is trying to stay on routine while balancing daily opportunities that come up.  I learned very good techniques about distributing work force to accomplish tasks.  Management I worked with were in many cases struggling to keep up.  Many of my co workers were able and dedicated people who I would trust for a variety of tasks for the company and services to the customer.  "
good,"Empresa boa pra se trabalha muita oportunidade de crescimento em promoções ,mais alguns lideres torna um ambiente um pouco chato."
good,I had a great experience working at wal mart. Everyday was a great joy meeting new people and assisting different personalities everyday. I learned that everyday is a new day to learn something new.
good,"I enjoy the job, but the hours are rough on my day to day schedule.  Hours conflict with my girl friend's work / live schedule"
good,"This job enabled me to meet many new people and learn many life skills. I would love to work at this job again. Worked as as cashier in sporting goods. Sold guns, hunting and fishing licenses."
good,Okay pay. They work well with your schedule. Co-workers were the best. Management wasn't that great. Employ discount card is a good add but the discount itself isn't worth it.
good,"*scan dock "
good,"Its a pretty easy job, no hard work. Not that great on hours. They could pay better, but for the most part its ok. The employees was my only reason for staying."
good,My manager and upper management were not loyal to me or other associates.  The overall job was fulfilling and motivating.
good,I Liked  the job somewhat. wanted too much for the pay they give you. Needs new bosses. tehy are over your shoulder almost doing everything.
good,I really enjoyed working with the customers. I learnt a lot about customer service and retail. I really liked my coworkers and most of our management team. The reason I left was for personal reasons.
good,"This generally speaking in my location and I'm sure not all are this way. Definitely low on employees and customers were in need of service but no employee in sight. I covered half the store and when someone needed assistance in my department with a low wait time, id get into trouble, then I would state that no one is around to help customers and its my job to do so. I am very knowledgeable of every department in the store, so if customers had questions I had answers."
good,I like the hours that I work and get. I work with a good team. I also have a good management team. But I would like to be able to get over time.
good,The only thing that can fire you at Walmart is yourself.  All jobs there have an importance but everything is a team game.  Shifting priorities and a non stop.  Be prepared to work hard and you will achieve your goals.  All stores are different and unique with problems and achievements.
good,typically access store stock items determine what needs to be restock and what do not fill all unstock items from back inventory.
good,"Walmart overall isn't a terrible place to find yourself. That being said some of their more recent policies are slightly more aggravating than they need to be. I found though that you could live with the new policies if your management was top notch, however, if your management is actually not top notch you combine them with some of the policies and suddenly Walmart isn't as decent a work environment as it could be."
good,"Want a career change. After 15 years with war I'd like a career change. I no longer agree with some of the policy changes, so I feel it's time to make a change. Looking forward to new adventure."
good,I loved working for Wal-Mart but the management is the worst part about the company.  None of the manager's are on the same page and because of this you can get in trouble because you will be doing one thing that a manager told you to do but another doesn't agree so you take the fall for it.
good,"Its an okay job, Job security and good pay for what you do. Management is okay. A lot of different people from different places so sometimes communication is a problem but other than that its good."
good,"Lorsque j'était aux études, c'était parfait. Mais maintenant je cherches quelque chose d'autre."
good,"I worked friday,saturday,Sunday it's was a great place to work except on black Friday. Other then that the management was superior at customer service"
good,"This was a decent place to work. The managers made it easy to work with them, and the pay was great. My only complaint is that the work I signed up for and the work I was doing were quite different. I applied to work in electronics, and instead I was placed in the outdoor/garden center, operating registers, stocking shelves, and pulling and organizing freight. all in all, I would not work here again, simply because they were misleading in their description of the job"
good,It was great place to a point then just goes down hill like some mangers not all were pain. the some worker are more friendly then others.over all it was more we tell everyday same old thing so it just drive u nuts or u quiet.
good,"got to work, did facing of products for the most part, got to go outside to collect arts which was the best part also got to meet a lot of lovely people and help them if need be. As store standards it was my job to keep the place clean."
good,Management needs work. They don't stand up for their employees. They can be very rude it was nice dealing with different people
good,"I had learned more about electronics like processors on lap tops, how to work the technology that the Walmart workers were allowed to use. I had also worked in other areas through out my work experience like packaging, garden, and Toys."
good,"sus políticas y normatividades son estrictas y rigurosas  "
good,"A typical day consisted of picking all our orders, which then need to be shorted or sorted in totes. We would pack the orders into boxes, placing them on the correct pallet and then wrap them and ship them out on the FedEx truck."
good,"Fast-paced and you are always on your feet"
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you have a busy schedule.  They are willing to work with you if you need to switch up shifts or take a day off. Also the employees there are fun to work with.
good,"Working at walmart you always have to be ready to work. be prepared to have a load of work to get accomplished. Overall, i liked working there. They give a break every two hours which i think is very needed. thank you.`"
good,the managers there didnt provide the equipment i needed to fullfill the job. And also there is alot of favoritism. like you go and ask for a scanner and they say they dont have one but then someone else comes and asks the same question and they have one and they say yes here come let me give you one.
good,"Walmart is customer oriented "
good,"I have worked at several Wal-Marts in two different states and the management all seems to be the same. Otherwise, this is a great place to work, And the benefits are good."
good,Can be fun at times and you have to work in a timely manner a lot of fun customers can be very rewarding and co workers as well
good,Typical day shift as a cashier can be anywhere from 4 1/2 hours- 9 hours. I enjoyed being a cashier although at times that the store is dead the job can be boring.
good,"llega la carga,y a descargar,acomodar,limpiar,cambio de etiquetas,planogramación,la gerencia es una porqueria por que ahi tienen sus relaciones entre ellos,no puedes subir de rango tan fácil,mis compañeros eran buenos,aunque no todos,la parte más difícil,era acomodar la mercancia en las bodegas,y al hacer el inventario,contar pieza, por pieza de todo. lo que mas me gustó fue aprender a utilizar maquinas para el mejor funcionamiento y control en la tienda."
good,The co-workers were always welcoming and willing to teach new employees. Management always wanted sales associates to go to departments that did not belong to them. Zone at 2o'clock is the reason most people leave.
good,You barely have time to yourself they are awful at scheduling around your availability management is very bi Polar people can be very rude at times even when you do your job
good,"A typical work day at Walmart would be fast pace, challenging projects, outgoing customers and workers. I would normally come in and start stocking the floor or unloading a truck. Once I was done with that I would count and organize my department, then order what I needed to. In the time between my tasks I would help customers in need."
good,Wal-Mart is a company that believes in serving the customer with as much help that is possible. It is imperative that an associate must be communicative with other associates and customers in order to get the job done right.
good,"all though the people there are great, the money is not good enough for the work. I am going through a temp since the company made it so hard to get in through them,"
good,for the most part it was good but had alot of cons not alot of teaching and some managers just dont care.and sometimes you can be treated badly.
good,"Managers made it really hard on everyone. Many demands were outside of our job description. Low pay, but what I did like was how we could always get more hours whenever we wanted to. Personnel had a few people that I really liked."
good,typical day of work is fun and challenging  to pick all the hot orders and have them out to shipping department in a timely manner nice people very divers
good,An easy job to start out at and build yourself a career. Great Job training and multiple job opportunities. Consistent work and generally good hours. No experience necessary
good,I choose not to answer ore planning and organizational skills could have been used. More delegation was needed. More management supervision would have been helpful.
good,"I had a pretty decent experience. My coworkers were pretty friendly, the pay was great for someone with as little experience as I, and the hours were decent. But don't expect management to treat you very well. This doesn't apply to everybody of course, but most of the management seemed very power hungry and didn't know where to send each employee. They asked for impossible tasks to be accomplished by too few people, or people with improper training. Overall, it was okay. If you need money and don't mind sub par treatment, this is a good job."
good,"it was different working here, as i was only part time. I'm use to rude and negative people but working in retail has changed my whole look on being happy and doing what will make me happy."
good,The people are some of the best people I will ever know.  They treat everyone as family and help you whenever they can.  Two breaks and an hour lunch on an eight hour work day is always good.
good,"I disliked working at Walmart, there were constant rude customers & the coworkers were total jerks. Management was horrible, would not recommend working there"
good,"Empresa com foco nos seus objetivos, que facilita muito o aprendizado dos seus colaboradores."
good,Loved my job. The only reason for leaving was due to family. They are great to work for and I would recommend any one. They need to work with having a schedule that is more work/life friendly.
good,"1st come 1st serve policy, Work on customers cars as fast as possible. Manager Helps out as service adviser. Co-workers, All friendly and help out in any way in any department. Jobs get hard when most co-worker goes to lunch at the wrong time as many customer comes for same service."
good,"I had a few friends working with me at the time i was employed at walmart, but they shortly quit. So, i stayed with the company for a little while longer, but the management was horrible. They treated they're employees like garbage and didn't give a darn about anyone of them."
good,I mostly work in the warehouse making bales and cleaning it  but I also help out cleaning with the maintenance team.  Scrub the floors and do other tasks
good,Worked a very fast pace I loved the environment the company was awesome.  My manager was a sweetheart she understood so much an put up with alot my coworkers we're very but I had to work regardless I was there to work an get the job done not to worry about all the wrong things but I appreciated the great experience I was taught.
good,"There is a ton of good people to meet. There are plenty of opportunities to move up, but at this point it can put a strain on your life at home.  Your time becomes very limited at home. It's great if you have older kids or no kids at all."
good,"typical day at work was great because of the people you get to work with, you have to be able to deal with high stress at times, u need to be able to multitask, you have available opportunity to advance to a certain level."
good,"I was a temporary associate. Worked on a register , as a cart pusher and as a zoner.I did a little bit of everything. I enjoyed helping customers and learning new things."
good,"I have worked a variety of positions; Bakery, Lawn and Garden, Back Room, and currently Deli. Food departments are very routine oriented doing the same things everyday. Lawn and Garden is only seasonal but a lot more to learn. Back Room is so short handed it is slightly stressful as well as routine oriented doing the same thing everyday. "
good,Started young worked my way up in the company and made a decent career. Easy to move up.  Family friendly as well..Christmas parties ect. Make great lifelong friends. Money was OK and benefits were great
good,"- no life work balance "
good,Never enough employees and still haven't gotten my raise that i was promised after 6 months. I can't finish any of my training videos while other people have.
good,"A company that allows advancement. A family atmosphere. Though, becoming very commercialized. Big stores, not enough help. Losing sight of Sam Walton's dream...more foreign products than American."
good,"Its not a bad place to work unless you have a manager abusing their power and rubbing it your face and making you feel like your stupid when they asked you a question. Clock in at work go to a meeting start on doing your duties for work and when all said and done its time to go home. Management was the hardest problem I had with Wal-Mart. They were not skilled at their job, they did not do what they was suppose to as a manager, it was just a bad experience. Most enjoyable part of my employment at Wal-Mart was the associates I worked with. Most of them was willing to help if you was struggling with something and that is a good treat to have because its always becoming a better working place and force when you have people willing to work together and help one another."
good,"Empresa muito Boa de trabalhar, "
good,I learned how to Scan items for inventory an The importance of keeping the Items Stocked. I also enhanced my people skills.
good,I enjoy doing mods for new items. Most coworkers are fun to work with. The hardest thing in setting mods was lifting the heavy shelves and finding everything you need to use to get the job done.
good,It was a good place to work management needed to work with the employees with scheduling alot better than they did .employees where nice and easy to talk with
good,"Very nice place to work , you get to meet people daily , they have a lot of benifits it's a good place to move up in a career , they are a great company to work for"
good,Work overstock from 3rd shift if a get time scan bens and put what doesn't go put of the shelf in the bins. My co-workers help me sometimes if a need it an if they get time. The hardest part of my job is try to get someone other a my supervisor to verify the overstock I have that deeps.
good,I found that working with management at times in my store challenging and a bit contradictory. The ability to move up in the store was definitely there however. Needed better communication between salary management and hourly associates.
good,Agradable empresa para adquirir experiencia laboral buen ambiente.
good,I like that there was always something to do. The Deli is hard place to work in a limited space with so many personalities. I found it was very much full of useless Drama.
good,I learn leadership team developing skills How to work with the team. The hardest part of the job was rude and disrespectful customers. Lack of upper management team skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping good people in need. And working along with the officers.
good,Not a bad place to work but the point system sucks. If a chick gets sick or you are in a car accident doesn't matter it is still going to cost you. The benefits are ok.
good,Well it was fun to work there I was able to meet all different kind of people which was very enjoyable I also learned didn't parts of Walmart
good,"Overall a good job but can get frustrating after working there a while and the some of the csm's treat you like lesser, but a few were nice the breaks you get are nice and long. Hour long lunch"
good,it's a great company to work for they offer full time with benefits. you get what u are told and they just don't pay that much that is the only down fall on there part.
good,"decent pay bad place to work. bad management. very unorganized, don't have respect for the customers or the employees."
good,Was an ok place to work met a lot of new and unique people.The management was ok except the store manager. I enjoyed working with my coworker. The hardest part of doing this job was making sure the orders were accurate and done in the time of service.
good,"Its a great place to work if you have no family or a student in school.  You cant balance home life and work life if you have different shifts, The mangers have very poor communication. What makes the day better is the co-workers. I worked in maintenance. What made my day a difficult day is when we're understaffed for that day."
good,"We unload the trailers of product and afterwards we stock the items that need replenishment, while directing customers towards the aisle they are looking for."
good,"I learned how to cut meat and cook several different foods. Management i didn't really like their position because most of them took their job to serious. My coworkers were cool, I got alone well with them. The hardest part of my job was having to make sure everything was on time and ran well enough for the customers to be impressed.I enjoyed my whole job after all because nobody could stop my work."
good,i worked over night it was good i learned alot about retail and customer service we didn't hardly see a manager at night as long as we did our work my co-workers was very good to me to me there wasn't a hard part of this job until black Friday stocking all the shelfs
good,É uma empresa que tem oportunidade de crescimento podendo assim obter novas experiências.
good,"The daily works jobs depends on your attitude."
good,"I enjoy working full time hours, as I am energetic, reliable and able to manage and delegate. Also willing to let others take the lead and follow instructions. I learned a lot of these skills from working at Walmart, and am looking to continue to improve."
good,Working at Wal-Mart is a good job if it is your first job or maybe second. It is fast paced and the fellow employees are always there friendly and ready to help you learn the basics. The management may not be so great but overall Wal-Mart is a good work place
good,"The nice thing about working here is there are a variety of jobs, but you're expected to do a lot for little pay, and be available 24/7.  Customers here are horrible to deal with, but management is pretty flexible when you need time off for something.  You really get to know your coworkers and they become some of your best friends."
good,"The company was an okay company but it seems to be directed more towards college students or people who are close to retirement, than it is towards career driven individuals."
good,Walmart was a fun yet great learning work experience for me to build from. When I would show up to work I was treated as valued member of the work force. I learned how to manage doing my job and properly give amazing customer service to anyone in need. The hardest part of the job in my opinion would be having to correct the mistakes and finishing jobs other shifts did not get done. The most enjoyable part of my job had to be showing my boss and everyone that I could go above and beyond what was required and or expected.
good,Well Walmart wasnt to bad it was just somewhat unorganized with all the changes going on and scheduling and getting some managers to do things is horrible
good,Started out ok then when managers did their rotations between day shift and nightshift morale dropped. There was safety incentives which were pretty bland. Also managment will throw multiple tasks on you for an 8 hour shift expecting you to do 37 hrs worth of work by yourself.
good,"Día de trabajo rutinario. No se aprende mucho ya que las labores son las mimas cada día."
good,"There was a lack of communication with the manager and that made the job more difficult. "
good,Es una empresa grande donde tienes facilidades de crecimiento laboral
good,I enjoyed my time as volunteer in this facility. I enjoyed meeting the residents and learned quite a bit from the residents. It ws always a positive experience for me and I think I got more out of it then the residents did.
good,"In a fast paced environment, Walmart made for a workplace in which balancing customer service and pushing stock was key for success. I enjoyed my time there"
good,"A typical day at Walmart would be dealing with a lot of angry customers due to poor management. I learned quite a lot at Walmart, I learned to develop a little bit more patience, as well as how to multi task in a fast paced environment, and for the most part; solving peoples issues. I didn't really get to know my coworkers, it's a busy work environment so I was always doing something! The management at the Walmart I was employed for was very poor and very lazy. I loved always having something to do. That was my absolute favorite part of the job and believe me, I'm not a big fan of Walmart but it kept my energy positive and more times than not made my day working there."
good,The coworkers are great. Some managment will make you feel unappreciated and disrespect you as a person. The work keeps you busy so the shifts go by quick.
good,It's an ok job to have. Just not long term. Gets very tiring of doing the same thing over and over. Plus it had bad influences of other co-workers around.
good,"Great benefits, time off. Difficult place to work for. Made great friends that I am still in contact with. They were patient enough to work with my and my husbands school schedules so we could each be at home with our daughter."
good,Wal-mart is a great company but their managers seem to form posse's and promote their friends. Hard work is noticed but never rewarded. My co-workers where great people who mostly tried their best to help customers and do a great job.
good,I was pregnant and not only did the company work around my needed hours/days but they were considerate to allow special accominations.
good,Walmart at Riverview great place to work at. I have learned a lot of skills there I have learned and met a lot of people manager. The only thing I will have to say is they need to give more hours and over time.
good,It was ok the pay wasnt good only 300 thats not enough for me i didnt really like it but whatever the pay just wasnt good the staff was ok didnt like it
good,"Learnt a lot about customer service, "
good,I've learned different ways to stocking and assisting customers. Management overall is good. They help employees with any problems that the employee is having with.  I have enjoyed working with all management and co-workers
good,"Stocking, unloading trucks of merchandise, binning and auditing, cleaning up battery spills as well as the sales floor duties all became natural in my time here. The pay was not great but it was just compensation for the job. Not too hard so not so bad. The management was honest yet too often impractical."
good,This job is great if you are looking for stability and a steady paycheck.    I strongly suggest anyone who have children or in school this is not the job for you. Walmart demands a lot of times especially during the holiday season so if your not willing to give that time than i suggest looking for another job.
good,"Repetitive days"
good,"I've been working since I was 18 years old, and when I worked for the Hospital in California it was a great experience, I got to meet a lot of different personality's and had many hard experiences but I over came them all and I also loved the pay even though I was a volunteer they had a stiffen to pay us for our hours. And when I did security that job was fun to because I got to help other people an guard things, an met a lot of new friends. Then when I moved to Tupelo an worked at wendys I thought it was going great until someone stole money from  me so I had to quit. I like workin at walmart it was fun to a certain extent but over all I cant complain because I was blessed with a job."
good,Was my first real job it gave me a lot of experience but as a career I wouldn't recommend managers are very friendly but also not dependable if you ask them for help or anything of the sort
good,"the associates are great to learn from, they are kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job is that it is a fast paced job. Working at walmart the customer is always first. This was always the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical work day at Walmart was prepping the cash register for the start of the work day. Between working on the register, I re-shopped unwanted groceries. I learned how to be patient with shoppers. Management was helpful, helped with any concerns staff had. I had the best co-workers. Everyone got along well and worked well together. The hardest part of the job was multitasking for inpatient customers but as I learned quickly to be patient. The most enjoyable part I must say is making the customers smile, when every they where at my cash register."
good,"Procedimentos medianos,porem muito corrido devido ao volume,"
good,The most enjoyable time working is when I meet new people either new coworkers or customers. Communicating with one another as a team or helping a customer with direction the help they need. What i learn while working is team work with one another and communicating with my staff to get the job done. The most hardest part about a job will be getting fatigue when working long hours and weeks.
good,"There isn't enough people to run the store. The people who need to be held accountable, management refuses to do so. Another thing is that they want one person to do the job of 50 people and complain when things don't get done."
good,Depending on store management  good place to work but no life/work balance . Neighborhood market difficult place to work you are store manager at all times when store manager is not present .
good,i like my job its just getting to over run with young adults who hasnt had any work experience. the company is steady changing policys and catering to the new hires instead of looking out for the ones who have been there. there are to many manager changes. been at this store 2 years and have had 6 different managers. im the only associate in my department who hasnt quit or gotten fired. my job is very easy just the people i have to work with have no sense of urgensey so i have to pull the work load.
good,"Fun work environment, was a bit stressful at times for lack of employees. Not paid enough for the work that is required of you."
good,Buena empresa. Buen ambiente de trabajo. El tiempo se te pasa rápido por que siempre hay que hacer. Apoyo de compañeros en otras áreas.
good,"The workplace was nice and neat, no problems from the customers. The area was Eco-friendly, very peaceful during work hours. You could enjoy your break with no hassle from anyone or any nonsense disturbing your peace."
good,"I am not sure what i am suppose to say about wal - mart . It is a fun place to work , got to meet new people in my neighborhood. I just did not care too much about all the workers , I liked some but not all ."
good,"Fast pace, not enough associates for jobs that require a lot of hands, good benefits. Disrespectful upper management. Cont holding others accountable."
good,I order filled for them Meaning i picked items on the list that the computer told me too..LOaded them on a palet and wraped them all up to be put on to the truck..
good,Typical day at work is non-stop and fast-paced. I've learned how to operate edging machinery and check for top quality work. Management makes sure the job gets done in any way possible. The hardest part of the job is trouble shooting issues with the machines. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the goals set by management.
good,"It's just a job it pays the bills, not what I had thought I would be doing with me life. I'm over worked and Over stressed There needs to be more people. I currently have 4 departments I'm taking care of."
good,"Easy work, "
good,I enjoyed working with customers. I was part of loss prevention. Customer service was another part of my job. Working at Wal-mart was a pretty good job.
good,"It was steady work. The manager was great. He really cared about his employees. He would even go as far as to stock freight and interact with his employees and customers.  He was very friendly and would go above and beyond to help his associates. He made sure everyone was welcome and greeted them with a smile. He believed that customers should be treated like family, that's what made  them come back, the warm reception they received from the cashiers and sales associates."
good,Good customer service and working the best in each Department improvising And providing all my knowledge of my work over the year but I would like to continue to improve my knowledge and learning other things to improve my quality of life Both personal and professional.
good,My typical work day.  I receive product that comes in from couriers and vendors.  Occasionally I go and help on the floor stocking and merchandising product.
good,"Walmart was a great place to start out in the job force. Fellow workers can become great friends and it feels like a family. Health care wasn't great, sometimes management was questionable, but overall pleasant.  I've learned about urgency and about to manage my own time. The day, or I say night at walmart is always slow but whileven I was employed we were terribly understaffed and work was hard to complete"
good,Wide variety of personalities and backgrounds but very open and welcoming environment. The employees were willing to not only explain how everything was done but walk me through step-by-step until I had a firm grasp on my responsibilities.
good,supervising the back room of walmart is where the magic happens its the most important step of the day . the only thing was that if we had call outs it was going to be a 12hr day instead of 8  hard to get good help back there
good,A typical day at work was standing at my register and cashing customers out when they were done with there shopping.  I learned how to do w.i.c.
good,"The Management at Wal Mart is Disrespectful, Typical day at work was pretty routine, it consisted of sweeping, scrubbing floors with the scrubber machine and buffing floors with the buffer machine. Majority of my co workers were cool."
good,Good place to work to get feet wet with working with retail. Amazing opportunities to advance and grow with the company.
good,"La exigencia es mucha, hablan mucho de sus valores como empresa internacional, tal vez los directivos si llevan a cabo su programa de trabajo pero ya la operación en tienda es muy diferente, no te piden te exigen y muchas veces no te dan la herramienta principal que es el recurso human0 para las cargas de trabajo que se tienen en estas tiendas, la empresa como tal es buena los que a veces desquician a la gente son los directivos que en muchas ocasiones te tratan con bastante prepotencia que creen que esa empresa es de ellos"
good,"A typical day involved helping customers and utilizing photo lab equipment to develop photos, canvas', and posters. Working in the lab also involved taking care of online merchandise orders. I learned how to organize, operate, repair, and clean all lab equipment. Management was for the most part quite alright. Most of my co-workers were productive and fairly decent people. There wasn't anything particularly difficult about the job other than the busy work load around Christmas season. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a customer happy with the help provided."
good,"Use  to be a family oriented work environment, It has changed so much over the yrs. Work  on holidays  except Christmas, Management comes and goes."
good,"From my perspective Walmart is a job you work at if you were living at home and your parents were paying all the bills, unless you're a manager or someone working there for 15 years. What Walmart pays their associates is not enough, you're hired for one department but assigned to work other departments you weren't hired for plus the one you were hired in for; besides the underpay, Walmart is an ok place to work."
good,"Sin duda que te den oportunidad de trabajar y estudiar es lo mejor de la empresa, pero los salarios son absurdamente bajos para manera el dinero de la empresa y estar tanto tiempo al pendiente de la gente."
good,A typical day was stressful the group I supervised was usually understaffed and I supervised the most important process in the company. Management was never on the same page. The hardest part of my job was taking extra orders from so many different members of management while still completing the main task.
good,Good Health and Dental benefits show up for work do your job and take care of the customers how ever your day may be. Good people to work with. Management could be more one on one to employee
good,"Supportive coworkers help get you through the ups and downs of retail.  If you're looking for a place to start at retail, I'd recommend Walmart.  They're flexible and offer a variety of opportunities."
good,Good pay but the staff management is not to good. The store manager never greets her employers unless she likes you. It needs a whole new crew of managers and store manager.
good,Love my job but there is so much lack of communication between Management. This honestly would be an amazing job if some Managers would look at the point of view as a Business perspective and not just something to make themselves feel and look good about.  You can't skip work steps to make yourself look better. If the Department Managers were left alone to do their jobs instead of constant notes then things would flow so much better.
good,"Its a very good job for just getting out of school and getting into the work world.  You meet a lot of interesting people.  The management team seemed very miserable,  but the coworkers were very friend of course."
good,A fast paced environment with customer service and experience as top priority at all levels of the store with specialized training for each area.
good,A typical day at work is hard because we are short staffed in my area. I have on the other hand learned a lot since I've been here. Management seems to have their favorites. My coworkers are great team players. The hardest part is trying to get everything done. The moset enjoyable part is my supervisor is awesome and don't mind teaching and helping.
good,communicate with customers making sure they get what they request and make sure they leave satisfied customers. learned a lot of customer experience here.
good,"The Walmart that I worked for always felt like they were always understaffed and management was rather poor in my department, so I was always helping other people with there jobs which distracted me from my own work. Plus it didn't help that I was the only Assembler in the whole building as well as part time at that time so they piled so much work for me to do, there goals seemed unrealistic to achieve for a new temp/ seasonal employee."
good,walmart is a nice place to work if all you do is the job you supposed to do. with me i like to learn new things everyday and with walmart it give that opportunity.
good,I started out working with a lot of new faces and before I knew it they were all gone. high turnover rate due to bad management.
good,"A typical day would consist of scheduling trips, confirming visits, greeting visitors, answering phone, and assisting in various departments as needed. My coworkers and I enjoyed working as a team."
good,me working at Walmart had my good days but had lots of bad days mostly when It came to management but nothing bad to say I enjoyed working there because of the customer's I like working as customer service or cashier and me knowing I can put a smile on people that I have never met in my life that's the beauty in it all.
good,General good work environment. Work ethics. Always something to do. Team player. Hardest was management that didn't communicate well. Most enjoyable was that i knew what was required of me to get the job done.
good,"Hard work. decent people mediocre management, If you sign/apply to work on the dry side be prepared to work (Force) on the cold side also."
good,Work schedules were compensating to your liking at times.Advancement opportunities sometimes depended on who you knew.I would work for the company again.
good,Working in jobs that involve me to interact with customers gave me a great experience on how to handle and deal with customers correctly.
good,This particular company is brand new so it had a great deal of improvements it needs to make the job run more smoothly. I do feel that the company itself will in the future become an outstanding company with the right leaders but for now I feel they could do a little better as far as how they select their employees and management
good,went to work around ten pm. I helped set up a store. i also did overnight stocking. handled merchandise and utilized equipment. got home around seven am.
good,I love walmart. The people are caring polite. They are walmart. It's clean friendly. And the best place I choose to shop.
good,It was quite easy for me to move up the ladder in the company. There are many benefits and life long lessons you learn while working for this worldwide company. The environment and total happiness/smoothness of the store all depends on the management that is staffed there. The attitude and work ethics of upper management have such a great impact on middle management and lower and the total experience of an associates time there.
good,"La empresa tiene una  cultura muy importante que rige dia  a dia nuestros  valores, te  da  oportunidad para  poder tener crecimiento,   hay  que estar  abiertos  a  el  cambio, nos  da  la  oportunidad de  conocer  varios  departamentos y  ver  que  tan  capaz  eres."
good,Working at Wal-Mart has taught me to adapt to ever changing demands and business needs. I have also learned to make informed decisions in a timely and effective manner.
good,"The typical night as an Overnight stocker at Wal-Mart consist  of clocking in, attentding meeting with employees and managent to decipher which department you are assigned.  Use the cpmouter system to check tasks, finish your tasks before you clock out."
good,Walmart was fast paced which I loved it made time fly by it was also challenging sometimes especially since I was there when they had a shooting
good,WalMart cared about their employees more. You did get an hour break and employers were treated like humans.
good,"A typical work day involves you working your hardest for little recognition or pay when the time comes."
good,"I consider this to be my first job, so it was a huge learning experience for me. It helped me gain a lot of confidence in myself. It tested my patience with other people- customers, coworkers, and superiors alike. Some days are incredibly busy and some days are incredibly slow, so I've learned about prioritizing what's most important. "
good,"The people around me who I worked with were always ok. On top of very respectful no matter what. Even though some of the people who were in higher power took it to the head. On top of their not family friendly at all, so if you have kids I wouldn't count on working here at all. If you ask me this company now is nothing but a money hungry company."
good,"Horrible wages for entry level workers."
good,wal mart was a good place to work i dont know to much about it now but back then it was ok they are always hiring
good,decent pay you get by every two weeks. Management gives your a hard time on scheduling thats my only issue with them and etc.jndsjnfudjsn
good,No set time shift sometimes having to cover other employees who call out but if willing to put in extra time they did notice your commitment to their company.
good,I excel in technology therefore i applied for electronics and just incase i applied in sporting goods nothing else but i was forced to work in deli.
good,"la empresa es muy buena para aprender a desenvolverte como persona, te ayuda a conocer sobre responsabilidad, compromiso y te enseña a trabajar con metas y bajo competencia. "
good,"You will work hard and it is demanding."
good,"a typical day at work is doing multiple tire and oil changes with in a expected time output for each job, while balancing getting the job done correctly. I've quickly become very sound in all the proper functions of cars and car maintenance. the management team often not in the shop unless requested to weigh in on possible problems on a vehicle. The co workers are easily the funnest an best part of the job. the downside of the job would be the constant burns from engines, engine oil or the underside of cars. ( typical minior shop injuries)"
good,The work is hard but the pay is great if you stick around you can advance there are many different positions available but you have to work hard to move up.
good,"A typical day requires dealing with numerous amounts of difficult customers, but still maintaining to keep a smile on your face. I learned that people come and expect excellent customer service, and that's what  I give them."
good,"I obtained this job in early 2015 thanks to my father, who worked in grocery. My employers originally told me I would be working in the Garden Center, then the Hardware section, before telling me it was maintenance, which caused a bit of confusion, but easing into the job was not hard. My main job was to do daily sweeps of the entire store floor. This was divided into four sections which would be swept at specific times of the day based on how busy they were. Each section would get swept twice a day, and then whatever the broom collected would be put into a large trash bag. This encapsulated 90% of what I did, but I would also empty all the trash cans around the store daily. My usual hours were 12pm-8pm, with two breaks and one hour for lunch. The experience was hit-or-miss. I was constantly monitored and questioned if I missed a single piece of dirt. The other maintenance workers would often sleep in the break room, yet get onto me if I took an extra minute. Overall they were very rude. They also repeatedly questioned me about every time I used the bathroom. The store was always hot and I was, at the time, somewhat out of shape so I would chafe badly. On the days that they let me do my job, it was fine."
good,Overall not a bad place to work but it can be overwhelming if you haven't been trained properly. But a mostly fun way to start working and usually always hiring.
good,"I loved working in jewelry and moved up pretty fast in pay, loved scanning merchandize for inventory, But loved moving to back as scanner, loved working over nights"
good,Good job but I like to be challenged a bit more. but had fun unloading trucks and prep for stocking. Management wants you to get stuff done way to fast which makes stressed out a little.
good,I got a lot of help by people at wal mart. It made me be very productive working here. I got to interract with a lot of customers. Customers were very satisfied with my customer service
good,"Started with inventory products on hand, counting cash in drawer,"
good,"Walmart is a place of opportunity. Here, you can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you."
good,"My job entailed waiting on customers, and helping with any problems. I learned that not everyone can be pleased but you always give it your best shot. Management didn't really seem to know what the cashiers went through all the time, it was nice having to know the people you work with, their quirks. It was hard to do some of the lifting, and it was always drilled into us that the cashiers are the first and last impression of their store.  But it didn't pay that way."
good,"Busy environment with many obstacle to over come while providing good customer service, with your team. Plenty of opportunities to go up in the company."
good,working at a university is good. It is a safe and educational place. But they do not offer good benefits and compensation.
good,"Con alto indice de presion, diciplina, mercadeo de mercancia, cobro de mercancia valor pesonal, la gerencia con muy buena organizacion y se formaban buenos equipos de trabajo laboral, o dificil no hay que fuera dificil, el ambiente de trabajo, los colegas."
good,"A typical day at work would start out by immediately cleaning up after a previous shift's work day. That would include janitorial duties, completing breaks, managing schedules, helping customers, informing management of duties, and assigning work to fellow co-workers. After this is completed you are required to help the customers at the service desk by providing Moneygram financial services, completing returns, taking verbal complaints, helping cashiers with questions, responding to managements requests, informing cashiers of breaks, answering the phone, helping customers both at the service desk and on the floor, and making sure that your area is completely clean. All while remaining calm under pressure with a smile on your face. Maintaining some semblance of well-being on this job is the hardest part because as a Customer Service Representative and sometimes supervisor its hard to keep a content smile on your face. But the most enjoyable part has to be completing a task to everyone's satisfaction. Also managing to help the customer and your co-workers throughout the day. But mostly I like the personal connections I have made throughout the course of my employment not only with my fellow employees but with customers in general who visit the establishment and know you by name. That in the end helps me maintain my smile and general sense of well-being."
good,"I am 24 highly motivated an love being a manager, making decisions,  makeing change and helping better the company. I am ready for any opportunity that comes my way"
good,"Opened and closed the Deli.  Sliced deli meat, made salads, sub sandwiches. Cleaned and did dishes.   Manager was not easy to get along with.  Always changing employees.  Hard place to work.  Enjoyed the customers."
good,"clean restrooms"
good,"Wal-Mart is a learning experience. Co-workers and Management learn more about the ways of stock control and working with people of different personality. The most interesting part about working at Wal-Mart is travelling to different store to help with their inventory. The hardest part is trying to control the backroom overstock. Overall, I enjoyed the many adventures and learning experience I received through the help upper level management and co-workers."
good,"It was a excellent job, but they didn't have the hours I wanted. And the management treated their employees unfair. The customers were always unhappy because management  never scheduled enough people during busy hours."
good,Management has room for improvement. Over all a great workplace. Co workers were very friendly. I enjoyed helping the cake decorators out and learning how to write on cakes and do different designs with frosting.
good,"Walmart has great rollbacks, clean store and a very wonderful environment I learned a lot while working there .I also had great management and there are many other perks to working there and we got a bonus every quarter."
good,"Walmart really helped me in sustaining regular work while attending university. It is also where I learned the most about what it means to remain dedicated to something, through both the good moments, and the bad ones. It has inspired me to fight as a human and defend myself as a worker with rights. Moving on from the experience, I do wish to find a healthy working enviornment that communicates well with employees. Everyone is equally responsible in ensuring a professional, respectful and unified team that gives each little detail the attention it deserves."
good,"Wal-Mart on a typical day can be stressful and also pleasant, its a place where you get to meet people of all walks in life and though challenging at times can present opportunities that one might find gratifying."
good,"Needs to treat their associates better, just because Wal-Mart raised their pay they also cut their hours.  Protect their associates better."
good,"Receptionist duties, dispatch, admin assistant. Part-time employee, satisfied with the office work and the employees as well as management. However, if you are a part-timer in this company, your hours are never stable. Even though our contracts state that we will get minimum 24 hours a week, in worse case scenario, that is not the truth, you will get 8 hours."
good,"As a customer service manager I work closely with all the associates in the store and have found a few common factors. The biggest one is that there is no communication between our management team. They all think that their part of the store is the most important part and need it to be a priority. The second is there is a lack of hiring and retention. The turn over ratio is sitting at about 65-70%. It's gotten to the point that management is driving people away and they aren't seeing how. They are to hard on their associates and while some can take it such as the supports and certain supervisors most can't and leave without a notice or just decide to not come in to work. The third biggest complaint is the lack of promoting the proper people. The people that get promotions now are those that can suck up the most, not the ones that deserve it. "
good,Wal-Mart provided me with the hours I needed and gave me the days off when I was in school. However they are very understaffed and I was pulled from my department to work in other departments leading to not much work being completed in my department. However the co-workers were easy to work with and cooperative.
good,"Even though management is typically a mess, you really learn to appreciate Walmart. Every employee gets an hour lunch every 4 hours and a break every two hours."
good,"My typical work day consist of receiving new loss claims each day. I worked each claim from start to finish this included taking recorded statements from claimants, placing calls to the store to get statements from associates to investigate what occurred on the day of accident, enter notes into claim, enter ICD 9 and ICD 10 codes into claim to show what type of injury the claimant had, read demands from Attorneys to see if the claimant had any pre-existing injuries, determine liability if the injury was the stores fault or claimants fault. Answered calls from claimants/attorneys to request status update on claims. Issued checks out to claimants/attorneys once claim had a settlement value agreed upon."
good,Good Part-Time Job great experience in regards to store culture and meeting new people. Wal-mart is a fast past job and can be stressful if you allow it to be.
good,"Learned for about time management and prioritizing. "
good,Wal-Mart logistics competitive wages with good benefits.  The company does a good job of giving back to the local community.  A typical day can be between 8 and 14 hours.  Due to the size of the company and many previous lawsuits all rules and procedures are standardized. This makes advancement difficult but also allows for associates to know what is required of them.
good,Se aprende a trabajar en equipo y lidiar con situaciones difíciles aplicando conocimientos previos y reforzándolos con el apoyo de los superiores y aprendizaje continuo.
good,I would come in early morning and helped out the overnight crew get ready for re-open. I learned how to manage and run departments at this company. Management was great and I learned a lot.
good,"I don't mind working at Walmart, but the district manager isn't very good at taking care of the empolyees. He tends to make a lot of rules to save himself, but they aren't ideal for the associates or store management. If you want to work at Walmart, find a good store to work at, and keep in mind that a promotion from hourly to salary mean you have to change stores."
good,Everyday was a challenge. we always had a target which we needed to complete at the end of the day.It was very competitive environment and cooperative too.
good,"Walmart is not a very hard job at all. It's just a very tedious job to do Depending on the store, it could be a very good job. I would recommend only working there for 5 years maxium"
good,"Was compensated for the work I put into the job. Co-workers and management were helpful, most of the time. Hardest part of the job was finding room for advancement, as it seems there was favoritism in the corporation. The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was benefits, such as employee discounts and bonuses for hourly associates. Not sure if that is still effective, but that was definitely a perk!"
good,"I really enjoyed working at walmart, It was fun to work with the public. We had hour lunches which were nice, but not every day. I didn't like the hours I worked."
good,"Most days in this company are fairly repetitive with the exceptions of holidays. I have gained a lot of insight while working for them. I work very well with my co-workers. I have found that the hardest part of the job to be that there are several managers on duty and instructions get crossed frequently. The best part about working for the them is the customers, I enjoy serving customers and making them happy."
good,"My typical day at Wal-Mart would start off first by clocking in. Then, go back to the entrance of the store and put on my safety vest. The next step would be to start work. Basically meaning collect any (Wal-Mart) cart you see throughout the parking lot. Keep this same exact task up for the next 8 hours of your day, until time to get off. Management was really strict with the rules of the company, and was quite disrespectful at times. Most of my co-workers was friendly and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was pushing carts in bad weather and by myself at night. The most enjoyable part of my job was having co-workers that I felt comfortable working with."
good,"It is a very busy and extremely fast paced job in the Deli. We are usually short handed, due to bad scheduling.The customers are usually very pleasant and make the job worthwhile."
good,"WalMart, as a whole, is not a bad company to work for. It is a place geared for people pleasing, and fast paced. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who are rude to you for no apparent reason, other than they are having a bad day, and you are the one they decide to take it out on. However, with the plethera of customers in and out in any given day, the variety of experiences in your shift can be amusing and enjoyable most of the time. The company pays fairly well, given that most people doing a cashier's position are paid much less, and the appropriate break time is almost always allotted for every employee as per in accordance with their work schedule. Overall, as with any company, it has it's good and bad aspects, but it is what one makes it to be. Positive attitude draws positive results, and vice versa."
good,come in start sandwhich's and salads clean up from first shift perp for closing and sever and cut meat management was ok fair i learned patients my coworkers was very helpful my hardest part of the job was closing by my self night after night the one thing i like most about the was making people happy and smile
good,"The job so simple that I could do it in my sleep, but I honestly don't have much to say. Being away from the job for 2+ years it feels kinda boring. The customers are decent but the management was alright. Simple, cleaning and taking care of customers with their needs. I on the other hand love helping the elderly."
good,"Typical day at work is busy, and productive."
good,"Wal-mart is a retail giant is the same perks and problems as any other store. the one i come while profit is high but, staffing is low."
good,I take great pride in my customer service. I even have customers come back and ask for my personally. I enjoy working with others and would like to find a company that I can grow with.
good,"Foi muito gratificante a experiencia que tive, em poder trabalhar em equipe e poder aprender tudo sobre o ramo .Como atendimento ao Publico, reposição de mercadorias, fazer pagamento de contas entre outras tarefas."
good,"I love this job , I was able to interact with people, I would help put outfits together for people. My coworker and management was easy to get along with."
good,Es una empresa de constantes cambios. Muchos retos son aplicados día a día así como la toma de decisión en el área donde me encuentro.
good,"Always busy and each day is different. Management varies between stores. Associates are pretty easy to get along with. The hard part of the job is the customers that get frustrated, but most often its easy to calm down the situation. The great part of the job is its not always stressful and you build relationships with your coworkers."
good,"Very busy, not much spare time."
good,Overall there was good interactions between employees and supervisors and almost everyone was friendly. The work kept you busy but at times things were stressful.
good,Thought it was a good experience to work there I miss the people. The company trained me in logistics and merchandising translated for customers in mandarin at least 2 times a week.
good,"Help Customers with products and questions, assist with help out to their car with big purchases (Big screen TV). Customers services in Electronics, Photo lab and, Communications Phone Contacts)"
good,In my time of working at Walmart I was not given a great experience of the working world. The managers were very unorganized and unprofessional. The schedules were everywhere.
good,while working at Walmart I had a few situations where the customers did not like certain things about our store. I found that the company did not back the decisions made by the manager which were made under their guidelines. this made it difficult for us to do our job
good,"It was busy and all the time lot of people. Defiantly how to talk to people better and communicate with others. Wish they would really treat employees like people. They were alright some was talkative some quite, we still got alone. Hardest Part was trying to impress the management and show you did do your job. The customers were great you learn so much from them."
good,"Empresa em estruturação, com ótimo ambiente de trabalho, com uma participação relevante no mercado."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company to work for, especially if you are a student. They try to accommodate your school schedule and your work schedule. Management is great, co-workers are very fun and make your work more enjoyable. Overall, great environment to work in."
good,"For the most part of my 14.5 years at Walmart I did enjoy working for the company. I learned about the following cash, price changes, returns of product at the end of a season, stocking the shelves and ordering of stock. The staff are wonderful to work with."
good,The only problem i had with walmart was the management. Management there do not care about their employees at all. They worked with my school schedule/
good,"I liked working at walmart.the fellow employees were nice and helpful.crew leader was great.thehours were great.my only problem with walmart was,when they hired me,they never once said it was seasonal.they had me take a drug and everything like a normal employee,then almost three months down the road they tell it was seasonal and after new years they call us back for perment hire.i was like huh,what?.they never called back.thats kinda shady I think"
good,"Tiene un ambiente armónico , es bonito el trato directo con la gente y sus instalaciones están bien equipadas"
good,"I enjoy being around my co-workers and the costumers, they give off a very positive attitude. The hardest part of the job was being at the register, I didn't have much freedom to move as I pleased."
good,"It was a good job but, when i needed my logs to do cashier work i never got them until i was laid off.A day at work usually was just zoning unless we where unde staff or it was a busy day."
good,"Get trained in an isle, pull inventory from the back of the store and stock on shelves. Any overstock, put on carts and pull to the back of the store and have it as overstock. "
good,"Steady reliable employment "
good,I loved that i worked with people and got to meet new people every day. I was doing something that i loved. but i felt like the benefits were not as good as they could have been which in turn made me feel like i was not good enough for better benefits. the pay was great. i learned new things...wasnt very good at working with my school schedule but i managed.
good,"good place to work if you enjoy helping customers and working with others. Typical day I would go to my department and assist other customers with finding the right products. What I disliked was the management, no respect for the employees."
good,working at wal-mart is a trying experience some times the management can be very lacking in there job. but over all i enjoyed my time there.
good,I mostly fill prescriptions.  I answer the phone.  I sometimes get to check in the drugs and put them up.  I don't get to do mush of the other jobs.  not because I can't it is just nobody like to fill.  they all like to stand at the drop off window.  I am the fastest filer they  have.  I am good at that.  but sometimes it would be nice to do some thing else. To get a break from running all the time. I really like the job. but I think it is time for a change.
good,Clocked in and start working was my everyday routine. Open up the shop start getting things that I needed to get my day started and finished for the day.Zone the products so that everything looked neat and perceptible for customers.After that I would start working on cars until break time. Come back from break and go back to working on car. If there is no cars help out other associates until a car came in or it was time to go.Then clocked out to end my day.
good,"Short staffed at times, had to adjust to cover areas due to understaffing or call ins. Enjoyed interaction with associates and customers helping them find things. Store shopped hard had to maintain all day long to cover."
good,I feel after working for this company eight years I was unfairly discharged for pointing out what another employee had done to jeopardize my job. After letting upper management know what someone else did I was penalized for their actions. Wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,Horaire de travail flexible et nombreux avantages sociaux
good,"Well I want to be honest, but not brutal..."
good,"This job was very busy, from the time the doors opened until the doors closed. There was never a dull moment in this store."
good,"Not a bad job, but for most people I realize its not a career with no job advancement. The store manager at the store in Murray, Ut has no Idea what go's on during 2nd, and 3rd shift. Only because he not there during those shifts. The hardest part of the job is all the other members or management who are more concerned with promoting there friends and doing nothing."
good,"Stock shelf's, helped  customers, cleaned, composed bins, put up snow fencing, emptied bins. working with my co-workers was good everyone got along"
good,"A typical day at work is customer service; helping customers find what they need. Also, stocking and zone - making sure the departments are well-organized and clean; making sure all products go out onto the sales floor"
good,"it is a fun place to work at but depending on the management , it is quite annoying sometimes to work since they expect too much"
good,very good workers but very bad management. productivity was good from the coworkers but management used to change daily routines often making jobs difficult and unproductive.
good,The environment seems very comfortable with low sress. I learned how to do overnight floor maintenance and safety in the work place. The hardest part of the job for me was adjusting to the 3rd shift.
good,"Energetic, and fast paced. One thing i have learned from the job would be how to multitask at a faster speed. Management was always present and there if any problems occurred. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to have been the customers."
good,Have set schedule good benefits not the most friendly co workers good management team. Hard to advance in company. Learn to work as a team. Work is not hard labor.
good,"Everyday is different."
good,A typical day at work involves a lot of tasks that needed to be done. Management did an average job in keeping the store organized.
good,ok place as long as your do not have a problem in your life and your there everyday . people that work there are great Management. Big over turn to many of them. Pulling skids and keep venders plus management happy. I loved the People I worked with and the Vendors>
good,"A typical day at work would be enjoyable...I definitely learned a lot throughout the three years I was there;v I learned patience, and kindness; I learned that you should treat each customer as if they were your first customer and only customer; I learned that being polite and friendly to everyone is very important. As cashiers we had a full responsibility of holding wal-mart together because without cashiers Wal-mart wouldn't do as well.. We had to greet customers and make conversation if possible... communicate and most of the time we joked with customers and co-workers and management. The management was nice and understanding at times; they helped when needed and were friendly. My co-workers were decent, hard-working people. The hardest part of my job was dealing with unpleasant or unsatisfied or angry customers. The most enjoyable part was the fact that we all were able to joke with one another and most of our customers were very pleasant and friendly and nice and I got to meet amazing people and some customers were even funny."
good,quando tinha pouca gente pra atende sobrecarregava muito...
good,"I learned more about managing employees some I learned on my own, but they do offer a good computer based learning. You also have a good chance at moving up, if you go in and give it your best."
good,no te permitian descansar . y estabas bajo presion mas de lo normal.. no contabas con un buen ambiente laboral-
good,"According to workload, the salary and other benefits need a lot of Improvements and part-time availability should also be equally appreciated."
good,"This is your typical retail. Pay is minimal, advancement opportunities are vast, benefits are okay, and environment depends on the management staff and how they lead."
good,"I stayed busy all day at work which is good, but coworkers always had something to complain about. I learned that hard work does pay off. management was decent. the hardest part of the job was the modest pay. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my hands."
good,"A typical work day is ok when it's steady"
good,the days were long and hot during the summer months and the management always switched the schedule every other week. 4 days on 3 off
good,Overall enjoyed working at Walmart. Management wasn't the best though. The management did not properly follow up on an issue
good,Mala experiencia con los jefes asi como el trato a los multifuncionales
good,"Very simple job, just absolutely bad management. Customers were never the issue, it would always be the management and co-workers."
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for if you want to advance and have no college degree. They typically hire within when they see potential in someone who works hard and proves themselves to do a good job and care about the store. The medical benefits are very good as well. They also offer dental, 401k and stock options. After a short while you feel like familly."
good,"mucha exigencia para el trabajo que se realiza y el salario que ofrecen"
good,Working in the bakery was something I've never experienced before but it was fun prepping breads and signing cakes. Seeing children smile was also pretty cool.
good,I can say I learned a lot working for the company.I enjoy workimg with my co-workers.I feel that management could have been better and commucation though out the store...
good,"Start a day at work with smile :)"
good,A typical work day involves assisting customers and fellow co-workers while completing tasks. Some aspects are very repetitive while at others times something new comes along. It is a steady job. If you show up on time and do your work you'll always have job. But advancement can be tricky if your store has no openings and getting a consistent schedule is impossible unless you are lucky have an awesome manager willing to take the time to sort it all out. You do meet some interesting people though. And I enjoy working with my co-workers.
good,"My experience at Wal-Mart was relatively short, about a year, but I learned a lot. It was a 9 hour shift (4:00 PM to 1:00 AM) five days a week and usually had a designated 2 days off. It was hard work, probably the most physically demanding position at Wal-mart but I liked it. It was challenging and competitive and that helped motivate me to do great. I was always getting compliments and thank you's from management which motivated me even further and eventually got promoted to secondary Team Lead. More responsibilities but same pay. I learned how to really work with and motivate a team. Wal-Mart is also where I became comfortable with a telxon and learned how they work and how to use key features."
good,"Working at Walmart can be great or terrible - it depends on how the management decides to run the store. Some store management can really care and do what they can to help to make the store one you can be proud to work at, and some store management can just not give a dang and actively work against helping the store and let the clientele destroy it. Depending on your position, you can choose your hours, but sometimes that doesn't work out in your favor, since it's first-come, first-served for people with the same job code. The quarterly bonus can be $500 at some stores, whereas some stores won't get one because of the store's terrible performance. Give it a try, since their minimum wage switches to $10/hour soon. Usually the smaller stores do better in terms of employee morale."
good,A typical day in Wally World would be to hustle to and from various job responsibilities and challenges.  You will never find time to have nothing to do.  A little spill could literally be waiting for you around any corner.
good,A typical day at work is very productive and dealing with a lot of customers. I have learned how to deal with customers when they are upset and show case fine jewelry. The management was not nice. They really don't care about your well being. My co-workers were nice and very easy to get along with. The hardest part about the job is dealing with the management team because of their lack of communication. The most enjoyable part about the job is meeting new people everyday.
good,They Have Good Job Security easy To Manage Cashiers The Only Bad Thing Is They Cut Hours At The End Of The Year. They Have great Programs If your in need. Typical Day Was To Come In Count All Registers Identify Shortages Handle all cashier and customer concerns. I Would Make Sure Associates Are following correct policies.
good,the daycare was great the children there always had me smiling if you didnt know children really have a creative mind all you have to do is seat back and let them go
good,"My day as an unloader would begin with zoning the store (making sure the merchandise looks presentable) while helping customers out with questions about merchandise locations, questions about Walmart online, locating merchandise in the back room, and making sure that the customers have a pleasant experience. After zoning for two hours, I would proceed to the General Merchandise side of the store to unload the truck. Unloading the truck(s) entailed that I knew all the departments in the store and have the speed and capability to finish a truck within two hours. A usual truck would have 2,100 pieces of freight. After the truck is done we would then take the freight to the sales floor, all the while keeping customer safety a priority. After the freight was all taken to the floor on the GM side, we would head over to the opposite side of the store, the Grocery side and pull pallets to the floor. Most pallets from the GM side weigh from 3,000 to 5,000 pounds since pallet jacks can only carry so much weight. I would then proceed to work the grocery freight or work in any department that had an abundance of freight until it was time for me to go home."
good,"It was a good place to work, the employees where nice and the management was great with how they were always there to give a helping hand and seemed to truely enjoy what they did. A typical day would be showing up sometime in the morning or early afternoon and clocking in. The Machine would then tell me what register to go to and I would work there for roughly 3 hours until I was relieved for either a fifteen minute break then I would return to the machine which would then direct me to another register to work for about 2 hours ish then I would break for an hour lunch. Then once I returned to finish my shift with another 15 min break near the end. That is the basic for a general day there. Couldn't really talk to the co workers because we where all busy working our cashier."
good,"Learned essential tools of governing large amount of employees. Learned team building and organization, as well as time management."
good,"A typical day at work in the Walmart pharmacy consist of clocking in, normally different times every day, then going to the pharmacy to the designated work station determined by what time you work then doing your task there while helping patients and customers in a timely manner. Co-workere were all nice and management at this particular location are all nice and are good at there job. The main improvement management needs to make is learning how to communicate to other managers and associates better. The hardest part of the job was trying to get all of the tasks done before the pharmacy closed. Often times I would stay late between 30  min to 2 hours after the pharmacy closed just to get everything done which the district health and wellness manager did not like at all but we were severely understaffed for most of my time there. What I enjoyed most about the job would have to be the my share bonus and all the cook outs we would do. There was a cookout for a lot of random reasons from holiday celebrations to getting a good review from customers."
good,"I work with a bunch of friendly people, and I am friendly to the customers when they ask me questions about the products they are searching for.  I enjoy helping people and I have been really lucky so far to not have a customer act rude to me.   The day goes really fast here, and I enjoy the atmosphere of the job as well."
good,"While I love working for awl-mart and they aren/t the awful place to work for that everyone make them out to be, I'm looking for something different but would like to keep my current position at least part time."
good,"Long days/nights, but it's worth it for the money. Career opportunity is always available. The hardest part is overcoming the first three months, then you know your job and it's easier to handle."
good,"Walmart is a very enjoyable environment, a way to encounter different people and meet customers and establish relationships for future en devours.  Learned to establish a fast paced and sufficient work ethic and a safe work environment."
good,Would be a great place to retire from if they understood their associates needs a little better. They tend to override scheduling when I am unavailable.
good,"inspecting produces for customer purchase"
good,Allowed to give great customer service everyday. Given enough hours to complete workflow for best customer service.  Great hours of operation for best customer service.
good,"Customer Service is supposed to be about helping the customer, but when did helping someone out turn into giving someone everything they want, no matter the cost.  Helping people is supposed to be about fulfilling our needs."
good,walmart was a great company to work for. in the twelve years I worked for them they gave me many advancement opportunities. they had a good work/ home balance
good,Great working environment I gain a lot of experience from working here. A lot of great benefits when you get hired on to the job. The management their was not the best but they was ok. I wasn't satisfied with what I was getting paid to do there as well.
good,"not bad to work for. fair. fast paced. friendly co workers."
good,"I enjoyed most of the experience.  But they had some questionable tactics.  Forcing me to go back to work during lunch.  Cutting my breaks short.  Low wages.  Outrageous health care premiums.  After being choked by another employee, I was temporarily transferred to electronics.  Things went really well in that department.  I busted my butt helping to get that department rated the cleanest, best looking electronics department in the district.  The department MGR and supervisors all wanted me to stay in that department, but some higher up manager forced me back to instock after they finally fired the guy who grabbed me by the throat 6 months later.  I felt like I was being held back and that they were refusing to advance me for what ever ungodly reason.  The only reason I could ever get was that I was one of the only full-time associates in my department and they didn't want to lose the full-time help in that department.  Sounded like BS to me."
good,"Work at this particular job was always different from day to day. Management was always contradicting each other with daily activities of employees. The hardest part about this job was being able to finish all my duties due to the lack of work done by my coworkers earlier in the same area. On the upside, I enjoyed the interactions I had with customers, and my coworkers and I still maintain relationships to this day."
good,"A typical day at work looks like signing in and updating myself with any new announcements or posts that may have been put up from the night before. I log into my phone and ready myself for calls, and open up our e-mail account to answer e-mails in between calls. The rest of the day is problem solving and listening to customers that call in needing assistance. "
good,Walmart is a safe work environment. There are opportunities for advancement. Walmart policies and procedures can be hard to work with sometimes. But overall I would recommend working there.
good,"Como em toda grande empresa, diariamente contávamos com inúmeras oportunidades que requeriam de nós soluções práticas e eficientes, sempre de acordo com o código de ética e conduta da empresa. Esse empoderamento, dado aos associados, faz desenvolver em cada um o profundo sentimento de dono do negócio, isso nos estimulava a todo momento a buscar a excelência no desempenho de nossas atividades."
good,"Considero que les falta aun mas reconocer al personal, así como también hace falta trabajar con el sentido de pertenencia del cliente interno."
good,Management schedule me at unavailable times week after week. I had to tell them multiple times. Other than that I was a Superior Employer.
good,A great place to work out; the management and coworkers were a delight to be around. Great benefits plus a 10% discount. Enjoyed helping and politicing with customers.
good,"I learned how to talk to customers and answer the phone"
good,This is a good company to work for where you can advance yourself as far as you want to go. There are plenty of store managers that have started at the bottom and worked their way up.
good,I have a good relationship with my management team.  They are flexible and willing to listen to any ideas I may present.  I am able to work hours prefer  The hardest part of this job is angry customers.I enjoy my fellow associates and like to talk them when able.
good,if you're a people person than a job in retail is for you. its very frustrating working at Walmart some days. almost no one communicates properly.
good,"Fun place to work with supportive co-workers. Everyone helped each other, no one was left behind on their work. The most enjoyable part of working with this company was the customer relationships created. The worst part of working with the company was the management team was not supportive of the good work only pointed out bad."
good,Managers make themselves available to help employees in tasks and training.  Many opportunities for advancement.  Requests for time off are given as requested within reason.
good,"es una empresa en donde muchas veces no hay mucho profesionalismo ético si hay mucho favoritismo "
good,"I would not suggest that this become a life long career, but it is a fun job depending on the management and staff."
good,"A friendly place where the opportunity of communication and making work-related relationships is provided. My learning includes gaining promotional team working and communication skills. The management is collaborative and caring in spite of a few leadership errors. Having nice and helpful co-workers has definitely been a strong positive point of my workplace. Standing for a long time on my feet used to be a bit hard at the first, but it never bothers me anymore. Achieving new experiences every day has been the most enjoyable part of the job. For example, I was so excited when I experienced working as a customer service associate for the first time."
good,Its a good place to work but its not a company that I picture myself starting a career in. Although it was a good first retail job for me to have.
good,un ambiente ameno en el cual tambien hay libertad a las opiniones de todos
good,"Working major retail has taught me time mgt. and attention to detail with personal and merchandise.  Tact with personal, and customers in difficult situations to achieve a positive result.  Attention to detail in reports, inventory control, and managerial decisions.  Overall Wal Mart has been a positive experience."
good,"It's a fun job and an easy one, but the management is awful. They fail to recognize the positive you do, but are quick to punish or point out your flaws."
good,"A typical day at my job is always greet customers with a smile, ask if they find everything okay or helped by an associate and and show your appreciate them for shopping at my job."
good,Black Friday- It was so crowded cashier barely made to there registers on time before the sale begin. But over all they made a lot money that day.
good,the co-workers are the best its a great place to work but sometimes management seems to panic and make poor decisions a lot of the time they have bad attitudes
good,"Very fast-paced job with decent compensation, though anything that causes downtime results in a much faster and potentially unsafe work environment for anyone affected.  A worker's speed and productivity determines the length of their workday regardless of other employees' performance.  All around, not a bad job, but certain aspects are physically rough on one's body."
good,"Its Good job the new customer scheduling is hard to deal with because your schedule is hard to work around and is not flexible. On a day to day basis you have to stock, rearrange and help customers. the hardest part is the heavy days were a lot people come in and tempers flair.  best part is helping people and locking down big projects. As long you work well as a team member and pay attention its an easy job."
good,Good place to work if benefits such as health care are needed. Friendly co-workers with positive attitudes. Management and floor supervisors were hard to talk to due to numerous demands and duties upon them. I was not trained properly how to complete certain tasks. Disrespectful customers.
good,"Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop."
good,"Its  Always Busy So Be Able To Adjust To Your Surroundings ,A lot Of Wonderful Things Happen At Walmart . So Days Its A lot Going On And Some Days Its Slow And Boring But Its A lot To Do Thru Out It."
good,Lockport and Joliet Illinois. I recently broke my ankle and when I came to Wal-Mart for the first time I was with my husband. He stopped right in front of the door. I could not put any weight on it. Then he got the Motorized cart for me.
good,Its better to work in a department where you can socialize as well. The bakery and meat department involves more solo work and so you might be alone most of the time.
good,Walmart is the type of company that has its own culture. A Lot of that depends on leadership. There were many different leadership styles I had to put up with and sometimes ended up getting caught in the middle of two assistant managers disagreements. All-in-All if you work hard you will promote quick.
good,"Walmart is a fun work place with supportive management.  "
good,Company is transitioning right now due to restructuring of leadership. Good place to work. Training plan is non existent is more of a learn as you go. Must be a self starter.
good,A typical work day consisted of driving a forklift to begin the day and get pallets to start the work. I was the one in charge of set-up.  My co-workers were great. What i learned from this job was responsibilities to be the one in charge. The most enjoyable part of the day was that we were always busy.
good,I enjoyed the management team.  My job was easy and boring.  Unfortunately I worked in a locked vault with no windows or dealings with people.
good,"Processing and ensuring that merchandise is sent back to the Walmart Return Center requires patience. Carefully inspecting all merchandise and properly stacking heavy merchandise also requires safe lifting techniques. In doing so, allows the store to continue operations and prosper in the market. Allows one to develop relations with other associates and help them in completing daily tasks."
good,"Management was nice they understood when you had something come up. They were very easy to talk to.fast paste, customers were nicer."
good,This kind of work is not always much respected but there is alot more work than the average person knows about from unloading full tractor tailors to stopping shop lifters from stealing ou got your work cut out for you there.
good,I gained a lot of experience on a fast paced and highly demanding job.Safety being a primary concern. I really enjoyed working with the people there. We all worked as a team.
good,"It was a fast pace work. You were constantly doing something. Management was not the best, however friendly. The cultural diversity in the workplace made the job very interesting, as you got to meet a lot of different people. The hardest part of the job would be turning people down on returns, as some could not understand the return policy and would than get angry. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with people in general."
good,This place allowed me to be a leader as well as allowed me to work the way I wanted to work. That being said a lot got accomplished.
good,The store manager was great to work for.  The company itself not so good.  They wanted more for less like the sign says.  The people that I worked with was great and I made a lot of friends there.
good,"Incredibly busy and stressful- but not necessarily bad.  They give you *just* enough people to get by, and *just* enough hours to get by.  Of course they always push for the most out of each employee- if you're a decent manager this will work out alright for you."
good,"Overall experience is decent. Every team member has the same scope of focus, building revenue to gain success in the company by sales."
good,"I enjoy what I do, I am looking for a more set schedule. I am wanting something with day shift hours, and looking to expand my knowledge; I love learning new things. I am a fast learner and learn best with hands on. I enjoy working with Walmart, because I am able to meet new people, build lasting relationships and be a positive influence on my co-workers. I am a very outgoing, friendly, responsible and hard worker."
good,"Before the hiring process, i was told that the working conditions i would be placed in, would never be under 60 degrees, nor would i ever have to work a day shift in the freezer. Once i did that shift, i got sick and to seek medical help at the hospital."
good,"Overall Wal-mart is a good place to work for. They are very organized when it comes to training. I learned not to let things get to me. Working on the front end can be very stressful but you have to learn to deal with everything in your own way. When a lot of customers come to check out at one time, it can be very hard to get customers in and out in a fast manner but with training you can get the job done. I like the people I work with and getting to know customers on a daily basis."
good,i love wal-mart it was just a hard decision i had to pick with bettering myself. I was in school and it was time for clinicals and i could'nt do both so i had to finish school. im welcome back to walmart i was a great worker.
good,"Walmart is a place that will either stress you to the point of burning out or allow you to thrive through trial-by-fire changes and promotions.  If you can be social with management, work quickly, and not be stressed by the chaos then you will thrive here.  Expect lots of politics and bureaucracy, however with such a large company the possibility to move up or relocate are wonderful.  Walmart is a living contradiction, equally terrible as it is wonderful."
good,The company was overall organized.But the benefits apart from a low hourly rate were not so well.I was paid $7.85.At times when employees were low I also found myself unloading a semi truck
good,Decent company to work for with ample opportunities for advancement.  Most co-workers helped each other and made it a fun environment.  The most stressful part are the customers.
good,"fun place to work, good people great place to work if you can follow directions and work independently. Supportive management and coworkers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me clocking in and immediately going to the sales floor to see if any items were out on the shelves. I returned to the stock room and gathered all the needed merchandise, then returned to the sales floor to ensure that customers were able to find what they needed. "
good,I will never work for this company again. They don't seem to care about their employees' personal life. I had a daughter who had cancer at 6 months old and had appointments at Arkansas Children's Hospital and St. Jude in Memphis and this company would never let me take off. I was forced to resign so I could take care of my daughter.
good,"Troubleshoot and configure cell phones. Be calm and patient with customers to provide the best customer service. Run and Fix issues in Electronics, Connection Center, Site to Store, and Pick Up Todays. Verify Returns and handle customer complaints. I learn different ways to do returns and material from customers and employees every day. My Co-workers provide me the tools I need to get the job done. Hardest part of the job is staying on top of everything but it's very challenging which I find most enjoyable."
good,I worked for wal mart for four years until I was injured stocking spaghetti sauce and placed on light duty and let go after I was placed back on full duty.
good,Empresa internacional de grande porte boa em certos pontos e ruins em outros.
good,"It was fun working for Walmart. Interacting with customers and being able to deal with different attitudes helped me out with my customer service skills. I learned a lot of things about Walmart and the services they provided. Working at Walmart, I leaned new things everyday and that kept me busy."
good,A typical day at Wal mart was busy the management was good and if you ever needed anything they were there to help. The hardest part of the job was bags on the carousel.  The best part of the job was getting to meet new people and talking with the customers
good,"It was a wonderful company to work for. I was introduced to a lot of aspects of the company. I worked with manager personally to take care of problems that was happening with the store. as an inventory associate I was required to do everything that was needed to be done in the store, whether it was to talk to customers, stock the shelves, organize pallets and much more"
good,"It was busy at Walmart. The days went by fast, but it got old. I wanted something more. Managers were nice and friendly. You get benefits and everything."
good,"I process grocery claim items, prepare damages to go to feeding America, check in vendors, process UPS & FedEx receivings and help in other areas of store as needed."
good,"I did a lot of work both in and out of my department for minimum wage pay and no store benefits because I had not worked there for 6 months. My co-workers were fun to be around and I did get to water plants, which was the highlight of my day."
good,From My experience as a IMS Supervisor at Walmart Its a nice place to work. I learned that the backroom is the heart of the store because if the back room is not running smooth the sales floor will not also.
good,it was great place to work good tem members and great team work the hardest part of the job would be overstoick on the floor
good,"Get through a typical work day"
good,"Great place to open your eyes to see how assistants work with patients and to see if the medical area is right for you. Being able to multitask is a must, as well as staying organized."
good,I sent in my notice that I had school coming in and that I needed to change my hours and my manager never changed the hours. So I had to quit before it interrupted my learning experience.
good,"Management tends to favor certain employees. Corporate guidelines state ""no discrimination"", but managers proved otherwise. I learned that employees are there to benefit the corporation but don't receive any in return with the exception of clothing discounts"
good,"While I worked there, it served its "
good,"overall the job wasn't bad it was just the managers were very disrespectful, no cares for associates life outside of work, cut hours at anytime"
good,"I worked at a cash register so that was pretty much my day at work, other than when i worked at night time i would stock the shelves. The management was okay that had a lack of communication which caused problems at times; but fairly reasonable. Co workers were ranged from various ages but was overall decent to work around. The hardest part of my job, was managing my outside life with work, considering the fact that the schedule never stayed the same. The enjoyable part was the discounts that were given."
good,"good company to grow with. Love the associates that I work with on a daily basis , good report with my direct supervisor. I have learned many new aspects of retail."
good,I think that the prices are good but the wages could be higher for what they require you to do on daily basis. They are flexible with your schedule.
good,"Walmart is a fast-paced environment....associates are continuously busy dealing with clients, associates and day to day paperwork.  This Walmart is multi-cultural, which is quite interesting, being able to learn about each other's culture.  I always enjoy working alongside these wonderful people.  Working as UPC Associate, I am able to benefit from working with all departments and levels of management, even dealing with Walmart customers."
good,"Working there as a whole has been a good experience, The environment and the people I work with has been a pleasure and a life learning experience. I am interested in leaving the company because I feel that there is no room for me to move up and advance my career."
good,"I would go to work knowing that I could not finish all the notes that I had, but always told it would get better. It never usually did, and there was always problems, but the people I worked with were great.  We kept each other going and it was fun at times."
good,"It is a very diverse workplace. It requires hard work. The management is rather difficult, but other than that it's okay."
good,"It was before the new regulations and pay raise this year, but it was good overall. Being in the frozen/dairy department, I checked expiration dates, unloaded trucks, zoned (kept the department up to standard) and use the pallet jack almost everyday. Management and co-workers were friendly and wanted me to succeed so they had no problem helping me understand the rules and how to accomplish our goals in the best way possible. Enjoyed being around my peers working but sometimes stocking and storing pallets were hard because of their size and weight with the additional fact you are in freezing temperatures made it difficult but still was not a bad place overall to work."
good,"A typical day at Walmart was me coming in, punching in and dropping off my coat/purse, grabbing a quick coffee and walking to my registering podium. There I would read where I was stationed for that day and made note of my lunch hour. I spent the first two - four hours of my day checking out customers, cleaning my conveyor belt, straightening up my area, and putting ""stored food"" away. By ""stored food"" I mean of course people who decide ""I don't need this bacon"" or whatever cold food they don't want and shove it deep into the can machine where you can grab a pop if you're thirsty in line before you pay for it."
good,I liked this job but it was a grave shift job and it made it hard for me to do anything else during the day. I enjoyed working with the team because they were helpful and I learned alot about their products.
good,Great company - bizarre culture that doesn't suit me.  Location is a drawback as well.  Work hours are long and strictly adhered to though that is not the case in the offices in silicon valley.
good,most of my ecperience at Walmart was good but my only complaint was a few of the night managers were very young or didn't have much experience managing that type of workplace
good,"Working in the Pharmacy at Wal-Mart stores can be a bit trying. Each day there will be something new. One day it can be total chaos and the next day you will seem to be in a fairy tale. The hardest part of the job is staying focus with the many distractions. Between the phone ringing, customers having questions, filling and bagging prescriptions, its easy for a mistake to happen."
good,It's a good place to work and managements are great to work with. I was happy working there except my pay rate. It's a great place for students lots of people oriented employees.
good,Way too many corners cut on all aspects of the company. Fairly easy to move up but that creates a lot of inexperienced managers. The turnaround rate is extremely high. Scheduling is the biggest problem with the company.
good,The company as a whole is a good company. I just didn't feel like I was treated respectfully. I don't think women get the same treatment as men.
good,"Al llegar a la empresa el turno hace su porra y empezamos a recibir turno para continuar con los reportes. iniciaba marcando a las tiendas para obtener horario de llegada de las unidades y ver cual era el tiempo que una tienda tardaba en descargar la unidad en caso de tener un tiempo largo se hablaba con la gerencia de la tienda ya que el perecedero tiene prioridad, se apoyaba a los operadores que tenían problemas en el camino o en algún club cedis etc. el ambiente de trabajo si era un poco pesado ya que los compañeros no estaban de acuerdo en cosas que los jefes hacían referente a que no sabían reconocer el trabajo de uno la parte dificil que me costo aprender fue la valoración de gráficas de las unidades ya que en cada reporte tenia que investigar desde el embarque en cedis hasta que llego a la tienda para determinar donde fue el error que daño la mercancía pero con el paso de los días aprendí la parte que mas me gusto de mi trabajo era atender a los club y tiendas cuando tenían algún problema"
good,Great opportunity but lacks leadership. Can develop and grow with this company but you must be will and able to pick up others slack.
good,"there are a lot of nasty people working for walmart that want you to do your job and theres too,,,but also if you like that type of work as i enjoyed you can be happy there,just dont let people push u around"
good,There is no life in retail and working for a big company didn't leave any time for your family.  That was my major issue.  They never wanted to let you off. You don't get any personal time.  When you make it home it's time to go sleep and get up and get ready to do it all over again.  They mistreat employees
good,My typical day at work was a 3-11pm shift. I always closed as the new member on the customer service manager. I learned that no matter how hard you work if your not close with the managers you will not move up the latter. My co-workers was the best. It was a team environment if your team trust you. It's easy to work as a manager. The hardest part of my job was working a 12 hour shift with nobody to cover your break or lunch. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers and my TEAM!
good,Working with Wal-Mart was a great experience. I enjoyed it and still do honestly. It a nice friendly place where you can meet new people and learn management skills as well.
good,"Its a good place with hours."
good,This job gives you plenty of skills because you help out in other departments as you work in your department. If you are sitting around doing nothing you probably forgot to do something. This job was a blast and brings a unique challenge to your life.
good,"empresa é muita boa de se trabalhar, com constantes mudanças fazendo o individuo crescer muito profissionalmente. Permite ótimo relacionamento interpessoal. Empresa que fornece bastante ao individuo, porém também exige também empenho e dedicação."
good,"The work can be easy but sometimes it seems you are doing more than your job description. Managers are easy to get along with but there has been a sense of favoritism within employees. Benefits are good, some hours can be different, but overall a good workplace."
good,"customers by telephone or in person to provide information about products or services, take or enter"
good,working at walmart has been a good experiance for me the people are nice to work with. i learned how to be adaptable in many situations and working in retail there are many. i really liked to see the customers and help them everyday and help make sure they got what they needed
good,"Overall, I did enjoy my employment at Walmart. My Co-Workers were extremely friendly and we all worked hard together as a team to provide excellent customer service. Working there for over a year I've learned that customers can be extremely difficult at times, but you just have to explain to them in a polite manner why the issue was happening, or get a manager to get a better control of the situation. I've learned that it's my duty to show up to work everyday in order to succeed at my work place, and also to be there for my co-workers so they don't have to pick up any slack. The hardest part of the job would have to be when customers yell at you for not being able to do certain things for them. For example.. Sell Alcohol without ID, as well as tobacco products. The most enjoyable part of the job is that the managers are very easy to talk to if there is an issue going on, and the fact that they work with your schedule during school. Days have been very stressful and fast paced, but at the end of the day my co-workers and I worked as a team to make sure we got everything done, and customers leave satisfied."
good,"grato con los compañeros de trabajo y la jefatura."
good,Walmart is an ok job for someone just starting life still living with their parents. You can work full or part time and there is oppurtunity to be advanced in a job position. some of the supervisors are understanding and some are not but overvall benefits are good and its a great place to start off working at.
good,"The hardest part of the job is stocking items on the shelves. On the other hand, working at the cashier station is great, because I enjoy working in front of customers."
good,"Every job I have held with Walmart customer service is a must at all times, ensuring customers are satisfied with their visit and make sure they found what they were looking for. I learned a lot from this company; how to handle different situations within customers and associates, how to become and be a successful department manager, and worked in multiple areas and learning what I needed to within each department to help customers find what they needed when they came in shopping. Management was pretty cool, they tried to work with you so you have the knowledge to get the job done. Loved working with all the co-works, if you were unsure about something or didn't know how to do it they would help you understand it and lead a helping hand within your area to get job tasks done within a timely matter. Their really wasn't a hard part of my job with Walmart besides when my kids would be sick and not able to make it into work, but management would work with me at times with my schedule so I could still come in once I had a sitter to watch a sick child. Working with the customers and hearing their stories about their families along with the regulars that would come in to see me, I would have to say that was the best part of working with Walmart."
good,"Compensation was more than equitable, but no time off was a problem.  Having quality time with the family was a major negative.  Always something going on to prepare for daily."
good,Wal-Mart is all about servicing the customer.  Associates are taken care of first with all issues.  The best part of the day is in the morning.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is very unpredictable.  You start out with a plan of  what needs to be done that day.  You set your priorities such as associate evaluations, schedules, deposits, compliance  issues, etc.  You receive direction from upper management.  You  check your Emails.  Any of  this can and will be interrupted for customer assistance.  You  walk your areas of the store looking for things needing attention.  You meet with those you supervise and give them direction.  You stop anytime an associate needs to talk to you about a concern. At some point you stop for lunch.  After lunch you repeat most of the things you did earlier.  Before leaving for the day you meet with each associate you supervise that have reported later in the day.  I learned how to deal with a lot of issues working in retail including  angry customers, underperforming associates, and just how much it means to say thank you.   The  most enjoyable parts of my day were when one of my  direct reports were promoted.  The hardest part was when we had to cut payroll"
good,"Good place, but as you work the ladder management asks you to do it all! Staffing was always an issue. Environment wasn't always pleasant."
good,Checking customers out very respectfully. Loved the environment there. The other staff were always very friendly. I really enjoyed being a cashier.
good,Nice environment always was ready to go to work. The management was nice hours were not what I expected.  Overall I like to go back but there has to be a better plan
good,Long time employee here and I can tell you it has changed quite a bit. No longer family oriented like Sam used to make it. Now it's all about the money.
good,Work was good people are very polite and try to help as much as they can.  Would love to return there but there is no openings and would recomend anyone to try and work there
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work for your first job or if you've been out of the workforce for a while and that's impeding your job search."
good,"Left for school and returned."
good,"The day started by opening and counting money out for cash register and vendors,I then took inventory for next orders due.If having a weekend event planned for the event food,entertainment exc.I then let employee in to open for the day,I worked if there was call offs or no shows.At closing I returned to the business to count out drawers.Took out next day start up and deposit the remaining amount into bank.I performed interviews and hiring,training process and was responsible for payroll.The thing I liked most about the business is meeting new people and providing the best customer experience I could deliver to keep loyal customer base,"
good,A typical work day can go either way it all depends on how the customers are. Management is easy to bring problems to and are understanding of outside influences. Co-workers are awesome they help you through the day and are understanding.
good,as a shipping dock loader i load store merchandise on to multiple trailers for shipment to store as well as following Walmart and DOT standers for trailer quality. the most enjoyable part of my job is the people who you work with they are played back fun people. the hardest part of my job is the shift to shift hand overs.
good,Management is Good Overall. Co-Workers are good hardworkers.I learned how to multi task better and get things done in a timely manner without any mess ups. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the management and some of the customers.
good,I really loved this job it was my first job i loved it . I learned so much things working this so much great thing that i carryed ova when i started working for DuaneReade.Management was ok the hard about that jo is that they didnt care about yu as a preson all the care about is the job n its hard working with people like that.
good,"This may not be applicable to all Wal-Mart stores this is only based on the one I worked for. Most of the customers were good but a few very nasty. I personally had to walk away from more then one. I did learn cashier work there, customer service desk, counting tills, doing charge orders and western unions customer service desk. As for the co-workers some worked hard other did not, the ones that worked hard had to pick up the slack for the others. Some of the management were good others not so good. Supervisors same thing. I will honestly say when I first started working for the company in 2001 I really enjoyed it. But the last years not at all."
good,"While this Wal-Mart consistently had its head hidden under the sand like an ostrich regarding what was going on with its associates, not all Wal-Marts are as such. Wal-Mart as a company is actually pretty good with some good benefits, not the 10% off since it's only off of general merchandise not off groceries."
good,"Overall after working for this company for a while i have learned a lot over the years. In a position such as the one i was in i believe that it was one of the hardest positions to be in concerning management with accomplishing customer service human resource objectives by recruiting, selecting, orienting, training, assigning, scheduling, coaching, counseling, and disciplining employees; communicating job expectations; planning, monitoring, appraising, and reviewing job contributions; planning and reviewing compensation actions; enforcing policies and procedures. It wasn't easy but would definitely recommend it to anyone with a hardworking personality and also with a lot of patience. I believe that the most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion is seeing the look on the customers face after going out of my way to get them exactly what they need when other wouldn't."
good,"A typical day at work begins with inquiring about that days tasks because the managers make 'notes' of what needs to be completed. I have learned how the inventory system works within the facility, how to make a cardboard bail, how to make a 'pick list' (what items we are out of that need to be properly removed from the warehouse). I have learned how corporate Walmart wants the store to look, what is considered incorrect, and how to read stocking labels. The management is okay, but it seems some lack the professional training. Sometimes their approach could be more professional and less demeaning. The physical labor is the hardest part of the job, I have to lift many heavy objects, and kneel for long periods of time. My co-workers, helping the customers, and more lenient than a factory (restroom breaks, days off)."
good,A typical day at work can be enjoyable but very stressful. I really enjoy what I do and working with other associates. Management sometimes lacks skills and communication. Hardest part of job is dealing with the misdirection of management. Most enjoyable part is the sense of accomplishment each day.
good,One of the easiest places I've worked. Not much of a compensation when it comes to pay though. This will be the reason for me leaving.
good,"•	Manage multiple departments simultaneously"
good,"It was great working @ Walmart because I felt like I was able to earn an income after being so sick for a long time. I felt really good about my little test that I gave myself. I was able to handle difficult people that were in a bad mood whatever the situation was with a calmness and I was happy to have made a few friends while there. The other Cashiers are a great bunch of people to work with. "
good,"productive work place,happy people management is very understanding and kind everybody is always busy and working  breaks were the best."
good,"It was very interesting to work in this company I learned to work with Customers,I would like to find a job like this.It was a very good experience for me Thanks Walmart"
good,Great place to work. Great mothers hours if you have kids. Co workers and supervisors always friendly willing to help each other out and work as a team. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting of products that come in cases or the 20-30 lb bags of kitty litter. They are my favorite. We usually tell customers to leave these most wonderful items in their carriages so we can scan them there.
good,"I enjoyed helping customer and the management aspect."
good,"the wal-mart on mason drive is a good location if you prefer fast pace and can be self productive your always busy and there is a challenge every single night."
good,"Set mods occasionally, cashier, zone, help customers, stock items, bin items that are overstock, and sometime help other departments."
good,"Dias de movimentos eram complicados pra todos,aprendi a saber ter calma e disposição,meus superiores tinham muito respeito e sabedoria no que me ensinavam,meus colegas era compreensivos e bem agradáveis e qualquer tipo de situação,era os dias que tínhamos que ficar depois do meus horários,as vezes que os clientes demostravam admiração por ter tratados eles de maneira correta."
good,i always do my best to help the customers and co workers. Always present myself professionally because it goes a long way to how customers and outsiders see the store.
good,"you you came from foreign country, Walmart is a good choice, they trust you , and you can improve all your skill for a new job"
good,"A typical day consisted of assisting customers, merchandising, and keeping the department cleaned/organized. While working at Walmart I learned that I grasped concepts quickly. My co-workers and supervisors enjoyed working with me because tasks were always completed thoroughly and in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was dealing with a customer who was upset with the service received from another employee. The most rewarding part was my boss and customers being satisfied with me."
good,"While they are very efficient at keeping shelves stocked, Walmart is not very knowledgeable about Food Service."
good,"The managers are all nice and supportive. Many opportunities for advancement, there is not very much job security due to turnover and high standards in the company. Customer service is first and foremost in the job. The hardest part of the job is keeping up the work thats needed to be done at the same time as going back over the work you had just done (mainly subject to the areas outside of cashiering)."
good,"Highly aggressive culture in management, which has its pros and cons.  Vast array of promotion options.  Struggle with turnover rate, has been a consistent issue since starting."
good,"dont tell them that you are going to school to get away from walmart.thay will demote you quick,if you dont work for them after school."
good,"Pretty good atmosphere, but extremely short-handed. No benefits for a year as a part-time employee, but usually scheduled hours as much as a full-time employee would be."
good,"Excellent place to work..learned to use the register,management was excellent loved working with coworkers.hardest part of this job was not enough security.Enjoyed working the closing shift."
good,"In an average day working as an Asset Protection Associate, I come into work and check my e-mail to begin my shift. After answering any e-mails that need attention, I then look into the database and print the previous days inventory adjustment reports and review them to look for trends in shrink and lost merchandise. I then perform a security walk through each department on the salesfloor, checking for merchandise protection consistency and correcting any items that need attention, looking for safety concerns and correcting those as well. After walking the salesfloor, I then check the backroom for any inconsistencies in binning and processing, safety, and to ensure the security and unloading doors are locked. After my morning walk, I fill out the necessary reports to document my findings and handle any other tasks that need to be worked.  Some days I also lead safety tours for the new hires, and conduct safety team meetings. My main objective at this job, however, and what I spend the majority of the day doing, is walking the salesfloor to identify and detain shoplifters. On an average day, I will walk eight to ten miles around the store. "
good,"A typical day as a cashier at Wal-Mart is fairly simple. We are expected to handle large amounts of money, while maintaining excellent customer service. One of the many things I have learned at Wal-Mart would be providing excellent customer service, and maintaining a positive attitude during a nine hour shift. A motivator for keeping this standard, is kept through manager's thank you notes. These thank you notes would be a personalized message from the management team essentially thanking you for keeping up the great work and encourages you to strive and better yourself. Thank you notes has always been my motivator, I have earned about twelve of them within my two years working for the company. "
good,"It's WalMart - what more can I say? Every day consisted of a skeleton crew dictated by an incompetent (and lazy) department manager. Walmart has terrible logistics and their frugal-ness towards employees directly influences the customer's experience. Upper management was fantastic. In fact, there wasn't a single assistant or zone manager that I didn't love to be around. Department level management was the downfall in my experience. My co-workers were a mix of arrogant hypocrites and lazy boasters. There were a few good ones, though. The hardest part of the job was leaving. But, by far the most satisfying, was making sure the customers left happy. I may sound like a spokesperson for Walmart, but I'm simply not. I genuinely enjoyed helping customers and making sure they found what they needed."
good,hustle around and stock shelves and help customers.  hardest thing to do is find everything on the shelves and keep everything accurately.  the co workers are a mixed place to work some are fun and some are not fun to be around.
good,"Advantages: This company offers a good benefit package. The benefits include medical, dental, Walmart stock, and 401K. Your only allowed to work up to 40 hours a week. You receive a 10% discount card after 90 days of employment."
good,If you like retail then Walmart is the place for you. Some stores are actually okay if you have good management. If you have poor management you will have a poor working experience.
good,"Everyday was interesting and it was the customers who made it that way. The times when this job was enjoyable was when I would have fun/entertaining customers. Even just having kind people come through your lane makes the day that much better. The hardest part about this job was dealing with the angry customers. I learned to have patience from my time at Walmart. When a customer was angry, being angry back was never the answer. It would make things worse. Having the support from management makes those situations easier to deal with as well."
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with at Wal-Mart.  It was crazy busy all of the time there was never a dull moment.  The reason I left was a customer spit on me because I wouldn't return stolen merchandise, and it made me fed up with the place."
good,"If a college student, as I am, there will likely be a schedule conflict. However, the work environment is nice and coworkers tend to be friendly and willing to show new employees the ropes."
good,"Walmart allows people to advance if they want to. They are a company that a lot of people in the public do not understand. You can make a living at Walmart. I respect the fact that they do pay their employees a decent wage, give the opportunity to get additional education, benefits. If you are a responsible employee Walmart will try and keep you so you don't live with the threat of being fired as with some companies. Managers have been fair with me only one has been a problem but not much. The average customer's that I deal with in my city are a diverse culture. People simply trying to or having to save money. Walmart is trying to allow people a better quality of life that they may not otherwise have."
good,"At Walmart I would clock in and proceed to my designated department. Once there I would either be taking out merchandise and stocking them in their designated areas while helping customers. Or I would be taking new skids apart with product and putting them through the electronic system and dating them once in their designated area in the back room. I would work alongside 2-5 co workers that would be completing the same tasks as I, some days I would be working alongside a department supervisor but always having store assistant managers just a page away. The hardest part of the job was learning the process that everything has to be done by. The job although very repetitive always had a good tempo to it."
good,everyday i would have to unpack 100 boxes or more. I learned how to work fast and handle customers. I worked alone most of the time. if i had a hard task i work with another team member. the hardest part was getting everything unpacked and in the right place.
good,Management usually doesn't care about anything but what has to be done. Dealing with uneasy customers was the hardest.
good,"A typical day was strenuous at Walmart. I learned task management and working to meet time guidelines. The co-workers and managers were all the hardest part of the job, with so many employees communication was absent.The job wasn't hard at all just continuous labor. The most enjoyable thing was meeting new people both employees and customers."
good,"The work is challenging with a lot of scope to learn and innovate. However the job culture,the career growth is not at all streamlined."
good,"Such great people"
good,Walmart is a fun place because it gives me a chance to interact with people of different culture and race. I learnt a lot about myself and I acquired a lot of skills to add on to my resume. management is not the best but I still love the people I work with.
good,"mi jefe era una persona que te apoyaba en todo momento, te sabia escuchar y se preocupaba por el bienestar de los empleados. "
good,"Taking care of the customers, I have learned you treat people the way you want to be treated. Management good teachers, co-workers good learners. The hardest part of my job is telling a customer I can nit return  old merchandise. The good part of my job is satisfying the customer."
good,job is very physical with little mental demand on the employee. Moving up in company is a challenge as there are few opportunities for advancement
good,"I have learned alot from retail pharmacy but it is obvious that i have met my capacity. I am a person who loves to learn more and am looking to improve my knowledge in the pharmacy setting. A typical day for me is hearing my name being called many times as I am an expert at everything as well as providing exceptional customer service. I have pretty much trained everyone and I would have to say that the most enjoyable part of my job is the majority of the people I work with. The hardest part of my job is working hard everyday to the best of my ability while watching others do alot of nothing. I have learned to take criticism, process Genco returns, inventory prep the whole pharmacy, credit our returns, and a lot about drugs and what they are used for."
good,I love working with and around people. The workers are very helpful and the managers help alot. Its alot to learn but its good to have people around to help you when you need it.
good,While working at Walmart I learned a lot of management skills. Very good internship program. I learned basic management duties.
good,Os benefícios oferecidos pela empresa não eram dos melhores; a rotatividade da equipe era grande.
good,The WalMarts in Deridder was Good.The people was willing to help and over all very nice.The one inWVa was kind of Dificult.
good,"Lo que más me gustaba hacer, era recoger y separar la mercancía dejada en cajas, porque me mantenía activa y hacía un poco de ejercicio."
good,"Started off as a cashier, but ended up working at customer service. The Atmosphere and co workers were great. The opportunity to move up to what I desired from Walmart took to long for me"
good,enjoyed working there just unfortunately they were unable to work with my schedule. I told the I couldn't work in the evening and they kept scheduling me to work it anyways.
good,the people that work at this store are really nice and friendly. The Management on the other hand are horrible. They expect the world from you with no real training or direction. They make a point of telling you that you can be replaced any time for any reason.
good,"-Any given day involved ensuring safety and checking equipment for proper operation, writing up customer orders, ensuring garage supplies are in proper order, fill out compliance logs, fill out and file paperwork on safety and compliance."
good,I was hired onto Walmart fairly quickly after I applied even it was only seasonal but t allowed me to broaden my capabilities and work ethic even higher then I anticipated
good,"Job was ok, but people were fun. Many different levels of management. Good opportunity for advancement. Give it a try, you just might like it."
good,"experience many different situations, i have learned how to deal with many different types of people and how to resolve conflicts"
good,"Hardest part of the job was keeping a department straight when people let their children run rampant in the store."
good,"As i said in the title,  some parts of the job are great.  Some of the managers are great people, easy to work with, and genuinely care about their employees.  The co-workers are good people, unless they are complacent.  The managers talk about ""hiring from within""  and chances for advancement, but nobody can give a straight answer regarding it."
good,"A typical day at work was about a 9 hour day working with a great team.  Very friendly , fast paced, warm environment. I learned how to preform W.I.C transactions , cash checks, count money back,  price match, and run the cash register. I also learned many of the fresh fruit and vegie plu codes after only a few weeks on the job with out having to look them up n the booklet.  I got along well with the management and my supervisors.  They were very friendly and caring people.  I made friends with many of my co-worker quickly and could relate a lot with them. The hardest part of my job was having to leave due to family issues. The most enjoyable part of my job was the feeling of belonging and costumers that would look for me on a daily basis.  I loved working with the costumers and my co-workers."
good,Great place go to work with many advancement opportunities.  Great culture and over all good place to work.  Fast paced workplace
good,"While working in the Chantilly, VA Walmart, I really enjoyed myself. I loved the staff and especially management. I had an amazing day every time I came in to work. Everyone showed excellent team work dedication to get work done."
good,Someday's were good but most days were stressful. i had a good group of people that i worked with so that made the days better. We worked hard everyday.
good,"Helping customers with any questions they had about any of our electronic items. I learned more knowledge about electronics. Coworkers were hard working and very nice."
good,"As a pharmacy tech at wal-mart the overall schedule rotates. Walmart is great at adjusting avaliable days for important events in your personal life. Very family- friendly organization. Coworkers are very knowledgeable in all tasks at hand. Management could use a little help in organization and communication,(but what company doesn't"
good,"Busy at times, but I learned how to treat customers, run a register and mix paint. Management always greets customers and thanks employees for a job well done. The hardest part is unloading trucks."
good,"As a merchandise supervisor, a typical day at Walmart usually consists of scanning your areas to make picks from the backroom, checking to make sure you do not have any returns at customer service that need to go back to your areas, price changes, and modular updates for the most part. The co-workers are what make this job fun to work at sometimes. You can meet some great people to work with. Management may or may not be the same. I like my assistant manager over the areas I work fortunately, but I actually dislike most of them. The toughest part about this job boils down to when it gets really busy/stressful on the weekends as well as the exceedingly high expectations that management has. It is typically unreasonable in my opinion as it is usually one person(me) having to do the work of, say, three or four people. The pay is unfortunately not that great, which is also tends to stress me out as well. I would say that Walmart is overall a decent place to work at if you're using it as a base to start off your working career. I would probably not recommend it if you want to use it as a long-term job unless you can manage to get promoted to a management position."
good,"My challenge ""angry customers"".Very busy day ,stressful and enjoyable at the same time ."
good,Going to work putting up new items that came in and trying to figure out where to put the items. Zoning the departments picking up the floors rehanging items in their proper places. the managers would try to work my scheduling so I could balance work and family. My coworkers help me when I need help and I help them when they need help we work together as a team to get things done. the most enjoyable is helping customers and working friendly people
good,"typical day at work is so quiet except for kids of the customers running, shouting or crying. "
good,"A typical day for me at Walmart is I get my section to work in, then I have to cut boxes open and stock our reserves for the orderfillers to fill from.  I've also worked in other areas of the warehouse, unloading trailers, processing freight, orderfilling stocked freight, loading trailers.  I've even worked in the consolidation part in the office processing over, short, and damaged claims.  I get along very well  with my coworkers and if I ever had to leave Walmart, that would be the hardest part leaving them.  I tend to get along well with management and upper management.  The most enjoyable part of the day is my co-workers.  We get along well and work together well.  That helps make the day go by smoothly.  The hardest part of the job sometimes having to work alone and keeping my mind active and focused while maintaining a consistent rate of speed."
good,"Being a customer service manager has alot of job duties, serving your fellow associates as well as your customers. Taking care of multiple issues makes for a stressful day on occasion. Making friends with others is also a part of making the work day better. Having good co-workers helps in the busy environment and managers help when they can."
good,This employer is a nice place to work if you have been out of the workforce for a while. I learned a lot there. We get an hour lunch break and plenty of bonuses. Fun and interesting people.
good,"From working at Walmart, I've learned some things valuable team work skills and people skills. I was friends with most of my co-workers, management was a little annoying. The hardest part of my job was the shift. 10 pm- 6 am. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with Customers. I love to help others as much as possible."
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work. I have enjoyed job security and a gained a lot of experience over the years."
good,"My typical day at Wal-Mart would consist of unloading a truck, assorting freight onto pallets, and pulling merchandise to the sales floor using an pallet truck. Each day I learned how to manage time using it wisely. Also listening to proper orders from management and passing work duties to my co workers. However the hardest part of getting this part of the job done was unloading the truck by a certain time. Therefore the most enjoyable part of my job was being able to talk and laugh while unloading the truck and pulling out the merchandise."
good,Buen ambiente laboral con muchas posibilidades de promociones. Mucha rotacion en el personal y poco reconocimiento de parte de la gerencia en general. Horarios laborales extensos en ocasiones.
good,"Back then, I started when it woolco, then Walmart took over in 1994. it was a great place to work.  Everyone had their jobs, positions and daily tasks to do. The company cared for the employees."
good,Hard to get a break.  Hard to get out on time to go home.  Management was hard to find when needed.  Hardest part of job was getting along with certain customers.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with people. The most difficult part was all the time away from my family. The days/nights were long. I learned just how much I can push myself to do even when completely exhausted.
good,Great co-workers made the job go quick.  Learned people skills how to interacted with customers.  How make dead lines happen with out to much time wasted.
good,"It's an alright first job, but I would not consider Walmart to be a great long term job commitment for anyone. I can not speak for all Walmarts, but the one I work at could use some serious help. As far as sales go and the overall look/layout of the store, I would say that it is better than most, however it has it's own share of problems. I feel as though management has a hard time getting on the same page. When problems arise between workers or just for one specific worker, it seems as though it takes a very long time for them to come up with a resolution, if they ever do. I don't agree with the training either. I feel like training has just been a lot of ""throwing associates to the wolves"" and just expecting them to learn everything on their own. Depending on what they haven't learned in training, this sometimes leads to termination for meal violations, poor communication, etc. I also think that it is wrong how workers are treated. Hard workers seem like they get the work of those that choose not to work and, in return, never get rewarded. While workers who do not do enough work, or don't do the work that they are asked to do, end up being talked about, but never disciplined for what they are doing which over all makes work more drama-filled. I personally think there are far too many faults with Walmart to enjoy working there. As I said though, I only know what I have witnessed at my own store. All Walmarts are not necessarily the same as the next just because of management, bad conduct, etc."
good,The Walmart I worked at was located in a very small town. Everyone there had little cliques established leaving you to feel the need to conform to others ideals or start your own.
good,Hard retail work but made easier by people you work with. But not a place for me for a career. Good benefits easy to with management with any problem work related or personal.
good,"Fun Work Place Fast Pace Love It Honestly, Only Problem Hours Get Cut Without You Knowing 40 Hours One Week !6 The Next Cannot Live Off Of That..."
good,easy work minimal wage job and has lost of positions and different types of work a sport for everyone. they work around collage students schedule and offer good benefits
good,Everyday at work was great and I liked the gained experience. The store was well organized and great place to shop. Everyone was very welcoming and friendly even the store manager.
good,"A typical day at work would have been to clock in at 10 p.m. as I worked 3rd shift. After clocking all ICS' (inventory teammates) would gather in what we called and ad office, to gather telxons (handheld device used to scan products), portable printers and labels. We would start our shift off by picking products out if our inventory system from a list that was made showing what all was needed to stock the shelves in the store. This would continue on for approximately 4 hours then it was lunchtime (1 hour). After lunch a process of binning items into the system started up, this consisted of all ICS associates to go to the main floor and grab all overstock items ( excess items) and bring them to the backroom where ICS would scan the product label, change the item quantity to what was in the box and neatly stack the boxes in to steel bins. Which was our job for the remainder of the morning. Shifts typically ended at 7a.m."
good,Walmart is a good company to work with but still needs to work on employee help with equipment purchases. Company is willing to commit to you if you are willing to commit to them.
good,"1.A  typical day at work would be stocking shelves changing end caps and cleaning up before the store opens."
good,"*ambiente de trabajo respetable con sus pros y sus contras"
good,"A typical day working for walmart i would push the carts and clean the front area of the store, and also greet customers as they come into the store."
good,"I worked in the south and the north, it's like two different companies. Inthe south it's like a team, stores are ran good.  In the north it's a nightmare, poor management, dirty stores, a lot of drama."
good,"Working in retail can be very difficult, especially if you work in a massive retail store like Walmart.  While the hours and the lines of customers may be long and tiring, the benefits and experience can be worth it."
good,"I stock shelves and cashiering, helping customers and also fill the holes out in produce, stock too. I also help trained associates that were my co-workers. I am very hard worker and everything is hard in the all the jobs but  and also I am very fast learner in any different departments and I enjoy the job very because I got along with everyone."
good,"Cover pharmacies for Northern California, scheduling, training, payroll issues and vacation/leave of absence.  Dealing with many personalities. Job is very fast paced, must be quick thinker and able to multi-task throughout day.  Working with management up to Regional level and district manager level. Hardest part of job is dealing with the many different personalities and covering over 91 stores 7 different markets with different management styles.  Most enjoyable part is the feeling that you have accomplished the goal of giving excellent service to customers as well as your staff."
good,"Working at Walmart taught me what to look for when hiring new employees. It taught me patience, and most of all how to prioritize my day. When I was hired at Walmart I knew nothing about the business other than how to shop their. The position I started in was only for a short time. I quickly advance into a personnel position, to where my work seemed to have doubled. Not only was I in training for the training coordinator position but 2 months after that our personnel coordinator took a leave of absence and never came back. With no one there to replace her I quickly had to learn ALL  of her position as well as mine own. Learning how to juggle 16 hours of work in an 8 hour day was quite a challenge. It forced me to really use my time wisely, to always be pleasant even under enormous amounts of pressure and to work hard to ensure that i got the job done. The management team we had their was also a pleasure to work for. The hardest part was knowing nothing about the procedures at Walmart and being placed in a personnel position to learn two jobs at one time. But thanks to help from management I was able to make it work."
good,"I ennjoyed my job at walmart, it is a great place to work. I had the opportunity to interact with my customers and coworkers. Collectively, we created a great shopping experience for the customers and ensured 100% satisfaction."
good,Worked night shift as a cashier over the holidays. My coworkers were always fun and friendly which made it a good environment to work in.
good,"Started off as a cashier, within two years moved up to customer service rep, then claims dept, then to management. I learned much about customer service while working at wal-mart. Made many friends and became very close to the regular customers. The hardest part of the job would be working long hours when short handed. I enjoyed being able to help customers and building that relationship with them."
good,A day at work generally consist of dealing with customers that are usually in a rush to buy a home item. Our purpose is to please the customers by any means necessary.
good,"Overall on a typical day you stock, help customers and on occasion work on modules or price changes. Management wasn't bad, but being a training store for new assistant managers, it could be trying at times. The associates were the best part of the job."
good,"As soon as I get to work I am in charge of opening the deli department, by checking all the out of dates and making sure the floor is stocked. I have learned a lot working with Walmart like how to run a register to balancing registers, to working the gemini and completing tasks in a timely many. The best part of my job are the associates that I work with, they are like family to me. Also the customers that I help at Walmart. Most of them ask for me by name. The hardest part of working at Walmart is they don't have enough associates to help cover your area so sometimes customers have to wait a little longer than what they should."
good,"i worked at walmart for about a year .....loved the coworkers, very friendly and easy to work with. job tasks werent bad unless you had to go get carts in the middle of unloading a truck...other then that it wasnt too bad, some management issues but its whatever."
good,"At Walmart I did many things. My job title was a sales associate. This includes helping customers find specific products, stocking shelves, organizing and binning to back room, audits, doing modulars and zoning. I also cashiered for a year and a half then continued as a back-up cashier for the reaming 10 months of employment.  I have worked in Customer Service and traveled to help other stores in our market. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I helped someone to the best of my abilities."
good,"Very busy."
good,"I learned many things while working at Wal-Mart, customer services skills, fast pace moving, dealing with stress. A typical day at Wal-Mart company was fast paced and fun. Some workers did more than others but that's how most jobs are some do better than others. Management was about the same some do better than others but at the end of the day they were great. I can say the most enjoyable part was the diversity the different kinds of people you come in contact with that was most enjoyable for me. At the same time it also made it the hardest part of the job as well."
good,"chegava fazia minhas responsabilidades que era abastecer o balçao, fazer produção, atender os clientes."
good,"In the cage we worked with outdated equipment. I worked 3rd shift. Third shift is usually fun. I had a main cashier that was terrible. He always had me uptight and nervous. He would not allow me to take breaks until he was ready. He always felt he knew everything and no else knew anything. I complained a few times, thing got better, but then they got worse again. They were trying to save money by having employees clock out 5 or ten minutes early so they would not have to pay the last 15 minutes."
good,I worked for them and it is very hard to grow with the company. The benefits were not bad but I would not want to work for the company ever again. I worked 3 departments and did not see an opportunity to grow. the pay is minimal. Well many years have passed so maybe they are better now.
good,Some days were better than others. I learned that everyone is different always have a smile on your face because you never know what kind of day the customers are having your smile could brighten their day. Some management took their job more seriously than others like caring about their employees more than then they care about making money. The hardest part of the job was when customers didn't have a good shopping experience I always felt bad that they felt bad. The most enjoyable part was when the customers were happy with their experience and they told me how much of a good job I did.
good,The Bakery's a very busy & productive workplace.  I enjoy what I do.  We all get along.  I like it when the shelves are full for our customers.  We have almost a set schedule.  The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy boxes with frozen bread & roll dough.  Many of our customers keep coming back.
good,"This was a job that taught me a lot about what the day to day cycle of Walmart, and how retail in general operates; Essentially, it was an experience I wont forget."
good,"I learn how to work all area of the store even backroom to claims. A typical day was unloading all the packages off the truck for site to store(online orders) log them all in by myself and bin them in there location. Cancel all old orders and clean area. I keep up with all paper work 3 binders. I also call customers to let them  know their package was available for pick up. I keep my hand held on me to for fill orders of store inventory. Then I'll go to electronics help customers put out freight,change mods,put up returns,inventory prep . Help in other departments when I see they needed help.Train associates even though I was not in management, but managers would always come to me and associate. I was going for it but I was getting over look that was the hardest part of the job and they wanted me to do more and more. I enjoy the customers you never know what you will get some sweet some not but it taught me how to work with people and get them to calm down and let them know I'm here to help you get what you need and also have a good experience. As far as co workers I talk to everyone I'm just a people person, you need help I'll help you.I stay out of drama just do my job and mind my business. Managers some were excellent some I just don't know. I just love helping customers stay true to myself."
good,"A typical day consisted of building several bikes, zoning the accessories section, and helping the toy department associate. I learned that how to work in a politically charged work place. Co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job were dealing with the politics between certain associates and the manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting children new bikes."
good,The  co workers was very nice people to work with. The management  are very understandable and they do listen.
good,It was an experience of a lifetime. I had fun doing my jobs there.
good,"My review of Wal-Mart West is that I loved the people I worked with. Friendly and helpful staff so I was almost never alone to do the work myself. However the management team was sometimes very disorganized and many communication issued between staff and supervisors occurred. On the other hand when I ever had a scheduling issue or needed to speak with management, most managers respected the open door policy with kindness. All and all I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart because of the wonderful customers I came into contact with and the staff that I built relationships with."
good,Loved the enviorment but they need to pay more and give raises.
good,"Was a very high level and confidential job which was very "
good,I only worked at Wal Mart for seasonal periods of times.  I enjoyed the work that I was apart of especially the remodel team.  For those times I enjoyed the work I did for this organization.
good,"This job was okay, I do not find Walmart really treats their employees very well."
good,A great place to move up in a company.  You work with great people who you are able to learn from.  At times you may have to work a lot of hours. If you are in management you have to work overnight sometimes.
good,"A typical day as a Deli Associate at Walmart is slicing meat for customers cooking, and filling in the hot case. I learned that Walmart makes their own sandwiches and salads. The management was not the best, too many errors to run a store correctly. The hardest part of my job was making sure that even though the tempd on the meats may be right they may not be cooked well enough therefor not able to go out yet. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping out customers."
good,I understand customers come first and providing exceptional customer service is critical for business success.  Co-workers must work together for increased productivity and performance.  Management must provide guidance with constant reinforcement of company goals and objectives that relate to the mission and vision of the organization..  Products must be fully stocked for customer convience
good,"Management isn't always on the same page. So this causes a waste of time. Having to do things multiple times.  We have to learn to utilize the people we do have, to take care of the freight and notes. The hardest part of the job is the amount of work verses  employees. The most enjoyable part of work is the  co-workers."
good,Wal-Mart distribution center presents a fast paced competitive working environment. Employees can also progress within the company. Wal-Mart presents a comprehensive education package.
good,I am lucky enough to work at a store where everyone interacts as family.  Being able to go to work and feel completely comfortable around my co-workers is a blessing.
good,I would get to help people find whatever they needed if we had it. There are always outgoing people and there are always new things for you to learn.
good,"The best aspect of this job was the interaction with my co-workers. I started as a cashier, but moved to the Deli for a slight pay increase and we made a pretty good team. I loved the fact that I was able to do my job well: slice meat and cheese quickly, then move to the ""hot side"" to fry cook and serve customers. The pay was not the best, but the managers were pretty flexible with my schedule when that was needed. Great rewards for working Holidays. (For working both Thanksgiving and Black Friday,we were given 25% off an entire purchase). You have to work at Walmart for one full year to get a raise, but when you work hard,the management does recognize it."
good,"My typical work day consisted of preforming the following duties "
good,"nine hour shifts with one hour lunches"
good,"no meu primeiro dia de trabalho eu tive uma experiencia nova e colagas novos de serviços as minha gerente foram super bem cmg depois de muitos dias tive um dia muito complicado com um colega de trabalho que nao posso falar."
good,I unloaded trucks. Then we sort out the merchandise to take to different departments.Stock the shelves. At the end of the night. It was clean up on the dock. My co-workers was cool. We did our jobs. And got along very well.

good,"Build credibility and establish rapport and maintain communication with customers at multiple levels."
good,Down stacking pallets and stocking the shelves and zoning to keep the shelves nice and clean. And to also clean up area once you are done restocking your area. I learned the ethics of working with integrity. The management team was excellent and very easy to talk to. Was able to get along with coworkers and we all worked together to get the job done. Working overnight from 10pm-7am. Getting to meet new people.
good,They were a pretty good place to work for giving us plenty of hours.  However the pay wasn't very good and during the holidays to them Walmart was more important than family.
good,"Job was typically relaxed and enjoyable for the most part, consisted mostly of organizing work area and helping customers find potential purchases, management varies between being kind and helpful or very demanding and over bearing, co-workers were always a delight and willing to help and lend an ear, hardest part of the job was over looking more than one customer service area, most enjoyable was being able to help customers find what they need and to have them praise me for my good efforts."
good,"stocking shelves, having produced ready and displayed for customers."
good,It was hard at times because it gets very busy but it was a overall okay place to work. Some of the co workers were very hard to get along with because of their attitude especially towards new people. Most of the managers were great though. The did have lunches n things like that for the employees and the company did try to do things for the employees more than other places I worked.
good,stoking shelf's and cleaning the department helping customers maintaining cash drawer making sure everything was marked properly
good,A typical day at work is mostly based on work in time management. I have a certain time to stock the items up in put them up. My management is really on to me about working hard and keeping track of time. The hardest part of my job is to break down all the pallets and getting the items out on time. In the most enjoyable part of my job is clocking out at the end of the day knowing that I have completed all my task that has been assigned to me.
good,"llegar a revisar áreas que estén bien presentadas para la apertura,de tienda, revisión de notas prioritarias e implementar las guías de mercadeo vigentes, realizar pedidos de la mercancía que se encuentre en agotado así como autorizarlos."

good,"Worked late night and long hours"
good,"I've worked a total of seven years as an associate for Walmart. I've been offered several department manager positions, however I've turned them all down due mainly to scheduling conflicts. Department managers also tend to take on a great deal of stress for a very small pay increase. I would only recommend a department manager spot as a stepping stone to a higher position."
good,Overall it is a great business and place to work at. Some of the managers are messy but the work is fun and enjoyable
good,Fast-paced job and can be enjoyable. I enjoy the people I work with and we all get along. I have learned excellent customer service skills working this job. The worst part of this job is you do not work the same schedule every day. You do get two days off during the week.
good,"The day begins with reports, sales, inventory, coverage, with any customer complaints(if any).The current days inventory inwards, due to receive,touring, conducting meetings, supervising merchandising, vendor payments, cash office operations, spark checks, associate attendance and scheduling.Everyday at store retail is a learning, handling associates being challenging....."
good,it is a good place if you are a student or just need a part time job. they work well with students and if you only need part time. you can learn how to work in customer service industry.
good,I loved working in the deli at walmart but working with other co workers that didn't do their made my job more harder because I had to do theirs as well.
good,"bonne compagnie avec de très bon principes, théories, et systèmes mais pas toujours possible de les appliquer faute de personnel ou de certains membre de la direction qui pensent plus a leur succès personnel  qu'au succès de   l'équipe."
good,Work her and you'll find out. something you can only experience to know every store is different
good,"Great company to work for, management needs improvement. The environment was great, co workers were some of the best people I've been around."
good,helps to be efficient to work as a customer service or as a sales associate
good,I was seasonal but the time that I did spend there I enjoyed the employees and the customers around me
good,"Being a cart associate at Walmart in Linden NJ is a decent job the average day is just collecting carts in the parking lot and bringing them inside the store. Management at Walmart is effective at keeping things running smoothly from front end management all the way to the top. My co workers are easy to get along with and do their job as well as they can. The enjoyable aspect is just being outside moving around, there is not anything that is hard about it except when it is very busy on weekends"
good,Can be very stressful and you have to know how to juggle a lot of things at one time.
good,"A typical day at work maybe a big truck and not enough, people so I would have to work harder. I learn to when you work hard there are promotions. Management worked together to get the job done. My co workers were hard workers. The hardest part is working short handed over the holidays. I enjoy working hard while trying to get the job done."
good,"Asda is a good place too work the colleagues are hardworking generous coporative and in general agood group. "
good,"A typical day for me involves interacting with costumers. Making sure all my area is clean and stocked. Working with management to make sure any issues are addressed and fixed. The employees there are dedicated to their jobs, with most being there for 5 or more years, but on the down side, the store feels understaffed with many of the employees having to handle two or more department all at the same time, and some employees not being able to do parts of their job at all because they do not  have the training to work the equipment needed or are not physical able to because of age..  Management feel disconnected, this could be because that most of our head management is new to the store and haven't connected with their employees.Most assistant management is willing to help in anyway possible but because of the staffing issue, it becomes a strain on them finishing their job. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing things being accomplished. It make me feel good when i can see my hard work actually counted for something. the hardest part is the strain that the under staffing put on the whole store, running for department to department, and not being able to finish task you were giving makes it fell like nothing is being accomplished."
good,"Daily tasks would shift depending on how busy it was.  Usually acted as a cashier.  Most of the time enjoyable, with a few sour customers every now and then.  Management was very helpful and friendly.  Stocking shelves and retrieving carts were the most enjoyable tasks due to personal preference."
good,unloading product from trucks forklift operator customer service zoning and working in all locations in store
good,"Constant interaction with customers, cleaning work area. Management tries to help as much as possible with progression."
good,"it wasn't a lot of pay, not enough to live off of but it is really good for some extra money when money is tight, hours are flexable too. they made sure I got paid in a timely manner if there were any issues."
good,"Home life takes a backseat here, but the money is worth it. Often times it is you who take the blame for others mistakes. If you know how to talk business however you can avoid confrontations.."
good,"llegar y que la mayoria de las compañeras estuviera de muy buen humor y tarto para los demas, es muy dificil estar parada tanto tiempo y a la vez estresado por el mal trato del cliente aunque aun asi una tenia sus ratos de convivencia con paqueteros & cajeros que basicamente fue con quienes mas convivi, ya que no podemos andar de un lugar a otro, me encanta la manera de socializar.."
good,"A typical day will include,many solo oil changes,rotate balances,tire installation and flat repairs. The hardest part of the job sometimes is dealing with customers who have no knowledge of their own vehicles.I always deal with these situations with knowledge,tact,courtesy and respect."
good,"The hardest part of the job has to be the horrid customers that we can get, they come in angry or something doesn't go there way, so they make a big fus and ruin other people's day. "
good,"In this business I learned how to be authoritative.  Coming straight from college, there needed to be a distinguished difference between college graduate and manager over various departments.  My co-workers were very helpful in molding me into the most effective manager I could be, and it was easy to rely on veterans of the business to direct you into the right path."
good,"A typical work day at Wal-Mart included interacting with customers and taking care of they're needs. I learned  how to properly care for my customers and to always put them as my first priority. I absolutely loved the people that I worked with, I enjoyed working with my fellow associates. There weren't any hard parts  to the job, everything was remedial. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people, I never had a dull moment."

good,"its an ok job but management keeps changing the rules"
good,"Wal-Mart is an enjoyable place to work, it was very laid back and an non-stressful environment. I would go into work usually ten minutes early, talk to the previous staff to see what happened throughout the day and what is expected and then I would go and clean up the work place and attend to customers and if needed fill or move merchandise. Management however at the time was not so good at the time within the department but the overall management of the store was good. The hardest part of the job was during the very busy times with an abundance of customers while trying to completely move or set up a display wall, however it was doable and completed. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I was contributing to making the store look good, knowing that I made it approachable for customers and also helping the customers find something they wanted or needed and knowing that it will help them with their day to day lives."

In the morning right before the store opens,I am responsible for making sure that the department is completely stocked and zoned and cleaned in order to provide a nice experience to the customers who comes in the store to shop.The management is good and they do care about the well being of the associates.Though I sometimes face little bumps in getting along with some individuals who doesn't show me the respect I deserve, all in all the experience of working in Walmart is good."
good,"Not that bad of a place to work. If you want to make money, you have to put in the time. The hardest part of the job, was dealing with unhappy customers. The management was ok, there were only two I would not go to with any problems/questions. Having an unstable schedule, and working holidays and weekends is difficult on families, but that happens in most retail establishments. I worked with a lot of great people."

While we stocked we would also interact with customers if they needed any help. We would have 3 breaks, with a lunch break in the middle. The co-workers were all friendly and fun to work with. We worked until 7 am, and I believe the hardest part of the job was staying awake until morning."
good,"IT was my first part time job. I did well there, got along with most of my co-workers and most of the managers. Plenty of things to do there. It was pretty good for a high school student. Customers had a tendency to be hostile though, and should you even try to give your defend yourself when they yell at you they threaten to get you fired."
good,"Daycare Provider or Floater"
good,You can definitely make it up the ladder very quickly if you are a hard worker. They can pay much better for the work the employees do but you do get a 10 or 20 cents raise every year. Management sucked. They sometimes cut your hours even if your FT. Overall ok job.
good,"I was able to go from a new hire as a sales associate to Assistant Manager (with relocation) in about 10 months. Granted I had prior sales and management experience. But over all, I would say this company is a good entry level place to get experience and start a career."
good,A great job for people who want to act as an undercover cop. You're in street clothes blending in with the customers to catch shoplifters. This job could be made into a reality tv show. It's action packed if you're at a store in a low income area where there is theft everyday. You better be tough and enjoy fighting.
good,on typical day I tend to come to work with walmart tag with my name on it and always greeting Customers to the checkout lane to help them check their items out and balancing my money in the cashier register. Benefit and pay was great and Mangment tend to misunderstand me. one day I was really sick from gland swollen in both neck and mangment thought I walked out of the job I couldnt even called and ask my family in law to call for me and they didnt believe them so I went in and show doctor note and still they fired me on that day even though I was really sick just for one week with swollen gland.. felt they were discriminated because of me being Deaf I kept my head up and look job else where
good,"Put stuff in locker, scan badge at time clock, walk to the front and go to the Customer Service manager (CSM) podium to get assigned a register.  CSM will give you a money bag.  Sometimes I counted the money in the bag.  Put money in till, put till in register, and then greet and check out customers.  Also keep register area zoned/cleaned when there are no customers."
good,worked with great people. days were good not to long or to short.
good,"Make sure the needs of the costumer is there, insure the satisfaction of the costumer, all stock is on the proper places. learned to be double time to fillup the store department where you assigned,always be on contact to the department manager to insure the right thing to do, cummunicate always the outgoing and incoming to get the exact stock to be fillin, if there is event coming, school and christmas,the most enjoyable part of my job if my supervisor and costumer thanks what i have done."
good,"As a Pharmacy Clerk, I would greet the customer/patient, if picking up medications, I entered the needed information, grabbed the correct medication, scanned the medication out of the computer system, used the cash register if they paid there, had them see the Pharmacist, answer any questions the best to my knowledge, assist them in finding products out on the shelves, ordered products and got to know alot of them personally."
good,"this company always have been  very low at compasating employees "
good,"A typical day is busy, There is a large number of customers looking for assistance, and freight to be stocked."
good,"I liked going to work, the customers were nice to greet and services."
good,A typical day at work would be running a cash register mostly all day. I learned how to run a compactor and bailer. Management helps you when your having problems. My co-workers are all nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job is having to work different hours every day. The most enjoyable part of the job is having an hour long lunch.
good,"I made friends while working for Wal-Mart but there were a few problems I had. There was too much work for part-time hours. The pay was not what it should be for how much work there was. I did like however the flexibility. About two months after started I got really sick and was out for a week and they worked with me till I was able to work again. Then I had my second child and they gave me time off, unpaid, but flexibility till I was ready to come back."
good,"My day begins with unloading merchandise for the night and then setting pallets to the floor to be stocked. This job taught me how to appreciate the little things in life. I worked with  various supervisors and managers that shared good advice. My co-workers were good and friendly. The hardiest thing for me with this job was the wages, but what I enjoyed the most is the impact I had with the costumers."
good,"Overall great work environment, with a few good hard working people. Needs more structure and discipline, and is a very chaotic work environment..."
good,work ethic is terrible. it's more like having a seasonal position.
good,"Walmart had a good place to work. I learned many things there as a stocker. That everything has to look neat and in order, so that it looks pretty when the customers come in the morning. The supervisors and managers are doing a great job, running the business. I enjoyed working with others, and coffee breaks."
good,"aprendi e aprendo muito no serviço, programas diferente de acesso a estoque e a sistema internos."
good,"Its not a bad place to work, my management have taught me alot. The hardest part of my job is working overnights, the best part is what I have learned from my job."
good,"It is a good balance between really busy days and low activity.  I learned how to handle all kinds of stresses while on the job, which showed in my work because my supervisor has recommended me for a full-time position next month.  Learning how to manage tasks of unloading, organizing product shipments and co-worker requests, and scanning products with all required tools and electronics.  "
good,I was an ims assicoate and we put away overstock and dealt with the trucks that come in and also used hand help devices that let us know what was out of stock on the sales floor. Mamagment was really good the worked with you on anything you would need and most of them was fun to work for. There was no really hard part of the job and enjoyed every part of my job.
good,"a typical day at work is checking in vendors and if something happens to where one is going to be late for one reason or another than I try and see if others can come in at a different time. The vendors work with me on it as long as I am willing to work with all them. I like the people that I work with, they are all willing to help if I need it."
good,I clock in at work. Management gathers me and my other associates to talk to us about the notes that we have to get completed before the day is over with. I've learned that coming together and working as a team makes a big differences. I enjoy working with my co-workers we get a lot done in a short amount of time. I would say the hardest part of our job is working in the heat and the most enjoyable part of my job is staying busy and completing different tasks in a short amount of time
good,WalMart is a good job for college student. It gave me a chance to help people in many ways
good,I learned that hard work will take you a long way in life. the workers there are good people. just alwys know to treat people how you want to be treated
good,Co-workers are great if you stay busy you have no problems. As far as management I think their are too many telling you what to do. No communication within management and you get told 4 different things to do by 4 different managers
good,"A typical day at work was never the same. Everyday was different. I learned alot from walmart, how to merchandise, how to deal with issue's, helping the customers. I enjoyed meeting so many different co-workers. I really enjoyed getting to know each of them. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customer's. Many times customer's would thank me for helping them and i would in turn thank them."
good,I was a hard worker I enjoy getting there packages for them make sure they left with a smile on there face they could not get there package if there name didn't match the id.
good,"Tire lube express associate, Fork lift operator, Dept. Manager"
good,Helping cutomers as well as coworkers and cashiers in their jobs. Instant managers are good but higher managment is very inconsiderent. Being on your feet all the day is the hardestpart of the job.
good,"Because of my extensive time with walmart, I was able to learn various departments in detail."
good,challenging job however technology and computer software was among the best in the business.
good,"Walmart, like any company, can be a wonderful place to work for. It might take some getting used to, and some major changes in treatment of it's employees, but still a good place to work at."
good,"Although I had retail background. These years was converted from knowledge to Management. This was where supervising others and yielding results, deadlines, coaching others to excellence started my management career. My specialty here was inventory and shrink. This is one of areas of experience and results."
good,"The best part about working for Walmart is that everyday is different and exciting. With facilities in operation 24 hours a day, most of which having shoppers during that time, new challenges and opportunities to develop one's management and problem solving skills are present everyday. Walmart promotes its leaders from within, and is still growing to this day, which means there are countless domestic and global opportunities for top performers to advance their careers. This also means that district and regional management teams are themselves Walmart veterans, and experts on Walmart processes."
good,"fast paced, fun employees and management. Flexible work schedule"
good,i would date meats and set them out .my co workers were fun to work with.
good,"I am happy that I had the journey in  working fir Walmart, I have meet a lot of different people. I manage cashiers and take care of customers needs and insure there needs are full field."
good,"A typical day at work for me is simply trying to take care of the customers and keeping my part of the store organized. Work load mostly depends on what position you are hired for. Advancement within the company/store is very possible even to the management level, but requires steady commitment. Workdays could be hectic due to the volume of people that come in to the store and it can be overwhelming at times.  Overall, if you have worked in retail before, it should be nothing new."
good,"Good place to work and decent benefits for those who qualified. Low pay scale, but many opportunities to advance for those who found the right way up. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep inventory stocked during the busy hours. Management was reasonable. Co-workers were all types of personalities which made for some eventful days."
good,What I learned at wal=mart was essential  in helping me get a better understanding of helping customers
good,"The workplace at times may be quite enjoyable, but it is a efficient and healthy work environment."
good,"A typical of day at work began with a start up meeting with my co-workers to prepare for the job at task, After that we will exercise and start to do the job at hand, Management started the start up meetings, My lift driver and orderfiller helped me get the job done, The hardest part of the day was the beginning because usually I didn't have time for breakfast, The most enjoyable part of the day was break, so you could get to know your co-workers"
good,"As a customer service supervisor I ensure that wherever a cash register sits, the store operates smoothly at that register. In our store we handle around 50 registers that are scattered around the store. I also ensure that our cashiers get rotated properly for their breaks and lunches. I make sure the cart pushers in the parking lot are efficient in clearing carts from cars. I also ensure that the door greeters are at their posts greeting customers. I also handle all customer and employee situations and complaints about products in the store. The best part of being a supervisor is the multitasking. I never get a chance to sit much and I love being productive. The hardest part about working there is the job pay is very low for the amount of work performed as a supervisor. Management is very inconsistent because there are at least 5 different managers on one shift and they all have different answers on questions and don't know how to perform certain functions in the store. It's very safe to say that the employees working at walmart know how to run the store better than the management does when it comes to literally running the register, stocking items in the system, etc."
good,from a day to day work schedule it can get busy or slow but there is always something do.
good,"Nice people to work around, everyone is really friendly. Auburn is a great city to work/live in."
good,"The work itself is a warehouse position over nights, this on its own is somewhat boring, the people however made it fun."
good,"This company is very high paced and multitasking is a must. Although somewhat hectic, it is safe to say there was room to grow and learn. My coworkers and managers were very nice and overall we had a family type relationship. The hardest part was just trying to spread the employees more evenly so customers could have the service they deserve when and where needed. A typical day would include unloading a truck, checking it in, rotating the merchandise, loading them on carts, and finally stocking and cleaning. There is much more that comes with the job depending what area you work in. It can be enjoyable because the company has an open door policy as well as a high interest in customer and employees feedback and suggestions. I was able to change quite a few things with my ideas and it also helped our team feel much more connected and willing to reach our daily goals."
good,Wal-Mart is a good place to work.  Everyone will help out so that all the work gets done and not all places are like that.  I enjoyed working with the public and meeting new people.  Sometimes there were not enough people scheduled to work because all schedules came from Corporate and they didn't understand out busy times when we needed help the most.  I really enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"if you are a hard worker like myself and want to advance, walmart is a great company to work for"
good,"It can be very stressfull, and hectic but staying positive always helps me get through the toughest of times."
good,"Helping in inventory, cashiering when store was busy, answering phones and customer service"
good,"Typical day of work is pretty much doing everything you can to make sure that the product is available for the customer to purchase. I loved coming to work to see my Walmart family and everyone smiling, but it seems that the morale of many stores has gone downhill in the last few years."
good,la no local de trabalho eu tive muinta ajuda de meus companheiro de trabalho em todos os momentos  em um dia de trabalho eu aprendi muinto com esse trabalho a gerencia era muinto boa a parte mais dificil foi lidar com alguns empregados era lidar com o publico era adoravel
good,"inicio de jordada comum, inicio com parte de manutenção, para inicio de produção, axilio de colegas de trabalho exelente, sempre postagens de novas produções, receitas, orgnização de função (não fixa), gerenciamento variado de setores, a dificuldade maior seria a não fixação de função, quando no mesmo, o empregado chega pra dar inicio a seu serviço, e ao chegar tem alteração em sua rotina ou horario sem aviso previo."
good,"A typical day is very busy and fast paced. Working at the Customer Service Desk you learn alot about check cashing, customer service, fraud, etc."
good,"walmart is a great company to work, i learned how to handle a large amount of money, and the only hardest part of the job are during holiday sales but still it was fun because you see a lot of people, and you also see that your co-workers are willing to help you"
good,"nothing too special clock in to find out what dept you'll be working in for the night and start work all employees were great to work with and very helpful management too only hard part about the job was working in chemicals as far as the laundry detergent,bug spray,air fresheners,etc because its alot to put out and usually takes all night"
good,Good place to work but very demanding. Not a good balance between work and personal life.
good,"setting mods, stocking products to the shelf, and assisting customers."
good,"Beginning a night a work was scanning my name badge to start my task, getting the pallets out onto the floor, down stacking the pallets, taking the merchandise to the appropriate aisle, stocking the merchandise on the aisle that was assigned in the beginning of the night. I learned how to manage my time better and my organization skills increased. Most of my coworkers were very helpful and did not mind filling me in on some of the things I was not aware of.The hardest part of the job was trying to adapt to the difference in my sleep pattern since this was a third shift position. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet new people and sometimes being able to interact with customers who came in late at night."
good,Pleasant co-workers and customers. Learned to be more outgoing. Hardest part was trying to enforce a drama free zone with newcomers.
good,"Satisfactory, benefits okay. worked with schedule. polite"
good,"I was quite lucky to receive a good job quite quickly however the stress of the job is a bit too much to handle as a student. If you are looking for a serious job with lots of commitment it's the place to be but if you just want to have a part time job, you might consider something else. The management wasn't amazing and a bit scattered but overall had a good head on their shoulders."
good,Always looked forward to my breaks. Felt like a loner there. Longest work day I have ever experienced.
good,Fast moving work environment. The best thing i learned there was to use a scanner. Everyone that works there are friendly an helpful.
good,Was good. I met a lot of nice people at Wal-mart and I loved the customer interaction.
good,"A typical day at work began by me just simply jumping into the work day. I worked afternoons, so my shift usually lasted all day. I would clock in and immediately log onto a register. In the process of completing transactions, I would assist customers with insurance issues, answer questions, issue refunds, and fix any error upon authorization. Not only did I learn about the job, I also learned quite a bit about myself. While working in the pharmacy I learned that details, even small ones, are vital. Simple mistakes can produce major problems. The most important lesson was how to actively listen and understand people. Most angry customers are not upset with the employees. If they feel that better service could have been delivered, then it should have been. Management was great. The Pharmacy manager is a very understanding and patient man. He was very flexible with my school schedule. All of my co-workers had no issue with teamwork. Everyone took the extra mile to help one another during the busiest days of the week. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I missed the relationships I built along the way. I enjoyed meeting new and exciting people everyday. I would do it all over again"
good,a typical day was operateing the register and scanning. I learned how to run that register. When I didn't have a customer would work on the candy by zoning it
good,Organization and prioritizing workday is essential. Ability to attract and retain quality workers is difficult with the low compensation offered. Helping and assisting customers with knowledge of products that meet their needs.
good,Wal-Mart is a company that strive to push their employees to their full potential and inspire confidence in themselves.
good,"On a typical day, I pull TVs out of the back and place them in public view.  I then dust and zone all the TVs on the walls.  "
good,Loved my coworkers but my upper managment needs a massive overhaul they dont listen to their associates.
good,Worked there for a short time. Was good when the original manger was there but when the new one came in he was unfair. He would approach me at the till and yelled at me numerous times. When a customer verbally and physically abused me I was the one who got into trouble and was told the customer is always right. Always wanted to work at Wal-Mart but would never want to work for that company again.
good,I worked at theh Frederickburg TX Wal-Mart is was great I transferred to the Bellmead TX Wal-Mart quit after a week. It was a totally different place then where I was. My pay scale dropped as well as my title and would not find a place for me other than cashier. I was a Customer Service Manager in Fredericksburg
good,"It was an interesting experiance, and I learned a lot, at the beginning the worst part, was doing CBL's it was like taking test back in high schol. The great thing about being an employee at wal-mart were all the benefits and the felxible work hours."
good,"A typical day at work was putting out new merchandise, while cleaning up the department given, assisting customers. Afterwards would be to work the fitting room, answering the phone directing calls to the right department, maintaining the fitting room, keeping track of customers and clothes. I definitely learned how to juggle a few tasks at the same time while staying composed. The most enjoyable part of the day was meeting all types of people and helping them."
good,muy buena empresa reconocida a nivel mundial que se interesa por la calidad de vida de sus trabajadores
good,"the most part of my job is working with people, a typical day as you call it would be inventory dealing with customers and working with the cashier. My co- workers are really fun people to be around im almost never borde."
good,"Start off the night with a quick team meeting, then we are given our areas where are working and we stock those areas. Basically what I have learned is how to multi-task more efficiently and how to maintain and clean up after a busy day dealing with customers. The management team in my opinion isn't nessessarly the most effective team I have worked with from previous employers, because I am usually 2 to 3 steps ahead of them through the night, but they do try and make an effort to accomadate the needs of the associate. My co-workers on a good night we are a very effective group, however on some nights our team seems to not work on the same page and put the effort. The hardest part of my job at this point is trying to adjust myself back to working overnights after being off 6 months due to injury. the other hardest part to my job is trying to adjust from working different areas in the same night. The most enjoyable part about my job is the fact I am working different people constantly."
good,daily functions where to unload trucks put away product that comes in
good,"Input prescriptions, put up drugs. Interacting with customers, filling prescriptions"
good,"When entering the Bakery you first must grab a hair net and place it on your head, make sure you cover all of your hair then you put on an apron and proceed to enter in the bakery. Wash your hands first then ask fellow associates what needs to be done or if you see something right off the bat you just take action and do it, you basically use common sense and knowledge to save you time on any projects that might hold you up on time later on in the day. Then when the baker is done baking and everyone goes home its your responsibility to make sure all freight was worked and brought into the bakery from the freezers, if any dishes are left behind make sure you wash them, sweep and mop floors, listen for customers in case they want to order a cake, use your friendliest customer service skills, if you see a customer within ten feet from you it is your responsibility to ask them ""Are you finding everything alright."" Make sure everything is ready to go for the next day."
good,Follow company daily routine to keep the customer happy and make sales for the company. Learned from Management to make increase in sales for the company while keeping in stocks merchandise for customer. Wal-Mart associates work together and help each other to keep the business running smooth. The hardest part of the job is making mistake that effect the business. the best part of the job is working with your co-workers.
good,The team at Wal-Mart wasn't too bad to work with. I have learned a lot of new things throughout the years I've worked there. Everyone gets along pretty well. We all tend to work as a team and help one another out if we see that one is struggling or has more freight than others. We come as one to get the work done and get the store ready for the customers. Management isn't too bad but sometimes the employees know what to do or expected than an member of management. It's crazy but that's how it is. What I've liked about working for Wal-Mart is the different people you meet or get to work.
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work. Great advancement opportunities. Very FAST paced on most week days. Management team is okay the just need to be on the same page and communicate with each other a little more. Job is very easy, but demanding for the amount of pay. The best part of the job is meeting different people from all aspects of life and having a job!"
good,Company is average. Nothing too major to say about this job.
good,"Learning how to use the Telxon guns, and doing price changes, checking for shrink, learning the Profit and Loss monthy reports, ect. Typical day consists of 7.5 hours, 5 days a week. "
good,"A typical day for me right now is a bit different than all the experience that i have."
good,"It was a nice breezy day and not to busy."
good,"I enjoying working at Walmart because its fast paced. My co-workers are nice and i get along with them very well. There's not really anything hard about my job but i can say some customers are just was to much. Some are loud and rude, but then you get those nice, sweet and really talkative ones."
good,"walmart é uma empresa de grande porte onde cobra muito aos funcionários mais não dar assistência de reconhecimento de todos funcionários é muito trabalho para poucas pessoas, onde muitos funcionários era obrigado a fazer desvio de função sem necessidade."
good,The best thing about working for WalMart is the constant interaction you have with customers and co-workers.
good,"foi um bom aprendizado com pessoas que tinham paciencia e vontade de ensinar axei que seria difícil mas foi bem fácil,os gerentes eram muito bons para todos nós se pedisemos ou precisasemos de algo eles sempre davam um jeito de resolver a situaçao,os colegas eram como irmaos sempre nos apoiando."
good,"Boa possibilidade de crescimento, porém algumas desorganizações no andamento do trabalho."
good,We work towards everyone knowing all the jobs in store so they may work when someone calls out. At this time we are not there but working  it.
good,I worked in a warehouse it was very hot and fast paced. Trucks were always in and out sometimes more than 3 at a time. Everyone worked together to make it as easy as possible.
good,I have learned a lot about how retail is done from top to bottom. The management and co-workers are easy to get along with and will help when needed. The hardest part of my job is having too many tasks and too little time to complete. The most enjoyable part is the friendly environment.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me clocking in on time and heading to the registers to clean up my area. I then started ringing up  customers if there were any. If there were no customers, I would stock the impulse merchandise shelves and help with other departments if they needed it. I often moved over to the money center to learn how to sell money orders and grams."
good,Started out as a great company who emphasized employee appreciation but the company it is today is on the opposite end of that spectrum.
good,"Experiencia muito agradável , consegui me dar melhor com organizações e comportamentos de colegas de trabalho que algumas são de boa companhia outras não , não existia partes difíceis no trabalho e também não muito agradáveis ."
good,"stock shelves, not a lot of new hires=more work on currently employed."
good,I loved talking with customer and helping them find difference items in the store. Or just saying hello with a smile makes all the difference in the world.
good,"Most coworkers were great.  You learn a lot about dealing with the public.  Not always an easy job, but one you learn to do. I loved meeting so many people."
good,"*Operating a department of 5 day and 2 nightshift colleagues."
good,Good job to start off to get you where you need to go next. great temporary job.
good,They want every employee to work hard but they dont want to pay the right amount.
good,"•	Trained sales associates to implement merchandising and visual strategies to support company wide, on floor programs."
good,"typical cashier job, some managers were cool others not so much. respectful of personal family emergency's."
good,"In some ways I really liked working at walmart, but more so because of the other people who worked there, but other than that, it was a hectic day at work everyday. You had to pull more than your load, and it was very unfair sometimes. It wasn't worth the money, you did more work that you got paid for. It was too much sometimes."
good,"Un Día de trabajo normal en Wal Mart es dedicarse a la atención del cliente y al llenado de las góndolas para que en todo momentos se esté vendiendo."
good,"Daily targets were to be met for which advance planning is needed.Stock planning,Appointment schedules,Proper coordination with Buyers and Merchandisers to be done."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work. This company has great benefits, you learn the good and bad of retail pharmacy, and you learn a lot about the medications that you work with on a daily basis."
good,"half the time i enjoyed walmart. but there was a few people during my stretch that i found wanting for lack of a better word, in management.the higher ups don't know what in the world they are doing. they look at pretty diagrams and think it will work out perfectly. and less then one percent of the time does it. i'm just thankful i had a few great managers thrown in."
good,Maintained and organized store carts inside store and in parking lot.  Assisted customers with groceries and other merchandise.  Maintained restrooms and outside of store.  Performed other miscellaneous duties as assigned by supervisor.
good,"I made good money there, overall good management. good benefits, I learned to drive lots of different fork lifts. I enjoyed working in the office. the hardest part of my job was going back and forth between my fork lift job an my office job and still making production."
good,There is no such thing as a work/life balance at walmart unless you are a salaried member of management. The hours are sporadic at best and it's almost impossible to become full time. The company seems to have little regard for the employees.
good,helping out the staff being there  working with other associate to complete tasks and zone up area
good,"management is not that good, salary is not that good. they work you hard but they don't give you any appriciation."
good,I typically made sure all carts were filled in the corrals for customer satisfaction. I learned how to greet customers and typical cart pushing duties. Management was fair and stern. My co workers were very good at teamwork. Hardest part of the job was collecting carts on very busy days when there was high volumes of customers. The enjoyable part was leisure time
good,"Most nights were fairly uneventful, consisting of stocking various departments throughout the store.  I'd not worked directly with a customer-base before, and found helping people find what they were looking for or redirecting them to where they could if the store didn't have what they needed incredibly gratifying.  Management was fairly hands-off, trusting that employees knew what they needed to do and letting them take care of business as needed as the night continued, only stepping in as needed or to provide general checkups on the goings-on in the store.  The job itself was fairly simple, but as with anything that didn't hold true all the time, and there were occasional mixes with where employees were working every night, and working in an area that was unfamiliar or that was filled with products I had no personal use for and still fulfilling my obligations to excellent service made it difficult to answer questions that were asked, at least until I had sought out and asked them of someone more knowledgeable."
good,A typical day at walmart is very busy. There are customers that comes in and out throughout the day expecting great customers service. I learned how to be a leader at walmart. I was manger over the deli area and trained most of the employees there. There were times where my co-workers were very annoying but luckily I have self control and can be very mature about situations. The hardest part of my job was being able to get adjusted to working overnights. The most enjoyable part was lunch time. During that time my co-workers and I got a chance to bond and just relax for a whole hour.
good,chegava 10 minutos antes pra poder organiza o caixa limpa pegava abertura do caixa que era de 30 reias passava as mercadoria contava  por ser atacado .pagamento e recebimentos de contas falava com todos na reunião de piso com estava as situação de atacadista .a parte mais chata e constrangedora era muita cobrança em cimas das operadora tudo era responsabilidade das operadora  a parte mais agradável era de alguns cliente que compredia  a nossa situação quando acontecia algumas coisa
good,"Muita possibilidade de aprendizado e crescimento, ótimas oportunidades e benefícios. Carga horária exceciva."
good,"Aprendi el manejo de una empresa multinacional y con una estructura generosa en la parte administrativa."
good,come in have our nightly meeting get to work to be honest I was a stocker and I really didn't learn anything management was so so working overnight was the hardest because I also went to school at night
good,"stressful management. liked my job, would like days better. Liked my co workers"
good,"work freight that wasn't done from the night before. still have to get notes that were handed out by managers, walk areas, do orders, make sure exceptions are getting done. straighten shelves, set modular (as needed), plan the next days freight, and maintain customer service."
good,"empresa muito boa para trabalhar, oportunidades de experiência, oportunidade de promoção, serviço muito gratificante, problema é que não tem vida social, jornada de trabalho muito extensa, muitas horas extras"
good,"Its a very demanding job, expected to do more with less on a daily basis and often resources are taken away from you. Some days it can be fun others just stressful and you feel like you will never succeed."
good,"era uma empresa agradável de trabalhar,boms colegas muito diálogo com meus patrões,não tinha a parte difícil,e a mais agradável era o atendimento com os clientes."
good,"As an employee at WalMart you meet people from all walks of life on a daily basis. I am a very outgoing & personable person, meeting & helping new people is something I enjoy doing. Whether I was cashing-out customers, or assisting them to find products, I can say I enjoyed the experience. My managers at #5497 were very helpful with questions that I had, & were not hesitant to teach in a hands-on manner."
good,Knowing I was helping my customers find the best jewelry for a family or friend  was wonderful.
good,"You can feel comfortable working everyday"
good,I enjoyed serving the customers. The managers did not know the proper way to talk to the employees. Most of the coworkers were easy to work with. It was an experience I'll never forget.
good,"I like my job, on a good day we have everything done everyone's happy we share a lot of laughs and enjoy helping others. As of late, the typical day has been rooted in stress. Being in a place of management it is our responsibility to ensure every task gets done. Before our recent change in management, doing so was no problem, but lately we have had to deal with under staffing, dysfunctional equipment, and a lack of acknowledgment to issues brought before higher management. "
good,"- Great co-workers"
good,You can work at Wal-Mart and start off being seasonal help and work your way up making 6 figure plus!!  Excellent opportunity for people who want to advance and don't have the education.  Get ready to work hard though!
good,no matter the good or rough days there it's still a good place to work.
good,co workers are nice the hardest part of the job is to know you are not ging to make a lot of money
good,There was no typical day.  I worked with a market team to help overall profitability.
good,"A typical day at work would be standing on your feet for 8hrs helping customer check out with all their purchases. Making small talk, asking them if they need anything. Maintaining the cleanliness of my area."
good,"employees really seem to get along with each other, really haven't learned anything new there. 30 years in management previously had seen it all"
good,This job is good if you just starting or if you are looking for the job as a stepping stone in to something else. To much stress for the little pay.
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. They are all about satisfying their customers.
good,Management and Coworkers were fine. Although being treated like you were dirt by the Guests was intolerable.
good,They have changed over the years.really. what can i say. i did not like working there.
good,"ok place to work, very physical job, strong management team"
good,"Um dia tipico de trabalho e fazer sua rotina diaria, e tentar ajudar a outro associado quando necessario, assim aprendemos com pessoas, e aprendemos em outros setores e outras funções. Procurar interagir com gerentes, diretores expressando suas opiniões procurando criar idéias de trabalho de acordo com a politica da empresa."
good,"I held many different positions while employed with Walmart. While I worked part-time on the day shift, I was a Sales Associate in the Health and Beauty department and my daily tasks included customer service, working small amounts of freight (old and new), creating displays, small efforts in inventory management, and occasionally helping the front end by operating a cash register as needed. Walmart was very understanding of my school schedule at the time and management was generally pleasant. I learned the basics of the Walmart Inventory Management hand-held device, the details of customer service, and a lot of product placement and display technique. The hardest part of my job on the day shift was balancing the work that needed to be done with customer needs. The holidays bring a lot of business and subsequent stress. However, the most joy was brought on by the rare customers that were truly grateful for my help. "
good,I use to do the Receiving every morning and got to learn a lot on how to work the computers input and fun place to work
good,"Como se trabaja con clientes es difícil no sufrir de strees , a pesar de eso siempre disponible y al servicio de los mismos"
good,"Learned how to handle disgruntled customers, effectively diffuse tense situations, and handle and work through tremendous amounts of pressure"
good,The job was physically demanding but not too strenuous. Little supervision able to complete assignment on time and meet production 90/% of the time.
good,"I would work the registers mostly, but have found they would often have me work in many other departments as well.  It was never easy working with customers, but in the end I enjoyed helping them the best I could."
good,"Certain areas work wonders with your school schedule. Some work areas are stressful and management is non-coopertive. Depending on your job title you have supervisors that you can get along with and others just simply seem that they don't want to be at work everyday, and push you to the limits. This store always has too many chiefs and very little indians. You can get many directions from different level managers and everyone wants everything done and at the same time. Sometimes it can be the most hated workplace to be at, but then you have your co-workers, and department managers that can make a difference and actually lets you enjoy your work enviroment."
good,"muitas amizades,prazer em ajudar as pessoas,aprendi a trabalhar com o publico,a ter mais paciência."
good,"Responsible for ensuring great customer service by greeting and assisting customers with the locating a particular item or pricing. Provided directions towards my fellow employees, completing performance assessments, providing constructive feedback and resolving tensions"
good,"Down-stack pallets and separate them by section, I also took the boxes that I lifted and baled them in the box baler, if there was a spill I would make sure someone else saw and assisted me. Management was friendly and always knew where to get more work done, I also  scanned overstock items in and stored them in the cooler."
good,I really enjoyed working with the customers and meeting new people. typically i would start my day out by getting my register organised and to the way i wanted it. the management definitely could have been better. there where times when we needed change and couldnt move on in our lines without it and the cs would take up to 20 min. the hardest part of my job was not walking away from my register and finding my supervisors.
good,"This was where I was trained for cash, I have learned a lot on cash and was happy to work for the company... The Management was good had no problems with them.... The co-workers were good if needed helped they would help out... the hard part of the job was to keep up with the paste.... The customers always making sure they were happy..."
good,"No day at work is the same. There are always new things to learn at work. Working in the pharmacy is different then working in the store. In the pharmacy, you have to trust and have confidence that everyone can do their job. We become a team and everyone works well with each other. The hardest part of the job is when your patients are not satisfied with your work due to something out of your control, for example their insurance copay is high. The most enjoyable part of work is making our patients happy, talking to them one on one about their medications, and developing trust/relationships."
good,"Un día típico llegar revisar si hay correo nuevos y darle solución y  seguimiento  a lo largo del día , y comentarle a mi gerente lo que quedaba pendiente y por que, supervisar registros de temperatura y balance de antibióticos y controlados, dar seguimientos a registro de tiempo de los asociados, supervisar el surtido y abasto de medicamentos, etc."
good,"Lots of work, not a lot of time given to complete the jobs especially during holiday season.  We were always short staffed and people aren't generally fond of helping out, unloading a truck is not an easy task.  Hardest part of the job was keeping the line moving seeing as it never stopped, pulling pallets poorly stacked that fell."
good,"i really loved working with this company because i love heavy lifting and driving the trucks, but it gets slow in winter time.."
good,Wal-Mart is an awesome company I just want to be in a better field that makes more money and be involved in company that appreciates my hard work and dedication.
good,It was good at wal mart because i love to meet new people and there you met people everyday. Things i will need at home i didnt have to go anywhere because it was right there.
good,"Management issues meaning constantly changing policy's making it difficult to keep track of current policy's and changing perfectly good warehousing setups and royally messing it up and expecting you to maintain production standards without researching what the change could do to your production also tend to get lazy and not update things such as labels or taking down old ones. unfortunately another downside they tend to instantly write you up even if you ask for a bandage for a simple scratch, and reporting accidents."
good,"I began working at the Wal-Mart store 5954 since it opened late 2012. I'm a cashier so my routine is pretty basic provide great customer service, speedy checkouts, balance drawer, and sell credit card applications. I talked to many of the co-workers and managers and later started hanging out with them outside of work then I realized everyone has been hanging out with each other for a while so I was kinda late to join the party. When promotions came around they promoted off of who was there favorite rather who's the best fit, and because of this strong favoritism the people that are well liked feel like they don't have to do work. I think the hardest part of working here is not getting recognized for your hard work or your skill but rather who you know. The best thing about working here is the people you meet like the co-workers, managers, and customers."
good,"Stocking, frying, baking, assisting customers. I learned how to give great customer service and how to be part of a team. Management was decent, took a while to address issues. Coworkers were fun and friendly. Felt like a family more than a business. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the unruly customers who, for whatever reason, could not see that you're an american and not ""from somewhere else."" The most enjoyable part was the fast pace and bond that you develop with the people around you."
good,"Clock in. Go straight to unloading the truck(s). sort all new inventory for each department. Unload and Sort all grocery items. Take 45 min. lunch. Take all new inventory to the floor to be stocked. Scan bins to see which department are in need of items that are low on the shelves. "
good,You never know what to expect from the customers. Because I have seen a lot in the past few years
good,I learned how to fill out federal documents to sell firearms and different kinds of permits. The hardest part of the job was trying to put up all the freight that came in no matter how many trucks or how much freight that came in plus giving each customer the proper customer service they deserved. The most enjoyable was when the whole shift pulled together and everything was accomplished against what seemed like all odds.
good,"I was Hired on as a Temporary position in the photo lab, after two days of being on the floor and in my position they had told me about another position in the toys department and that i would be getting 40  hours a week for only two weeks and it had started at 5 a.m. and ended at 2 p.m. I had grown to like that position but hated the hours. I made two friends while working in the toys department and my department head, we really just tolerated each other more than anything. It was a relatively easy job compared to the photo lab. When the two weeks were up I had gone back to the photo lab and was glad to have later hours but not as many (the only down fall). When i would get to work i worked with 4 other girls and occasionally a supervisor if we got really busy. It was an easy position as well but i never got the chance to learn how to put the canvas' together and every time i would  ask there would always be an excuse why i couldn't. I knew how to put the mounted photos together but same excuses. The most enjoyable part of my day would be helping the customers with the kiosks, looking at the photos, and informing them about the cameras. Toward the last week of my employment i was noticing a lot of positions opening but they never got filled. I wouldn't want to work for this Walmart again; all because they had ignorant supervisors."
good,walmart was fun happy nenviroment that i had the honer to work for i was there for some time
good,"I learned a lot working with Walmart. Remodeling, Cashiering, Sales, Stocking, Phone operating, Price Changing,and Bin audit. And i have work with some great people."
good,i loved what i was doing but some of the management where very sexist and rude to the employees.
good,"the work is fine, a bit of hard labor but fine"
good,This Walmart is fairly new so it can use some work. I started off enjoying this job. I was one of the dedicated employees.
good,"My job is very demanding, I take pride in my job and do very well at it, Im always learning new things I have very good co workers and managers"
good,"from this job i learned about customer thats about it. A typical day at work consisted of a lot of work and juggling task, it was kind of like management wasnt sure of what task was supposed to be done by certain employees. It was a learning experience."
good,Working with customers was great helping them with there needs and wants. working with my co-workers was great. I learned what it took to make a customer happy.
good,"Walmart is a very good company to work for , with great potentials for anyone. I was a department manager that worked in most of the stores departments, with stocking, shipping and receiving, great computer skills daily maintaing great sales and inventories, also performed schedules and training associates on all customer service."
good,"Walmart is an ""okay"" company...it just has a bit of favoritsm"
good,I enjoyed working there...great management and coworkers.
good,"They were really great with my school schedule, and I grew to love the people I work with. It is time for me to do something that i will love to do."
good,It's okay to work here if you already have another job. You don't get you're breaks or lunch on time. Management are horrible at making out the schedules.
good,"The structure is solid. Management is on rotations and encourage you to work faster. People that cannot keep pace overnight are cut where people who succeed are rewarded with permanent positions. "
good,Had to bring money in for the summer so it was honestly just a pocket change job. I feel like this Wal-Mart is more of a place for older people.
good,"Arrive at work and set lunch in ref. Have group meeting to find out your location for the night"
good,"Clock in, genuinely greet my coworkers and start my shift, I learned patients and gratitude. My co-workers are funny and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job is pleasing every customer.The most enjoyable part of my job ..is seeing customers satisfied from great customer service."
good,a typical day at work there where no typical everyday was a challenge
good,Open minded place to work. Very enjoyable co workers and nice atmosphere
good,"work day woukd be reviewing and working price changes and putting freight on  sales floor and work customer service, learned how to supervise and prioritize, Management would help co-workers all worked as a team the hardest part were sometimes not enough time to be able to get everything completed or when we would be short handed help and the enjoyable part was meeting great customers and making good friends"
good,great place to work if your looking for part time hours full time is near impossible.
good,The job is an okay job.  I wasn't pleased because they have you working way harder than you get paid.
good,High stress position that had plenty of rewards for a job well done. People are fun and work hard. There is typically good communication from the top down to the associates. Continuous improvement is difficult for a building as old as it is.
good,you get the chance to learn many different things an also advance your career here.
good,"A typical day at Walmart would consist of me and my colleagues doing our job to the best of our ability, but much times going unappreciated. They don't give raises based on work efficiency, but rather just the time of being at the company. We were overworked compared to the pay rate they gave out. Hardest part of the job was unloading the truck with few amount of people."
good,"Walmart is an amazing place to work. Meeting new people and customers. But over all work space, Management is horrible. Pay is awful. And the benefits you dont get unless your full time and work for one year. So part time miss out."
good,make sure all items are stocked in need of better pay and more hours
good,I had to come in speak o the second shift management team to find out all the ins and outs of the day and make sure that all breaks and lunches were on time and that the cashiers were covered. Count all money held in the podium and make sure it was all accounted for. Then I had to make sure my cashiers on my shift were doing all the duties they were responsible for. My co-workers were very helpful and  diligent in there duties. The hardest part of my job was stocking shelves when necessary the most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with all the different customers that came in the store
good,"Walmart had low pay but it was above minimum, I only worked 32 hrs a week so no benefits."
good,I enjoyed the people that I got to be around each day. I learn how to work as a team and to let the small stuff go. The management however was not to my liking.
good,"Walmart is an OK place to work. Depending on the job there is and can be alot to learn with very little time.I'v always enjoyed the people I work with at Walmart, I'v made great friends and still are making some. "
good,"I was very happy to work for Walmart.  I didn't think I'd ever leave.  Taking over the garden shop duties was challenging but I really liked it.  However, it's not a one person job and there was no back up provided."
good,"I was a female cart pusher for Walmart in the summer, which was not my ideal job, but it was something. There's really no learning in cart pushing, it is hard work especially doing it on m own most days. There was also no electric cart pusher thing to help, and it was really hot most days. Managers were cool, but needs improvement in a lot of areas. Co-workers were lazy and I was left doing everything all by myself most times."
good,"A typical day was having about 10-50 customers, maybe more, come through my line and I checked them out and completed whatever transaction that was given to me. I learned a lot about customer service then and how much a customer means. Both for the company and personally as a cashier. My main goal was to make every customer I had come through my line very satisfied and wanting to come back. The management was great. Always courteous and always willing to listen to the employees whether it be an Idea and our if they had some sort of situation. Very understanding and compassionate. I always got along with my co-workers. Ever since day one when I started working there they were like a second family to me. After learning everything I needed to for my position there was not really anything too difficult in the job, I just enjoyed every minute of it that I was there and to see a customer leave with a smiling face."
good,"Leave your personal life at the door."
good,Worked with some great people while maintaining that the customer comes first attitude.
good,"I enjoyed working at working with the employee's as well as deputies at Walmart. However, do to me making an arrest pass my 5th hour, I was let go."
good,"I started as a night stocker and ended as an Instock Supervisor on the second shift from 4pm until 2am.In between I was a Support Manager for their Tire and Lube Express and became Bay Supervisor as well."
good,"Lo que mas me gustaba del empleo es que cada día aprendes por la tecnología que innovadora en las cámaras, videocámaras y mostrarle al cliente cual puede ser su mejor opción de compra"
good,its a good job but it would have been better if it was more organize and better communication. if it had those to working there would have been alot better for me and other workers
good,boa mais nao me fez subir no cargo entao resolve sair mais e uma boa empresa para trabalhar me ensinou muito e veez m qque tudo mudasse todos foram bons comigo.
good,"I learned to effectively delegate tasks, oversee all front end operations, and ensure that other employees recieved breaks and relief at the scheduled time. I enjoyed working with my coworkers as a team. The hardest part of the job was during busy store hours and not having enough staff to cover all departments."
good,"Problem solving, merchandising, operational procedures, people management, and customer service are daily expectations. Attention to detail, setting expectations, and accountability are also part of the daily routine. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with customers and provide excellent customer service."
good,long quiet nights that I enjoy the managers where great the atmosphere was nice
good,"Responsible for ensuring staff is selected, utilized, and appraised in accordance with company guidelines and job specifications, and takes corrective action as necessary"
good,Management is fair and fun to work with. The people are friendly and the time you get to spend at home with family is amazing.
good,"Gerenciava 70 lojas em Pernambuco, na área  de Recursos Humanos, foi de grande aprendizagem para mim, pois tive oportunidade de implantar um projeto de capital humano na organização com fins de conter as demandas trabalhistas."
good,Walmart is a good starter job. They do not hire full time anymore and the pay is just above minimum wage.
good,"A typical work day at walmart depends on the area in which you are hired for. Theres the floor associates who zone, unload trucks, stock shelves, assist customers, and pretty much have a designated area they are responsible for but can be pulled wherever they are needed. Cashiers are in a way an area all in theyr own, they rotate from register to register and can be pulled onto the floor for extra help. Then theres the pharmacy, vision center, wireless, photo lab and TLE. Each area has a set list of notes they are responsible for completing each day while providing excellent customer service. I've learned patience, time management, customer service, problem solving and much much more from the years I've been with the company. Depending on the day and time of year can reflect of co-workers, for the most part we're all here for the same reason and everyone seems to work well together in order to make each day an enjoyable work enviornment. Our store inparticularly seems to be able to improve in the management area. There are great managers that are eager to help and do everything they can to provide help but others sometimes seem to just do the bare minimum to keep they'r title. The hardest part of the job is not letting the little things get to you, everyone has bad days whether its you the customer or a co-worker. The most enjoyable part of the job is when an individual is recognized for the hard work he or she has accomplished."
good,Not as bad as everyone claims it to be. The crew I worked with was great and the benefits were great.
good,"touring store with associates. "
good,"I have learned how to handle large quantities of product to maintain inventory integrity.  However, advancement is not as easy as most think."
good,"if they would get back to the principles they were founded on they would be a fantastic company again. There is great opportunity for advancement for those who want it.. However, it lacks a solid training foundation, consistency and realistic expectations."
good,"Cut meat "
good,Walmart was a learning experience for to work for a largest company in the world in fact the staffed was great and learn how walmart came to be a great place to shop.
good,"I recently started at Walmart Logisitics and can tell they are really tryin to make a positive culture change.  Safety is just as important than production, which is a geat thing.  The culture has a long way to go to becom more diverse, but leaders are making the right moves."
good,"overall, a good company to work for. I would not have gotten as far as I have if not for the training I received over the years. Hours could be long at times, but a lot was accomplished. Good associates throughout the stores."
good,"Work was a adventure every day because you had no clue what was in store until you got there. Lots of things happen such as call offs or associates who leave early. Adjusting to the new work task ahead while being left short-handed and accomplishing all assignments store wide> . I learned to communicate well with customers and associates. Management for the most part were all good people. Co-workers were great to work with and most are great people. the hardest part of the job was adjusting to the lack of staff and still trying to get the work done on time,"
good,In my 4 years at Walmart I found it to be a good place to work.  the benefits were terrible but the pay wasn't that bad. The only problem with the Walmart store I worked at was the management.
good,"Came in made sure stock was put away, took care of customers. Management was never on the same page."
good,"I started out as a cashier, but if you work hard, it doesn't go unnoticed.  I've held various positions in the 11 years that I was employed there.  I've worked as a cashier,an unloader, a stocker, in the cash office.  I've also worked in the meat, deli and dairy departments.  I left because of a career change."
good,"Fast and friendly. Friendly managers and coworkers ,clean area"
good,"They work you where ever they can put you even if you dont have the training. Keep you on your toes, and fast paced."
good,I have enjoyed working with my co-workers.  I have also learned many skills from both my colleagues and management.  The hardest part of the job is maintaining the store in a neat and orderly fashion. I do like interacting with people so that part of the job is enjoyable.
good,A typical day at work for the ics crew was to come in and set out pallets and prepare to unload the trucks. unload the trucks and organize all of the freight by aisle then haul all of the freight out onto the consumer floor for the overnight stockers to put up. When you got through with your part of the job you would go out and help everyone finish their jobs until it was time to get off work after cleaning up your area. The management staff wasn't the best but they kept most everyone doing their jobs. Your co-workers were pretty much a gamble. Some would be good and some would be bad. The management wern't very picky about who they hired.
good,"A typical workday consisted of unpacking items, loading them on a pallet and bringing it to the backroom by a certain time. While the experience was wonderful, management could use some work in professionalism and how to keep their employees in line. While some co-workers were fun to work with, other had a childish nature. The job was pretty much easy. Lack of supervision and a lot of brown nosing. The best part about working at Walmart is that the pay was great and you come across some very interesting characters late at night. In short, it wasn't an entirely bad experience and I have taken a lot from my time there."
good,A typical day at work consisted of working with people that for the most part did as little as possible to get the job done and finally getting tired of it and looking for a new job.
good,"Great customers, would be better management if the managers cared about the employees more. Co workers were average. Always doing something not just standing around."
good,"Working at Walmart was a wonderful experience, it truly taught me the value of customer satisfaction, integrity, team work, and hard work."
good,"Management meetings"
good,Good job and good company. I enjoyed the management and my fellow employees. The reason I left was third shift
good,"Walmarts is a very productive business,work goes on round the clock to be ready for their customers. Early mornings were slow than gradually picked up business in mid-mornings. There were some customers that came in on regular basis, I usually knew what they wanted on particular days of shopping. "
good,i enjoyed every day because i was always doing something different at my own pace....my co-workers were excellent to say the least....and the customers as well..management was to say the least a pleasure to work for...the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers that just hate the world...and theres no recipe for that
good,Typical day starts off by loading and unloading stock from the store. It is then my responsibility to check all the necessary merchandise in the store so that it can be put out on the shopping floors.
good,"A typical day at work was stocking merchandise, working with many people, running the fitting rooms. Management was very nice and was willing to help when they could."
good,"-The most I enjoy most about working at Wal-Mart is the friendship that are created"
good,I like the people I work with and the job is easy. The pay isn't that great.
good,"i really enjoyed working at walmart, serving the customers, & meeting lots of new people."
good,"A typical day at work these days is all about times, management rushing you to get things in the amount of time that a computer prints out. All the workers having a good judgement of why the times do not match the amount of frieght, but the management sometimes do not care about our jugdements. The Hardest part about the job is pleasing management; no matter how much we get done they still want more done, which is hard to do on Five out the seven days of the week because the lack of workers, which 90 percent are partime and only ten percent are fulltime. Their dream is to have all their workers partime, which will reduce their payments for full time workers benefites.The most enjoyable part of the job is having two 15 minutes breaks and a hour lunch and then going home. Also i like all my coworkers even though we have our ups and downs at times."
good,"A typical day at work we would pick and merchandise for cutomers, and for the sales floor. I learned the concept of inventory. The management for the most part did their jobs. At times they did not do their jobs, which made it difficult for the team members to fulfill their duties. I loved the working environment with my co workers. The hardest part of the job was the fact that no one was ever on the same page. The most enjoyable part was when we worked as a team."
good,"A typical day, for me, at Asda would start at 6.00 a.m. It would, firstly involve, liaising with the night shift team for a handover followed by a review of the previous day's store performance to identify, assess and improve areas that have scored below the company target. Necessary steps would include delegating to fellow process and shop floor colleagues tasks such as price changes, reductions and creation of visually appealing displays."
good,"I worked here as a stocker first and then went to running a register and working in customer service sometimes. This is a pretty good place to work ,pay is ok and benefits aren't bad."
good,"It was fun at times,stressful in some areas  Another typical day of your work.We helped each other."
good,"I was fortunate to work in an area of the store that was fun, productive and challenging.  Our customers became known to us and some became friends.  The vast majority of store management did not know our job and therefore left us alone to do it....a real bonus!!!"
good,"restocked shelves helped shopping customers helped dept. when needed learned numerous things about the company, co-workers were great got along well with"
good,Overall walmart is a great place to work having smiling face to greet you everyday. Management was ok they was around enough to help out though some problems. The co workers was great to work with an willing to step in if you had a hard time at work. I like meeting new people and seeing new faces i didnt really have any hard moments at work.
good,"Its a great place to work amazing people such a friendly environment "
good,Fast paced stressful job.  Company does have good core values despite what others have stated.  Their culture is for their associates and customers.  Its a plus to be able to work with such a diverse company.
good,"I enjoyed my job and it was very rewarding helping people to see.  I liked being a manager and teaching my employees.  I devoted my life to this job. I learned to be patient and take care of my patients/customers.  It was really great to work with the people that I had a chance to work with and the patient/customers that I met.  The hardest part of the job was the difficult patients.  A typical day at work would start off with manager paperwork and checking inventory.  Then, getting ready for the Dr. and patients to arrive. Next, would be selling, repairing, and adjustments. The last, would be settling Dr. money for the day, filing, cleaning, and getting ready for tomorrow while waiting on customer/patients until closing."
good,"They had great core values and history "
good,"My typical day at work consisted of me unloading freight off of trucks and taking inventory of everything. I learned how to use a Gemini and the SMART system to keep track of the stores inventory. Management was overall good, but they had a tendency to overreact about small problems when they were under pressure about different things. My co-workers really were the best part about the job, because it really was like a group of close friends."
good,"delegating responsiblities to employees"
good,"Aprendi que temos que somar como equipe,que um só é mais difícil,que devo sempre tomar a frente,a respeitar cada um com suas diferenças,a empresa é uma só,somos um só,não deixar para amanhã o que posso fazer hoje,regra dos 3 metros ( olhar nos olhos e cumprimentar, :) , não posso fazer tudo por ser um,mais mesmo sendo um consigo fazer algo,e farei,a empresa é minha segunda casa,pois passo mais tempo nela do que em casa,a saber separar amizade do trabalho.etc. A Parte mais difícil é que uns não fazem nada e você tem que se virar em dez,porém creio que toda empresa é assim,e meu gerente sempre me disse que eu iria conseguir e fato sempre dou conta."
good,"At walmart i worked in the deli department. I had to use the meat and cheese slicer machine, stock the sales floor, place merchandise orders, was in charge of doing the department resets, and worked in receiving for my department. My coworkers were reliable and easy to get along with. The management team was good overall. The hardest part of the job was working in the coolers and freezers for several hours at a time and having to be at work at 4am everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and meeting with new people all the time."
good,"As a cashier you have a tedious job. That was the only downfall. It was an easy job but doing the same thing 8 hours a day got old. Most of the time I ran out of change and it took 15 minutes for someone to bring me some more (and as a cashier, that is a long time). Sometimes customers were just rude and that could ruin anyones day. They were very nice when I called in sick for work though."
good,this place was a  fast  placed enivorment but  being a greeter  just wasn't  my area that I would like to  be  the hardest part was when  I got  bored
good,"Alerts, audits, counts and picks."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers.
good,"Working for this company has it's ups and downs, it's all what you make it, I enjoy working there because of all the different people that come there to shop and meet and greet, the employees is like family and fun to work with.Hardest part is working most all weekends,the most enjoyable portion is you get a chance to prove yourself as a great employee for moving up."
good,"I have been there for 3 years now, I like the job because it requires dedication in what I am doing. I like the people and the managers I work with. I have learned to stock shelves of the product needed that the store receives on the truck each night. I really like helping people and knowing that I myself does a good job each night when I am working."
good,"A typical day at work usually begins with filling scripts or inputting new scripts into the system, then going through everything that needs to be called on or fixed. What I've learned from the time that I have been there is that technicians have to make sure they get things right the first time so that the pharmacist doesn't have to fix it. My coworkers are amazing very hard workers. Most enjoyable part would be getting to know customers and having that special bond with a lot of them knowing they trust you."
good,Good job and had fun working and everyone was good to you but didn't like working later and on Sundays.
good,"A typical nights work consisted of labeling and preparing merchandise for hauling. I learned a lot of tech work, inventory analysis and management, neatness and organization, polished on my ability to work rapidly, most importantly how to operate a cherry picker (Forklift). Management taught a lot and really allowed you to develop. if you weren't on a team assignment, there was limited co-worker interaction. The most tedious part of the job was when the equipment malfunctioned and we were required to hand count thousands of products. Of course the most enjoyable was the prize give aways."
good,"Very hard physical labor for working overnights due to loading and unloading freight to put on shelves.  Management walks around all night and has nothing nice to say, but to keep telling everyone to hurry up, and it shouldn't take this long to stock."
good,Just enjoy helping a custom find the items that they were looking for in the store.
good,"I would, on a typical day, go in for my shift and begin by tidying my aisle to keep it free of clutter and debris. I'd organize my shelves and make sure they are stocked well. This job taught me that there is more to providing excellent service than just asking if ""that will be everything for today,"" or closing a sale. I learned to communicate efficiently, to product promote, every customer deserves 100% and to manage my time wisely. I would take on extra jobs, outside of my intended job specifications (i.e.- re-stocking various departments, staying extra hours voluntarily, working in different parts of the store, and working as the door greeter/ security.) Management left a lot to be desired from my superiors as they didn't always write people's schedules down correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people out and gaining that invaluable experience and various skills. I learned a lot about teamwork, communications and time management. The hardest part was getting people to agree on when to schedule me."
good,"Scheduled front end staff hours, conducted random til audits and employee interviews."
good,"A typical day at work includes: multi-tasking, following up with associates, making last-minute decisions, planning for upcoming events, controlling expenses, completing associate schedules, food safety checklists, addressing customer issues, insuring in-stock on merchandise."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is very fast paced. In this environment I have learned to efficiently use a cash register and how to deal with customers with the utmost respect.  Unfortunately, the management is very unorganized.  Some managers are always on top of things while others slack at their responsibilities and duties.  If every manager does not have the same mindset the store will continue to be in an uproar.  However, my co-workers are what makes the job way easier at times.  My personality allows me to meet numerous people and develop relationships with them with no problem. These relationships make me feel more comfortable while working at Wal-Mart.  The hardest part of the job is when you come across a problem at your register and the manager does not react fast enough.  This causes your line to back up and customers start to complain about the length of the lines in the store. However, I believe the most enjoyable part is the satisfaction of having a job."
good,"Advancement is difficult and the company strives to minimize full-time opportunities and cut work hours. Your pay is low, but your responsibilities are minimal and your job is very easy overall. Advancement is difficult even if you have a degree and are an excellent worker."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers find everything they need, to help them pick out jewelry and to check them out and make sure they found everything alright. I think the management there is kind of lacking in some areas. Because we have some managers that plays a role in not being fair. The co workers are alright at least some of them. When you are at work you love to be there but sometimes you still have to deal with people not doing right by others. The most enjoyable part is helping people and meeting new people."
good,"As an MS my day begins by checking overnight feight and staffing patterns, to lay out a plan for the day.  Give assignments as needed and begin collecting information on outs (empty merchandise).  Zoning areas for cleanliness and safety issues is constant.  Attend morning meetings for continued communication.  Assist consumable areas with daily picks and stocking.  Work freight, maintain price changes, feature management, customer assistance, and assisting other areas as needed.   My co-workers have been awesome.  Most are willing to help out whenever needed and are always there for support.  Management was at times difficult due to different managers giving different direction.  The hardest part of the job I would have to say would be continuously working short staffed.  It's frustrating for customers to have to wait long periods of time for service.  I have never worked retail before this experience.  I enjoyed learning the process and continuing to learn.  The customers begin to know you and look for your service needs."
good,"The culture of Walmart is a great one, when you are at a store that is strongly attached to the values set out by Sam Walton. You however can find stores where the culture is not as prevalent. This can be a very rewarding place to work when you are prepared to come in and actually work. Many think that retail jobs especially the lower level positions are just a place to come to to make some quick easy cash, but those who excel will get somewhere and those who aren't looking to put in the work find themselves as dispensable to the company as they have made the company in their life."
good,The co-worker was great to work with.  Enjoy working customer service and cashiers.
good,"1.Its just like working at any other shopping mall but this is more ambitious"
good,"Open store and put bags out, count your drawer. Stock candy shelves then go to register and greet customers and scan their things. Co-workers are great we all get along and enjoy what we do. The best part of the job is talking with the customers."
good,"good environment"
good,"typical day at work consists of delegation to shifts over which i bear responsibility, problem solving and prioritizing based on stores present liabilities, and co-operating with the management team to ensure productivity of store processes. i learned a lot about associate relations during my time working here, as well as how to gauge proficiencies and encourage associates to go the extra mile, and how to work more effectively under pressure. in my two and a half years working for Wal-Mart , my store has been managed by a total of 3 store managers changing almost annually, but despite this high rate of fluctuating management styles i must admit that due to the companies solid belief system it does maintain a fair amount of solidarity. however i must conclude that such high fluctuation has a lot to do with its high turn-over rate. what i enjoy most about my job is the constant challenge to improve, and adapt to the situation at hand. it has been a constant pleasure to find new ways to fulfill my duties in a constantly changing work environment and i look forward to applying these skills elsewhere. the most difficult part of my job has been keeping a high morale with associates while constantly being understaffed."
good,"Gostei muito dos dois anos que passei nesta empresa pois aprendi muito,mas teve uma hora que começaram a se meter na minha vida pessoal e eu estava me matando aos poucos pois não valorizavam meu esforço, pois quando estou trabalhando eu visto a camisa da empresa e enfio a cara no trabalho."
good,"Customer service, becoming a better team player, working hard with others and assisting. Hardest part of the job was keeping busy, finishing work early is a must for me."
good,"Hectic, short breaks, depending on your manager it could be hell."
good,You were told you were appreciated but you felt that they were just saying that because they had to.
good,"Walmart values its customers, but they need to improve in the area of pay and benefits for their employees"
good,"a typical day at work is too much work not enough people or time to complete daily tasks i always strive to get done but they make it difficult by not scheduleing the manpower to do the tasks, my coworkers i get along with but there is lots of drama i try to stay out of it do my work and thats all hardest part is pulling heavy skids i can do it but sometimes a little to heavy most enjoyable is helping people and the satisfaction when i do get my work done"
good,"Great workplace, always something to do if bored. Always learning something new."
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place if you have an interest in a part time position. Management is informed and easy to work with, it's just very difficult to get out of a part time position."
good,Walmart has introduced me to many new people and experiences.
good,Since Sam Walton has passed the company has lost sight of how to properly appreciate employees. You must start at part time with limited benefits but have opportunities for advancement. Raises are very limited and you must have open availability.
good,"Working here was not a bad job, I got to help people on a daily basis, I learned alot about managementof business, and I met lots of new and interesting people"
good,"My main job everyday is making sure merchandise is refilled on the shelf. I have to do the inventory part every morning along with price changes. I learn alot of easier way to do my work from the other department managers that been with the company for years. The management team are very busy moving around and can not assist us with the things we need them to do half the time. The people around me are very helpful. They listen to me and follow through with the information I give to them. The hardest part about my job is not having the help to work all 4 departments I have to cover, but I was in this area by myself for 6 months with no help and manage to maintain. The most enjoying part is when we as individuals can come together and accomplish one goal without giving any excuses about having other things to do. I also enjoy helping each one of the customers that comes through my area."
good,"The job itself is great. It was a job at walmart that any person would love to have. Customers are great. I have learned a lot from how to deal with problems, multitasking and how to accommodate people's concerns. The one thing that i would say that did want me to leave is  because of the management. I do not know how a company can let their employee to cuss at someone yet let it slide. The same person that also swore does not even do there job right and walks around talking to people, dumping all the work to you, Numerous people have complained already yet no action has been done about it. It really is disappointing. That is what made that job rough, its not dealing with customers or equipment but it was that coworker specifically. I know that its important to work as a team and i love to do so it really just unfortunate that one of my coworkers had to be like that."
good,a fast past  job working with different customers and different mangers everyday
good,good place to work good benfits nice work enviorment discount was horrible enjoy yourself at work if you dont have stress you will after being there
good,"Working at Wal-mart allowed me the opportunity to meet and work with a wide variety of people. The compensation was below par, but they were very flexible with my hours."
good,"llegar, cambiarse de ropa, instalarse a trabajar, repetir siemore lo mismo."
good,"Co-workers were good, and even some of my bosses had we're pretty good."
good,I enjoyed this summer job. This job helped me learn my strengths and weakness when it comes to customer. I have grew to learn more about customer service by beginning at this job and moving forward.
good,This particular Walmart was brand new when i started. Went through two store managers in two years.
good,"A typical day at Walmart would keep you busy taking care of all the customers and taking care of your department at the same time, it's a very fast paced environment which makes your day go by very fast, maybe the hardest part of the day is when it comes to  doing ""Go backs"" which means the associate has to separate all the items that do not belong in the department, it becomes a long process when you have a lot of baskets full of them, the most enjoyable part of the job is when you know you have helped someone with what they needed, sometimes they have been looking for an item and the associate is able to get it for them, it's very satisfying."
good,It was ok for like 2 weeks after that thay exhaust you completely.
good,Great associates. And most rewarding management work is hard sometimes.
good,Being a cashier at Wal-mart is great way to interact with people. I scan customers items while having a positive attitude. I started out as a people greeter about 3 years ago.  I wanted to be promoted to a cashier position after a year being a people greeter. I taught myself by watching other cashiers for about 2 months. The store manager was impressed and so he promoted me. The managers are hard on employees because they want to continue the successfulness of the store. The hardest part about working at Wal-Mart is being around negative people because I am always positive. My most enjoyable part of being a cashier is when a customer tells me they love coming through my line to checkout.
good,"Walmart is a very large corporation that has given me the opportunity to learn from and experience what its like to work in a fast paced environement. I have learned many skills ie. work a register, answer calls, backroom merchandising, special order jewelry, ear piercing, jewelry sales, and customer service. hardest part of my job having to tell people we don't have an item in stock and not being able to find it at the other stores. The most enjoyable part is when I get to talk with customers about certain items that we carry that they might enjoy and interviewing"
good,Working for them is something everyone should try.  It makes you see how it takes alot of people to keep the wheels turning.
good,"Working there is sometimes a headache, but sometimes it is also fun. The managers don't always help as much as they should, But when they do help they do so as much as possible. My co-workers are fun and funny to work with, when they work."
good,The work was good and the people were fair but as is most retail this is better seen as position to gain experience rather than a career job unless you see yourself in management.
good,It is a great place to work with benefits. I learned about different financial transactions. Customers were always the first priority. The hardest part of the job was the schedule. I constantly worked evenings and weekends. That is not fun when you have a family. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my coworkers' faces when I completed my job efficiently and did more. 
good,"great place to learn how to stock shelves over night"
good,Walmart was a great job for me because I was able to learn about many drugs and exactly what they were used for . I learned how to make compounds and bill insurance. The best part of my job was I learned something new everyday. I think the worst part of my job was most people who come to Wal-mart expect 2 minute service and thats not the way it works in a Pharmacy.
good,"Job duties were generally predictable. Employees were assigned tasks to carry out in specific priorities and adequately trained to handle designated jobs. I learned about checkout lane procedures, consumer electronics, and home garden products. Management was available on request when needed for assistance and guidance. Working with less than pleasant customers or associates was a challenge, while being in a busy or interesting work environment working with modern equipment or merchandise was stimulating."
good,"good work just not great,could have been better with more flexible scheduling of employees.they make it harder than it should be."
good,"Hard work can pay off for you in the end with a company like Wal-Mart, but all too often will you find yourself being the work horse for your team or entire shift and the management is glad to abuse you for all that you are worth. Promotion is very possible and not entirely out of reach for those who walk in off the street to become a part of the company but take into consideration the area in which the store is located because customer interaction is a mandatory part of any retail job no matter what position you are hired in as. The key to working at Wal-Mart is ask a lot of questions so you can understand the big picture while you are still down in the ditches working. Solve the problems you see coming and don't be afraid to ask questions that may be outside of your pay grade. Ask your management team what their personal background is. The best managers you will find will be the ones who worked their way up through the company as an hourly associate. Best store manager I've ever worked for started out as a cart pusher. Leave your personal life at the front door and let your pride in your work whether you are praised for it or not continue to drive you."
good,Worked well as a team unloading general merchandise and moving to appropriate sections within the store. 
good,"My typical day at Wal-Mart included meetings, reports, stocking merchandise, and helping the customers. While working there I learned that sometimes even managers need a break. My co-workers for the most part were not very enthused about working there and I feel lack motivation. The hardest part of my job was trying to figure out how to get everything done that I was responsible for and yet make the time to do the work of an associate as well because I had none. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I knew that I had helped a customer, the customer truly appreciated my help, and the the customer enjoyed their shopping experience."
good,"clock in take out skids and start stocking shelves, return empty skids and overstock to warehouse as well as the trash prep  the store for opening"
good,there was some great people i worked with the management was ok at times but not the best to work with or talk to. my typical day was receiving vendors and UPS/FEDEX and filing paperwork. the hardest part was having so many people telling you to do one thing while the others would tell you something different. the most enjoyable was the co-workers i got to work with.
good,"a typical work day consist of doing the sales floor, putting up an freight that may be deli dept. most of all assisting customers once the deli has opened. i've learned what i need to know to manage a dept or a group of people. i have also gained better customer service skills. manage at walmart is all for the customers long as the customers are happy the managers are too. my coworkers are very special co workers we work together to ensure that the job gets done. the hardest part of the job is learning to deal with the customers because walmart policy always believe that the customers are always right. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all people from different aspects of life. "
good,I enjoyed working at this company for the most part. I loved my job and what I did. 
good,"a typical day at work would be me getting placed in a room and me doing moves all night until we finished. something that i learned is how to succesfully operate a stand up forklift. The management was good from the beginning but one of the managers got transfered which left me with one that seemed to always be in a bad mood. He wouldnt get everyone fired up and ready to go when we would get there. where as to the first manager woul get everyone pumped up and started in a good mood. My coworkers all treat each other with respect and all would help one another. the hardest part of the job would have to be me learning the forklift, i struggled for the longest time but i ended up getting the hang of it and becoming good at it. The most enjoyable part of the job was how every employee would stop what they were doing just to help another employee. Everyone would help one another all the time."
good,My experience at Walmart was enjoyable. I saw new faces everyday. All of my co-workers and management were friendly and team workers.
good,"Wal mart was an alright job i would go back if i was able. Im the type of person who is not picky about a job what so ever as long as it will pay my bills and take care of home. The hardest part of working at wal mart was putting up and dealing with management they felt lke they could talk to you any kind of way and say whatever they wanted to say.I really enjoyed dealing with the customers because im a people person, fast paced worker and a fast learner "
good,"Customer/team/associate service"
good,"Wal mart is a secure company to be employed by.  There is always something to keep you busy and new people to meet.  Management can be hit-or-miss since the company is so large, you never know whether you're going to get someone who knows left from right.  The hardest part of the job is being patient with difficult customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting interesting people."
good,"Average place to work, co-workers usually friendly, management really only cares about themselves and getting a bonus"
good,"I enjoyed my position at Walmart because it gave me the opportunity to come face to face with wonderful people whom I would probably have never met otherwise. However sometimes the hours can be very demanding and benefits are few and far between, especially for a part-time associate. "
good,"3600 Rx per week"
good,provide customer service to patrons. cashiering. write work orders for vehicle service
good,"Meu trabalho era bastante dinâmico, mantinha contato direto com fornecedores e demais áreas da empresa, não existia uma rotina fixa, a cada momento surgiam novas atividades para serem efetuadas e/ou resolvidas. Gosto de funções onde me sinta útil e que faço parte do negócio e eu me sentia assim nessa empresa."
good,"lo que aprendí:  Ejecutivo de Operaciones"
good,"I loved working for walmart but due to health reasons I was forced to quit. The jobs were very hands on with plenty to keep people busy throughout the day. Before becoming sick I was being groomed to become supervisor of ICS. I learned how to receive trucks and merchandise, how to operate a walkie-stacker and electric pallet jack. The hardest part of the job was the physical labor involved. Management was easy to work for as they had clear outlines on what was expected. "
good,"Stocking shelves and coolers, providing customer support, and perhaps cashiering"
good,"precisava interagir liderança com associados pois ,tinha esse bloqueio de ambas as partes."
good,"I was very busy doing all kinds of different aspects of this store, I helped open it- put up planograms and designed domestics dept and was transfered to the toy dept for christmas time- that was fun-- i also unloaded remix trucks."
good,I loved my coworkers like family. I learned how to multi task all my duties. I learned how to communicate with management when needed. I also learned to care for every customers needs.
good,The greatest skill you will gain working at Wal-Mart is customer service.
good,Walmart is an ok place to work. There are benefits and the pay is ok but you only get a raise once a year and its judged on your evaluation. But on average its small increments so you wont see your worth in pay unless you move up in the company. You're pretty much expected to work holidays. 
good,i think Wal-Mart is a great company for may reason you can start in any position and with hard work and time become a manager its  a place where it can start as a job and end as a career i dint know i had such a great  customer service skill until i work there 
good, working at walmart miss it start your day of open your till how to be fast 
good,"At the beginning of my shift I would check which area I would be working in for the night and then restock that area. Management was great, and always helped me make sure I was doing my job correctly."
good,"A typical day at work was waiting on customers, straightening the shelves in  your lane and red lining (standing at the end of your lane and waiting for a customer). You learn to read people. The people I work with are nice and friendly, we help each other."
good,I learned how to read bar codes and labels regarding the products. I worked well with fellow team members that were working towards a team goal. The hardest part of the job was meeting the deadline to have everything stocked and cleaned before 6 a.m.
good,Management are not the most reliable. If you do have an issue they will listen but most of the time they fail to follow through.
good,"A typical day working for Wal-Mart stores includes managing monies, being courteous, helpful, flexible and efficient. I have learned that each individual customer is different and must be handled different, some come in to get out, no interaction, and some come and interact. The management is not as involved with the associates especially since the associates are on the ""front line."" The co-workers on the front end maintain a rapport and work together to ensure proper protocol is adhered to and the customer is being serviced in a timely manner with minimal conflict. The hardest part of the job is the pay, we do so much, mentally, physically, we are helpers to parents that need assistance with their children (sometimes a child is crying, yet a small conversation, some directed attention calms them, allowing the parent to perform transaction accordingly. Also the reality of life some people are not happy, and for those you must grin and bear it. The most enjoyable aspect of this job is servicing those in need, satisfying a customer who just needs an ear ( while ringing merchandise I tend to be flexible, listen and work),  and making friends (the majority of friends are more than 50 +) that are glad to have me handling their purchases."
good,"Deal with customers on a daily basis. Take care of complaints from the customers and email any problems to my manager if I can’t handle, also to keep all customers happy and diffuse potentially volatile situations, also deal with my cashiers and questions they may have, done interviews and hired people for the company, written associates upon poor performance at the work place. Provide orderly maintenance of front-end equipment and supplies. Accurately and efficiently ring up sales and accurately maintain all cash and media at the registers. Communicate customer requests to management. Maintain orderly appearance of register area and supplies stocked.  Also do any other tasks as assigned from any other manager higher then me. Resolve customer complaints."
good,"A empresa walmart foi a empresa que me deu muitas oportunidades de aprendizados,os encarregados super comprometidos com os seus funcionarios os colegas de trabalho bem dinâmicos,o que não mais me atrai na empresa que pra mim torna isso a parte mais dificil a parte salarial que não é de acordo com o que fazemos na empresa. "
good,"Wal-Mart was a fun place to work.  Sometimes the load could be overwhelming, but overall scheduling was flexible and so was management"
good,Work with great friendly people including the customers.  It was fun learning something new everyday i worked especially in the produce department. Management was always in a good mood and very excited about my work ethic.
good,"Overall Good Experince. Loved with the customers and my co-workers were fun. Management Was awesome"
good,"A good Place to work, easy advancemet. Hardest part of the job is not enough help,Management is not working as a team different managers give you different direction."
good,The place is ok to work at. It has it's up and downs but what job doesn't.
good,"in a typical day as a walmart cashier you work your butt off and hope the customers dont yell at you too many times for things you are not in control of i.e. why there are 20 checklanes and only 4 cashiers working. the management team varies like any other place, some are better than others. the hardest part is the customers, but the best part is also the customers."
good,"There is never a typical work day at Wal-Mart. You learn to deal with all different kinds of people, co workers and customers. Wal-Mart was one of my favorite jobs because I stayed busy. Management was really good to me and my family when we had a death in the family. The hardest part of the job was the long hours on third shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the incentives that Wal-mart offers. "
good,"First of all the assistant managers I worked with were excellent. They were concerned for thier employees. Everynight I would setup the cleaning equipment (minor repair the floor scrubber frequently). Clean the floors with dust broom. Clean bathrooms,empty trash, and clean breakroom. Pickup cardboard for the stockers frequently through the night. Help stock product when needed. Zone product when asked. Make cardboard bales when needed. Moved pallets using pallet jack and stacked pallets by hand when needed. Usually a two man process. Cleaned produce walls and counters as needed. Cleaned meat wall and shelves when needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to scrub and buff the floors while stockers were still stocking whith pallets on floor having to re-clean when pallets finally were off the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to freely talk with the Assisted managers (offering complaints and problems without repocutions). Also, knowing was well cleaned at the end of the shift with no complaints from the management. Personal satisfaction."
good,Excellent learning experience for young men and women. The opportunity to gain life skills and become a self sufficient individual as well as a team player. 
good,"it is a diverse company with a very unique goal and policy in the sales floor and it's called the 10 foot rule, the work environment is safe and good and the people that i work with are courteous and very approchable to a new hire like me. "
good,"making sandwhiches, cashier, management not very good , co-workers were lazy , preping food was the hardest part making sure the bread was fresh, also working with different people was enjoyable "
good,"loading trucks for four ten hour days what I learned is how to is different ways to do my job better and faster. management is great some do there best to answer all my questions to the best of there knowledge. the hardest part of my jobs is not giving my all, the enjoyable part is management always telling us what a great job we do."
good,"It is a very tiring job, you need to stand for several hours and only get about 15 minutes break in between a 6 hour shift. The interviewing management is really bad, because everyone gets interviewed at the same time by different managers so the managers can't even hear what we are saying most of the time. "
good,"Clean the store,empty the trash,clean the restrooms, wax and buff the floors. I learned how to clean up hazardous spills and food safety.Management wasn't the greatest they didn't know how to do our job. My co-workers where the greatest we all got along and we all know what we have to do.The hardest part of the job was getting it done in the time we hard to do it.The most enjoyable part was working with my fellow co-workers"
good,"Nos dias de sábado o movimento era fluente, e tinha necessidadade da habilidade dos funcionários."
good,"There were no typical days at Wal-Mart. Everyday was different whether pleasant or unpleasant. I overseed 5 department managers over the fresh areas. I learned about inventory on fresh foods such as meat, dairy, bakery, and deli. It was not a difficult job but due to the lack of sales floor employees, the job was bit overwhelming. I am a very flexible person but doing 5 peoples jobs everyday will take a toll on your body. The hardest part of the job was trying to be so many places at once because everyone always needed help. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that the customer service I provided pleased the customers I helped."
good,Clock In.
good,"tienes la oportunidad de acender pero los estudiantes no la hay por la disponibilidad de tiempo,,,,empece como multifuncional acendi a Aux administrativo"
good,nothing to say the job was a job and that really all to sucky managment and more things not to talk about
good,"management is ok, cashiers are coming and going, not too organized, meeting new people (customers)."
good,I loved my co~workers we all started together and we where like a big family i worked there for over a year almost two till i gave birth to my babay girl which i decide to be a stay at home mommy. Which is a full time job.
good,"Wal Mart isn't a bad job as long as your automotive technician. We usually get left to ourselves to just work on cars. It's nice to be the forgotten end of the store as we get left alone on most cases by upper management. Pay is not great, but with a raise every year, it isn't all bad either."
good,I like meeting and helping others find what they need. I liked working with the people and having fun doing our jobs. But when a manager lies to you. You have to make sure you know the values of what is right to work with and what is wrong about the person you work for.
good,"Aprendi nessa empresa o quanto é importante você ser responsavel e organizado, a minha gerencia era pessoas otimas não tenho o que falar deles, aos meus colegas de trabalho pessoas com facilidade de comunicação todos com a visão de crescer no mercado, a parte mais dificil era na maioria das vezes o trabalho com o publico, as amizades."
good,Good place to gain work experience. Work hard and follow the rules and you will have a steady job.
good,Silverdale library was a visually stimulating and fun place to work. The day was a regular routine that offered a good feeling about what you were doing.Management was caring and concerned. My co-workers were interesting and came from diverse backgrounds. To some extant I learned to do basic research. The hardest part was keeping up with the hectic pace.
good,Need more guidance alot of times. Felt like I could do whatever i wanted to do. Managers are great there and actually take the time to talk with you.
good,Low Pay
good,"Enjoyed working at Walmart, most employees are part time, as an unloader i was full time, catch is, you only get 39 hours a week, just enough that they dont have to pay for insurance or many benefits"
good,"I learned how to work the keyboard at Wal-Mart, and also to memorize lots of codes for the fruits that come through the lines very often. The co-workers were very helpful when i first started working. The hardest part of the job at first was knowing the codes for the fruits. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers."
good,was an alright place to work. jobs were easy but hours varied and were not enough at most times.
good,"Shift Managers work 4 days, off 4 days or work 3 days and off 3 days. Good days off, but 13 hour shifts. Allows no time to do anything else in your day. After 13 hours, you are physically and mentally exhausted."
good,"Clock in, head to the front end, jump on my register to help get lines down. Then I would assume the role of Customer Service Manager once the 2nd shift CSM goes home. Then I would handle the money and count down the registers that aren't being ran on, and switch the money over for the new day at midnight. Would also be in supervising anywhere from 3-6 cashiers on a given night."
good,The training course was supposed to take 3 weeks. I was let go in 3 weeks because I didn't do something properly. I wasn't trained properly. I had less than a week training. They did feel I could go on my own but there was still somethings I was unclear about.
good,Third Shift is a excellent shift to work. I learned how to work in a timely manner. My co-workers for the most part where really sweet and helpful
good,"I love the smaller grocery version of Wal-mart, we're able to work a little a harder to provide our customers with a better. memorable shopping experience."
good,A typical day at work would always keep me busy and the shifts would fly by almost everyone I worked with was fun. Managers were nice and understandable. Co-workers were nice but sometimes lazy. Hardest part of my job would be the fish tank maintenance and repair. Most enjoyable part of my job would be unloading trucks.
good,"If you are still in high school or currently a college student then walmart is a great place to be employed. Wal-Mart has flexible hours that can accomidate any student. The benefits of Wal-Mart are what make Wal-Mart a leading competition for consideration of employement. Such benefits include, two weeks paid vacation annualy, quartly bonuses, 10% discount, and direct deposit. However, there is little chance of advancment in the company unless you have seniority. Even if you may be the most qualified person for a management position, Wal-Mart will 80% of the time promote the most senior person who applies for the job. Management also is a disadvantage in the company. However, Wal-mart is a good way to get started, especially if it is your first job."
good,"My job varied from day to day which kept it interesting. The assistant managers were okay, the store manager lacked the ability to deal with conflict. My co-workers became some of my best friends. Hardest part was not being able to work personally with all my customers. Most enjoyable part was how much fun I had and all the friends I made, be it customer or co-worker."
good,"I was a sales associate in Electronics. when opening I'd first check the books make sure all the high dollar merchandise was in its place. I'd open the registers, get the money counted in. Clean and zone the department areas. Then the day would begin with helping customers, cashiering, restocking shelves, or zoning. At times I was needed in the Photo Lab. I'd check the prints, the computer, make sure all was working correctly. Then put the pictures with the correct name and price them using the scanner device. I was in charge of keys most the time, they were for high dollar merch such as Ipods, cell phones, and gps."
good,"When i arrive in to work i check my task for the day typically its waxing sometimes its cleaning different areas in the store. Learned how to strip and wax floors and operate floor scrubbers. Management is fair can be difficult at times but we get through each problem. Enjoy meeting and building knew relationships with other workers, and working together completing task at hand. Hardest part of work is having a knew manger every 6 months. When the my job is done and feel satisfied with my job."
good,"I worked for store #171 for Walmart and I must say, while they talked a lot about being their for the associate and team, they never truly were, manager and associate. I worked overnights in the backroom and the performance of a majority of associates was horrendous. Everyone waited for someone else to take the leading role and when they did, they would perform poorly on the job and leave it up to the associates whose work was proficient. This did, however, make me get noticed really fast as a prominent member on the team but was a bitter sweet justice to me when trying to move in higher positions as no one could fill the positions I were previously assigned too. The management made a lot of bad choices with merchandise orders and the hiring of new associates which kept the store at lower sales than other stores."
good,Overall a great place to work. Compensated fairly for the type of job as well as good benefits for even part-time employees. Quarterly bonuses for part-time employees as well. They are always doing things for the employees and holding special events. Employees get a 10% discount on everything except food. Food is opened up during the holidays for over a month which I thought was great.
good,"People helpful and easy to work with, management worked with military schedule. Hardest part of job was having to at times work later than scheduled."
good,"work days could go by slow or fast. I learned how to do refunds and money orders (money grams, sending or receiving). Most of management did their job, others had negative attitudes or didnt appreciate co-workers"
good,I wasn't there long enough to see how the store is ran entirely but i did see enough to no that some improvements need to be made. I worked hard and kept to myself even though i no i was hired as temporary help
good,I made the furniture books and filed all paper work and contacts for this company throughout the years. This is my mothers job which I worked contract labor for when they needed my help. I also did Microsoft PowerPoint and Excel to make the furniture books and to do my contracts.
good,"It was a fun job nothing too hard overall an easy job, co workers was easy to get along with"
good,I work in the domestics/housewares department. I get returns from customer service and put them up in there proper place. I zone the department making sure everything is straight and in it's place.
good,"I go above and beyond for the patients, I'm use to staying busy, very hardworking, the management is ok but could be better, my co workers don't do is much as I do on a daily, the hardest part of my job is having to pick up slack but I make sure I get the job done"
good,Walmart's business practices are not the best in the industry. The good ole boy promotion was quite common. There is no consistency in their management
good,my day to day activities include ensuring my department runs smooth and customers are satisfied. I'm also flexible. I move from department to department helping wherever I am needed. I also delegate in the absent of other department managers.
good,Managment wants you to do 12 hrs of work in 8 hrs and if you somehow manage to consistantly get your work done there are no raises for the first year so therefore no incentive. There worker are fine but I find that alot are either just out of high school or retired.
good,to provide customer service
good,Started as a regular associate with Walmart and made my way to management. I did enjoy the benefits and pay but soon turned to 60-80 hour weeks. And being called in on my days of on a consistent basis. I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart but believe that NOT all Wal-Mart locations are like this.
good,Your Job duties are pretty schedule due to management. Which include breaks and lunches. Tasks are some times overwhelming but challenging good in some aspects. Management is sometime nice when there not under tremendous pressure. The company do give back to there workers through food and bonus but are team efforts.The hardest part of the job is the attitude of management the pressure just most the time determine it.
good,"A typical day at work, at least in the electronics department, consists of helping customers with their day to day needs. We will restock the returns for that morning and day. We stock the movies for the day, and while tracing the department and helping customers and stocking merchandise we tidy the department and make sure all the merchandise is in the right spots."
good,It is a good place if you can not found work the field you like.
good,"Overall good place to work while attending college. The store is very disorganized. There's barely any coverage during night hours. There are so many people working there, but none of them do anything they are supposed to do."
good,"Wal Mart is a great place to work if one is into the retail business. I started at Wal Mart because I needed a job a couple years ago but it is not something that I see myself doing for a long time. I am apart of the overnight shift so it is hard for me to function during the daytime because most of the time I am tired from the night before. A typical day at work is getting to work around 10pm and getting my task sheet from my manager with all the task that have to be done by the time I leave. For example, If I am stocking in the food area, I will have a task to stock a certain food group within the time that was given to me on my task sheet. When I complete that task, I have to go to a computer and confirm that I completed my task and I can now move on to the next one. That goes on for the entire shift until all tasks are completed. My co-workers are great. They like to keep a fun atmosphere at work while working and it helps all of us because some nights can be tough but having great co-workers around you makes the night that much better and the job much better. Wal Mart Management is good at what they do. If I have any questions, they are open to listen to what I have to say as well as if I have any suggestions that can help the company in any way. There really isn't a hard part to the job except for staying alert because the job is during overnight hours and you never truly get used to those hours. I have learned that you can work your way up in Wal Mart. I have learned that making an effort is important and being too comfortable with a situation will not get you to where"
good,"My day consisted of coming in a stocking the merchandise over night. It was an ok job the people I worked with were good people and even the Co Manager and Asst Managers, but I think upper management had some problems they needed to sort out and couldn't figure out just how to do it. I felt like they made decisions that were less than accurate to solve the problem they were trying to solve. Seems like to me upper management in some Wal Marts is regressing instead of progressing."
good,"Empresa dinâmica e agradável de trabalhar,aprendi muito trabalhando nesta empresa,aprendi a como se comunicar com as pessoas,como se comportar em publico nas horas mais complicadas."
good,"this was an overall great place to work because i hate jobs where u sit there bored most of the time. i just hated that people get treated like they are nothing or they also have ""favorites""."
good,"A typical day at work, In the area i was in, there was always alot to do. We have alot of responsibilities next to our names. the people were friendly it was almost like a small town everyone knew eachother so asking for help, or assistance in something you didnt understand was not alot of trouble. I met alot of different people who walked into that store, and shared a bond with my customers. The hardest part of my job was just waiting on some management for help. Its just the response we would have to wait for that got into some of our customers skin, that made us look bad."
good,The typical day would be to come in and Cashier at all different times of the day or night. My co-workers were sometimes helpful sometimes not helpful. Had no trouble with management. The hardest part of the job was standing for 8 hrs. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new cusomers and talking with them.
good,The job wasn't too hard. I got to interact with the customers. It was a fun environment.I just wish It wasn't just a seasonal position. It kept me busy.
good,"lo que aprendí en esta empresa fue el manejo de la mercancía en grandes cantidades, y su acomodamiento para facilitar su localizacion"
good,"Would start off with zoning fronting of merchandise.Learned to sell firearms,doing a background check. management was fair . co-workers were very helpful and nice.I didn`t find my job to be hard.Working in sporting goods was very enjoyable."
good,"aprendi varias funçoes,lidar com conflitos no atendimento ao cliente,trabalho em equipe"
good,"A typical day usually included arriving to Walmart and clocking in on the time clock, then presiding out on to the sales floor and answering the questions that customers had regarding the products that Walmart sales. While there I learned the value of team work and the importance of finding a new way to explain things to others."
good,"We start the night off by having a meeting describing the how much of the general merchandise that we have coming in that night. Usually someone is choose to go outside and pull needed merchandise from the outside trailers, because of me being the youngest, fastest , and most hard working employee, I am always choose to go out. I don't have a problem with going outside, its' just I have to go outside every night, even though I announce that I get cold really fast because I am a small person with no insulation. I been outside 4 hours a night. After lunch, I do a little of everything to help everyone out. So I usually go outside to put up merchandise, put up merchandise in the backroom, help stock the floors,and zone merchandise. My most enjoyable part of the job is working with people, being able to stay inside during winter and working with others."
good,"a typical day consists of clocking in, unloading a truck usually 2000 shipping packages and put them on pallets-- this usually takes 2 to 2.5 hrs then we sort mixed item break packs, next is an hour lunch, after that we pull the pallets out to the sales floor and deliver them to their respective departments, after that we start on picks - which are items that need to be stocked, that are binned in the backroom. i learned good customer service, how to work better with others."
good,"My job as a Walmart deli-associate was scary & exciting. I learned how to work a slicer & a deep fryer, also a rotisserie for chicken. I learned to work fast with what i did such as asking the customer how much meat or cheese they would want & i learned how to measure out meat/cheese slices without a scale."
good,A day at work would be me orderfilling cases talking to a voice activated system which would tell you the slot number to pick from and the quanity.Basically I would do my job and not have any time for interacting with other associates besides on breaks and lunches as I was timed on all trips. Management knew how to treat their employees. If you had a problem they would help any way that they could.
good,Everyone typically communicates on the clock and outside of the work place
good,"I have no real problems with Walmart, aside from lack of available work hours and lack of benefits, aside from health insurance. They have treated me quite well; however, I haven't asked much of them, either."
good,"makeing sure every thing had price tags,"
good,"A typical day is filled with different projects depending on management direction.Projects can include switching out features, resetting modular units and condensing and organizing modular units. This means knowing where your product and where it has been featured. Every day there is the working of exceptions and picks, returning of dropped merchandise, filling empty shelves and binning overstock as well as customer service. I have learned some merchandising, the behind the scenes in retail, how product remains stocked and how to be proactive in keeping the shelves filled,as well as planning of features and maintaining modular integrity. I need to be able to take direction and be able to work independantly as well as be able to work as a team member. I have found management helpful and knowlegeable. My co-workers are awesome, very helpful and I look forward to working with them. Because of the great team effort our work is synergistic. The hardest partof the job can be staying focused on days when an interruption has an interruption which is pretty typical. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I get to complete a project and can see that it is a job well done. I am a hard worker who is dedicated and loyal to my employer. I am very interested in trying something new and hope to hear from you soon."
good,"On a typical day I would work freight, stock, bin, cashier. As a deli associate I would prep food, cook, temp., clean and provide customer service. At any time I was expected to fulfill many roles, particularly since I was trained in multiple skills and work areas."
good,Very busy and non stop
good,busy putting stock out . making paper work for the gm receiving.enjoyed employees.
good,Management was minimal but the experience with customer service and cashiering was exceptional. Also training and leading was necessary for loading and unloading new product.
good,"Managed daily operations of the vision center as well as division 1. Responsible for hiring training, evaluations of associates. Managed Inventory,shrink and markdowns. Responsible for meeting sales and performance goals,P&L statements and reconciling journals."
good,overall a good company
good,"Management is friendly and very employee centered they really cared about my well being not only as an employee but as a person. I learned a little inventory work, cashier, customer service skills."
good,Working here stocking third shift was not to bad really. The people were nice and most of the time it wasn't to stressful. The only thing that the management did really that wasn't right was tried to make everyone stay after for over time but take it off the next night during lunch. To me that didn't make sense really. They also threatened to write people up for not taking off the over time but that is when a few of us called corporate. Had also found out that the main man of the night shift had been pocketing the bonuses that we were suppose to get in our pay checks.
good,"my typical day of work as a Maintenance for walmart begining shift meetings, walmart cheers. my typical task was bathroom sweeping the stores and any others clean up that may happens. what i did learned was how to wax and stripped floors and maintaining it which was hard work but fun, fun close at the end of your task on waxing and stripping I love to watch it shine when you completed the task. The management vary from person to person we have a few different manager from day to day. Only thing i dislike is communcation, every manager tell you one thing then the next day one manager tells you others on how thing suppose to be done. They have no knowledge on certain job that we do, it was just a mess. Beside all that employee is cool."
good,"de este trabajo es increible todo el prendizaje que adquiri,a pesar de no tener ninguna experiencia previa en el rubro.me enseñaron a realizar cobros no solo en efectivo si no tambien con monedas extranjeras(dolares,euros y reales),con tarjetas de credito y tarjetas de debito (por sistema y por postnet),a identificar billetes falsos,a realizar el arqueo de el dinero recaudado por las cajas que utilizaba por cada jornada laboral,a reconocer y detectar robos de mercaderia o a los clientes dentro del supermercado,a realizar reposiciones,etc."
good,"Não existe rotina, cada dia é um novo desafio"
good,"A typical day at work for me is to come in to freight not worked and planning around trying to implement the new processes that the company has rolled out on a weekly basis. I have learned that no two days will ever be the same and you have to expect the unexpected when you walk through the door. My management style is unmatched. I work along side with my team, therefore causing them to build that team work amongst the associates as well. The hardest part of my job is to see an associate struggling. I will go about and beyond for my people to let them know that I care. Making my customers happy is what I enjoy the most."
good,"Fast pace and busy environment, co-workers are generally friendly. Long hours but long weekends makeup for that."
good,"A typical day consist of restocking returns, providing customer service,assisting associates with sales. Reporting to my manager for further instructions. maintaining a clean and safe environment"
good,No geral é um bom ambiente de trabalho onde apredi qe não devemos ficar preso em apenas uma função pois a pro atividade também abre portas Pelo pouco que convivi são pessoas que procuram exescer suas funções com reponsabilidade.
good,gostei de trabalhar la mas sai por que tinha outro emprego em vista e por isso pedi demissão
good,"Wal-Mart provides great opportunities for employees to grow and as responsibilities grow so does the salary, the most difficult adjustment is that sometimes this intrudes on your work life balance."
good,My typical day working at Walmart was tending to the register scanning items and talking to the customers as they wait for me to get through all their items.I learned that the cashiering is one of the hardest jobs in a store. You have to deal with all the complaints of customers from their experience in the store and some times they could be very rude about it. The management over me and my co-workers were wonderful. I enjoyed getting to meet new people every day and being comfortable at my job.
good,"Bueno, pero no comparado con los beneficios y lucros a repartir entre sus funcionarios, que son los entes generadores de sus ganancias.Rutina del cargo o puesto.Legislación actualizada de estos cargos de seguridad. Distante. falta preparación. Lidiar con personas que no quieren trabajar. El entorno, y la presentación, lo standarizado, aunque criticado."
good,"é uma boa empresa ,tem bons treinamentos umaboa politica,fornece vale-transporte, mas fica devendo em plano de saude,apolitica de respeito ao colega nem sempre é respeitada e o salario péssimo pois um empilhador recebe 720,00 reais bruto a onde outras empresas pagam acimo de 1100,00reais,mensais."
good,"I usually have an medium amount of work to be done daily. My managers are all nice and understanding. My co-workers are nice , a few are slackers. The hardest part of my job is getting a set schedule."
good,• In charge of opening and closing the store
good,"Wal-Mart is a very challenging experience because Wal-Mart is fast-paced and they expect a lot from their employees. I learned about dealing with customers in difficult situations and how to keep the ""customer first""."
good,Walmart is a good start with no job experience. You learn a lot and you interact with many different cultures and lifestyles.
good,"Open the store for business, go over sales, prepare for daily meeting, ensure all stock is full, over stock set floor plans, manage assocites, deal with customer issuses, lock up store."
good,A easy start up job that prepares you for intense customer service
good,"the job itself is pretty descent, a typical night at work is pulling pallets from the backroom onto the sales floor so the overnight stockers can begin to stock the shelves. then once there is overstock on the floor we go out on the floor bring it back to the backroom and bin the merchandise into the bins."
good,"I work in the sporting goods department, and I get to learn something new about guns and ammunition everyday! I love learning new things, and love hearing new ideas. A typical day at work includes putting away all freight, always having time for customers, zoning the isles to make them look good, and helping out other departments around me. Management at our store has just transferred to a new young leader. She also moved from the state of Colorado and so far she has done everything in her power to make the rest of the management team, and our store, simply unstoppable. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers who deliberately try and bring your day down, but I never let them overpower my happiness. The most enjoyable part of this job is all of my coworkers, being able to say hello, and briefly converse, gives me more of a feeling that I actually want to be there working."
good,"Walmart as a large company as it is has its share of good and bad's. A Typical day would include making sure prices are correct and the shelves are fully stock, Training is a 50/50, you learn on the job as you go and by talking to people but if you get a promotion your just get thrown in without an actual training course. The management team I would say are so-so, there are a few that really want you to succeed in your career and others like to talk down and treat you like you really are lower then them. The People of Walmart are a great group of people from the co-workers to the actual customers, The Hardest part would be when management and the company throw on a lot of daily and hourly task that are expected to be constantly completed and if you do not complete them it could lead to consequences ... The most enjoyable part i would say is when Walmart has parties and events to raise money for associate in need or volunteering projects. Walmart is just another company that is there if you need it but not one I would want to have as a career"
good,You work longer hours and have to work 2 Saturdays out of the month. You need good communication and organizational skills. Have to be a multi-tasker.
good,"Day at work consist of stocking shelves and waiting on customers, I learned the basics of customer service and about the company itself. Co-workers were not always as committed which made daily tasks hard. Hardest part about working at a 24hr store is that when the Jewelry Department closed customers were not always ready to leave. Getting to work close with management was most enjoyable"
good,"displaying products, putting product"
good,can be fast paced. nice environment. hardest part would be getting hours. co workers are in every department to help.
good,Your level of satisfaction with your job will depend heavily on who your manager is.
good,This job at Walmart is never the same. You'll always have some thing to do.
good,"Generally fast-paced, customer-interface intensive. Challenge and opportunity for ""solving customer's problem"" satisfying. Usually backed up by supervisors, but management tended to overrule policy instructions if they decided the customer should be placated."
good,"I've learned that you see a lot of different people everyday. With that, you learn a lot that can help you with future costumer service."
good,i love the job due to the fact that it is a great way to meet and speak to new people on a day to day basic.
good,"otimo convenio medico,pagamento em dia,atendimento de boa qualidade,aprendi que o cliente é muito importante que um bom relacionamento entre colegas é muito importante"
good,"Working for Walmart was an fast steady job. Working during peak was an 12 hour shift with only 3 breaks! When i arrived i was placed on fedex. My job was to scan and ship items ordered online. Management could have been better to me more organized. there was good and bad co-workers, some people had good work ethics and some didnt. the hardest part of all that was being hired on after peak and having to ship items all alone. Other than that i still enjoyed my job because i was still employed"
good,It was a ok job. It was my first job out of high school. the management was come and go
good,"I love my co-workers, not a big fan of the management, I dont really like the very long hours, the hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers that are rude but that comes with every job and the most enjoyable part of the job would be that I enjoy that I am quite good at my job because I enjoy hands on projects/ acivities."
good,"A typical day at work is the ensure freight get put on the shelf, department managers scan lows/outs, work exceptions, bin merchandise, set modulars, zone, and take care of the customers. The hardest play about management is changing from day to night shift schedule and the long, long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying and help the customer."
good,"I enjoy my opportunities at my job, I could really advance with my skill sets that I bring with me towards the goal of the company. They pace is steady, the co-workers are great and the management really seem interested in your ideas towards getting tasks done, especially if it shapes around the idea of helping people save money and live better. I find the trickle down effect most challenging-its when you can work your hardest with a sense of urgency and feel like youre making a difference when you leave the job but when you return to work you will find there will be some not working towards the same goal as you are. Overall I enjoy the open door policy where I can speak directly to management and reach some common ground to know what is all expected of me within each of my shifts so that I can be accurately taskful and done in a timely manner."
good,Wal-Mart is an alright place to work. The benefits are pretty good but the pay is poor. Other big box stores pay more for the same jobs. Management is hit and miss as some are good and some are not.
good,"First I would go clock in with my badge go to the meeting, and listen to what department i would be stocking, then i'd go to the computer on the sales floor swype my badge and begin the task. Then i'd go get my pallets and drag them to the zone they went in, and start stocking. I would look for the item by the last 4 nubmers on the barcode and the number ot the right of it which indicated how mnay ros of the product there was, then after i was done i';d take all the cardboard to the bailer and recycle it. then i would go back to my department and zone it make it nice and neat, then i would move on to the next area."
good,i love working there for the 5 years it was fun there always something to and new people to ment.
good,Excellent store in Collingwood. Friendly staff make it easy to get along.
good,"Buen ambiente y trato, aprendi a hacer cortes de caja, el manejo del efectivo, el buen trato al cliente, los compañeros muy amables la parte mas dificil en el trabajo es que haga faltante en la caja aunque rara la vez, lo que mas me gusto es haber aprendido tantas cosas."
good,"Empresa boa de trabalhar ambiente saúdavel, colegas de trabalho com espírito colaborador, gerentes compartilhavam opiniões e informações de vendas e lucros obtidos diariamente. A carga horária era elevada sem horário fixo para descanso. A parte agradávavel era o relacionamento com o público."
good,They treat their employees like they dont matter! Cutting full time job so they dont have to provide health insurance. One manager actually told me that my job should come before my family! This wouldnt like me give them 1 star either!
good,"It is hard work, but rewarding. A typical day at the distribution center is long. It takes a motivated individual to maintain the level of expected work ethic that the management team demands."
good,"i had a good day at work and learned new things everyday,my co-workers were very friendly and some of the managers were to.the hardest part of my job was when the company changed all the rules and we have to learn everything all over again."
good,I enjoyed working with the public. I think they have great advancement opportunities
good,"Wal-mart was a good place to start working. Always work to do so it was very productive. I learned a couple of things while i was there stripping and waxing of the floors. The push cleaner and also the moblie cleaner as well. Everybody was kind of laid-back .The hardest part of the job was the hours 11pm to 8am but , the best part was the pay was very negotiable."
good,"Stocking,Helping customers keeping inventory binning items (scanning inventory). co workers were great. helping different areas of the store. hardest part was taking care of 5 departments and helping customer find what the needed but very doable. Enjoyable part was being a bike assembler"
good,"While I was employed at walmart, I seen alot of thing both good and not so good. I will say that an area that can really use some improvement, would be management. I know their main duty is to manage the store and employees, however I believe they should have knowledge of all departments, so they know what to tell a customer if the customer needs some assistance from a manager."
good,Multiple tasks on one day.Lot of opportunity to interact with the customers.Lot of support from the management and co-workers.Learned leadership qualities and interaction at different levels.
good,"buen ambiente, 9 horas pero con una de comida y pues aveces con precion"
good,"Es una empresa lider, que tiene muchas oportunidades de desarrollo en cualquier ambito para los asociados"
good,The most enjoyable part of my job are my co workers. I have made so many last friendships out of my work relationships.
good,Co workers were great.Management was ok.The job was very demanding and fast pace.
good,"Wal-Mart can be a friendly environment with its cultural diversities in staff as well as clientele; work with each customer who needs assistance by recommending the BEST product(s) for his/her needs and also provide fast and friendly checkout at the registers; learned much more by working with plants, trees, insecticides, and the lawn in general and especially about gardening; management can be a bit demanding at times but for the most part friendly rapport has been developed between me and the managers for a solid foundation in our friendship and communication; co-workers are fun to work with and we work together as a team which makes the job fun and easy; Wal-Mart's scheduling is tough at times, some shifts being early while others being later in the day sometimes makes for unpredictable planning at home when, of course, at times other things need to be done; being able to work with my fellow employees is a great delight as I have learned a lot from them and taught a lot, always a pleasure"
good,"In the Technology division, a typical day begins at 7:30 am and ends at 5:30 pm. Assignments and projects are determined by the merchandising segment of Walmart. Management can be very hands-on and can be somewhat removed. Meetings are plentiful. Co-workers are fun and helpful, always ready and willing to give back to the community."
good,"I was new to Albuquerque and out of work when Walmart gave me a chance. I noticed friction between stockers and maintenance, they got in each others way. There is so much to do, you must hustle. There is no overtime, almost everyone there were labeled as temporary meaning no benefits yet, managers were full time with full benefits. You get two 15 minute breaks. 30 minute lunch. Managers have eyes in the back of their heads but were fair and not abusive."
good,I would recommend this company to anyone especially to someone trying to pick up extra hours
good,Walmart offers a great chance for advancement.
good,I was a cashier and competed with myself to see how fast I could process the customers through the line.
good,"You get to know each and every individual around you and can develop lasting friendships or enemies.Your opened up to a world where you are able to see so many different types of people come and go through your line; some are pleasant and others, not so much. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the every so often rude customer and trying to make them happy while still giving them great customer service. Sometimes communication is lacking in a retail store and this usually in one way or another, ends up leading to a problem on breaks and lunches. Standing on your feet for long periods of time can also be one of the hardest things because it puts stress on your feet and legs.One of the worst things that goes on and is sometimes swept under the rug, is the favoritism that goes on throughout the store. Overall, it is a stable job that provides awesome benefits as well as bonuses and vacation. You can easily work around other commitments like school while working here also because the hours are flexible."
good,"Stock shelves,baled cardboard, and build displays.Learned teamwork by working with everyone with the store.Management gave feedback and the co-workers were good to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.The hardest part was the fast pace of the job."
good,Great place for students to gain experience and for others advance their customer service skills
good,"it was a fun job, but there was no room for advancement. you were expected to do numerous things and you were never given enough time for any of it."
good,Learned a lot about retail and many different jobs. Your hours have to be flexible and be prepared for long hours. You are responsible to manage the entirety of the store at any given time. I truly enjoyed the associates that have worked for me and helping them to grow and learn more.
good,Fun but sometimes stressful
good,"typical day starts with me checking my aisle making sure all items are where they belong. once my area is neat i present myself to the customers. Once they start coming to cash out i ring them up and get them out in a timely fashion. I enjoyed meeting new people, they hardest part would be to stay calm when customers get upset."
good,We work and a team but manager was not very good to talk to employees and we where late they will short your work hours.
good,"Wal-Mart was my first job right out of high school. I loved how the company values education and worked around my college schedule. After I graduated college, I begin to look at Wal-Mart as my career. I worked my way up in the company from a sales floor associate, to supervisor and eventually an assistant manager, my current position. The most enjoyable part of my job is training and mentoring my associates, especially the younger ones. I enjoy sharing my story with them and they feel they can relate to me. The hardest part of the job is feeling like you can't have a life outside of work and having to hear associates complaints and concerns and not being able to do anything about it. Wal-Mart made me overcome my fear of speaking infront of an audience and not being so hesistant to voice my opinions and ideas, I have came out of my shell and not as shy as I was once before."
good,I learned that your work should be done in a timely manner according to the rules and guidelines for the job specified. Management was on top of things and expected their employees to complete their work.
good,Its always a typical day at work. The hardest part of the job was stacking the pallets. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i got to run the registers.
good,"I loved working for Wal-Mart because of the staff (associates) and the chance to meet customers everyday. The managment was great before they were replaced. Everybody was so great towards each other. Right before I got laid off everything was changing, now they are more focused on business rather than the value of the emplopyees. Overall I had a great experience with the company."
good,"I did like working for walmart, I enjoyed being the first to see the new freight come in. I worked overnights. Usually the night would start off with a meeting, they tell us what we have going on for the night, where we are sitting at for sales and whats going on in the store. Most of the time the truck unloaders would have all the freight already pulled out to the floor for us but sometimes we would have to help finish unloading the truck or pulling pallets to the sales floor. It started the night off with a good sweat for sure. Then we would proceed to work our departments. Each department is different, and each employee works more efficiently in different ways. Some would sort their frieght per isle, some would run isle to isle as they came upon each box. Whatever the method. I myself had a different method for every department. I was a floater. I made a point to learn every department so i never knew what the night held till I got to work. CoWorkers were always willing to help with a team lift whenever needed. And it was a very laid back environment where people told jokes and kept each others spirits up, a good way to keep you motivated and moving. Management knew what they were doing for the most part. I think most of the managers I worked with managed to find an opportunity in every challenge. Those like everything. Management did have its bad apples. And of course I had my favorites. I liked the managers that were willing to work. Not just sit back and watch us work. Instead of downing my idea they would either accept it or come up with a better idea. My favorite managers"
good,"Overall I loved my job at Walmart. I would still be with them if there had been any positions available when I moved out to AZ. They're great for students and part-timers. Never ever go career though. I couldn't survive working full time at Walmart in Nebraska. I made less than 17,000 a year as a full time associate with almost 2 years with them. Thats before tax time too."
good,"Clocked in and spoke to everyone that came into the doors, I made many stops on thefts but still had fun when I did it."
good,It was a job I did in the summer while in college.
good,While management may struggle to assist those that truly deserve recognition for the most part they are a solid company to work for.
good,This company is overall a good place to work. It has work stability and is easy to be promoted if you set your mind to it.
good,"Great communication job between the company itself and the ""banks"" and people I had to have contact with."
good,"Customer Service, Cash handling, Cleaning up around my area, processing customers item's."
good,It is a very busy store can be very demanding. Management can not be found at times. Chances of moving up is there if your a hard working and vocal about improvements you think can help the store.
good,I've had experiences in two different Wal-Mart stores and I preferred Monticello because of the friendly and understanding management and staff.
good,"I really enjoyed working with this company, especially if you are a student looking for flexible hours while in college. I definitely recommend this job. You are able to meet different people with different ethnic background and sometimes you develop great relationships with your co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when there is a shortage of staff, so you have to fill-in to do your job and the other persons job."
good,i will be the best person for the job good worker... it was good working at walmart alot to do and you see and get to help people every day..
good,. Leading large group of people
good,Like all jobs Wal-Mart has its ups and downs.
good,"Wal Mart gets a bad wrap by the media, but I think generally you get what you put into it when working there."
good,Productive workplace. But management has a lack of communication with everyone.
good,"It was my very first job I learned how to handle I rate customers, communicate with customers which is something I like to do,learn how to understand a customer needs and wants. I also like the fact that it was very hands on, fast paced and a friendly job. The managment was great and they really appreciated their employee's too. Unfortunitly I was looking to enhance my career as I became more experienced and moved on."
good,I ring up items and put into a buggy if I am cashier or do returns/exchanges if I am service desk associate.
good,"O dia começava agitado com a procura de anincios de concorrentes verificaçao de preços, circulares,numeros das vendas do dia anterior,verificava com os setores se estava tudo em ordem para a abertura da loja,associados se estavam todos,reuniao diaria com a diretoria para as estrategias de vendas ."
good,I really did not have a set time to come in to work. As a CSM I learned how to deal with all kinds of situations on a professional level. My co-workers and management where easy and great to work with. I love working with people
good,"working for walmart was a good place to work, however the management needs to pay closer attention to the employee and appreicate the hard work that they put in."
good,"Enjoyed working at Walmart, learned much about retail and the business, met so many different people from different backgrounds, they change management every so often, so no one really gets to comfortable in one place, everyone is truly a family, good and bad."
good,"El trabajo es un poco estresante, mas no es pesado."
good,Manage daily functions. Co-workers good. Hardest part of the job was the 48-50hr. work week.
good,Walmart is a full in-line General Merchandise and Grocery store. High pace work load where your day begins and ends with more to do than daylight to do it. Great thing about Walmart is you have work to do the next day you are scheduled. The management team is as good as the associates that work in the facility. My experience over the past 22 years is the best management team is those that have grown up in Walmart.
good,"i had a lot of issues working for this place, no one was ever satisfied with anything, co. workers were lazy, management was very disrespectful toward the associates working beneath them on the ""chain of command"""
good,• Worked as a member of the sales and stock team ensured team productivity to ensure optimal sales and customer satisfaction.
good,A typical day at work I can be standing at register all day and having to a various assortment of different things throughout the store such as helping customers find what they're looking for to selling customers fishing licenses to assisting customers in pets by catching and bagging fish to pulling out freight that was pulled off of the truck.
good,Was a geat workplace as the employees work as a big team players.
good,A typical day at work consists of helping customers and cashing them out while standing on my feet with a smile. My main goal at this job was to learn to please my customers by any means. I really enjoyed this job there was never really a boring moment with many opportunities to grow in the company.
good,the work was steady. and the people were friendly. you always got 2 breaks and an hr lunch break.
good,"The overall company Wal Mart is awesome, but as far as benefits for part time associates isnt so good."
good,"A typical day at work... go to a register, take a 15 min break, switch to another register... repeat depending on how many hours you work that day. I learned how to work a cash register. Management is okay to get along with, maybe a little rough around the edges. Its a friendly work environment. Hardest part of the job is dealing with unmanageable customers. Most enjoyable part is meeting different people everyday."
good,"As a cashier, you have a lot of responsibilities. you are required to run the cash register, stock the bag racks, and candy racks, handle returns, restock the returns in their proper areas, if something isn't ringing up right, call the department it came from and get the price checked out for the customer. Then you have to apologize to the customer if the price they want doesn't match the actual price that is ringing up. Then if you don't have customers you have to organize the clothing displays in the front of the front-end of the store. Basically, you have to stay busy and not get caught not working and talking too much. This job can be very stressful at times. It all depends on your perspective of this job."
good,"A typical day at walmart is very busy and most of the time tiring but you live through it. i learn something new everyday, managment is ok when they communicate with you. I get along with all of my co-workers they are awesome, The hardest part of my job is making sure the tags are correct for the customer so they pay what they deserve."
good,"I enjoy working at Wal-Mart, however, Wal-Mart needs to take care of their employees better than what's in place now."
good,trabajo estresante pero q te ayuda a desarrollar tus cualidades y aptitudes
good,"Walmart is a vrey good company to work for, but they change the way you do things to often. I have learned how to work in a fast pace work place with goals to meet. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the work."
good,"I loved working with the customers,The management could be more involved with Associates. Mostly a fun job, but the work load can be a bit heavy."
good,Working hand in hand with customers can be fun. Management isnt all that great but you can have that anywhere. Working with a very diverse group of people.
good,Great place to learn big box retail and the day to day operations of store management in this enviroment.
good,Worked night shift as an inventory associate which is keeping accurate count of inventory in each department and also in the recieving area and scanning the merchandise that enters and exits the recieving area.I've learned quite a bit over the years there too much management not enough time to get familiar with one before another comes in my co-workers I loved them they were really nice and easy to get along with but the hardest part of my job was the nights and the most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers.
good,fun
good,"When the quota is met they give us lunch, such as barbeque and cake. They would sometimes do nachos and cheese and snowballs. Thats there way of tell us job well do."
good,Was not to fond of the overnight shift but it was a laid back environment.
good,"We typically each day work numerous pallets of merchandise that are left in our department by the overnight stocking crews which can range anywhere from 5-20 pallets of merchandise. We work through and put on the shelves what merchandise we can fit and the rest we put back onto pallets, wrap them up and using a walkie stacker we place them up into steel holding racks until they are needed to be brought down again. I've learned how to use the telexon scanner device thoroughly. I have learned about inventory tracking and I have been certified to use the walkie stacker and the forklift which we use in the stores outside drive-through where mulch, bricks and other heavy outdoor home improvement items are kept on pallets. The management at times can be very excellent and the managers and supervisors can be very polite and understanding and fun. Some days though they can be extremely rude and ignorant for no substantial reason whatsoever. Most of my co-workers are enjoyable. Some tend to slack a lot and wont do their share of work to anywhere near the best of their abilities. The hardest part of the job is trying to accomplish many of the tasks given to us for the day by our department manager and supervisor which at times can be extremely overwhelming. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help out customers and knowing that I am putting in my best effort each day that I walk into the store"
good,"customer service, never ending to do list, always changing do to economy, co-workers and mangement were always pleasant,"
good,My co-workers were very dependable. I enjoyed the atomsphere. I learned that you must work as a team to get things done effectively. There was always something to do at work I never really had a time to sit down which was a major plus. The hardest part about the job was when you were givin an outstanding task and it had to be completed by the end of the night. It may have been a job consisted to finish in ten hours but you only have an eight hour shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was working on assignments with my coworkers we were able to enjoy eachothers company as well as complete every task.
good,"A typical work day is not bad when the store correctly staffed. I've learned being kind can take you a long way, and how to handle stressfull situations. I love my co- workers it seems like were one big family. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a store thats not staffed correctly. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to take care of customers."
good,"I run a register bag groceries in a timely manner, I try to make it easier for the customer when checking them out., keeping my area clean at all times.I enjoy working with the other cashier's and our CSM's on the front line.But the one thing I love about my job is meeting new people,learning things like where their from and why they are visiting WV."
good,"very hard work...it took sometime to get use to...once i got going and figured their system out, it was a fun place to work."
good,"I liked working here, but the Christmas season is absolutely nuts there."
good,"I use to love working there, but once we got new management it was like there was too much stress in the air."
good,"Doing a lot of work and finishing on time or before time. I've learned how to work with people and to try to be the best at what I do. Management is good very helping and willing to teach. Ok coworkers, there isn't really a hard part once you get use to a job. The best part is being around people and having fun."
good,The only thing I didn't like was you can't be full time unless you were a manager.
good,"Some stores are better than others, though I find a huge communication problem with most. Managers tend to lack college degrees in business and lack the interpersonal and motivational skills to supervise a team."
good,"I came in did my job and clocked out. Stayed away fromdrama, made a lot of friends. Kept area clean and neat."
good,"I have worked for this company for over 5 years, mostly as an optician. Benefits are provided and they are adequate as long as you don't have a current and ongoing medical condition, I have heard rates for that kind of insurance are high. Dental is great. No vision is provided, but there are discounts."
good,The work was very enjoyable. Difficult situations arrose on almost a daily basis and I would be the called upon to figure out the problem and fix it. Management didn't get too involved in daily ops. of the dept. My co-workers were great to work with for the most part.
good,Good work environment but had its 'clicks'. Management could have been a little more understanding and compassionate and workable for workers and people. Also a little more pay and raises would be a plus.
good,"A typical work day was working were needed. Working in the bakery, shoe department, electronic department, inventory control, making keys, and accounting,"
good,"A typical day at Walmart is where everyone comes together as a team to get everything done. I learned cash handling services, customer service manager duties, inventory. Management would tell you one thing and then you turn you back and another manager goes against the other managers decision, so it would make it impossible to get things done. My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of my job was to operate the walkie stacker. The most enjoyable would be working as a cashier."
good,"I learned a lot about working with film and cameras at this job. A typical day consisted of working the register, selling cameras, and developing film. I'd say the hardest part of the job was getting the hang of handling the delicate films. One wrong move and it could ruin a customer's pictures. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with the customers and helping them get the best camera within their budgets. I had no problems with my co-workers, we all got along really well and helped eachother out when one of us was having a difficult time. They are also the ones who trained me to use all the machines, and they were all very patient."
good,"E uma boa empresa para trabalhar , todos dia tem reunião para estimular o trabalho do dia , e tem reconhecimentos dos associado em destaque do mes trabalhado com premiação eu gostei de ter rabalhado nela"
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart for 11 years and then vested my interest and moved on. The time that I served spanned a period ranging from a time when Sam Walton (and his friends who shared a common vision) ran the company to a more conventional company with a somewhat colder attitude towards its associates after his passing. His legacy is visible in the company today but it has changed, as all things must, for better or worse."
good,"I loved unloading trucks, I enjoyed this job more than any other job I have ever done in my life. I learned so much from this job, how to lead, how to drive a forklift, how to use a pallet jack, how to organize freight in both a backroom and a store floor. I made many good friends at this job. I never quite felt the pay was enough for the caliber or demand on myself or my fellow crew members but we were all motivating for each other."
good,"A typical day work means, coming in at 8 and checking phone inventory. Answering phone calls and assisting customers with cell phone needs. Everyday I learn new prices about phones, I learn about the phones and plans for the different services. My old management team didn't not have clue about what I do or how I did it . They where not the best team of management never open to new ideas. There's no hard part of my job because I took the time to learn and understand people needs. The most enjoyable part is teaching a customer how to operate a devices."
good,"I typically worked the register, sometime the money center, and the customer service desk."
good,"Working at Wal- Mart can be a very stressful job, the customers are not always nice and the management can be no better. There are some days where the customers can be nice and the day goes by smoothly."
good,Walmart est un très bon employeur au niveau des avantages sociaux.
good,"love the company, management sucked rude and very hateful management not professional at all the only good managers they had are gone and the ones they have there now need to go"
good,"Collecting carts the whole shift. Also was required to help customers out that needed help with heavy lifting, and also had to bring it back in if there was a return. I learned that many people just put carts where ever and will let them roll if they are in a rush. Management tried to stay on their job my co-workers were nice to be around and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was working in the winter because it constantly caused me to get sick. The most enjoyable was when it was busy and a nice day because i did not get bored and will have something to do."
good,I can't complain about my pay. I hated the scheduling though. Management was alright.. but the policies were a bit rough.
good,You work hard for little pay.
good,"i enjoy working at walmart its fastpace my day usually starts with counting the safe, then running tickets to go on the register pull running breakes cashier and customer questions and complaints. CBL's and in the evening doing the register reset watching for shop lifters. The best part of the job is the people i meet solving problems to everyones satification fast pace and the constant change. Ensuring company policies and values are followed. The worst part is the not being able to have weekends off with my family. Getting time off is hard to do. there is really not a hard part if you know the personality typesto get what u need with limited resistance."
good,"Boring,"
good,"As a Photo lab technician i enjoy my work.i have got ""Shining Star"" ,which is given as a recognition for best employee by customer choice."
good,A typical day would be about 16 hours. Constant lifting and walking.
good,When I worked at Wal-Mart several years ago it was a good place to work. I have reapplied will no success. I do not know what the problem is. I found Wal-Mart to be fair at the time I worked there.
good,There Was A Project I Had To Complete On My Own In A Time Limitt. I had To Move Items From One Department To Another. I Learned That Management had Faith In Me Completing This task Within The Time Limit I learned How Neat Things Should Look & Other Co-Workers Learned As Well. The hardest Part Was Doing The math & Not being Able To Reach Too Many Things. The Enjoyable Part Of The Job Was I Finished The Project On Time .
good,It was Ok Just The Management had favortism i loved unloading trucks because nobody bother you
good,"assembly line packing out product, that people can work together and have fun, management was very understanding at times, not getting permanet, meeting people from school and making friends and being productive"
good,Management was horrible. Discrimination was rampant: I was told I could not become a certified fork lift operator because I was a woman.
good,"My walmart is understaffed so it gets hectic, but it is a very fun place to work at!"
good,"Walmart have plenty of opportunities for any employee who wants to advance. The only issue is that employees have to be in the right place at the right time in order to get noticed. A typical workday includes working in several areas with tight resources, and limited time. Management can be very demanding, but some of them will do their best at providing the support needed to complete the tasks. Co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is trying to get so much done in one day with tight resources and time. The most enjoyable part of the job is having the opportunity to make friends and have fun."
good,"The days at this job were very long and collective. Put in long hours everyday. i Learned to Manage credit cards and handle cash reports. The management was decent. The Co-workers stayed buisy and was on good floor duty and maintence. The Hardest Part was Also taking care of peoples basic needs, their concerns returns."
good,"it was a fun place...I learned in my trainings a lot about electronics, cameras, movies, video games etc...I was a positive place to work"
good,"For a multi-billion dollar company, they do not pay their hourly wage employees very well. The salaried managers of this company talk to their subordinates in a rather condescending tone and lack enthusiasm for assisting others to solving problems. The company more or less has plenty of opportunities for those employees that are seeking to advance within the hourly wage sector."
good,"I work at a fast but, efficient pace and management does not seem to notice at all. I work with someone who treats me like I am nobody. But, everyone else I work with, I get along with very well. The hardest part of the job is having to do someone else's work before I can begin my work. The most enjoyable part is that I can listen to my music."
good,"When working with the public and assisting people with people with their daily needs, one must keep on their toes to strive for perfection in customer satisfaction."
good,"My typical day at work would be helping customers and stocking. I learned to cull produce, how to use certain machines to cut down fruit. I also learned how to stack bananas. The management was overall nice. The co-workers were extremely cool and hard working. The hardest part would be the AM schedule. We had a lot to do in a little time. The most enjoyable part of my day was helping the customers."
good,Compensation was good and plenty of room for advancement. Sometimes management made you feel like just a number.
good,"The managers and I didn't get along very well, and I will say I am an easy person to get along with. People just get power hungry sometimes. Other than that, I enjoyed it. You got to do your own thing with little instruction."
good,"Depending on the store you work at your day can vary wildly, working nights is different entirely and much more fast paced when working with merchandise. Management is very friendly and flexible, never had any problems on my end."
good,"Walmart cares about there customers and provides all the support needed to help one another. The management could be a lot better and stop favoriting certain people, all employees should be treated equaly. I enjoyed all the cusotmer that i saw everyday and most of the employees."
good,"I started my time at walmart as overnight mod-crew and absolutely loved it. I loved my management team and co-workers. After transferring to another store, I felt very out of place. No one would talk to me, management wouldn't offer advice/help. I was an outcast, so to say, because the new store wasn't my original store. I was a 'transplant' as some associates call it. Overall, walmart isn't a horrible place if the right people are there."
good,"In the first month of working, I received the honor of associate of the month."
good,"its great places to work only being able to grow was limit . i learned how work with cash , start work do a little stocking then start to check out customer . Hard part was unloading truck . enjoy part was helping customer get what they need in a timely fashion"
good,Went to work from 10 pm to 7 am stocking the shelfs
good,"It's a secure job with opportunities to advance. If you enjoy working with the public this is a good job, although you do find yourself alone because management cannot make a schedule."
good,"A lot of walking, lifting, pushing, pulling, and twisting. Very physical job. The pay is good and shifts are good. HR could be more helpful at times and some of the managers dont seem to have the answers you need."
good,It wasnt a bad place to work and I liked the experience that I gained from being employed there. I made some valuable friends out of some coworkers and some of the managers were helpful.
good,It is a very secure place to work. They really do focus on the customer and doing anything to keep them coming back. The managers can be very clear on what they want done.
good,A friendly work environment that allow you to be able to be trained on various heavy equipment
good,"You meet, work, and help alot of people if different backrounds.The pay is good."
good,The pay is okay. Not a good turnover rate though. I didn't dislike it here but it wasn't my favorite.
good,"I would never work at Sumter, SC Wal-Mart ever again. The managers are terrible"
good,loved the people i worked with always had fun no matter how bad the day was. for the most part was short handed due to management making bad schedules. got to where its to much of a run around trying to talk to a manager
good,Stressful work/must be able to work shorthanded/no excuses for mistakes
good,Walmart is a great place to work. The management is helpful. It has great advancement and benefits. The values they carry are family oriented.
good,"Walmart is great place for many people seeking work in the retail field can learn and grow, and they offer many rewarding classes to prepare you for a more advanced job."
good,"If you are looking into a good place to work and grow in the retail buisness, Wal-Mart is the place for you. You will enjoy meeting good people, and working in a fast moving environment. Wal-Mart is also a reliable company as far as job security."
good,Overall I enjoyed working for Walmart. They work with you on your weekly schedules. I think they are a little slow with their advancement procedures.
good,"I worked here for almost five years, I enjoyed working in the photo center and working with a group of energetic people."
good,Wal-Mart is a good job to start at when first learning the career world. If you are able to move up within the company Wal-Mart can be a great career with good benefits.
good,"The family life is almost nonexistent with Walmart. We work 364 days of the year. The only day off is Christmas. Families get together on Thanksgiving, but we have to work our normal shift."
good,"Work within company parameters"
good,"You never know when you’re day is gonna be busy or slow, so you have to anticipate and be ready for just about anything. It helps build work ethic not knowing whether or not it’s gonna be a crazy day."
good,I at one point loved working for Walmart but if you have kids I don’t recommend working there as they will not work it’s the hours you are available to be at work and will schedule you to be at work at the same time you have to pick up kids from school no care in the world for single parents
good,"- Highly recommend for those wishing to start building their resume"
good,I loved it at first. As time went on it got to be more about numbers and money and less about the customer. I tried my best each and everyday to take care of the customer and make sure they left happy.
good,A typical work day at Walmart consist of engaging with customers as they enter and exit the store.  Management is usually there ready to assist customers and employees when needed.  The hardest part of this job is dealing with customers when they are caught stealing merchandise.  I have learned how to manage people and deal with stressful situations.  The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is helping customers.
good,The good thing about working at Walmart is my schedule. Management is a little one sided. I'm guaranteed 40 hours a week. The hardest part is making sure every customer is satisfied.
good,"Good place for part time work, No bad experience working for this company at all"
good,decent pay for the job. management is respectful. fast-paced working environment. always learning new things. coworkers nice--no drama. adequate breaks given.
good,"I managed several apparel departments while supervising 10+ associate on company standards of organization and cleanliness. Most enjoyable part of the day was being able to help customers and give them good information about different products. The only bad thing was the work-life balance, management demanded  to much of your time."
good,Alot of people say the management is not good but I liked my managers and co workers. I think they would go the extra mike to appease the customer. I liked my customers as well.
good,Overall it wasn't a bad experience. Thoigh it did feel like management was not taking care of the issues that I would bring to them. Either personal or from my team.
good,It’s good for new comer for basic experience and knowledge. It’s take time to grow up your career here like be a assistant manager. So besides you have to show your good performance
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work. Will give you the hours and days that fit your schedule.  Management  sometimes are mean and don't respect you. But, once you take it the matter above them the situation usually stops"
good,"The pay is nice, but the management isn’t so nice. Horrible managers, besides a few"
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart very much. But it was getting to the point where they would complain about small things and wouldnt give co workers space to communicate and achieve they're goals together.
good,"Walmart is a fast pace active environment and keeps customers happy, if you’re up for a challenge, or competition, Walmart is the place for you! Fun filled"
good,"As a former employee of Walmart Transportation in Raymond, NH. I want to say first I’m grateful for the job opportunity. I learned new skills to add to my development. You give 120 HRS of  your life to accomplish someone else’s dream. Many just do the average. Just how life is. There is still a racial issues northern parts. Go-Getters are unattractive. Do your job and go home."
good,"Not enough pay, more management opportunities need to be available, more hours need to be given, and more associate care and attention needs to be given"
good,Trabaje por 3 años y hay cosas que no me agrada de los jefes no saben resolver problemas en el trabajo.Cuando necesita resolver un problema con los empleados le da la espalda a los empleados.votan a los empleados injustamente cuando se quieren defender sus derechos
good,I got paid fairly for this job and didn't hate coming into work. They sent me around the store to help out with other departments because they were understaffed at the time.
good,I had previous experience as a cashier so the job was easy to learn. I was appreciated by management. I learned new things. I had a hard time learning to stand on my feet for a long period of time.
good,Except for the last part of my working there it was ok to work for them. The jobs they give are not too hard. While I was a cashier it was easy to do. Jjst had to keep your scans up. Needed more work on the card applications but not insurmountable.
good,Work well with other dnt mind helping other wish Walmart had better mangment but overall it’s a great job dnt mind moving up in the company but they give you lots of hours
good,It can teach you good communication skills and help you learn about a few technologies you didn’t know existed. I would definitely not recommend it as a full time career
good,"Working at Walmart requires being fast on your feet, and helping customers. I work quickly i also made every shopper comfortable with greeting , asking if they would like help finding anything and still working ."
good,Overall good place to work lots merchandise though out the store store is updating daily u get a discount card and get quarterly bonus check the only negative thing is they have a point system and dr notes are not acceptable
good,"It's a routine job ever day, easy to complete, but sometimes stressful and physically tiring. My direct supervisor was awesome, but some of the management can be really unfair and having favorites is a commen thing among them. I haven't had actual bad experience, working there, but it's definitely temporary job."
good,Clean and stock shelves organize backstock areas. Pull orders while helping customer with and questions or concerns. A lot of heavy lifting with some lite forklift work
good,"Too many chefs and not enough Indians at my store a lot of the older employees are rude to the new employees and not very friendly to the customers, I love helping the customers find what they are looking for I even got an award for Excellent customer service and I’ve only worked there less than two months"
good,I loved working here. I worked with great people. I just needed a change. They are flexible with schedules and everything. They will help pay for school and always gives back to the community
good,Una empresa dedicada a la atencion del cliente donde son los primeros en su categoria
good,Just started working here  a couple of months ago. The coworkers and management take to time to answers all the questions I have about a particular issue.
good,"When I first started with Walmart they cared for there associates more than they do today. It seems their more opt to be out with the old and in with the new. Focus on the new associates and not acknowledging the long term associates. They don’t evaluate on the job one does and the above and beyond an associate does for the company. I use to love the company but feel to better myself I need "
good,I wasn't in a good situation because there was a conflict with another employee accusing me of something I didn't do. Said person causes problems with everyone that got hired but I was the only person getting in trouble and it wasn't even done. So I quit. But they do treat some people good.
good,I have worked part time at Walmart for about three years. The are very flexible with my work schedule which makes it a good fit for me. I enjoy the people I work with and have never had any serious issues with management. I certainly intend to continue my employment with Walmart for the foreseeable future.
good,very busy day as usual but managment can be helpful with tips on what to better help out the area. In my area you have to soon learn that being fast is better. if too slow then lines of customers will grow.
good,hard to have a personal life the more you move up. I've learned a great deal from Wal-Mart. It can be really rough during holidays. Knowledge is power.
good,The shipping dept. seems to be best suited for people above 5 ft. 5in.. closer to 6ft would be ideal. Must be in shape or willing to get fit. Heavy lifting. Periods of high physical activity. Some managers truely care and are understanding but Wal-Mart has strict policies and they can be a bit ridiculouis. Wal-Mart seems to care way more about their consumers rather than their employees.
good,"Wages are good, management is usually reasonable, Work culture is strange at times, I mean, it's still the only place I've ever worked where a coworker went berserk for taking a minute to help them(When I was already running late for another assignment) And of course said co-worker was very popular lol. But it's generally not a bad place to work really"
good,You have to know someone to get a good position. Assistant manager is not friendly . I love working in Jewelry and apparel. Hours were good.  Customers were friendly.
good,"The pay is great, long hours, stressful working conditions, they expect too much and continue to take from associates. If you can make production there’s plenty of jobs available, if you cannot make production then they walk you out the door, no chance for another position."
good,"Working for Walmart was a great learning experience, especially for socializing. I learned how to talk with people and be more open as customers shared their experiences in life. Management at the Walmart store I worked at was somewhat okay as some days they were fine, but other days were tedious due to miscommunication. Workplace culture at the Walmart I worked at was pretty good as most people had an excellent work ethic and associates were always willing to help each other to learn and strive for better performance. The hardest part of the job was inventory, preparation for the event to be precise. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with fellow associates and the customers."
good,"Buena empresa para empezar a trabajar sin previa experiencia, si trabajas duro tiene oportunidad para crecer y lo mas que me gusta trabaja todo tipo de nacionalidad y edades."
good,It was good overalls experience work good with the coworkers they were helpful. The help me with everything that I was supposed to know. My training was successful.
good,Working there I had my experience and my opinion is my opinion so therefore I don’t want to make anybody not want to work there but more to let them make their own opinion.
good,"I was really thankful to have a job. This job got me by, but with my bills and being able to support my family,  i need something that is paying more. I have a new edition to my family. I need to look for a job that will better meet my needs."
good,"i really enjoyed the people i worked with, it was fun and always energetic. Being in online grocery we had plenty of ""regulars"" and our customers were always fun to be around."
good,It has a nice atmosphere and management too.The starting pay was more than welcome.Enough break to help your time flow nice.Team work is prioritized. excellent environment to work
good,Can be a stressful job at times but overall good if you’re looking for hours and an easy job to learn or if you’re attending school. The management was usually open to working with me on scheduling and helped me learn my tasks.
good,If it wasn't for the fact that I was lied to by my supervisor I will still be there don't get it wrong the pay is ok but the supervisor sucks and it's a lot of favoritetum so I won't be going back
good,While working at Walmart I think the pay and benefits could be better but you also needed to be a people person dealing with customers on a daily basis.  I think they could also give you better and longer training depending on your area of work.  At times you could be placed to work in areas that you only had a quick training and were told what to do and that was it.
good,Walmart is an awesome company to work for if your not management  cashiers have an awesome place in the store and as long as you smile and treat your customers good you’ll do well
good,Walmart is a great place to work for if you are single and are in management. It’s very high paced . The associates work well with management and will go above and beyond for some
good,"This job started off as a good place to work. However, they didn’t do a good job of working my school schedule around my work schedule. Sometimes I would tell them not to put me on certain days and they would put me on that day. It started becoming tiring working so many overnight hours and going to school.The hardest part of this job was the simple fact of working overnight which made it even more tiring. The easiest part of this job would be working with customers because you typically don’t have to worry about a lot of customers coming in.I wouldn’t recommend this job to working college kids."
good,Walmart can be difficult to work there because management is very strict . But the benefits are good and they are very understanding. You do learn a lot at Walmart and they will help you move your way up and learn management duties.
good,Has stable job  some management aren’t very understanding. Having anxiety like myself my issues aren’t really heard like they should be. Good company as a whole  just depends on what store you work for
good,"I was a CAP 2 member. I would unload our daily delivery truck, then stock the shelves afterwards. The hardest part was getting all required merchandise on the shelves at the end of the day, usually the general merchandise. What I've learned was how to go about my job in the quickest and most efficient way possible to complete the job before the end of the day. However, there has been a high turnover rate for the supervisor position. The supervisor is responsible for assigning each team member to their position. I cannot speak for others, the reason why for the high turnover rate for this position in particular are just rumors. Rumors are that there are disputes between the supervisor and assistant managers on how to lead the team. But what I can say, is that we did go through a lot of supervisors. Some lasted longer than other. It reached a breaking point where one supervisor in particular did an amazing job and never raised his voice at anyone. However, he still got demoted. Half of the team protested by walking out. The Co-Managers (one rank below general manager) had to undo the demoting."
good,I was a nice journey here. I enjoy the work but it was not enough. I want to continue where I left off at and apply for managment and improve my leadership skills
good,the average day at walmart was crazy. We always had a rush there was little time to take breaks some of the customrs where  rude and management wasnt that good
good,"Enjoyed helping all the customers whether that was with finding products off the shelf, finding a price or cashing them through the check-out line. Walmart can be a stressful place to work, but if you are organized and have excellent time management skills it can be a great place to work. Management does require staff to promote Walmart cards and raise money for charities and staff do become competitive, but it is all in good fun."
good,"There's always something going on. There's chances at times for changes in your job, if you want them. The people are great, the job can be crazy at times."
good,Es un ambiente lindo! Sólo mucha competencia entre los internos.
good,"I liked to work at Walmart because the employee environment was good, If there was any problem you could talk to any manager and solve it, the supervisors follow your development and help you to be better. Always with a kind and polite attitude. It helps when you are a foreigner."
good,A typical day at work is stocking shelves and helping customers find what they need in the store and also unloading trucks I learned something new every day dealing with different customers that comes in the store also I learned something new in the store almost every day because of helping customers find different product
good,There are some Managers that are phenomenal but then you have a selected few that could careless if you climb the ladder of success or not. You just have to have your focus and Self drive to make it in the line of work
good,They have a hard time listening to their employees. they ask too much from their employees for the time they give them to do the job. But a great family place.
good,Helping customers with orders over the phone or in store keeping items stocked management was okay it was a good work place trying to get everything done in a certain amount of time with no help being able to help people
good,Great place to work..very productive and faces paced but good benefits but warehouse can be extreamly hot in the summer and extreamly hot in the winter.
good,"The company has wonderful culture values and diversity in it's workplace that strengthens it's core values, and the people and customers that the company  grows efficiently and effectively."
good,"Walmart by fair was the worst job I ever had. Mangers was hardly ever there to help, staff support was very low. Very unfriendly environment as far as coworkers."
good,Not a bad place at all to work in. The managers were OK. I found people there to be quiet friendly. The environment between the employees and customers was excellent.
good,I wish I could say something nice but I had a bad experience there.  I feel they don't really care about there employees I felt like just a number. The management wasn't very kind
good,Its friendly fast paced job.  And with accuracy and good memory an associate can go a long time without  feeling detained that the job is not being done correctly...it was a good job for me only after a year has gone by and all the adults still treat you as a the new person is depressing .....
good,Enjoy the fast pace work. But can get overwhelming. Management not very helpful and not caring. Needed time off for health issues and both my managers didn't have time to talk. Personnel is never available always gone and doesn't answer phone.
good,"My only problem with Wal mart , Is the pay!  They do not pay enough for what they want you to do.  Sometimes you be running 2 or 3 departments by yourself"
good,"Busy work environment. Great growth potential. Work with a variety of people and personalities. Gain exponential training, past that of what your current position may be."
good,"This place isnt to terrible to work at. Its definately alot better than some jobs out there. If it wasnt for management, the place wouldnt be too bad."
good,"It was a great place to work, had lots of fun on the job of course. But it was stressful just because there was so many people for one or two manager to look after that we all kind of just got lost throughout the day and started improving what to do. Running the store on our owns if you would, we would all check in with each other while near one another but never with the managers because there were to busy. Overall it was an ok job, just lacked the efforts from the higher ups"
good,takes physical lobar and it is mentally stressful in certain situations depending on what you are doing there. work 40 hrs a week if full time and usually 32 if you are part time.
good,"Product count as well as stocking and replenishment."
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work, but they have old ways of operation, I will always advise the first time working to start with Walmart. I notice why working there, that its very difficult to work 40 hours a week."
good,"This environment is very fast paced, have to be able to work effectively, efficiently, and have good quality of work and customer service. "
good,"A lot of customer complaints to handle also running around to check for prices. "
good,"The best part about this job was attending the Walmart Academy for two months, but they set your expectations for their stores uncomfortably high and that is not cool. They pay well, and if you do not want a social life but want money then maybe walmart is for you."
good,"Working at WalMart, I learned the importance of communication and responsibility. Depending on what area I was in during the day, it was simple and energetic. The hardest part of the job was when I was given other duties on top of what I had to get done. The management at WalMart was well rounded. If my department manager was there, there was always another one there to talk to if need be. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with surrounding coworkers, and when I felt confident about getting my job done right."
good,A typical day is pretty fast pace and fun. I've learned that teamwork works alot better here so be willing to help out. Management can do laot better with understanding the employees and knowing their jobs
good,"Wal-Mart truly isn't that bad of a place to work. There is room for advancement, you can become a department manager in less than a year. The cons is the managers. The store manager was great but some of the other managers were just very unprofessional. And I don't suggest the maintenance position for anyone with a weak stomach. You literally don't know how nasty people are until you clean those restrooms."
good,Alright place to work . Opportunities for advancement also a very good team to work for me job security . Plenty of overtime . Also very nice staff and understanding boss
good,"environment is good. the hours aren't so flexible, but if you don't have a busy life outside from school it could be a good temp job.  ..............................."
good,When I worked at Walmart I did everything from clean up spills stock shelf’s unload the trucks overall it was a good job the management was good the benifits were good I learned some stuff like how to be safe in toxic areas
good,Be prepared to move around alot and do more than your workload you do alot of other peoples jobs too but all and all its not that bad you just have to work hard
good,I liked Walmart but when I first started they made it seem like it was better then it really was. But even though I didn’t like it I still did good. I am a good worker.
good,"this job is great for the area that i am living, i would recommend this job if you don’t want to do warehouse or fast food. It is very easy to advance in because there is always a management position available."
good,"The best thing about working for the company, is the other employees. The company overall is horrible to work for. They dont care about your family obligations, or making sure you get to spend time with family on the holidays."
good,"Need To improve there assistant   managers ,  lack of communication they hear what they wanted hear need to hired more people and started listening to the associate and start showing some leadership they lazy"
good,"Very fast paced. I used to enjoy working for this company, Worked there for many years. Company is going through many changes and no telling if you will have a job tomorrow. Management is horrible and does not listen but acts like they care.  Store employees morale is at a all time low."
good,I started as a cashier and every year was promoted to a hire position.  With this job depend on how motivated the individual for advancement.  Unless you are hired directly into management its going to be a long haul for a suitable  compensation.
good,Management absolutely sucks at Walmart and literally anyone can become a manager. Kiss butt and you are guaranteed to go far! The best thing about the job is the benefits.
good,I enjoyed my time here atWalmart also. I made great customers which became friends. Walmart has created ways for me to work in different areas in the store. I was access the freedom to move around accordingly to what customers need to help with.There was a thing at Walmart with the lack of communication i there with the management.
good,I would have gave a better review but the whole reason I left was because the CSM there waited for me to be away from cameras just to complain and threatened to coach me several different times during her whole spiel but other than that liked the exercise
good,"Ok company needs improvements in management and turn over rate problems, also needs a more set schedule for associates but overall not a terrible company to work for."
good,"Overall the people there were very kind. The Customer Service Managers were great, the assistant ones were not. They had trouble with communication. They really didn't work together to help you out."
good,Good people overall...but at times gets annoying with the repetition and managers treating you like a child...Very Cheesy And Fake I public but disrespectful behind closed doors...they jus hire ANYONE
good,Working in Walmart disciplined me to work more organized and prompted my movement to be fast paced. Arriving at the job I was given a certain amount of pallets and they had to be finished at a certain time. Maintaining the area clean and organized was a must while as well as helping the customers with their shopping experience. At times you'd have to cooperate with your team of associates to finish stocking certain areas of the store. I'm an easy going person which allows me to work well with others.
good,Great place to work assoicate are great.The work is easy. All depends on the person were you go with the company. Its so much you can learn and do. You can come in and with in time you can be promote fast.
good,If you are highly motivated and can communicate with large groups of people through out the day. Be able to make business decisions at a moments notice.
good,"There are lots of places to go with the company. Lots of quick ways to get promoted. The atmosphere depends on the store dynamic, however the company takes care of their associates, with good pay, and good benefits. The job of ASM is not easy. It is a lot of hard work and can be very rewarding."
good,Walmart was a fun place to work at especially when you had friends as coworkers. My time at walmart was nonetheless boring but a good paying job! If you work at walmart do cashiering.
good,"short handed 90% of the time and are required to do the job of two or more people. you get as few or as many hours depending on you position, the customers get frustrated by the lack of help."
good,"It was always busy, so I never ran out of things to do. It was a really great environment, everyone usually got along and the managers were great. I learned a lot in a very short amount of time"
good,Overall Walmart is a good company to work for. It can be stressful at times.  There is opportunities for advancement especially with the changing structures.
good,It was a good first job taught me how to be patient with costumers and to try and ask questions if needed also wasn’t hard on there employees very helping people
good,With walmarts policy and positions always changing it's hard to obtain a secure position. The duties and job description were never followed. Performing job duties not in job area.
good,"Walmart is a large corporation and the average associate is paid according to corporate dictated rates.  The good associate is paid the same as the not so good associate, this is one draw back of the corporate pay scale.  Personally I would like to see some improvement when it comes to the Walmart scheduling, it tends to be erratic and favor the store over the associate, but that is understandable I suppose. (It benefits the community allowing better service to our customers) "
good,"I'm not a lazy worker by any means. I've worked in a foundry and many manufacturing jobs. But this job has pushed my abilities to the limits. It's not an easy job. As an order filler you have to lift very heavy objects and stack them effectively, and fast. If you can't handle fast-paced heavy lifting, you may want to consider other options."
good,It was a decent company to work for doing that time. If company perk haven't changed. The experience can be great depending on which location you working because all management staff are different.
good,"In my 4 years, I met alot of great coworkers. In my experience management was sub par and cared mostly about meeting qutoas. It wasn't at fault for rude customers, but it make for a hard experience seeing hundreds of people a day."
good,I enjoyed working there. Had a lot of great co workers and employees but I left the company due to work/life balance. Not being at home and seeing my family caused a lot of unneeded stress.
good,"Not a bad company at all, loved my area I worked in and got along with all my managers and co-workers..I left because I was getting harassed by a manager from a completely different department."
good,"Job work/life balance was never a balance! Always what our boss wanted. We would ask for days off, and they would be denied because somebody other than our boss would go in and deny it. Didn’t like that, but the benefits were good and stock investments were good."
good,"A typical day for me was starting in the department I was hired for which was the garden center , did whatever the tasks were assigned . From there many associates as myself were put in different departments to help out and make sure there was a good zone making sure customers were assisted . Working at Walmart I’ve learned how to use the tools they provided such as the devices to check what’s in stock or where things were for customers. Overall working at Walmart gave me experience great work place , management was decent working with others was great and learning to multi task."
good,I liked working with the people and the job wasn't to bad there was a friendly atmosphere and good people who were always there for me if I had any issues
good,"As a stocker you're expected to stay on a strict schedule for your tasks. It can become stressful but once you get used to it, it becomes pretty second nature."
good,Walmart overall is about there customers. The job entails making the customer at ease and comfertable when shopping there.The Managment in Walmart neighborhood make the place feel like home.They are always there to help out when it comes to getting the job done. I took pretty well with learning every job dutie I was entitled to get done the times they have me schedualed. Overall a great experience.
good,Walmart is wonderful company to work for and it's easy to make friends. However some of the managers aren't that great. These managers make your job harder that has to be. These managers makes a company look bad. You will know who these managers are because when you need them they won't be around.
good,I love interacting with the customers and stocking the shelves which as a result keeps the customers happy and eager to return.  I just don't like the unrealistic income.
good,"Great stocker love to help customers and did a lot of maintenance , cleaning als also overnight stocker clean windows boards and floors also put In new items on shelf"
good,It wasn't all bad. Somebody good co-workers. HR is fair. Breaks are only like 5 minutes. Traffic is horrible when you're getting off work. Really no time to eat in breaks. Management really didn't hope with getting the product off line.
good,"i worked in the deli it was ok for the most part it can be stressful at peak business times but the nights went by faster this way, the people i worked with were very helpful and insightful"
good,"This job can be very fulfilling, I would not say it is for everyone. I found it very difficult to keep up with the required time. But many of the other people hired on with me excelled at the job ."
good,"I learned alot about retail,the hard part was there was no hard part,the management was not bad they treated we with respect and the coworkers were awesome."
good,"Walmart as a whole is a great company to work for of you're looking for an entry level position to retail.  However, the stores lack support in management and employees can be treated poorly, even taken advantage of. Walmart stores need to work on their ethics and how a store is properly ran."
good,"My typical day was going into the backroom to check freight in the morning from the night before truck and pulling it out to work it on the sales floor, making sure my department was nice and neat for customers to provide a safe environment. Customer service is very important working for Wal-Mart. Customer service always come first before any other job requirements.  I learned more about technology and communication skills while working in one of the largest retail store. The hardest part of the job was making sure your attendance didn't go over the policy amount of allowed absences because it will be termination if you call out. Doctor notes by a doctor is not accepted as an excuse to take time off unless you take a medical leave. I would not recommend Wal-Mart if you have kids or health issues."
good,"In my time with walmart, I've actually built a cooperative comradary with my associates built on team building and understanding. I would love to stay but circumstances are forcing the inevitable."
good,"Working at Walmart was definitely an experience that is great for a first job or a part time job while in school, the management definitely needs focus on better things when trying to improve departments operations"
good,Managers worked to a certain point. People constantly had negativity. The pay was alright and worth it until they started hiring so many people they had to cut hours.
good,A typical day at work is different from the last.  You never know if it is going to be a busy day or a quiet one. As for what I have learned working at Walmart is that team work is always important but not essential. Managment where I work can use a bit more ethical training.
good,Company is changing. Change is good to stay on top. However when you discount your management team and keep changes a secret unit they happen it’s difficult to lead through those changes. After 20 plus years I am disappointed in the direction we are headed when sharing the goal could alleviate the workplace tension we all have.
good,"Great place to work as a beginner, chance of moving up pretty quickly with the right skills and mind set. Management is very helpful if you have no clue on what you might be doing. Kind of a learn as you go place since one doesn't really get the proper one on one training."
good,"Very fast-pace, makes it enjoy-able because long shifts seem to go by faster. The management at the Walmart location i was at were very understanding and easy to approach."
good,"It was a faie job, it was good to have with the experience that ive learned, i got to learn how to help people, and take care of cleaning and stocking."
good,Management can do better. Pay could do better because they expected us to do way too much for just $11 a hour. Overall it is a good customer service experience.
good,Clocked in a have to report to managers to get daily tasks. While you finished these tasks you have to make sure that customers are helped if they need help.
good,Always had something to do so never had down time. All employees were nice and easy to work with. Hardest part of the job was the work/life balance some day called for long hours but was expected in the holiday seasons.
good,"It's a fast-paced friendly work environment. It does get a little stressful. The workplace culture is a little competitive, as management likes to play favorites."
good,"good environment, good benefits, opportunity to grow in the company, respect to individual, friendly, competitive place to work, customer service centered"
good,Working here can be a good experience and it also builds character. I learned how to have patience and treat every customer the same. Sometimes the management would schedule me to work out of my available days but it all worked out in the end.
good,"The location I  worked at had a dreadful energy about it. I was once a customer at this Walmart and once I was actually behind those doors and working with everyday walmart life. I realized that the energy surrounding the building wasnt pleasant. Of course every person will be nice to customers, its your job, but more importantly to your fellow peer. The latter didn't occur very often nor was there a good team aspect. Team was always spoken of but not practiced just preached."
good,"Respecto al área de cajas, el salario es bueno considerando la cantidad de horas que se trabajan (30hrs), sin embargo, sus turnos hacen que el equilibrio de la vida personal con la laboral se vea afectado, ya que la mayor parte del turno al mes, es de cierre, oses hasta las 23:00hrs, por lo que la vida personal se ve afectada. El ambiente es bueno, y orientado a la inclusión."
good,"Working for Walmart is fun, but can be stressful sometimes, management could have you working on something, and then the next minute they'd be yelling at you for not doing another thing. The actual employee's(not management) are really fun to be around, they make it worth while to go into work everyday."
good,"Very stressful days on third shift. I learned that customers are the reason you have a positive ending to your long hard day. Management was always terrible. Faced-paced, but manageable sometimes. Working night shifts was the hardest part about the job. Helping customers and fellow employees was the best part about the job."
good,If you are looking for a job that is flexible maybe for students this is the job for you. They do not offer full time but good salary. management is understanding and will accommodate for your outside of work life.
good,"The work load was due to a daily routine or on store sales, and seasonal preparation. Had great employees whom always wanted to learn and excel . Customers were great to meet and complement the work effort of the store"
good,"Walmart is an ok company to work for. Honestly it helped pay the bills and having discounts and access to merchandise is ok. My only complaints are they like to cut hours, don't really give clear advancement paths, and the pay doesn't scale well i have been there 4 years and people who just got hired at lower positions make the same or more than i do."
good,This place is a very outgoing place to work.It has lots to offer you if you want to move up in the company.managers are very fair in this company for the most part.
good,"A typical day Coming in doing my job assisting customers, I learned to be polite and focused when working with the public give the same respect you want from somebody else, I think sometimes people who manage people should treat them with the same energy they want to have."
good,Working with the right management can make the job really easy and fun. I have worked for the company for over 13 yrs and the only reason why I would leave is because the pay raise to me is not fair
good,Walmart is a good place to work with good benefits. I like discounts and mark down that they had and as associate I like to putting up the merchandise in the grocery department
good,"Always provided good food for employees on holidays."
good,Walmart is a good place to start work experience for first-time job seekers and people that want to broaden their skill set in the customer service field. The job is usually physically demanding for most departments including lifting heavy objects or standing on concrete floors for extended periods of time.
good,The only thing I didn't like about Walmart was management.. They were really rude and only thought about business and not how they made employees feel.
good,Great place to work they have very good benefits along with great workers. It can get very busy at times throughout the day. It can also get stressful if you don't have the help you need. You met great people along the way. The first time I started they gave me a schedule and then they changed it on me and didn't tell me. So I didn't show up for my first day because they didn't notified me of the schedule change.
good,I learned that team work is very crucial and important when it comes down to the daily mission. Everyone that is assigned to a task plays a very important role.
good,"Walmart was a great company to work for, they paid great for the area, my only issue with working there was their attendance point system, you only get 5 points before getting fired and it’s very easy to get to that"
good,"A career at Walmart has plenty of good and bad to it. You are given plenty of opportunities to advance to new positions and even moving laterally to other positions is encouraged! Management can be very easy to talk to about any problems you may encounter and tend to take issues seriously. Part-timers are given benefits after a year of working and are also given a 401(k). You are also given an hour long lunch period as well as two fifteen minute breaks, one before and one after your lunch."
good,Good place to work alot of help from other employees get to know one another and you get to have a steady place to work amd once you get to know your fellow employees they become like a one big giant family
good,It was okay. I would not recommend you staying there for a long time. They work you to death. Good benefits though. 401k resources available for everyone
good,I liked it at first but then they started changing the way we did things and just kept changing the way we did things and now it's just super stressful
good,"We had to change oil, and some tires a day. I learned how to change oil, change tires, and change batteries. The job really wasn’t that hard. My favorite thing about the job was getting there an getting started."
good,Walmart is the biggest and most profitable retailer in the world. They manage in order to get the most benefit from their workers. they never push it in fact everything is in such an order to extract the maximum amount work from the minimum staff.
good,Store manager should pay more attention to Night shifts as much as they do for day & evening shifts. They should train Dept. Managers & workers more instead of just throwing someone out with improper training.
good,"Maintaining employee records"
good,"Could use some training with their upper management team.Management could show some signs of thankfulness and appreciation for the associates that work for the company. I think it would be a much better workplace.,."
good,"I have worked for  Walmart for a long time, I would recommend other people to work there. The job has been good it has helped me raise my son and now is helping me to put my son through college but need more income college is very expensive so that's why I have applied to earn some more money for my family to survive."
good,If you want a job that has decent hrs and some flexabilty with you then walmart is there. Some of the management team is great to work with but others not so much
good,"Its not a terrible job but some days the machines/registers dont cooperate, sometimes the customers are rude & nasty, and often, there are slow shifts where time seems to stop. "
good,"Se bas en la atencion del cliete y el orden del area de trabajo, asi como el inventario y administracion de mercancia."
good,"Its a decent place to work if you need flexible hours or part-time. Its over all a basic work place. "
good,"pushed carts outside by myself most of the time, didn’t have any help for such a big parking lot. some of the employees were lazy and left work for others"
good,"Te da estabilidad laboral, el detalle es su sueldo"
good,Great staff helps with dealing with unfortunate people. Only thing i dislike is working my butt of and getting paid the same amount as people who just stand around doing nothing. Great company lots of benefits just low pay
good,In general.for a big corporation they're very nice to work with. I enjoyed my short stay. I worked in the apparel department which was not my first choice of departments to work but I liked it. It's a berry busy department
good,"There never seems to be enough people however you must always try to complete everything. Overall, it is not a bad place to work and it can provide a good income for minimal work depending on the job."
good,It's an okay place to work. You can tell that there is favoritism being shown towards certain employees because they get away with everything and barely do any work other than standing around talking. Most of the CSMs are cool and helpful. They have a computer that does the scheduling for them so just be aware this because if you don't change your availability once you first start it takes a while before the computer changes it for you.They have a point system also.
good,"Laid back crew, unloaded trucks in a timely manner, some managers willing to get the job done. Plenty of breaks and a lunch. Air conditioned back room."
good,"Depending which area youre in, its pretty nice. Its just the company itself that gets tiring after a while. They are always changing they're job rolls, taking jobs and replacing them with somebody else or a ""new"" and better work place. Its basically a way to rearange people so theres less people to pay and more work getting done"
good,"Review based on personal experience at stores worked, there are some stores that run the proper way. The Store Manager sets the standard for the store."
good,"This is a fast pace environment lots of lifting, pulling, stretching, and customer relations. Training is given at every aspect of your career. Great benefits."
good,"Some stores have a better management team. The management team can make or break the employee morale. Most stores are understaffed now, and a lot more are becoming under stocked. The benefits are good and they match your 401k 100% of what you put in to it up to 6%."
good,"A typical day at WalMart is the definition of ""Only at WalMart.""  Working in the Asset Protection Department, we knew a lot more than most about the general operations.  Every store is different, and the work culture all depends on the store manager and who they chose for middle and lower management.  In general, advancement can be rapid, especially in areas that are densely populated and your willing/capable of doing whatever is needed."
good,The job is easy just takes too long to get good hours. I would stay there if I had more hours but since i dont I need a better job to take care of things at home.
good,"The deli department manager at the time was harassing me and other staff. Had to leave. Before I left a new assistant manager was hired, he was very nice and actually listens to staff about problems."
good,The job is ok as a hold. But every year something change we are now on a point scale. I really don’t agree with is because as an adult we have families and children activities we would like to attend and most of the time can’t because of the job. Don’t never trust the sales on social media they are all lies just call your local store.
good,"Was with Walmart for over 15 years and while I wasn’t happy with how it ended, the overall experience was positive for me and my family. Can be long hours and feel repetitive at times, but the people I met along the way were great"
good,Nice place to work. Customers are friendly. Staff is more than willing to help. Everyday is different. Management staff is knowledgeable and professional
good,Wal-Mart offers job security. If you have the drive and desire to advance with the company it has many opportunities to offer.  Store management is very key to how each stores moral and performance.  The benefits were good.
good,"Pharmacy manager does a great job at keeping the team morale up and in good shape.  Love that we work as a team to help pharmacy run smoothly."
good,I made a $4 raise in the first two years. There are some wonderful managers who push you to see you succeed and then there are managers that set you up to save their jobs. All in all not a bad company to work for but a lot of poor managers running the establishment unfortunately.
good,It was crazy working at walmart because of the shher amount of customers you have to work with. The workloaf is also a lot compared to a lot of the other retailers.
good,It was an okay place to work. Everything is easy to find the employees are nice. Management are easy to work with you if you like have an illness or a family member.
good,"Although a day of work can become pretty busy, if you have the work ethic to do the best at your job, you will catch the eye of those in charge. Although you will work hard you still have to bare the weight of those who slack off."
good,Nice work area. Management could use more training and more managers. Other than that the overall experience was alright. Thank you for the opportunity.
good,clinical supervision for its staff and does not appear concerned about reducing risks in liability. Management is more interested in perpetuating workplace drama and instilling fear/anxiety in the clinical staff than actually leading. There is a lack of consistency in operating process/procedures and protocol which culminate in what usually looks like a hot mess. The positive of working here is that there are some amazing clinicians who are wonderfully supportive teammates. Management needs to up its game to be able to retain good clinicians
good,Training was exceptional. Benefits were great. Got promoted to a new position after 8 months. Schedule was erratic. Reviews and raises were given consistently.
good,"Depending on the manager, Walmart is a rather relaxed workplace with a sense of rush to it. There's no push to get done immediately, but there is a certain pace required. I found that pace to be rather slow and methodical."
good,Its a nice work environment co-workers are happy to you learn fast and slow pace depends on the day easy to learn always do what some one ask of you b
good,"It was a guaranteed job until they ended the overnight crew."
good,"I loved working there and I love the friends and memories I made. I miss working with the people. Sometimes the customers weren't very nice, but you just have to suck it up and continue about your day"
good,Pay is good benefits are decent nice place to work people and managers are helpful and understanding  work around your schedule. Hour lunch is nice when you need to do things
good,"While working at Wal-mart i never felt like a valuable member of the team. That's not to say i felt like i could be fired at any moment, just overlooked. Advancement to other positions seemed random and arbitrary in who was picked."
good,"Working here I learned a lot and could work most anywhere in the building.  As with any job it has it's good days and it's bad days.  The hardest part is not having enough help to get a job done. The most I miss about working here is my customers, some of the people I worked with and my vendors."
good,"•	Invoice Exceptions reconciliation"
good,It is a good place to work. They provided my hours I needed to help pay for my meds. There was no hard feelings I just needed a fresh start. Thanks for the opportunity.
good,Personally not my favourite job.  Easy job to maintain for students.  Minimum salary for minimum work somedays the job is underpaid.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with some rude customers
good,I would love working face to face with the customers and every day i would practice my codes for the overhead calls. i enjoyed having paid 15 minute breaks and ive never had an issue with any other employee while working there. i like how the encourage integrity and really put the customers first.
good,Precisava cumprir com  horário certinho dos funcionários
good,This company is moving in a new direction. It use to be about customer and the employee's and families. Now it's  not kinda disappointing. They really need to get back to their roots.
good,"Exelente lugar para aprender a trabajar bajo precion, lamentablemente te ponen muchas trabas los gerentes y subgerentes que no conocen el área, además que haces actividades que no te corresponde n como QFB."
good,wal mart is a pretty good experience I got to work at different parts of the retail store and afterwhile I learned that it could get stressful for a while.
good,This was a very friendly environment to work and get started in the work force. The management at the time was very good. Everything seem to run well. I learned my customer service skills from working at Walmart.
good,Its a great place to get your feet wet when it comes to work experience. There is more to Walmart than stocking merchandise such as human resource management and developing better marketing and business strategy through training with the management team.
good,walmart was a steady job and had great hours for department managers.  they had alot of changes which put more work onto their schedules making it harder to properly run their departments.
good,The specific Walmart that I worked at could have been better if they had managers that knew how to do their job and not depend on employees for everything.
good,"Um ótimo lugar para se trabalhar, apesar de não ser tão fácil se lhe dar com os clientes, trabalhando como operadora aprendi a ter mais paciência e até mesmo compreender mais as pessoas, no caso a se coloca no lugar delas."
good,Wasn't at Walmart long enough to do a thorough review of the environment. Overall had a decent working environment from the few months I worked there.
good,"Avisar y mantener el mayor contacto, sobre la información importante, para con los superiores haciendo  uso de la atención  y respeto de los servicios RH quien favorece en proporcionar y capacitar e integrar de nuevo a laborar, lo que es: éxito."
good,Each store has good and bad things. It was great working at a store with a good team. Stores with not such a good team were tough. People a generally good but everything depends on what your store manager wants to do and their personality.
good,When I started at Walmart I had a good working environment but now it's not like that. The policies have changed and do not favor the employee only the company. The pay for the department manager is very poor. At least I can say that Walmart has good benefits for employees and that being promoted doesn't take long.
good,If I did not have to relocate the advancement opportunity is wonderful here as long as you prove yourself. It is about attitude. Any job is what you make it and how much you care you are performing.
good,Aprendes mucho y te dan la oportunidad para desarrollarte pero a la vez te limitan a muchas cosas
good,A typical day of work as a customer service manager was extremely busy and stressful. It involved watching over all of the employees in the front end and making sure everything was running smoothly and properly.
good,"I honestly liked working for Walmart, I just don’t agree with some of the newer rules that were added to the company policy and not thoroughly explained to associates."
good,"I loved working at Walmart, I always felt valued there. I worked hard but we also had lots of fun. It was like family and I found it very hard to leave when I moved away"
good,"I learned many valued skills with my time at Wal-Mart, but restructuring of departments was not good for many employees.  There are layoffs almost every year as well."
good,"Walmart was always fun. Everyday was different "
good,I was lucky in that I had a great management team but I felt like I was at work more than home. When applying to move up in the company I was never promoted and was told that when they have associates they know they can count on to cover any job they want to keep them where they can use it to their advantage. Training was very thorough and they made sure we knew how to do our jobs. Benefits were great and great stock options.
good,Well with what you do at Walmart this only depends on where you work. Where I worked you really have to multitask and do a lot at once but it’s a pretty good job
good,No pude cumplir con el horario ya que tuve una bebe
good,"good place to work if you like fast paced environments. great place to learn many retail skills. always busy, and lots of new and familiar faces to see everyday."
good,"Communication skills, people being productive in a timely manner, poor management. Walmart can be a good place to work but management doesn't communicate well with all associates."
good,Very upbeat Fast Pace working plenty of Duties to do for each individual stay busy and uphold customer service at all times on the sales floor sometimes could be a little frustrating and felt like the task that were expected work too much for an individual
good,"Extremely fast paced work environment. There are always customers you can never please no matter how nice you are to them or how much you try to help them out. I have learned how to become a leader, how to transfer calls, to try to keep the stress level down, and to just do your best if you are having trouble with a certain task. The managers are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet (Lumberton Wal~Mart). The hardest part would be keeping the hot box full while taking orders, and slicing meats/cheeses. The most enjoyable part is when you are able to make a fellow associate/customer smile, and hearing from customers you're doing a great job even in the midst of all the chaos, of course you can't forget about payday."
good,Working at Walmart was an ok job. While working there I could tell that it wasn't a long term job. The employees either liked the job or hated it. The pay at Walmart was good besides everything else.
good,Working at Walmart can be rewarding as long as you have management that is willing to help you grow.  the major problem with Walmart is they don't have a good work culture.  the morale can be very low depending on the store that your at.
good,It's a good job if you're desperate. Don't work there if you're trying to make a career. Only work there until you find a better job opportunity. This company is not worth wasting precious time and energy. Not worth the pay or lack of promotions to people who work hard and deserve it.
good,"Ok pay at the time, 1 hour lunches and 2 15 minute breaks, Fast work pace Managers sometimes do cookout for us. gives us free drinks on hot days. Only problem is that policy is really strict, they are picky about everything and you can get in trouble easy."
good,la empresa es una de las mejores en la que he prestado mis servicios sin embargo existen malos administradores que hacen que la imagen de la misma se deteriore.
good,Okay place to work kept you busy.  Fast pace work place I did have to pick up heavy items.  You never do have a set schedule so your days off would more likely be split days off.
good,Work would start at 2pm and the back rooms where never cleaned out. The management didn't have a clue what they where doing half the time. The pay was decent.
good,I did above and beyond when it came to working there I picked up slack for others when which of course I didn’t mind I was flexible where I was working and what I did as long as I was trained for it but there were times I wasn’t doing jobs that I had no idea how to do professionally or correctly for that matter because of lack of management plus they expected me to come in after they changed my schedule without telling me I hd a printed schedule so if you don’t have internet access like me that can be a problem
good,"The job itself was a breeze and actually fun with new challenges each day. Co-workers were always motivated and pushed each other  to complete the daily goals. Management was sub-par, seeming as if the did not care about the average worker. Management would lie to employees."
good,"typical day as an ordrfiller is a long 12 hour shift with over 5,000 cases thrown a day. "
good,Walmart should have more employees and crosstrain everyone in different areas. However i would recommend working there. I enjoyed it and met alot of awesome people . The idea to crosstrain benefits company and helps an employee to advance quickly.
good,You have to have the drive within to benefit for this place . It can open up opportunities but if you sit back and wait other will fill in the spots .
good,"A typical day at Walmart for me is working in the electronic department. There, we stock movies and clean the display windows around the department. We assist customers and answers questions that the customers might have for us. We organized the department and make sure the movies and other merchandise are in there correct location. I really love my coworkers because they are great workers and we get our jobs done. The manager don't really need to monitor us because we are all responsible and dependable. "
good,There was work life balance. The hours were great but there was no opportunity for advancement. The culture is poor and the working conditions are terrible and very intense due to loading and unloading trucks alone.
good,Tiene muchas areas de oportunidad sin embargo es poco flexible con los horarios para las personas que estudian
good,ok place to work never enough help to run it the way they it needs to be to give the customer a great experience. always seem to be catching up. wages are difficult to maintain quality life. Other than that decent play to work.
good,I started as a cashier. Quick advancement when it is needed for the company. I became dept.mgr. within 4 months. Absolutely lovef my job. Poor management within my immediate supervisor was the problem. No really willing to pay overtime either.
good,"Walmart needs better management. I work as Ap and manager of lawn & garden. Upper management has bad commercial skills, everyone does thing differently"
good,I left walmart because they had no one willing to help you with anything you try to do. Then when did they only help some of the people. Management had their picks throughout the store.
good,Very nice co workers and management team. Walmart has an excellent HR team that will answer your questions right away. The management team is always willing to help out in any situation.
good,"every day stress stress stress, managers talk top u like you are an idiot your treated like a herd on a farm its very degrating i am looking for work else where but til then i will work and give my 100 percent no matter what.."
good,"Wal-mart has great benefits programs, just not a great Hourly rate, especially when you live in Hawaii or think about how much revenue Walmart brings in. They should be a top paying employer."
good,"Comencé como cajero, luego ascendí como auxiliar o encargado de línea de cajas, trabaje un tiempo como repositor, recepción, atención al cliente y piso de ventas y claims. Actualmente me desempeño en el sector de piso de ventas en el sector de hardline electro."
good,"Worked here for just about 4 years at a neighborhood, i was Friends with associates and management for most of the time even going to gyms and fundraisers with management. At the end of it they were trying to trick me into getting fired and when i was not making PTO they said i was dumb and didn't know what i was talking about and was even paid out 2 months for the missing PTO. when things work there great when they don't people will use you and lie to get what they want"
good,"Walmart are a great place to work great team players. Keep smiles on others faces. Mostly a good and fast day due to the rate on which were working, you tend not to notices how times flies.It can be a big job but putting the customers first and making them happy makes me happy."
good,I started out as a cashier. Management helped me moved over to the Vision Center. My manager was very sweet and understanding. The Vision Center has it's own schedule and sales to meet.
good,"Its a good job for people looking to go to school the schedule is flexible, mangers are really good. Pay is better than most part time jobs you'll find, You have no vacation time, you have to work 40 hours for 1 hour I believe. But there is room for moving up if you're interested."
good,It's okay if you're young when the older you need to make money you can't pay bills off of minimum wage in a shifting schedule all the time livernois and what days are hours you're working
good,but stressful very stress ful not what i was looking for not a good job mgmt not to nice but sometimes they are friendly other timethey let u gos not if u miss days
good,"The hours are weird and the schedule can be difficult if early hours aren't your thing. Each day you come in and pick as quick as you can but on busy days you end up staying late, especially if someone calls in. It's not very rewarding because when you have overtime you have to cut it by taking longer lunches and leaving early."
good,"This place is nice to work for. For 16 years I have worked this company, I have seen a lot of change in the company. Many people coming and going. Moving up the ranks and some into their own stores. It gives you many choices to better your job skills. And now the company are adding more benefits for their employees."
good,worked here after high school and while going to college. the part time work was suitable for the needs at the time. left to pursue my career with my degree.
good,Sometimes I feel like sleep twice a day juist because my shift at walmart is overnight. The management is pretty chill. Honestly they don't care they jsut need you to be at work and do your part.
good,"I worked at Walmart for three years. I enjoyed my coworkers, and the pay was decent. If you do decide to work there be prepared to do a lot of hard physical work and have a large amount to complete before the end of your shift. Upside is good pay and lots of room for advancement. Downside is benefits aren’t great, physically demanding, and stressful at times."
good,"work was not that bad. Pay was though. I think they offer more money to start then when i worked there. Flexible hours, but they are a stickler about not getting too many hours"
good,"its ok, It really relax. As long as you show up for work you wont get fired. The people there are really fun as long as you can make friends. It's not stressful."
good,"Walmart, is a good starter job, there is always places and opportunities to move up as long you prove yourself and give it your all. Only down fall, no set hours unless you are management."
good,Walmart was a nice place to work. Very organized and efficient workers and friendly enough. The shifts were nice and long hours. Well spaced lunch breaks. The staff helped as much as the could about flexibility.
good,"Really enjoyed working remodel, I like doing labor jobs. The people I worked with were cool and the managers were good at what they did. Its good hard work that I enjoyed."
good,"Great company and great benefits ,ability to relocate,able to cross train ,family oriented,training programs are excellent,aboriginal change your career at any time"
good,Walmart has high expectations for hourly and management associates all the same. Ample opportunity for advancement as long as you are willing to give up a lot of personal and family time.
good,Its a great place to work and at the time when I was there I think they could've pay use a little more but I think it has gotten better now over the years
good,"I have worked pretty much everywhere in the store and the pay is worth what little work you do in most positions. There are a few that I personally think should pay more, but that is a corporate decision."
good,It was as though the longer you were there the more they tried to shove you out the door. The more you gave them of yourself the more they took away.!
good,Es muy buena empresa buenas prestaciones lo malo de ahí son los dirigentes ya que sólo ven por su propio veneficio. Te alientan y prometen muchos cursos para que saques mayor producción pero ala mera hora se hace y tienes que estar detrás de ellos casi rogandoles o al menos que seas lambiscon puede que te echen la mano se sientes duelos d ela empresa.
good,They are all different I got lucky and had a good one.  People tend to get stuck in there jobs and not move up.  Management tends to favor management 'lower' workers get left out
good,"I evened out most of my scores because I’ve worked in two Walmart locations. Store 383 (Silsbee, TX) was amazing. Coworkers were close, management was great, and they were very understanding of scheduling conflicts, as long as they were aware at least 2 weeks in advance. However, store 1253 (Austin, TX) was MISERABLE. Coworkers (and some management) never learned each other’s names. Nobody spoke to each other, even productively. Managers were vague with instruction and refused to elaborate. Management would deny requested time off, regardless of reason (including family obligations, like a family members scheduled surgery date, requested over a MONTH in advance). I was consistently scheduled for times I could not work (I.e. during times I had class at UT, times outside my regular availability, etc) That store was a nightmare."
good,"Once everyone gets on the same page, then everything will run smoothly. I do not have the patience for that. If you can tolerate being in a cold environment for extended periods of time, then this is the job for you. You will be well compensated."
good,"The manager I had was beyond amazing! I loved her way of explaining things and taking the time to actually show how things would get done, and then we did them. It was fun to spend time with breaks with her. She never seperated herself from us and went where we were to make sure we could do what we needed to do, and even helped out if needed. Nothing was hard to do. The manager I had was the best and haven't seen a better one."
good,"replenishing daily outs, completing processes meeting the needs of customers, team members, setting modulars  and creating displays. unloading trucks, assisting in areas where needed"
good,"I did seasonal work at Walmart.  The management was very friendly.  The seasonal work is a little more fast-paced.  Walmart is open 24 hours, so there are opportunities for different work schedules."
good,"The regional managers are very rude and bossy, and don’t know a thing about actually working in our positions. They only know numbers that machines spit at them. Salaried management tends to be lazy and won’t own up to their mistakes"
good,"I did not enjoy my time at Walmart. It was a slow paced working environment and I wasn't able to get 20 hours a week. They weren't flexible with me needing more hours and I ended the job with working bout 10 hours a week, sometimes even less."
good,"Busy and short handed"
good,with my experience at Walmart I call say walmart is a good company to work for they invest on education i got my ged through them and start business school with their help . In other hand the management at the store where I worked is a totally different thing.
good,As far as Wal-Mart it's a great job but for this particular Wal-Mart was ran by terrible management and it backfired on all of us workers because they were not doing their job.
good,"Work environment really does depend on the store. It is a solid job if managers are not power hungry. It is also better in larger stores, smaller stores feel more confined."
good,"Decent salary, inconsistent work schedule, good rapport with management, hardest part was being extra nice to fussy customers, but most enjoyable was comradrie with favorite co workers and nice customers.customers."
good,I loved working at wal-mart all except for the store manager at the time honestly didn't do her job efficiently. But otherwise great environment to work in.
good,i worked at a neighborhood market where your advancement wasnt based on how well you worked but more so who you knew and how well they liked you. the workers were often rude and unprofessional and when brought to manager attention it went by unresolved making me have no other choice but find other employment because i was not comfortable with my work area. also the managers only made set rules when the cooperate office came to visit the building.
good,Wal-Mart is not the place for a long twalmart is the most stressful job Ive ever had and can't predict what they will do next. management don't care about your needs anything good for you is bad for them.
good,The managers we had at the time I worked there weren't all too peachy and I'm a firm believer it trickled down from manage.e t to the employees. The atmosphere at work was tough. Everyone would pretty much be exhausted with the next and it just made work heavier or some.
good,Cuentan con varios departamento de los cuales puedes aprender diferentes habilidades
good,I loved stocking and getting to meet new people and working in different areas. It was great to always learn something new in different areas. I liked stocking so I could see all the new stuff we had
good,"Working for wall Mart is kind of a mixed bag , on one hand you can get great managers and co-workers and on the other hand you can get managers who have No people skills and have you wondering how the got the position they hold"
good,Working for Walmart is enjoyable most of the time when you're able to do the job you we're hired for.  It's a challenge when you have to do multiple persons jobs.
good,",Normal retail job. Nothing stands out, Stock shelves check products and assist customers with purchases. Some days are stressful,,, black Friday for instance, Others are calm and relaxed."
good,"My experience at Walmart was okay. My hours were graveyard. My position was stocking orders we received/restocking items left behind by customers, as well as helping customers on the floor if they ever had a question on an item or needed to be directed to a certain item."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of friendly customers in the morning who are a pleasure to help with all of the following : refund merchandise, cash checks, send money, answer any inquiries. "
good,Balancing  work and family can be challenging with this company. You must plan well in advance. The management varies from location to location.  Some managers are very hands on and are excited about the department doing well and other appears to be somewhat intimidated so you have to constantly extend an olive branch to form an alliance. The company is establishing initiatives where the two departments have to work together for the success of the team which has proven to be beneficial to a great extent. It helps to have a great  Market Director that assists you in this endeavor
good,Walmart is a good place to maintain a job when you need one. Best for younger groups of people who have lots of energy to run around and complete tasks. Easy manual labor.
good,Walmart offers a great starting point for those who are just starting to get into the retail business. They give you the basic skills and experience needed for working a retail job as well any future job.
good,"Easy Job, good benefits, good pay for my area, full time hours even for people hired part time. Good job for people wo stay to themselves at work but also have excellent customer service."
good,Empresa boa de se trabalhar ambiente muito bom .política boa a gente sempre é ouvidos quando precisamos.
good,Walmart was very fun to work for. Lots of drama and gossip between staff which made it very difficult to work there because everyone was in your business.
good,Good place to start especially for young people or people going to school. You have to decide how far you want to go at Walmart and what you are willing to do or not do to accomplish that goal.
good,I loved working at walmart learned a lot about retail. Most of the people there really want you to do good and expand your work.  I feel as tho walmart is a good first job.
good,I like it but they take everything that is said about you seriously .More money a hour would be nice .Better management .Better and respectful Csm.Respect goes both ways
good,"Unloading stock in shipping area, Working alone was usually how your day went. Management would stop by to check on productivity.  Hardest part is getting rid of all the stock that comes in."
good,"I've had many great opportunities at Walmart, but i feel as if they have nothing else to offer me. I've learned valuable life lessons while working here that I'm very thankful for, but it's time for something new."
good,"It was fun for the most part, management is pretty bad at everything though. The job is fairly easy though and the people you meet are great. It’s different every day"
good,I'm a ppl person so it was retail entertainment with nice coworkers. Would perhaps accept Security Officer position. Looking for a driving job locally. thanks
good,it was a great and relaxed atmosphere for a young worker like myself really don't know why I'm writing on behalf of Walmart but here it is. your terrible welcome
good,A typical workday consist of getting prepared for your day by getting your plans in play to execute goals to accomplish. I've learned how to manage multiple associates at one time to get things done. The management wasn't always supportive of your ideas and often times micro managed alot. Workplace culture is very stressful and you're always on the go. Hardest part of job was balancing home and work life. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,First they teach people how to do the job. Each associate have two week to learn what he has to work. Than old associate help him to understand fast the job.
good,"I enjoyed working along side people I considered friends. Enjoyed the hours, the work, and the pay! Toughest part of the job was only the sun, haha! Will work here again given the chance!"
good,"working at walmart was good. the teach a lot of things. how to work as customer service and cashier, working with people was fun and helping them what they need."
good,Walmart on Cap Team 2 is a very physical but not strenuous job. You get an hour lunch as well as a 15 minute break every 2 hours. Management is always on top of things in a firm but not rude kind of way. Most enjoyable part is when i can relax and just stock my isle and focus on work.
good,"For the store I was at, co workers LOVED to start drama, reminded me of being in high school all over again. Other than that, not a bad job, fixed hours fairly easy job"
good,"Walmart offer great and quick advancment oppurtunities if you are willing to work for them. It seems hard to advance up into salaried management as an internal, because it relies on your Asm and the store manager backing your advancement. So they can stall and delay you accordingly. There is a great ability to transfer around the store and become cross trained in many departments. And with the institution of the Walmart Academies the training for management positions is fantastic. I have a great respect for what Walmart is trying to accomplish."
good,It is a great environment but the company as a whole just doesn’t offer enough pay or pay raises to make it a reliable source to provide for a family.
good,"The day would start off good then the manager would come over and talk to you about how you are not doing the job at hand incorrectly. They would kind of talk to you loudly in front of customers and other employees. they would embarrass you. they didn't care if you were at the company for and long time or a new employee. "
good,The work is not hard as long as you’re focused on going in and getting it done. The management and leads look out for what’s best for them to look like the ones who are calling all the shots and doing the most work. They care about their advancement and that only. If you get it the way of that then you become a target and not talking about a huge target! It’s best to stay to yourself and do your job and them some because you never know they may even get onto you for not doing more than your 110%. You can be the best everyday and for months on shine but as soon as you slow down even just a little they will begin to as what’s wrong and why aren’t you doing as much even if it’s atill above goal. To managment the goal is a suggestion and the ones who are doing the work fastest always have to catch the “team” up who are slacking and don’t get in trouble because they are on special projects for production.
good,My coworkers made my job very enjoyable but sometimes the days felt long. I did enjoy having two consistent days off. Management was pretty good but the hardest part was probably standing for long periods at a time.
good,This is a great company to work for. Easy work fast paste time goes by quick when your really working. Managers arent the best but it is a all round good place to work with decent pay.
good,"Being retired, Walmart was a ok place to work. as a bike assembler, I was able to work at a pace that was good for me. I didn't have anyone telling me what to do and when. The only problem was that I was in the same area as the truck unloaders."
good,was really nice place to work in the beginning. i just focus on taking care of my customers... getting my work completed and helping other as a team player...
good,"Really liked the people that I worked/currently work with. Made a lot of good friends and met a lot of good people. There are always opportunities to advance and grow in this company but you really have to have a certain attitude in order to get into management roles. But if you work hard and put a lot of effort into your work, it does get recognized. However, there are some downfalls to this company. While some members of management and higher-ups (supervisors, department managers, etc) were friendly, others were a bit cold and off. Some managers showed clear favoritism and would treat others differently."
good,This job can be challenging at time. It can be quite busy at times but really makes the time fly by. You can really have fun with customers. Some of the work can be hard with heavy lifting. I took pride in the trays that I made. The one thing I didn't like about one of the stores is the fact they didn.t take the time to introduce themselves to me.
good,"typical day can vary. there are a number of primary tasks like stocking shelves, taking back cardboard to the bailer, clocking in and out for arrival, departure and lunches but can range from to plenty of other things. making a bale, cleaning up a mess either you or a customer make, pushing carts in the parking lot, shoveling snow outside..etc. I think a lot of people either quit early with this job or stay a long time because they have built quality relationships with people. Hardest part of the job is dealing with managers telling you one thing and then changing it within minutes or the next day. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with people you can get along with."
good,"Empresa e associados agregam bastante no dia a dia porem a questao de muitos superiores embolam o dia a dia tanto de associados tanto como de lideres , fazem perder o foco e objetivo da empresa, politica da empresa muito interessante porem pouco praticada!! mais experiencia valida que se leva para uma vida toda trabalhar e tamanha empresa."
good,Fast paced environment lazy management. Management doesn’t seem to care. Customers were a bonus to this job. Definitely will be sad to leave the customers.
good,Es una empresa líder donde puedes crecer y tener un buen ambiente  de trabajo
good,"Most Days weren't so bad."
good,we ended up getting a new store manager and her idea where a whole 360 to what we were used to. it seemed like it was her way or no way and she wouldn't give any one a chance to voice an input. because of that a lot of the employees felt like the store was just going down hill fast and didn't enjoy working anymore
good,"Fast pace - time passes by"
good,"I was working for Walmart for 7 years,  The staff at Walmart was very nice and they worked well with me.  It felt like a family in the sense that sometimes we might have our disagreements but we would always find a way to work them out so that the pharmacy ran smooth."
good,"WalMart can be a very relaxing place to work, or it can be a very stressful place to work depending on who is managing and the shift/roll you're taking on."
good,"Job was great, people where great, great work environment. only complaint would be that it wasn't enough hours and unless your willing to make your shift availability extremely flexible they won't give you more hours and the pay was very low for the cost of living in the area."
good,"the job was not bad but they wanted me to do to much for what i was making for example the had me acting as manager at nights and i was not payed the salary for it doing any of the managers tasks, so when a job came a crossed i took it and i have been there since then."
good,"When I started working to this company, it was fun place to work for, however, over the years, different managers it got change the work environment. At one point it was fun."
good,Have worked for Walmart for 6 years and they have had its ups and downs. Like any other place of employment it has it's good days and it has it's bad days.
good,great company to work for. management needed improvement (supervisors). Corporate can pick and choose who works in a store instead of giving the store management the power to do so hurts the stores productivity.
good,Walmart pays decent but loves cutting hours. Also provides aetna insurance which is good. Management is not good. Worked there nearly 2 years and the environment was not good
good,its unfair the way managment treat associates.they put you to do things its not on job description..the only thing i like about walmart is to help out customers
good,its been a ok review at walmart. im just looking for a better job to advance myself in life.Great custumers at walmart. but can a stressful place of how they treat the employees.
good,"Some pharmacies are well ran, while others are not, is all I will say!"
good,You will focus on maintaining 6 registers and report shrink and damages. During the day there about 5 peak periods where the store is busy. Often we are understaff which means workers are forced to pull others weight . I do enjoy the hour lunch.
good,O ambiente é bem agradável de trabalha apesar de ser uma empresa de supermercado.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy.  I liked how busy everyone had to be. It helped me further my range with customer service. "
good,"The work had me sweating perfusley , walmart is a large company so the inventory had to be sorted in steps of recieving, sorting, Stocking and it vas various amount of merchandise a lot."
good,"I would work there again as management if given the chance. I like working with the customers, I had customers that were very nice and were regulars . I also had my share of unhappy customers but I have never left with someone ending up being unhappy."
good,"•	Responsible for ensuring that customers are satisfied with their shopping experience by investigating, researching and resolving inquiries and complaints."
good,Good starter job and advancements are possible if you are willing to work and move.  Management is good with the exception of getting rid of lazy co-workers.
good,"Working here has provided me great work experience. It was fun and all the managers were really helpful. The job was kind of hard but with their help, it made any task easier."
good,Wal-Mart DC has a weekday schedule of Monday-Thursday and weekend schedule of Friday-Sunday.   Great for people who goes to school.   You can one day move up to a manager if you have a degree
good,Walmart isn't as bad as some people make make it out to be but it definitely has it downsides especially when you have to pick up the slack of coworkers.
good,"I typical day at work is pretty slow then gradually picks up making it pretty fast paced. I learned a lot about food and health codes . I wouldn't really say that anything about the job was hard. It was all pretty simple tasks that required more movement than anything. The most enjoyable part was building relationships with the customer, especially the ones with children since I was over the sweets. We would generally hand out cookies and samples to the customers which often times would strike interesting conversations about the product."
good,"A typical day at work would be saying the same things to customers as they went through your cash, very easy and repetitive work. I learned a lot about what it is like on the other side of the cash register and how to give change quickly haha. Management was alright but did not want you to take sick days and took a long time to get back to you on basically anything. Workplace culture was almost like a second family as people were very kind and talked about their lives and things of that nature when on breaks together. Hardest part of the job was standing and repeating the same task over and over for hours, the most enjoyable part of the job would be talking with nice customers :)"
good,Depending on the day it can be either really busy or really slow sometimes there can be a happy medium where its steady. I learned a lot. The management team is wonderful and will work with you as long as you work with them.
good,I worked here long enough to see that the managers there were very rude and self centered and though that was just my experience I would recommend that those who apply strongly try to get a “feel” for the people they’ll be working with.
good,"Overall , the pay is good when you are a teenager with no bills but as an adult , no. They won’t give out over time or let you come in days they actually need somebody. Poor management poor customer service very unorganized and many rude managers."
good,"Walmart overall is a good company to work for. I heard many horrible stories about how they don't offer benefit and they work you full time hours. Those are lies. Sometimes there is no organization when giving directions coming from managers. This is is why its best to pay attention learn your job(even if its on your own). Whatever your job is be present (mentally and physically). If you show good work ethic and come to work you shouldn't have any problems. "
good,"Policies are great in theory, but impractical during day to day operations. Customer service is always first, but retaliation for unfinished tasks during a shift creates a conflict in shift prioritizing."
good,"Great job if you just got out of school and need to have an income, beyond that not really that great of a place.  Customers ruin working any retail job.  Although the flexible hours are great in balancing the work and home life."
good,"Was only a temporary position for the remodel at my local store in Mason. Left for a better job opportunity, that didn't end up working out. Got to learn how to operate a forklift which was a great experience. The managers were super nice and relaxed."
good,This job has helped me with my speed on the register and helping customers send money receive money cash in their checks and what the laws are in sending money it is helped me a lot and understanding returns and customers
good,Walmart has a great structure for growth of the employee. I went from no pharmacy experience to a nationally certified pharmacy technician. Walmart likes to promote from within. Walmart has great benefits and the flexibility to allow people to work around their own schedules.
good,It has it's good and bad days but at the ruston store managers talk to you any kind of way and never listen to what you have to say. There is no halliday pay
good,"Nice pay, fun coworkers but managers were rude, not motivated and very self centered. Managers always forgot about breaks and were rude when reminded."
good,"Some of the manager where great."
good,"Work freight, help customers, zone aisles, pick orders. Happy, yet a bit stressful at times and fast paced. End of the year holidays are always fun!!!"
good,"All day is spent scanning items and bagging them for customers. When it's slow, you stock and zone the front end around the registers. You get to talk to every sort of person out there, so it can be interesting depending on the customers."
good,"I was in the electronics department. Didn't learn anything new. Management was okay, at least to me. The culture was alright with everyone else around me."
good,"I would scan upc barcodes on items, fruits, and vegetables. would reload prepaid visa and gift cards. there would be 4 to 5 digit codes or numbers that I would have to remember."
good,"Good company and pay is good. But be willing to work and don’t expect a lot of overtime except for around the holidays."
good,"la compañia tiene una muy buena cultura, se generan desarrollos de carreras en los puestos mas bajos"
good,"a lot of people come through"
good,"Productive and great job to have plus the wages are fantastic. It’s a good company to be with if you really wanted to work... pay rates, have all kinds of difficult shifts..."
good,Physically demanding job.Very fast paced and the job seems to get harder every day.  As with most companies they are always trying to be innovative but sometimes change isn't necessary. The schedule is good because I get a lot of time with my family but that also means lower work hours. Hours fluctuate from 27-40 per week.
good,"Walmart is okay, it really depends on the management. Not all are cool and willing to work with you. But it is a good starter job for people just out of high school."
good,I liked working there but the cost of living is so high and the pay just didn't cut it. I need to make more money for the cost of living. I have kids.
good,Great company. Former employee. Pay is great. Benefits are ok. High stress job. Rude customers. Sometimes u as a employee are not treated fairly. U are only a number.
good,I worked at Walmart during one of the many upgrades. It's not a bad place to work. It has great opportunities to move up in management. They great benefits. Pay is average depending on experience.
good,"Supervisors & Managers were pretty cool & helpful. I mainly worked as a cart pusher & there would usually be at least one other cart pusher or two of them to help me on my same shift or they would come later on their shift. On some occasions though I would be alone on my entire shift if someone called out for whatever reason. Now sometimes management would send an associate from inside the store to help out if it got too busy, with carts filling up everywhere outside & the inside a lot of carts used by customers. I liked most of the people I worked with though. The position after a while can be physically tasking, especially in the summer time. We were also responsible for helping with customers groceries & also helping other associates with carry out items. Using the Cart Machine was cool but you need to be careful using it as carts can fly into vehicles if you don't use it right."
good,"I only worked there for a short time, but I can say that a normal day as a stockman consisted of either pushing carts for 9 hours, or cleaning the bottle machines for 5 hours. Since I was working part time, my schedule was all over the place... Little to no consistency. That aside, my coworkers were friendly and the management agreed to help with any issues that I had. I would recommend working here if it's your first job, but maybe not as a career choice. Also, tons of benefits."
good,"It helped me learn how to stock things and I got to meet new people , it was a interesting work experience. I enjoyed the hour lunch breaks . Gave me time to go home & check on my kids ."
good,I didn’t love it and didn’t hate it. Took a pay cut to work somewhere else just because I needed experience in a different field. They are always looking for managers and hardworking employees are often rewarded.
good,"The customers and my fellow hourly associates kept me coming back. However, cashiers are a dying breed. They feel self checkouts are better and more cost efficient. Customers tell me "" I don't get paid to scan my items, you do. I'll never use those machines"" And more and more positions are being done away with. So moving up in the company WAS my idea upon my hire date. But the longer i was employed, the less interested I became in moving up. And the more i realized, that Wal-Mart is now all about Business, and not their associates (who are the gears that make the company what they are). I loved my store manager and only a couple managers had a bad attitude. Their bad attitude came from being overloaded with tasks as they continue to cut positions. I was loyal to Wal-Mart, untill Wal-Mart showed me they were not loyal to me. And that when it comes down to it, even if you are the best in your store and work harder then everyone else, to Home Office, you are just a number. Now that Sam Walton has passed, all the morals that came with him, have left Wal-Mart."
good,"Daily duties varied depending upon departments worked, which were layaway, courtesy booth, cash register, Customer service manager and sporting goods."
good,"After 5 years with Walmart & working every position almost & worked at 9 different walmart stores in Orlando, I can tell you a lack of leadership & teamwork is almost in all Walmart stores in Orlando Fl. I have had great opportunities but they fall short when the company can’t seem to figure out how to have stores run were the picture is team work is dream work. Because honestly the consistency always lacks due to this main objective they seem to lack. After many communications & deligations traning classes and so on I decided it’s time for me to move on to a business I can actually work with a motivated team and grow!!"
good,at first my manager wasnt very helpful and didnt tell me where or when I had to work but aside from that actually working the register it wasnt bad people were generally nice. I learned how to check people out and  work a register. It wasnt really a hard job. I wouldn't say it was enjoyable but it was a good entry job
good,"A typical day at work is fine once you learned the routine at the appropriate times."
good,"I really enjoyed the management pushing us to go faster and do better, but even if you beat your personal best or others there was no benefit to it. Those that worked slowly at their own pace got the same praise for doing 1/2 as much or less, so in the end they actually did less to make the same amount of money or more."
good,On a normal day as soon as I'd clock in we'd unload a truck usually taking 2 and half hours. After we finish take a 15 minute break and start stocking grocer. We'll usually have a remix (pallets with groceries from all isles) truck arrive which we will also need to stock all of which will mean we have to double our speed on finishing the grocery which demotivates most of us. Some of the time we do not finish everything meaning we have to stay over and get overtime. Management is very strict. Most people in the workplace are good to get along with. Hardest part of  job is getting all the grocery stocked. Enjoyable part is lunch time.
good,"If you are interested in moving up the ladder, Walmart will help you. My heart just wasn't in the job and that is why I left. Many of my coworkers were promoted and a few of them became assistant managers at other stores. If this is the work you are into then Walmart is a good choice."
good,"As a cashier , the job wasnt too bad. The customers in the washington blvd area are a little rude but hey thats retail. As a whole it was an okay job , but its seems like its less cashiers to keep up with the demand of people shopping. Which can leave stress to the employees. Overall its a good company with okay benefits, but something to depend on for a lifetime just to get by a couple years."
good,"Working at Walmart is difficult to describe.  I preferred to work when fewer managers were working.  I could focus on my department (Sporting Goods) and I believe that translated into more sales by me.  I had repeat customers coming to my department just to do business with me because I could give them good information.  But, managers just need a body to fill in a hole which meant my department was left with no clerk.   I thought that was counter productive to sales and to the customers.   I got the feeling the ""leadership"" in Arkansas was disconnected from the employees and had no clue on how to service and keep good customers."
good,I loved the job and all that  had learned working for the company. There is lots of room for growth. It also allowed for opportunities for traveling and learning more about the department.
good,Management is very easy to get along with. Pay isn't the best but it's higher than minimum wage. It took me awhile to get full time but if you work hard you can earn it and it's benefits. Being promoted is somewhat easy but most of the time not worth it for most positions.
good,"They treated me well , the people were wonderful."
good,Walmart was a great company to work for. Helping other customers everyday was really an enjoyment and learning new techniques as well helped expand your mind
good,productive and fun work place with competitive wages. The way the management runs the store needs to be handled better expecially when the departments are short staff.
good,Good environment to work and great benefits and very good quarterly bonuses and good co workers and you can learn a lot while you are working there. The management team was decent
good,Over all not a bad experience. I learned a lot about cars that I didnt know before . They have good things and bad things about them just like any company.
good,in a typical day i would stock freight do price changes and bring down my top stock. Once a week i would need to change out any features that were looking low or if others were coming in. I have learned a lot with Walmart and they have taught me a lot about managing other associates. hardest part of working for Walmart along with any other retail would be not always having enough associates to help our customers.
good,"A typical day at wal-mart was fast paced ,busy and fun. always something to do days always went by quick. Management was very helpful and friendly and always had a open door policy."
good,Excellent verbal and math skills and car maintenance and light bulbs responsible for vehicle maintenanace and light care like oil changes and rotations
good,It seems that the war-mart culture changed while I worked there...startred when the store where first being introduced to canada...had many opportunities to advance
good,Walmart is a very stressful place to work. A lot of managers were not fully trained at the time. They treat you like you are a nobody. Its a very busy business .
good,"would be crazy at first,had 2 hrs to unload the truck then pull stuff to floor after lunch would stock groceries rest of the night,om weekends just random stocking"
good,It's fun to work at but they need to offer more because people have two jobs to support themselves.. management is not always great.. they always hiring but people quit..
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and helping customers.  The hardest part of the job was working with angry customers.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and still have contact with some of them.
good,Upper management not store level are very unappreciative. I worked there for 19 years and when I left the moral was the worst I have seen in 19 years. The people at store level are not the ones to blame for the lack of service Walmart customers are provided.
good,They typically want employers to show up and be on time. Attendance is a strict policy to adhere to and they take tardiness extremely serious. It is possibly one of the most diverse places to work for.
good,Walmart is a steady and busy company to work for and it offers a lot of things but it has its good days and bad it all depends on what time of the month it is.
good,Overall great place to work. Management was okay but not very strict. I loved my job here and what I did but the management was poor in my opinion. Doesn't pay well enough for a family or even single person living. A great first job to get experience or build quickly if you're detail oriented and a hard worker.
good,My typical day at work was not bad. It could have been better with management not making it seem like they were punishing you every time you were sick or had to take time off because you were sick or had to go to the hospital. Other than that management was fine. That would have been fantastic.... The most enjoyable part of my job was going home.
good,"The store was always busy and we never had enough cashiers "
good,"The good days outweighed the bad, walmart is a great place to work at if you never had a job, lots of different stuff and positions to learn from all you have to do is ask, benefits as well are pretty amazing but it really depends on management"
good,Working at walmart was a challenging deal for the pay that we received. It was easy after throwing pieces from off the truck to on the carts which normally was over 1000 pieces a day.
good,"everyone was so Clickie, no one spoke english it was hard to be a  team. I loved my bosses, but working in that enviroment was hard. everyone came to me for customers, I would take the time to help the customer.. but that takes time out of my work."
good,Em um ano dentro dessa empresa aprendi a ter mais responsabilidade e pontualidade.
good,"The job was fun, most days were spent organizing product for displays and shelves in accordance with the zoning plan given to us by the department managers. If a customer was looking to buy a specific item I helped them to the best of my abilities to ind said item."
good,"There are some areas that lack management skills but it is a Worth while experience. The benefits are good and you receive a qurterly bonus, you receive paid time off as you work so you have to save up."
good,"Walmart has the potential to do so much more for their associates and the community then they currently do. "
good,A good job to have in that type of business. See different types of people every day and learn how to use your skills with costumer. Learn some new everyday in that work place
good,it was a very busy place and long night. they give you thing to put away and you help coustmore all night . they are very good to work for. they just to let peopel move up with company.
good,It was an OK atmosphere. Fast paced and stressful but not a bad place to work.If you make a good impression they are willing to work with you. You have to show you are will to work. It can be very hot in te building but the pay is good.
good,I actually loved working for Walmart. My only issue was that they didn’t provide the right training for my position and expected everything to work out smoothly and with good numbers. I don’t mind working extra hours or with big amounts of work. I just needed the help and good guidance. Also I noticed a lot of favoritism.
good,"Management does not give us the respect that we deserve, They seem to think this is the only job out there ."
good,"I worked for Walmart 10 years. It was fun and happy at first but then became stressful. I was in produce and later became the manager. I learned how to do inventory, stock, clean, and organize tasks for my associates."
good,"Walmart had a good culture, now its just does not follow what Sam Walton believed in. The work is very easy and you can get hired easily. Turnover rate is very high as people are not happy with the low wages and high demand for note completion."
good,Typical day starts with handling of stock. Price changes if necessary. Then if management has anything  that is handled as well. the hardest is when management is not on the same page when it comes to daily routine. Co-workers are the best part of working at Walmart.
good,"I worked graveshift case lot order fill. Very hard work. The work area was dangerous with lots of bending under racks to lift heavy boxes. The job quotas were ridiculous and you were required to use a special productivity scanner each time you performed a task. It was supposed to allow a 'reasonable' amount of time to perform the task, but, what it expected you to do was unrealistic and obviously the people who developed the software had never done that job. Unless you are a robot or superman, it was nearly impossible to meet their goals. Also, they don't believe in team lifts for items weighing over 70 pounds so a lot of people hurt their backs or got hernias etc. The management operates under the walmart brainwashing policy which is  nothing more than socialism (all the workers give all to the company etc. ) The hardest part of the job was the physical labor involved. The most enjoyable was when I was tasked with label control which didn't require repetitive lifting and was a lot of computer inventory control. I would still be working there if they would have allowed me to do that job full time, but, they expected me to essentially order fill and then do a full days work in inventory control so they burned me out and I left the company."
good,"Buena empresa, solo que deberían mejorar los salarios."
good,"Cleaning all of the department of girls, boy's, men's, ladies, interments like bra and panties, and babies clothing. Cover someone 15 minutes break and then u have to answer the phone while you are there here and then u have to monitor the customers in and out of the fitting room."
good,"Not good for head of family to work there, you only get between 20-30 hours weekly and get paid bi-weekly. Good for students or someone looking for part time. No benefits, just discounts. Only persons to get benefits are full time employees and they no longer hire for full time."
good,"Walmart has its pros and cons like all companies, but at the end of the day, the company will be here forever and it will only grow so I would recommend more people to work there. You get a consistent amount of hours, they have good benefits, and you control your own destiny when it comes to how far you want to go in the company with handwork and knowledge."
good,"After having spent 11 years with the company, I believe that overall, it is not a bad company to work for. There will always be cons to go with the pros but, to me, the pros outweigh the cons. There’s bonuses, health care, room for advancement and as well as a family atmosphere."
good,"Work strong "
good,nice workplace and fast paced. management was okay but can be moody alot. The hardest part of job was just keeping up with the fast pace. I enjoyed everything.
good,Walmart would be good if management would work with you especially if you are a college student trying to have money on to help you out with school supplies and different things.
good,"For the most part they're a very employee happiness driven company. They come equipped with decent starting wages, an extensive benefits package after 6 months. As well as if everyone does their jobs and avoids injury whenever possible? Worthwhile quarterly bonuses. The only issues I had while employed there that were of a concerning level were either; Managerial based when a manager doesn't like you for personal reasons? 90% of the time they'll freeze you out of their sections and make getting promoted difficult. There's also a severe lack of communication that prevents A LOT of necessary information from reaching higher ups. In a timely manner, or even at all."
good,Many things can be improved for the employees.. and benefits to help have a better financial stability. Having a better opportunities for employees to move up and further there career in any direction that can be provided through the company and some incentives are not always what the employees want but simply a better living of better wages to keep up with the economy.
good,Working at Walmart kept me busy my whole time I was there. I had this job when I was in high school which helped me keep money for gas to get back and forth to school.
good,You are dealing with the public and that is not always pleasant. Staff are great and managers are all friendly. Sometimes my schedule did not follow my hours I told I was available to work.
good,"I love Walmart, but recent and continual layoffs are causing a great amount of stress.  I have worked for the company almost 18 years and now I am looking to find outside employment before I am displaced.  "
good,"Walmart is one of those places that you can have little to no experience in how to do a job. When I first started, I really didn't have much experience. My management team taught me how to do things, took the time to guide me, helped build me up as a person/worker. They valued my effort in wanting to learn. My manager would always tell me that my willingness to learn a job the correct way would get me very far in my future jobs and careers. Nothing about the job was hard, in fact it became too easy for me. Everything was fun though. Worked with some wonderful people who taught me a lot of things. Walmart really is a place to learn."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you have the heart to do what is need of you.  Associate have to take the ownership of there own training and get it completed.  Also you want to get promoted you have to act the part of the position that you want.  Showing up for work does not count.
good,Wal-Mart needs to take in to account when they have good staff especially elderly that they should be a little more accommodating in terms of lifting requirements.
good,"Good place to work with the right management. Some judgmental, some understanding and helpful, really just depends on the person. Hardest part of the job is if you don't know the answer to a customer and nobody else is around to help, they can be quite rude, but as is with most jobs. Pay is average, but at least above minimum wage and full time or part time had benefits. Can be either really stressful or somewhat monotonous depending on which department you work in. Toleration of heat or cold is a must, as well as heavy lifting, for some of the work. Breaks and meal times were provided though for some departments, not always on time."
good,I enjoyed working for walmart. There's so many different departments you can put in to work for every 90 days. You get to meet a lot of different peop
good,"El ambiente es muy bueno, los compañeros excelentes  se trabaja En equipo."
good,I enjoyed working in the ladies department assisting customers.  I especially had been requested by a few handicap customers to help them do their shopping.
good,I loved my coworkers! the job was very physically demanding and i would not recommend it if you are not someone physically fit.The job was moistly common sense but the physical aspect sent some packing.
good,Was a good job at first.  Management changed so many times over the years and everybody wanted to do things their way.  I feel that associates started to become less important over the years.  They expect so much work to be done with so few resources.
good,Just wish they paid us more to work and be able to live while working fun atmosphere and a great way to meet people and friends.  managmenet could be a little two face
good,"Walmart is an excellent, growing company to work for. Annual raises and bonuses were a great reward for work put in. I was trained in most departments as well as able to cashier and work the back room. Typical nights are easygoing once trained and in the flow of things. Coworkers help guide you and show you how things should be done. The hardest part about my job was trying to seek help from management but was easily helped by experienced coworkers. Management needed improvement and was my reason for leaving the company along with many coworkers. Very unprofessional at the location I worked at."
good,"The company's greed for productivity numbers is preventing some of the staff from doing the job correctly.  Any department that has rate becomes cutthroat and toxic.  If you make the rate the company raises it and continues to do so until you fail.  "
good,It’s a great place to work if you an high school student n etc but you have to be a top manager if you really want to make a living and career if you want to make an career out of it
good,"Working at WalMart, you find that it is easy to get along with other employees. You begin to treat each other like family. The pay is really good especially for persons who begin with little to no experience. It can be very fast-paced during the day, but slower at night. Management is not always reliable. You have to be on their case constantly about getting things done for you. They will procrastinate!"
good,"Wonderful co-workers at the walmart I was at. Managers I had several of them. It was 50/50. Half were amazing and considerate and Half were jerks but that's about the same as the co-workers. The culture I felt like it was amazing because we all pulled together in the company. The Pay was not bad we got a raise ever year. The area I lived is was significantly more than the pay to live alone. Moving up or job advancement seemed difficult, as it seems you get pidgeon wholed into a position. Once word gets out you are good at a position, the company seems to want to keep you at that same position even if you would like to take steps to move up"
good,A typical day at work lasted all day it was long stressfull and just overall too much... This job took up so much of my time i didn't have much time for my kids i was always at work from the time the sun came up til the sun went down i was at walmart trying to please a horrible man that was at the time the store manager
good,"simple work "
good,"If you like getting your hours cut regularly, benefits taken as a result, and need to get a second job, then Walmart is the place for you. Most of your coworkers are decent people."
good,i always had a great day at work love the people and the work almost everyone was nice and most put a smile on my face that's way i love working there
good,"If you perform your essential job functions and show up to work there is a lot of room for growth."
good,"I enjoyed working at this store, very nice, well-mannered co workers. i did not have a problem with anyone while workig there. it was very fast paced enviroment, which i enjoy."
good,"It paid the bills. As long as you are there on time and never calling in you are good. tip: dont call in, just go in when you are sick and they will usually send you home."
good,"Working at Walmart is easy work, but it is work. Walmart is always changing, and associates are expected to stay on par with the rapid flow. With all of the rapid changes going on in all of the departments, there are several different managers. Sometimes there are a lot of cross directional ideas going on because of all the management, but, if you're respectful to everyone above you, they take care of you."
good,"Walmart is a nice organization to work for, the pay could be batter as well as the management. The co workers are nice sometimes and other times could be a little rough around the edges."
good,"I enjoyed working in multiple Walmart locations."
good,"This is a great working environment, there’s many helpful people and you have a great opportunity to learn new things. You get to meet new people and you get a different experience than working with fast food."
good,I worked over nights so their was no working with costumers just going to work putting out freight . working with minimal supervision. unloading truck.
good,Easy and fun the night alway went by fast!i learned how to get over my anexity and love people! Most hardest part of the job for me was lifting all night because I was pregnant. Enjoyable part would have had to been lunch time.
good,"NOrmal day was having your head on a swivel trying to keep up with all the different  things you was being asked to do on top of you maintenance work, while still trying to make sure you had all your work done before you went home"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, although its not for the easy hearted. you was always moving fasted paced. Being short staff was normal but It didn't bother me. they train you well for each department."
good,"Répondre au besoin du client, passer les articles, emballer les achats et remercier le client. Placer la marchandises sur les tablettes et répondre au téléphone et aider les clients a trouver ce qu'ils cherchent."
good,One poor Co manager and Poor judgement on part of corperate  ruined employment for myself. They should have investigated a sittuation more thuroghly prior to making a call on a sittuation.
good,"I work the afternoon shift from 2-11. Everyday  When I clock in we set up the receiving area with pallets ready to unload merchandise, which it usually takes about 2 or more hours depending on how much merchandise arrives. Right after we are done unloading we go out to the floor to stock throughout the day."
good,"A typical day consists of helping customers find what they need throughout the store, zoning areas that need attention, and showing and selling jewelry products. The hardest part of my job is dealing with disgruntled customers, but the best part is meeting nice people on a daily basis."
good,"Fast paced and driven to learn .  Multi tasking to the max with high expectations and results. "
good,"buena empresa,buen trato,respeto,estabilidad laboral."
good,"I started from the bottom as associate, and soon I was manager, I didn't loose my integrity in the path to management and I always remembered that the associates are the most important part and thanks to them I was where I was as a manager... sadly most of the managers forget that"
good,"Is a nice place to work, and the managers are pretty cool. the hardest part of my job is going to the freezer for long periods of time, otherwise, I enjoyed."
good,Typical day had a nice steady routine. As a stocker they kept my work load extremely heavy. As a Tech the shop temperatures would be extremely hot or cold. The maintenance we preformed on vehicles was very basic mostly changing oil. tires. batterys. and windshield wipers.
good,"When I first started working at walmart it was a very relaxed and enjoyable work place. Management was very approachable and helpful. Currently, the moral is down and nobody wants to stay within the company. Love my coworkers just dont like that management isn't on the same page and giving many different directions to associates."
good,"The place is a great environment and a place to express your social skills. However, it is a job that can make people get stuck financially. Never the less it is a great company."
good,My work place experience was always filled positive out look and look forward to providing the best customer service as possible. the team work made work life a great work environment. there's always to grow and expand in the company. if you apply the right attitude you could reach your potential. Working here is the largest retail store because it cares and employees best workers.
good,"At walmart the hardest thing was trying to stay on your times, because if you not you will get coached, even if your moving fast as fast as you can.  Some of  Management is poor in areas on how they talk to there employees.. Meeting new co-worker was the most enjoyable part of the job. Also they never wanted to move anyone to a different position ..However on a good day at walmart it was ok.."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you need many hours, and advancement is almost always available. However, it is a place where you should not expect every customer to respect you or your efforts."
good,"La mayoría de los trabajadores no es déspota con los demás empleados, sin embargo lo que hace que la estancia sea estresante son los clientes que llegan, ya que generalmente van cansados o irritantes y exigen que todo sea rápido, además de que a veces son ellos los que hacen sentir menos a los empleados. Por estas razones, trataba de darles un ambiente efectivo y rápido, por supuesto, amable. "
good,"Walmart has taken great interest to take care of the"
good,It is a good place to work if you dislike being stuck with nothing to do. The hardest part of the job is trying to get so many things done that seem impossible in the set time period.
good,"A fast pace working environment where people with different culture of life meet. Friendly work place, as well as zero tolerance on discrimination is highly prohibited."
good,Not bad first job. I would recommend if you are trying to make a name for yourself and show your hard work ethic. It taught me how to deal with situations within customer service
good,"Walmart is definitely one of those places where conflict is easy. If you are a really good people person and are really good at problem solving when you have people screaming at you it's a good place. I definitely learned who could be trusted and who should have been watched, but I also met some really great people there. Some of the hardest parts of the job is when you become really good at it and then they rely on you take be able to do everything. They can work with you in all kinds of situations, but they can also not be understanding sometimes. Just get to know the people there and eventually you'll know who is who."
good,"Walmart is pretty mediocre starter job at best. And at worst, it's a load of bull. All in all, they really could've done better in certain departments."
good,The management makes sure that you know what you’re supposed to know to get the job done.Very friendly environment to work in.The job wasn’t too demanding
good,"Working ethic is ok. The co workers are rude and bitter when it comes to team work towards me. Other than that the performance is alright, the customers sometime could be nice. The supervisors ARE too strict about work which I understand that but far as there words how they talk to people is not polite."
good,"Because they wanted to save in the cost of their manpower, there are times that I work by myself in the Electronics Department. That is the hardest part of the job for me because customers get mad because I cannot help them right away"
good,"Busy and stressful "
good,"good place to work, no advancement opportunities unless willing to relocate great distances, starting to go downhill since the passing of sam Walton.."
good,Cut and slice meat for customers
good,"I worked hard and was rewarded for it in pay increases. A lot depends on your attitude and the ability to dismiss poor attitude from others. It's been awhile since I worked there, but still am a customer and it appears to be a better place now."
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart to put myself thru college. it wasn't a bad place to work, but it isn't a place I wanted to be for the rest of my life. When I started working there they were a company that strived to take care of there employees, after 2 years of working there they started to worry about the customers more than the employees. If you are looking for a job that really has no thinking behind it than its a place for you."
good,"It was okay. Manager expects a lot of stuff even when there's not much that could be done. Manager are nice if you are on their good side. Too much expectation and work, example finish stocking two pallets (around 10 feet) while maintaining customer service and finish unloading truck daily. Most co-workers I worked with were lazy and didn't do their work so I had to suck it up with them."
good,This store I work at would be a lot better it just needs new management to take over. They need to treat all employees the same no picks all equal.  When I first started here I loved it but a lot has changed.
good,Enjoyed my time with walmart.com and grocery.walmart.com!  The culture was fast paced and always changing due to the nature of the job.  Collaborative thinking was always welcome and strong team work was a must.  My manager was great and the team very productive and good at what we did.
good,I love Walmart because they have a lot of opportunities for growth. I love the teamwork.I love they care about the employees as well as the customers.
good,Walmart is a customer first company and they really do put the customer first. Employees are pushed and most I worked with are unhappy but need the Walmart pay.
good,Great place. But is shutting down soon . I worked at this place for around a year and a half . Business got bad and unfortunately has to close the place down.
good,"I helped people with questions they had about the self checkout, with question about products we sold, cleaned and filled machines with money, and had to fix if the machines had any issues."
good,A typical day is an 8-hour shift. I learned how to keep the store clean and how to restock shopping carts. Management was ok. The hardest part was working in the sun. The most enjoyable part was walking around the store.
good,Working with many different and diverse associates taught me a lot about the world and work ethics.  Had a good time in the 20 years I was there and hopefully taught some people some good things.
good,"It's a good place to work for an easy paycheck just waltzing in and following orders, basically working for your bosses rather than yourself and the area you're assigned to."
good,Typical day at work is roughly 10-12 hours fast paced. Must stay focused and driven. The hardest part of the job is working long hours and extra days. Most enjoyable are the people.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was a fun experience. I found the hours were flexible and staff overall was friendly. I found the managers were talkative with there employees but not always assertive about tasks they want completed.
good,"The day can be hectic. It is most important that we communicate. Management should make sure we have the tools and equipment to do our job. I enjoy being a team player, wish I had more time to help people with their needs. I feel good when I make someone happy and feel good when they leave the store."
good,"you just got to listen an do your jobs . then you'll have no problem."
good,"If you like to work in a fast paced environment with the interaction of Customer Service, Walmart is the right place."
good,Great for students and individuals with financial needs. The work is not hard but it can be challenging depending on your job title. Benefits and 401k.
good,The overall job would be great if the store wasn't regularly understaffed. This causes added pressure on those working and makes if difficult to do our set routines.
good,"Walmart has great benefits for employees, very flexible, working as a CSM was very challenging be cause I had to train people of all backgrounds, loved the experience."
good,"Was called on a needed basis. Ran errands, cleaning, sweeping, dusting, vacuuming , mopping. Required to be in certain areas in the store. Clean the restrooms as well."
good,I wokedat walmart for about a year getting my work experience while i was in highschool but i wasnt learning much for what i thought i would need in the real world.
good,"Good pay, fairly easy tasks, some advancement opportunities. Very repetitive,  easily capped in earning potential,  can get very repetitive. Hours can be very inconsistent."
good,"Walmart has established daily, weekly, & monthly routines, & you must make time to handle opportunities that arise."
good,"It has good benefits and insurance but only starts 90 days working there.suppose get three breaks but normally dont ,have too learn working in small area space with moveing boxes about 2600-3000 filling up trailer from start to end bottom too top,you have too be fast or production stops you get written up,people are nice but you be left alone do fill ups.wieghts 1-80pounds boxs comeing down too you from converter belt ..if light blinks you have go faster ...times also learn how full in sign in check out trailer threw little computer screen.some employees told me if you get hurt not report if you do higher ups with write you up ...money is good ,work is 9/10.."
good,Has a diverse culture for a workplace.  Hardest part of the job was having upset customers.  I would say the most enjoyable part of the job would be the benefits.
good,The work environment was rough and the pay we got was not worth it because what I did was unload trucks and restock the floor. I could not live off of that pay.
good,"I don't like Walmart, but they do have jobs. It's not completely terrible if you don't mind being told what to do. I was a manager in the Vision center and I got fed up with the corporate structure."
good,If you have patience this job is great! you must have great customer service skills and problem solving skills. after all the customer is always right.
good,"I was full time the whole time that I was with the company, but they just didn't pay enough. I saw on the news that this is changing a little. I think that they are starting people out at a higher wage than when I worked there."
good,"A typical day was just stocking shelves and being a full-time janitor"
good,This is an ok company. There is no room to grow and that is why I chose to leave the company. The pay is decent and the work isn't bad. There isn't room to grow.
good,"It's retail, so dealing with customers is the main job no matter where you are. In my department (fabrics, crafts, party, and office supplies) my entire job was cutting fabric for customers, assisting customers by answering questions and the like, and keeping the shelves organized and stocked. I wasn't given any daily tasks most days, so a lot of the time I had to make up jobs for myself (I worked evenings and was the only one there at that time) when there was no organizing to do or fabric to cut. This sounds great, which in some part, it was, because it wasn't super stressful, but at 8 hours a day it was and incredible drag and I sometimes felt I was being severely underutilized. But other than that, the job was pretty good and management was fair."
good,"During my time at Walmart, the staff was amazing and upper management wasn't the worst. I was hired part-time and promised full-time, but never received it due to a variety of excuses, so I left the company."
good,Buenas empresas ñero no cuentan con suficientes horas
good,Managers would forget to give me my breaks. Some days time would go fast when it was busy that’s what I liked about Walmart. Couldn’t go to the bathroom except on breaks.
good,"I liked working t Wal Mart. Had some minor situations, but overall it was good.  Everything depended on the supervision you had.  Some are better than others."
good,"My job was at the gas station and there is no restroom facility,so this made it extremely difficult to work. They always promoted drinking plenty of water because of the heat. This was not logical since you had to call into the store and wait for someone to come and relieve you to go all the way into the store to use the restroom."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, tranquilidad y confianza para desempeñarte sola en tu puesto. Buen horario."
good,My time at Walmart was not a bad experience.  I worked for them while I was in college and after that I was given an opportunity to enter into the management training program.  I enter had a great time until the District manager didn't like me because I wanted to fire a department head who was doing an awful job.  I found thousands of missed markdowns.  I wanted him to demote but they were having an affair so he protected and made my last days there miserable and force me to take a transfer and I declined and resigned because I had another opportunity and refused to work in that type of environment.
good,"Great first or second job. Pays better than most entry-level positions and if you play your cards right, you can make it a career. I liked the people there, but as a cashier, you're mostly by yourself. I felt pretty isolated even though I was talking to customers all day. I honestly preferred my previous job in fast food despite the lower pay because I  felt like I was on a team there."
good,"Working at Walmart was not a bad experience. However, overall it was a stressful although i feel like it did not have to be. Management made it point to make sure every associate felt included. The hardest part of the job was not being able to fulfill customers needs if the store could not provide what they were looking for.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,Te ayuda a complementar los valores de casa y te exige superación para promocionar.
good,"Empresa Boa de trabalhar , nunca tive problemas com a empresa"
good,I worked here while going to college. They were flexible with my hours and didn't have many complaints.  It was very relaxed and meet interesting people while there. I learned how to keep myself busy with my manager didn't have assigned work for me to do and to manage myself when I was the only person working in that department.
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work, if you are just there for a fun job. If you are here to make a career out of Walmart that is when it is a difficult job. Expectations are always high, and most of the time customers are angry. If you can get past that, it is a nice job."
good,"I was a cashier at WalMart. I had interacted with the customers, handled monetary transactions. Help customer with any question they may have had. Stocked the end shelves if we didn't have a customer in line, to stay busy and productive."
good,Some mangers are poorly unorganized. They don't want to hire any people for certain shift therefor requiring them to do twice the work. Its a very stable job though and don't have to worry about getting laid off. You gain PTO by the amount of hours you work instead of a fix amount per year. Its a good place to work if you need a job and all the people that works there are friendly.
good,Safety is the number one of Success. Great culture & High expectations. Customer service is one of the most important when it come to work . Respect your surroundings.
good,a great place to work as long as your manager isn't a jerk. no overtime but nice benefits if you're full time. part time doesn't get any benefits.....
good,Walmart although was a good working place I find it harder to me to explain how hard it was to let go of that job it cost me a lot of time and effort to relocate. The training experience was excellent they taught me very well . The pay was really good and they provide great supervision on the co workers .
good,I loved working at Walmart however after several attempts to get the job title for the job i was doing  the manager that made the decision let me know that her friends were going to get it before me.  No promotion available I moved on.
good,"A empresa possui a política muito forte, aprendi conviver com as diferenças por ser uma empresa a favor da diversidade, atender a grandes demandas por se tratar de um Centro de Distribuição de Grande Porte, aprendi a trabalhar com os Subsistemas de RH e DP, a cultura e os valores da empresa são magnificos, a parte mais difícil  quando havia redução de quadro e tinhamos que desligar funcionários muitas vezes muito competentes,  a parte mais agradével o respeito pelo indivivíduo."
good,"Decent work place with good benefits, Great break room.  Great on work and life balance, and the employees were competitive and friendly.  Management did their job"
good,Walmart was a great place to work at. There was always work to do and the people there always seemed to be pretty happy. It was such a good place to work because everyone was always so friendly.
good,"The pay, mangers, and coworkers are great and friendly. Costumers are typically good or decent with the occasional bad apple. The job can be taxing though and very draining."
good,Es una buena empresa en la cual puedes adquirir nuevos conocimientos
good,"Walmart will always have tasks to keep you busy, however, if you are not available 24/7 you will not get the hours that you need. You are almost expected to make Walmart your main priority in life, and it can be rather frustrating because some management will become frustrated if you don't make Walmart your main priority. If you are interested in short-term employment, or if you are interested in a job where you can very quickly move up, Walmart is a good company for that."
good,"Outgoing ,friendly , always busy..  been working there for 5 years and enjoy it I work in the pharmacy so it's always busy and costumers are always mad ."
good,Worked my way to 9-5 five day Mon. - Fri. The typical day fast past and ever changing! Hardest part was adapting to Management mode swings...Most enjoyable part was working with good assciates...and the pay!
good,"I really enjoy the people I work with, but the job can be very tiring, ecpecially on over nights. It is fast pace and detailed. Like any job, it has it’s good and bad days."
good,"The walmart tle is a good place for low prices on tires and oil changes, and warranty, there is usually long waits, very slow paced workers everywhere I go."
good,Restocking and unloading trucks was hard work. Restockers should be paid more then the average worker at walmart. The conditions in the back room can somewhat be dangerous.
good,I loved my job! I loved my customers. I think their management needs a bit more training because at the moment they aren’t that professional. But other than that my days at work were amazing! I had a few stressful days but it overall was a great experience.
good,Work is very fair and can be fun if you want it to be. But the hours are purely dependent on the stores and the amount of freight that is brought to the dc.
good,"When I arrive the my first task is to check expiration dates on all products. If they expire today I mark them down to a cheaper price, if they are already expired I scan them out the system then dispose of them. Then I wipe the glass and counter off. Wash my hands then proceed to filling the cases and shelves with bakery items that are previously packaged or made by me. Then I look in the file box to see what special cake orders I have and what time are they due. Then I start to make the orders while taking new orders and assisting present customers with special messages they want written on a cake and answering the phone. The hardest part of this job is on a busy days trying to design a beautiful cake that looks exactly like the picture in the book and not make any mistakes and meet the deadlines while trying to assist the current customer and be helpful, courteous, understanding is not easy but I managed to always get the job done. I've learned decorating cakes is not as easy as it looks. The most enjoyable part of the job is I got to be creative."
good,"Walmart DC pays very well, but you have to kill yourself at work to earn that money. unrealistic production goals, and if you do not meet those unrealistic goals, you get written up. Great benefits at a very good price. Raises every 6 months until topped off."
good,This particular job is not for everyone. you have to have a good attitude about yourself and others. it helps to be able to laugh at a lot of stressful events at work. Be good at rationalizing and making sure you have good people skills.
good,"Some days can be hectic due to the area you live in, but you learn a lot from customers and their experiences. Management can be sometimes harsh but dependable, its weird."
good,"you meet a lot of people there, they keep you really busy and the managers are really bossy at times even when you are busy. they give you tons of things to do during the day."
good,Great benefits package and salary for Pharmacy technician was good. Most continuing customers were great. Not much security when threats or fights would occur but most customers were respectful. Constant turn-over with management and employees.
good,I go clock in and get my uniform on and i head to recieving and start unloading the truck by hand each box onto there correct pallets by department. When the truck is done we put the boxes on a cart or l-cart and take them to there departments and stock the shelves and when we get back from lunch we move all pallets to there right departments and when thats finshed we work them untill 11. when 11 rolls around we all clock out and leave.
good,"Nice people, If wanted to move up just learn and it was easy to do in a short period of time. sometimes really fast past and not enough employees. most management were great not all but most."
good,On the whole Walmart is an excellent first job that offers swift promotion and easy transfer for any who want it. If you are neither of those people then it's an excellent way to memoryhole wide swaths of your life.
good,It's usually very fast paced with few breaks in between customers. You get a fifteen minute break every two ours. If you work at least six hours you get a half an hour for lunch and an hour if you work at least eight.
good,"I would like working at Walmart if they would hire people to do their job, like they are suppose to. They do have people who enjoy their job, if management would their job."
good,This is a place to work and is no longer a place that can be considered a career.  The overall culture of Walmart is more about money and less about employees and customers.
good,"The work  was fast paced but it was fulfilling to me. I enjoyed going to work every day. There were challenges to overcome, but the tasks were varied so it was never boring. I really enjoyed the interaction with customers, because it was very rewarding to help them find the merchandise that they needed and were looking for.I was actually paid very well ."
good,I loved working there but I left because I found a different job making more money.  It was so relaxing that I didn't get stressed out so much.  I should also mention that Ii helped pushing carts when they needed help. The problem with pushing carts is the guy that does that for a guy made me mad because he always took breaks every 10 minutes and he was so lazy he never did his job.
good,"Working here taught me a lot on different things for example great customer service skills, how to handle lost items or resolving an issue with a customer."
good,"a typical day of work consisted of customer service all day fast pase, teamwork , and a mixture of good and toxic type of environment overall its a great job . the environment and management mainly be the issue if there not equip with their position and feelings effect there decisions."
good,"After working with Walmart for well over a year, I've concluded that Walmart is in fact a good place to work for if you're looking for something either temporary or wanting to really move up within the ranks i.e. becoming a manager. However due to some people working there and depending on the management, working there can prove extremely stressful at times, even to the point where some may quit or just not be happy working there. Equipment is pretty scarce in that many employees including some managers have to hide equipment/materials in order for them to be able to do their jobs. The most difficult part of working is not the work itself, but the interactions with the other staff and customers, some of these customers and staff can prove to be very hard to deal with, and are sometimes confrontational and prove to be hard handle. The best part I could say working for Walmart is the pay, the pay isn't the greatest, but for 12 dollars and hour with the addition for having 4 bonuses per year you can say it's one of the best places to work for in our local area if you're wanting the most pay from a company."
good,El trabajo en si esta muy bien pero muchas vees el jefe no tiene los modos para tratar a las personas y l sueldo es muy bajo
good,I worked there part-time while going to school. My only complaint is that I asked for shifts of 6+ hours and was consistently given 4-5.5 hour shifts.
good,Walmart is Walmart. You get what you put into it. The pay and benefits are below the cost of living in Philadelphia. It’s not one the MOST professional places to work but you do come into contact with some decent individuals while working there. It’s definitely a good place to work while you’re in school.
good,Management is wonderful. Job security is not so good. You never know if your department is going to get laid off. They are not very mindful of the balance between work/home.
good,"As department manager, your stress level is one of the highest for the company. Multiple deadlines and tasks without assistance. The daily required tasks actually amount to 5 associates."
good,"I have learned that communication is one of the most valuable tools to have in any job. Without it there is no way for a business to be successful.  Taking pride in the work that I do and to be the best that I can be everyday is important. Management depending on whom is rotated into the department can have a rippling effect.  Unfortunately most of them have never or very briefly had training in the department that they are over, so their is not a lot  of building off of experience.  Everyone is always rushing to put out fires instead of finding a smarter way of working and ending up overworking and being unappreciative to the workers. The best part of the job is that through working their you make personal connections with associates which makes the work day better and though those days make lasting relationships."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. There are creeps everywhere just wish they took complaints more seriously. I enjoyed most of the customers, working with the public you will always have certain ones that only wish to stir up trouble."
good,"Overall the job was simple enough but, the amount of work each person had to do was more then 8 hours of work each night. most of the time sections were left unfinished because of lack of enough of workers."
good,"Everyone person will have their own experience working at Walmart. Some people will love it and some will simply loath it. I was somewhere slightly past the middle, leaning toward loathing but this was mostly due to co-workers and not the company itself. If you greet customers in a friendly manner and maintain professionalism then you generally will have a healthy work experience. Some managers were just as involved with day to to day functions as the floor employees, where as others were very expectant of good results but not really good at giving direction. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntled customers and the most enjoyable part was the company discount."
good,"I loved working for this company, they would always give me alot of hours, this is just a really good company to work for. they would switch me from one job to another job inside wal-mart.you have to be on time and never late.the employees were really nice to work with."
good,"You get paid well, but the customers make the job tough. If you work in Fresh it is very tough and always busy and the job isn't great. The management is okay, but you rarely see them."
good,"The hours are very inconsistent and they will break you in hard."
good,You have to make sure you are very quick to get pallets of items done or they will be all over you about it. And make sure you are helping the customers the best to your ability. And if you don't know something don't be afraid to ask.
good,"I love working at Walmart but when managers show favoritism it’s time for me to go, I’ve seen some hard working dedicated workers leave because of noticing ( favoritism) one of them had been employed there for 15 years."
good,"They don't give you enough hours to qualify for insurance. They cross train you so that even if your job is accounting, they can make you clean the restrooms."
good,The job requirements at Wal-Mart were clearly laid out and easy to follow. Management for my position were easy to get along with and followed through on promises made.
good,"Serving customers on cash registers. ringing in merchandise, applying coupons and discounts. Counting cash at the end of each shift. During less busy hours would spend time cleaning registers of resorting misplaced merchandise."
good,"I gained good work skills and experience at Walmart in lots of different departments, I had the opportunity to make more money that I didn’t have working at Walmart. That encouraged my decesion to Pursue other job opportunities"
good,"Quality of management strongly varies from store to store, surprising level of quality expected, kept busy through the work day,  promotions are common and encouraged."
good,Wal-mart culture is family orientated. Ability to move up with company is there if you wish. Heavy into giving back to the community. Overtime is hard to come by.
good,You will quickly learn the pros and cons retail if working at Walmart. Days usually fly by and there are many employees to make friends with. Managers are generally reasonable and understanding but can be spread too thin due to the high levels of staff generally.
good,"I stocked groceries and unloaded trucks. All I remember was simple tasks, hard work, always something to do. Oh and don't put overstock in the backroom sloppy, they will let you know about it trust me... lol"
good,tryed to have the cleanes  department . always keeping fully stocked  merchandise. learned the store to help customers find their items needed .  was able to operate the paint mixer machine .enjoyed the 10 years  but need to learn more .
good,"Working at Walmart provided me with much needed work experience. However, I would not consider it to be a career worth pursuing, unless you are aimed high on the corporate ladder. It's good for those individuals with no prior work experience, as having something on your future applications is leagues better than having nothing at all. All in all, I consider it a good temporary/part-time job for High School or Uni students, but I don't consider it a lucrative career."
good,"every day is a new experience at walmart. everyone gets along and it almost feels like a family, but with every family comes drama, theres tons of that at walmart. some custumors are a hastle, but that is seen in every work place, but overall, its about the best part time job you can get."
good,The hardest part about working at Walmart is knowing that all the managers aren't on one page.
good,"The job was good, you worked independently at night with no customers around, fast paced but you knew what you were doing, it was a physical job but easy work. The training manager was great, very professional and always had a positive attitude but the hiring management/supervisor for the company wasn't very professional and they do not respond to any form of contact in a timely manner."
good,"Sueldo mas comisiones por meta sin embargo no todos llegaban, reconocimiento a los empleados que lograbamos las metas"
good,It was fine till 2018 when they started changing everything and messing up hours. Overall I wouldnt recommend going there now due to the schedule being crazy.
good,stressful yet everyday is different therefor you never get board of what you are doing. The reward is being a part of the development of others that you supervise
good,"Every day was busy, but was easy to make friends. Experience would have been better, if not for poor management. Team leads would regularly goof off and talk amongst each other."
good,"Walmarts management restrict their workers a lot and punish workers for putting in extra work to get tasks done. When I worked at Walmart I received write-ups for using the cart machine correctly. The label stated that the cart machine could take up 40 carts at a time, and I was given a write up for putting 25 on. They also don't have a school option for calling off work, they only have personal emergencies and sick. The options for calling of work are very limited."
good,The work/life ration was very nice and the management was helpfull. Most of the managers I came across where nice and I liked working with all of the other associates.
good,"In this job you must have good customer service.  Be able to work a cash register, it is a must that you can multitask as you maybe needed in a different department on a daily basis."
good,Fue una buena experiencia laboral donde he aprendido mucho más.
good,"Great job with benefits, and hours. There just wasn't enough to do. The poeple I worked for didn't train me enough. Pay was good but there was many times I ran out of things to do."
good,Working for Walmart for over 6 years has been an adventure. Only reason I want to leave is due to lack of career advancement. Management depending on your location is either a hit or a miss.
good,It was a fun place to be at times had problems with some workers but that always got fixed customers were always nice and patient and the store was always clean
good,"I'm not going to review Walmart, I worked there, i loved stocking then they wouldn't let me stock anymore i was doing 4 peoples jobs a night..................................."
good,i got this job straight out of high school and it was labor just putting boxes on the shelf as fast as you can to put the product out there. hours where super made up. you had your schedule but it would be different almost all the time.
good,"Worked 13 years they hired me after working at a job for 27 years thankful for that "
good,"Worked overnight, it entails a lot of physical labor and standing on your feet a lot. Can sometimes be a easy and fun shift, it just really depends on the work load."
good,managers choose favorites so if your not liked then every little mistake is pointed out! although the pay and benefits are good its not worth being treated badly
good,the learning experience on the machine waxing buffing riding scrub riding machine moping  cleaning break room team work help   out the public with their needs
good,"The environment is pretty laid back, I got to work with some great people. It's not the easiest to move up where you would like though. However, you do get 2 fifteen minute breaks and an hour lunch."
good,Many opportunities available at Walmart if you take advantage of them. A constant changing environment so you always need to be on your toes at all times.
good,Good place to work at good place to learn new things about all types of people in food always have room to grow in Walmart in every area also all types of culture that will open your mind up two new things and new ways how to cook food in Compare Food
good,This is a good place to work. I wish I wouldnt have left. I would come back. I have applied to a Walmart again. I honestly hope I get the job. They are amazing
good,"It seemed like a good place to work with a group effort.  Lovely individuals.  If you like to help individuals with all there Walmart needs, then that is a great place for you."
good,Sou  prestativa aprendo rápido e sou pontual tenho disponibilidade de horaris
good,Its a very competitive place however it is fun and an enjoying place. With understanding people and a great drive it's a lot of fun to work along side the company.
good,"Clock in. "
good,"My Boss was fantastic. Everything was in order and neat. Made working there so much easier. Excellent training, and communication."
good,a typical day at work was good most of the time the only issues i had were that they didnt have organizational skills for the management and always expected more out of us than what was real. The hardest part about the job was the lack of help when needed from management. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customers and reflect on them in a positive way and seeing their bad day turn good after going through my line.
good,Job is set up on single production reward system..Makes for a lot of accidents & very little team players.Good pay & benefiys but most out for themselves.
good,A typical day's work at walmart was slow and unfulfilling. There were no benefits for part-time employees and the pay every two weeks was also a drag.
good,"Very long hours of work.  Not very family oriented.  great place to work for experience, training and skills. Benefits such as medical, 401k, and stock purchases are great."
good,Walmart over all I would say is a good place for a first job. They worked well with my school schedule. For a young person there is room for advancement.
good,"Responsible for achieving production requirement goal."
good,"I'm looking for something more advancement in a career. This job I thought was going to be promising, but turned out that things that had been promised turn out to be a joke. I'm am not willing to work for a company like that anymore."
good,Not enough help for the demands of meeting the metrics. More and more liability placed on the pharmacists and pharmacy managers with no additional pay for the billable services we are providing
good,"I learned the basics of working "
good,"No matter what your schedule, they are willing and able to work around any schedule. I even said I wanted to transfer to another department so I could work full time and they made up a new job for me in my current department so I could stay there (they couldn't afford to lose me)."
good,"This is a good company to begin a career however, advancement is difficult. Long hours especially during inventory and holiday seasons. Average benefits."
good,"Very good environment to work and courteous management."
good,"Typical day at work is determined entirely by the amount of freight. With or without proper staffing, production is still expected to be met. My time with the company i have learned the ins and outs of inventory managment, as well as teaching, training associates."
good,Amazing co workers i HAD a great co manager and am getting another one !!Great environment great learning experience!The benefits are awesome and helps out in so many ways !!All in all I'm pretty satisfied with my job but I am looking to pick up another !!
good,You moved around   a  lot  and you will work a lot of nights there is  places to move around when the spot is open if you been there long enough. A lot of focusing on details.
good,Working at this job is good because you can meet all different types of people. I love this job because it’s pays great and every 2 month you get a raise.
good,fiquei pouco tempo la pois era temporário mais a empresa é boa
good,"i clocked in at 9:55pm, went to the group meeting at 10pm. then i went to the freezer did my 3 pallets of dairy product and 2 pallets of milk. after that zone and clean up my areae. then went to go help others out."
good,It is a business there are things to do everyday and need to continually change to meet customer needs. Walmart is all about the customer and what they need.
good,"The other people I worked with were awesome. The job itself was easy but, the pay was low. Overall I think they are good company just not what I was looking for long term."
good,typical day at work would be to be on time and dressed accordingly. you learn to be versatile because you may be asked to help other employees as well as customers in different areas of the store.
good,"The fact is that there are not enough employees to do the job that is required. Store management says to do the job a certain way or else then other management says do the job their way or else."
good,Worked with really good management and some very friendly people. Customers are great if their treated how they should. Hours are exactly what's wanted but always available areas to train and transfer.
good,Long days and during inventories you were working non stop days at a time. You could try to plan out your days but plans changed at a drop of a hat. Enjoyed the employees and most of management staff was on same page.
good,"Walmart is very fast paced and ever changing. They constantly go through structure changes, so you cannot get to comfortable in any one position. Salary positions that is"
good,"Walmart was always busy, provided plenty of hours, offered flexible schedule. Enjoyed interacting with the customers and being able to improve their shopping experience."
good,"Long days, can be stressful, but good management staff. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. If you know how to work under pressure and can handle customers then this the place to work for you."
good,"This job changes every day based on the time you work, customer traffic and time of the year it is. This is retail, so work/life balance is what you make of it. If you have specific times that you need for your family, then this is not the job for you.  Workplace culture is again, what you make of it. The company lays out the parameters they want you to follow, and it is up to you to make it happen.  "
good,There's nothing I wish to share about walmart at this time. It was one of the best places to work for. Fast and easy work. Management could've been a little better at the time.
good,"Very fast moving, stressful job. Can also be rewarding at some points during work. Management is very good to all employees, makes sure everyone is satisfied from top to bottom."
good,It's a good place to work when getting back into the workforce or entering the workforce for the first time.  The pace is quick and you learn a lot in a short period of time.  I would go back if the right position came my way.
good,"it was a temporary job so I have little to tell of its potential, however I did enjoy the people I worked with. Its not a job id ever consider going back to simply because its not the career of my choice."
good,"It's a good temporary job, however I wouldn't want to make a career out of it."
good,My job was to stock shelves overnight.  I learned some interesting things on food refrigeration.  Management was great.  The hours was the most difficult part to the job.
good,"Walmart is a steady job once you get past the part time nonsense.  It actually starts to pay pretty decent once you start to get up higher into management."
good,"trabalho em equipe, oportunidades de conhecer novos setores do mercado, gerencia super competente, ambiente de trabalho otimo de trabalhar, oportunidades para crescer na empresa e premios de reconhecimento ao funcionário."
good,"Uma empresa agradável de trabalhar. "
good,"I worked at Walmart for a short time to gather some money before I moved away for college. I didn't establish much of an emotional connection with the job or my co-workers/employers, good or bad. My department manager was laid back and funny, and I had no issues with my co-workers."
good,"Its a job, managers are fair an friendly, be flexible, learning everything you can in the store is very useful, the work place is very cultured, so try to get to know your co-workers, hardest part of the job is probably all the heavy lifting and running around when short handed. The enjoyable part of the job is when the customer walks out the doors happy."
good,A large part of your job at Wal-Mart will be interacting and helping customers. On top of your job specific responsibilities you are expected to provide great customer service. If you are friendly and knowledgeable about your department and store it can be a great place to work.
good,"Un ambiente sano, lompio y con mucha cultura laboral con principios."
good,"Deal with different types of people, and huge retail store allows great retail experience. Learned a lot from working at Walmart. Lunches and breaks are very fair."
good,"I have enjoyed the work.  Talk to customers, and staff.  Respect for the individual is being worked at to help one another to make our jobs easier.  Need some work on not only making the customers number one, but also making the employees feel like they are important too."
good,"Walmart is good to place to work depending on the area you work in but sometimes the hours seem like they were not enough for people who are part time, not to mention if you've been there a while and new people get hire its like they cut your hours a good bit."
good,Having a one-hour lunch was great but most of all the management was not good I did like it there working with as a team helps as well made great friends
good,"Too much to write and think about, I'm getting a headache just thinking about it. It has good benefits and good workers but after working there for so long and it being my first job, you get tired of the same stuff. You do not get transferred to different departments as fairly as you think you should. Its a good start out job overall"
good,"I learned customer service skills, automotive skills, and communication skills."
good,As a new immigrant It was a good experience for me to know working condition in Canada. I enjoyed the philosophy of costumer service behind this company. If the salary was OK may be I could think about staying there.
good,It's a great job for anyone looking for a steady paced job.  it can get a bit hectic during the holidays.  but what else can you expect from a mass retailer..
good,"A typical day for me would be to have all of fashions organized in an eight hour shift, all the clothes would be well organized by size and by color and brand-names. I would help as many customers as I could. I learned a lot about customer service where walmart has been my first job. i learned there was more than one thing about life that i could enjoy. the hardest part of my job was my memory lost and my hearing. i had to focus so much harder because i have severe memory loss. the most enjoyable part was honestly making a ton of friends and receiving amazing hours and the actual work in the organization of the clothing and meeting lots of new people as i worked. seeing the joy on their faces when i helped them. i loved it there so much."
good,"It was a good job as a college student. They pay you well, you get moderately decent discounts, most employees are helpful, but there was downsides, as there is with everything. They can have really bad managers and customers will threaten you for their own misunderstandings and mistakes. All in all, its better that most part time jobs and at least the pay is better than most."
good,"A typical day of work was always very hectic, since I worked within a supercenter. Scheduling for each department was almost always handled poorly, leaving a lack of people in certain areas. Necessary breaks were always guaranteed and discrimination was never a worry."
good,"Challenging but rewarding, management lacked a little but overall an upbeat environment to work in. Duties were simple and easily accessed and fulfilled"
good,"It is a fast paced environment and some co workers do not help out. You do get bonuses quarterly depending on how well your store did, but raises do not come often."
good,My coworkers where fun and great to work with but management and scheduling make it not worth it. People that actually worked and tried hard dont seem to get anywhere and lazy employees could do whatever they pleased.
good,Learned many things working at Walmart including how a retail company functions. The most enjoyable part of the job are the friendly people and opportunities to develop different skills. It is a stable job unlike other companies and they work with your schedule. A typical day are slow mornings and busy afternoons.
good,"I learned to go above and beyond no matter what anyone else thought. There was good and bad days, depending on if everyone worked together or not. Overall a good job."
good,"Responsible for taking money in the form of cash, check, or credit card from patrons, in exchange for food or services. Scans items, provides change, balances drawer, and processes card transactions."
good,"Fast paced, very social, involved in community activities and fundraisers. "
good,It just depends on who you end up with as a manager. Your store may be fun and more lenient with rules but at the Walmart I was at they were always nagging about everything infront of customers and about customers. Highly unprofessional.
good,"A typical work day involves cooking, cleaning , dishes and being part of a team. I've learned a lot of work ethic and how to work independent and in a team. The management team for the most part is great and easy to get along with but some are harder on their employees. The hardest part of the job is the heavy lifting, moving skids, carrying boxes and racking chickens. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships I've make with my coworkers and the amazing environment it created."
good,Any one who has the ability to keep pushing forward can succeed in Walmart.  You are able to learn so much from your employees and employer.  Dedication is everything.
good,"I worked at Walmart at the same time I started college and I was able to balance the two of them out. My superior was super nice and friendly, and made working at Walmart a more pleasant experience. I also gained several skills while working at Walmart that I still apply to my life today. I would not suggest Walmart as a long term career, but I would totally recommend it to someone who is starting to gain work experience."
good,"A typical day at Wal-mart is  being under-staff by associates calling out daily. It a fast paced and very busy job,it all ways something to do. Wal-Mart likes for you to be able to multi task on different jobs. "
good,"I enjoyed the employees that I worked with. I wish I would've been full time after 9 years, but they wouldn't give it to me. I enjoyed having an hour lunch and most of the management team was really nice."
good,I was an unloader. The job did not take much skill unless you were trained on equipment. Had to work in all weather conditions. The job is very physical and it took me a couple of weeks to get used to the constant standing moving and lifting. The pay was decent for the job.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. They don't really practice what they preach about the family oriented place that they want you to believe. I feel if what they don't hit the news that they do they don't do it.
good,I learned many valuable skills working here and it helped me realize what direction I wanted my career to take. I created beneficial connections while working here and I would have stayed if my pay was better.
good,"Slow paced, doesn't pay enough for the amount of stuff youre required to deal with. Other associates can be hard to work with, and Walmart does not train properly"
good,working as a cashier with walmart you have to be organized and fast paced. you work in our own work area. You also have 1v1 interaction with customers.
good,"Walmart is a good job. I learned customer service skills, time management, and supervisor and management duties. After twelve years of service it is my time to move on and enhance my skills within another company."
good,"A typical retail environment, usually striving to increase business (script and sales volume)."
good,"It is fun working at walmart, "
good,really easy if you are a team player. Wal-Mart is a very easy job if you can maintain your attendance. the attendance is the hardest to get past because you are allowed 8 occurrences in a 90 day period
good,"Honestly, I loved working at Wal-Mart but the management was poor. The managers were rude and disrespectful and there was a hostile work environment. The pay was good but the managers reflect the employees and no one wants to work in a hostile work environment."
good,"its a good place to work I just feel like I've outgrown Walmart in so many aspects of my life I want something more. Going into work on a normal day is walking into you department and nothing haven't been touched. I'm responsible for keeping up with inventory instead I'm getting items that's not even on order confront management ""o it wasn't finalized so you're stuck with unnecessary freight .."
good,"Overall was a good place to work, well compensated but sometimes had to deal with micro management and disorganization across offices. Also work life balance was sim to none."
good,"My job at walmart is very fast paced and stressfull because of the lack of help (hours) given to us by our district manager. Overall, I like the customers and co workers, and my direct manager."
good,"a typical days work is stressful under a lot of pressure from the moment you enter the store. Different mangers giving direction know one is on the same page about anything, people micro- managing."
good,"Decent place to work, not a family oriented company, required to come in on off days for production based on volume. Very fast paced and physically demanding but pays well."
good,"My department was one of the better departments in the store."
good,Management was great it was just that I felt for me there was no room for advancement. I would start my day by clocking in & jumping on register. Every two hours we'd have a break & if ever I had a problem I could go to management without fear but again for me it just felt like a lack of advancement.
good,A typical day at work is usually stressful and fast paced. Walmart is always looking for impossible goals to set out by the work staff but continues to stress it. Overall Walmart most certainly gets your time of day.
good,"It is a good place to work. The management is good and the staff is friendly. If you do your job properly, then the management will not interfere in your day to day work."
good,"A typical workday starts out like walking in the family business. Everyone greeting each other with a smile or handshake.  You become a part of a team, working together for one common goal, to take care of the customers"
good,"I worked in the Wal-Mart Deli, and when I was there the Deli was known for always giving plenty of hours, unlike other departments, so I was very fortunate in that sense."
good,Days there were very busy and a very fast pace workplace. It's customer service environment working at walmart. It was very enjoyable getting to know some of my coworkers.
good,great training  in the company very hands working for the company I like the time management the way they took care of their associated and the holiday in bonces they hand out was great they are willing to work around your time to make sureyou get hours
good,"busy work day normally, learned customer service skills, management overall is was good, hardest part of the job was no set schedule, the most enjoyable was meeting new customers."
good,Learned a lot about baking and decorating cakes and other pastries. learned how to work or deal with costumers and take orders over a phone. Walmart is a good place to learn.
good,Typical Retail job. You clock in stock shelves do some other tasks and help customers as needed. Not much else can be said besides in the store you are you to corporate or home office you are just a number and don't matter in the long run.
good,"It was a good experience based on my opinion, you'll learn how to deal with production, quality, safety and a lot of physical activity at same time. "
good,"I love working here but the management works us like dogs with no help at all. They don't seem very sympathetic to when you are ill and can't work because a doctors excuse is not a valid excuse, you have to get admitted into a hospital in order for the absence to be authorized. I do like the break system/"
good,"Fun Workplace , Just Looking For Better Pay And Overtime If Needed. Management Is Poor With Skills  And I Am Guaranteed 40hrs Until Next Year 2018 Our Schedule Changes So Thats Why I Need Another Job"
good,I didn't like the management there and how I would work the same hours as everyone else but get paid less. The management wasn't very friendly to me. The security should probably be more advanced as well.
good,"Days are very busy in the pharmacy! More than 500 prescriptions are filled daily. It was hard, for me, to accurately input prescriptions between patients when the lines are long and patients aren't happy.  I enjoyed filling, and people's appreciation. I did not enjoyed rude customers, but I did love my job. I believe Walmart is a good working company. I do need a better place to learn more and grow in my career!!!!"
good,"I loved my job.  I knew what was expected of me and what my job was.  Although, with the number of people we had, the expectation was unrealistic, we always gave it our best.  I learned that if you have given it your all, you can't beat yourself up for not being able to accomplish everything.  Yes, you do have to keep pushing, but not to get discouraged when you could not do everything needed to be done."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is pretty slow at first then customers start pooling in at certain times. I learned how to work at a fast pace, operate a register, handle money, provide customer service, and boosted my confidence. Management wasn't all that great when you needed assistance it wasn't there, then you had to hold up the customers and that's not good. Hardest part of the job was getting assistance when needed the most. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers socially."
good,"The managers were usually there to help you out, the store manager is a great guy. Work load is easy to complete. Advancement is easy if you put in some effort."
good,i was a cashier when i worked at walmart but there are many different positions at walmart. low pay and benefits unless you get in as a supervisor or manager.
good,It was a busy and experiencing work atmosphere. I enjoyed the people I worked with butI had to have a better pay. That's the reason that I left Walmart.
good,I worked overnights. it was just fine besides sleepless nights and emotionally draining mornings before the end of my shift. I would not recommend overnights to anyone unless you're forced due to circumstances.
good,Productive and fast-paced. I only worked part time so I did not receive benefits. Overall professional and respectful environment to work in. Management can be less than ideal at times.
good,"Worked as a cart pusher and cashier, but the manager who overseed the cashiers and cart pushers was practically useless and would only complain at us instead of helping us during busy times."
good,Management needs to work better with employees that is the management at the time I worked there. The manager now seems well liked.need to give more hours to employees that need to work
good,Learned a great deal of the ins and outs of a retail environment through constant training. Leading fellow employees through their duties. Lots of responsibilities to meet the needs of the customers.
good,"Uma empresa que da várias oportunidades de crescimento, praticam e vivem a política da empresa, valorizam e reconhece o trabalho de cada funcionário"
good,"Me gusta todo mi trabajo pero necesito una mejor paga una mejor estabilidad , mejores oportunidades de aprender más , horas completas sin cortes"
good,It was a good job An would go back if I ever had to. Was in highschool when I worked here so unfortunately I was involved in a lot of school functions so I quit so I would have time for it all.
good,It was a nice place to work good benifits management made it hard when they ride your behind to get the job done in a timely manner and very rude it made it very stressful the job itself was not hard it got so it wasnt enjoyable because of management.
good,Wall Mart was a great place to work. Managers were fun and ideal to work with. Yet there are times as a department manager work was stressful with the turnover rate being so high. Completion of work was sometimes hard because of lack of help
good,They do discriminate about disabled people. They were good about saying the truth. It was a clean friendly environment. Coworkers r nice. They have their good days and bad days.
good,my typical day working at Walmart was easygoing at the beginning but it began to be really stressful. management was very antsy about work being completed on time. workplace culture was okay but my situation is different.
good,Bonne dynamique de travail lors de certaines journées.
good,"I enjoyed working here for customers and meeting new people on a daiily basis. Half the time, the customers would give life stories of their veteran years. It was always pleasant to chat with them while keeping up with my job tasks. I was cross trained with the company to give helping hands to different areas. I inventoried the stockrooom, stockedthe salesfloor, operated the registers, and a few other tasks during my tenure."
good,It was a good job with good money good benefits and great staff. I started in electronics and I already had Electronics experience and cell phone experience then I moved over to Tire & Lube didn't have any   experience at all and then became a senior technician
good,Lots of work to do. Often pulled to a different department if short staffed. The hardest part of the job is during the holidays and usually they don't have enough area coverage.
good,"Great for single career driven people. But, if you have a family or have anything else going on at home plan on putting that on hold. Not that you want to or that your work will keep you from them. but if you want to move up or have a career with the company you will spend most of your time here. Great opportunity for advancement for the right people."
good,"The hardest part of the job is unloading the trucks,sorting out the boxes with the letters of each department, and stacking the boxes neatly to stock."
good,I love working at Walmart good benefits Flexible hours good management some good investment to Build a career is the best place to work at a Retail store
good,"Task"
good,Its a great company to build yourself from the bottom up if you keep motivated. I've learned things like how to decorate cakes with experience without any previous training. Loved everyone I've met. Walmart gets looked down upon but I've bought 3 cars and have gotten lasik eye surgery while working here and paid them off within the 9 years with this company.
good,"Wal-Mart was real fasted paced, paid fairly, and allowed many opportunity for advancement. They scheduled mostly fair and balanced work and life fairly."
good,My job was pretty laid back. I was a stocker and organizer. Every day we would stock and tidy up the different aisle and make sure the barcodes matched up with the product.
good,"I worked overnight as a stocker, though there are lots of shifts available."
good,"Essentially, I help customers decide on products, then sell the products to them. I also assist the pharmacy in the process of dispensing medications, though i do not physically fill medications myself. Stocking and maintaining the pharmacy department is also a responsibility."
good,decent place overall. decent hours and pay. Management was okay. Manly left for wanting another work field. Very good environment to work in too and never had to worry about store conditions or too many things breaking. A lot of people were helpful if you needed help with something.
good,A good place to work if you are just entering the job market. Great benefits and pay. Easy to move to a different job if you desire it. Most employees are friendly and easy to work with.
good,"Great opportunity for first job experience, customer relations, not a lot  of hours or benefits. no paid. Very good management at the time being. opportunity for full time very Little"
good,"it was interesting to work with different cultures and peoples, learned more and gained more work experience, and was really enjoyable to help customers in any departments"
good,"I don't know if working in the pharmacy with a small team affected how I viewed working for Walmart, but I had the most supportive coworkers and managers and that honestly made it the best place for me"
good,"Aprendi muita coisa nessa empresa. Empresa boa de se trabalhar, gestão boa."
good,My pharmacy as far as the people were great to work with. The company itself does not value its employees. A very stressful job with no recognition that pays well.
good,Its a great day at walmart i loved working their. i learned how to work well with others. i learned to be the best management that i can be.The people at work where great and i would love to work with them again. the hardest part of the job was nothing. the best part of the job was going to work
good,At first the job was okay when you make the hours. Sometimes the managers move around the store departments and sometimes the scheduling can be inconvenient. Also no overtime or many hours.
good,"Seasonal job worked on the sales floor assisting customers putting out merchandise, stacking the shelves. The hardest part of the job was when they let all seasonal hire go one week before Christmas"
good,Here I learned how to delivered good customers service. I learn the importance of team work. I moved around a lot here from stocking to cashier. I enjoyed been a part of their team.
good,"I loved working at walmart , Loved making the costumers smile, LIke every job there was ups and downs . my manager was fair and honest. only reason for leaving this job was that the pay wasnt enough to take care of my bills and family ."
good,"its a good to start and built your career at wal-mart but them it takes all your time from ur family life, but you will learn and you will be multitasker."
good,I would recommend walmart to a friend but that friend has to have time a patience. Walmart is a very strict place to work in but has very noce benefits.
good,"wanted to switch from stocker to forklift operator which i was hired to do and they didnt allow departnent transfer management was not good, and training was very poor as well."
good,"walmart  is very  very   fast  pace, you have to pay attention, to everything happening around you ,people  are in a rush,everyday!!!!! hope the workers hang in there long term"
good,"Overall i was pleased with the company , but found some of their views [ the pot calling the kettle black ]   "
good,It is an ok place to be depending on the manager’s attitude and how much they care. Some tends to be rude when asked simple questions or for assistance.
good,I didn't mind working at Walmart.  We got set tasks to do so there was always work to make the time go fast.  I learned how to read bar codes along with customer service.
good,"clock in review current stock on shelves and incoming shipments preform down stack( sorting of items from the boxes) restock the shelves, item placement, clean isles and shelving units, set up display areas, change price tags and clearance items."
good,Not much to say. Walmart is walmart. I worked in the automotive it was fine. There isn't much to say. They will put you at exactly 34 hours a week so you're not considered full time at 40 hours so you don't get benefits even though they're a multi-billion dollar company. The people are what you expect at walmart.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is very fast pace, competitive, and can get very stressful at times. If you don't have the liquor license you have to wait until someone scans it. I learned that you have to be patient. The hardest part of the job is holidays because how hectic it gets. The most enjoyable part is the employees. The managers you have some good ones some bad."
good,It wasn't a bad place there is room to advance and learn and full time got 40 hours and sometimes overtime. You cant call off a lot or they will fire you.
good,All aspects of the job were easy to follow. All of my coworkers were easy to work with. Management was good and efficient. The only downside was poor pay and few benefits.
good,over all it was  ok at first it was a little hard but i got used to it  there were some days i didnt want to go due to other coworkers slacking off or not doing what needed to be done
good,Great starter job with benefits work well together provide great help fat pace environment very concrete on hours raises annually very understanding management
good,stocking and unloading freight from the company trucks as well as using pallet jacks to pull boxes to the front of the building. Management was very hands on with training
good,Everybody is friendly on 3rd shift.It is a good place to work for a part time job the hourly pay is ok. and the mangers are are very nice motivating and keep you focused.
good,Pay scale is too low for the stress and hours needed to succeed. Location of store is in high cost of living area so minimal raises are insensitive to the needs of the associates and management there.
good,Customer service and trainer ..... regular day is handling Money and registers . Supervising Cashier's and Maintenance through out the day . Making sure shift are covered and maintaining a safe work place
good,I enjoyed working here i am just looking for an advancement in my career and they are not offering what i want. they offer fair employment opportunities and working conditions.
good,I love my job at walmart but some of the support managers they wont help with anything and only was responsible when the actual manager was around...Besides that its pretty cool and chill your not rush like if u was in a restaurant. And you learn new things everyday walmart would make you feel home just helping out around the house nothing too stressful.
good,It had poor management when I was their and the managers over us had really bad communication skills and treated us very poorly as though we were a number that was replaceable. but I hear these days someone else runs Walmart and doing a great job.
good,En esta empresa se tienen muchas oportunidades de crecimiento dentro de la empresa
good,it was a great job coming down to meeting new people. the management wasn't the most ideal. The management was mainly just there to dicate. they really didn't help you out and when asked for help got a lot of attitude.
good,Found that the company has great benefits Unfortunately slow to advance employees that have worked there for a long. I should be mandatory that company advance employee with new opportunities and better training if they want them to remain there.
good,This is a good company to work at as long as you do not work overnights. They do not understand how hard it is to work overnights and they make everything simple on days and throw overnights under the bus.
good,"I enjoyed working there, I got along great with a lot of people,  but management was too lax and it seemed they couldn't agree with each other half the time, which made it difficult to work there somedays."
good,"Working 48 plus hours a week. Different duties and task, working with a management staff of over 15 and with up to 150 associates. Customer Service, placing orders, supervising Department Managers, Human Resource, Supervising up front Operations, Delegating tasks to Department Managers, Warehouse Operations, Outside maintenance operations."
good,hard working hours and standing all day so you must be willing to do this without taking breaks sometimes at a later time but other then that it was a cool job and i would go back if i could
good,"Very good pay"
good,Foi bastante produtivo minha vivência no Wal-Mart onde adquirir muitas experiências e tive algumas oportunidades de carreira.
good,"hard and fast pace "
good,"worked here in high school, good job to start, not too demanding. was able to fairly easily balance school, homework, sports, and my shifts at Walmart."
good,"I started here seasonally, it was pretty calm but you would get swarmed almost every hour in the small town i lived in, so im positive its busy in the city,"
good,"I like working here, the management is nice. I learned customer service. The hardest part of work was the customer complain while the store is extremely busy."
good,Wal-Mart is a job ware you can easily move up quickly. The only thing you have to do is work hard every day and show up. I would say if you want their benefits it is quit expensive for a spouse and children.
good,Went in and found out assignments. Worked out my shift for the day. I enjoyed the customers and my fellow coworkers. My job consisted of many different tasks.
good,"Love to help and be amongst people.  I find alot of satisfaction in helping ANYONE during my day (something that led me to pursue my primary field, that of being a nurse)."
good,"Walmart is not a bad company as a whole to work for. They offer benefits to part-time employees. It is very cut-throat and competitive but the store culture is one of family. Management is dependent on your location, very inconsistent. When I worked there the pay was low but they have taken steps to improve that now."
good,All I did was stand behind the register everyday which is good for someone who likes repetitiveness but not if you like doing different things and not standing in one place all the time.
good,At the time I started working at Walmart there was a huge need for employees and so the wages were higher and if a person had some experience there was always opportunity to move up the store ladder. Most of the employees were severely unprepared for the work load but if you could handle it you were treated well by the management team.
good,Solid place to work. Some of the mangers there are hard headed fellas. Loved the people i worked with. Very open to having your schedule changed. solid place.
good,Local management was wonderful but corporate doesn't seem to care about employees. Advancement is available to people who work in retail. No it a good environment for mechanics.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. There is room for advancement but it's not something I'm interested in doing there. The hours are long and it is salary but not worth the money nor the stress.
good,"Even as a part time employee, the number of hours given each eek was purposely enough to allow for healthcare benefits. Also the opportunity for education to advance within the company was always supported and offered within house first. Bonuses are extended to part time employees just as well as full time employees every three months for savings accumulated by keeping a safe environment for all customers."
good,It is a fun place to work at. I enjoyed working with my colleagues and learnt a lot from them. One of the cons is that they do not pay well and give very minimal increase.
good,"The work is fairly standard for what you'd expect from a large chain retailer, but the hours are inconsistent each week and it's hard to balance life outside of work with inconsistent hours. The benefits are surprisingly good as a full time employee, with a good and affordable healthcare plan, time off based on your hours worked with the amount increasing as you stay longer with the company, 401k matching (up to 6% at time of writing), and a 10% on a majority of the products offered.  The management is spotty, with some being good and some being poor to work with.  The store tries to push  on the company and If you enjoy retail Wal-Mart is not a terrible place to work but if you do not enjoy interacting with occasionally angry customers or do not like the idea of retail as a career it is not the place to look into long term."
good,Working at Wal-Mart can be very stressful. It really depends on who you work with. Also depends on your customers. There are too many managers in charge.
good,"*Happy to go to work everyday and take care of my patients"
good,"All in all a good place to work if you just go in do your job and go home.  Managers steadily on you to get done. Expectations are set too high. Favoritism is a huge factor, at least on over nights."
good,"I was a good field but the only real problem was something that every job has, which is micro managing. The management never had good communication that made your work hard."
good,A typical day on cap would be getting all the product off the floor from night shift. Scanning all the left over product into bins and putting them up and then running top stock.  On online grocery we had to ber there at 4 a.m. and we had to stay until all picks were done so at times we were there for 12 - 14 hours aday. I had to pick order for the customers bag them and when done I had to put them in the right location and when the customer came to come get there order I had to dispense the order to them and go over there order and explain there order. In the deli I had customer service I had to wait on the customers cut there product for them.
good,"I was excited to work there when I first began. I saw how they earned a negative reputation amongst former employees, by the end of my time. For better or worse, it inspired me to strive for more in life."
good,my typical day at work were stocker and re stocker I learn customer skills learn lot skills tips and tricks job done great work place culture my hard part of the job was there were none I enjoyed holidays cultures and customers support
good,"A typical day at Walmart can bring you about 100 customers per shift.  It can get hectic during certain days in the month, holidays, etc.  Overall, management are pretty laid-back, maybe sometimes too much.  The customers can be pretty nasty at times and bigoted.  Other than that, its not too bad of a place to work."
good,it can be stressful at times but if you keep a smile on your face and ignore the bad things then your are good. The management is not so good at Walmart sometimes they don't want to listen to you other times they ignore your needs.
good,Wal-Mart was an Ok company some of the management was unprofessional...but there was room for growth. I started as a cashier. Became a Customer Service Manager less than a year that I was there...after I worked 11mos I was promoted to Personnel Manager
good,"In all honesty, working for the pharmacy was a great learning experience and inspired my motivation to move towards a career in pharmaceutical services.  Unfortunately, it was only part-time and did not provide any benefits or advancement, which prompted me to accept a full-time job offer."
good,average work envirement for pharmacist good computer system easy  to learn-helpful staff wellness director alwaysavailable enjoyed working for the company
good,You have to be a people person to work their because you meet and see a lot of different people that work their and that come in there to shop. They give you opportunity to move up in the company
good,"not to many cashiers, always call outs customers services desk always dirt, cashiers walking around don't want to help customers ringing up there stuff"
good,It gets you the experience you need to succeed in other jobs that contain great customer service. Its the door opener. So if your young and need a place to start Walmart is the way to go.
good,When I first started 10 years ago I lives working there. After time went by I found it harder to advance with the company. It took me 7 years to move up from one position to the next.
good,This job is alright. Some managers are the best some arn't. A lot of breaks. They are strict on attendance and work ethic. They have a dress code. They have a very fun orientation proccess.
good,"The associate is last with the company, The management team only is concern with what is done for them, A lot of chiefs and not enough Indians. Must have open availability."
good,"Stocking takes a toll on your body, especially when you are little. Make sure you do the recommended and required training because it can potentially allow you to receive a raise."
good,"When I started there is when they were not giving breaks to workers so you could work an 8  to 12 hr shift and be expected to not take a break. I was expecting when I worked there , even with Dr. telling the supervisor I needed to eat . I was not given breaks to the point where I fainted . things have gotten better since . I know many people that work there now and are very happy"
good,"never the same job every day"
good,"Fast paced some racist customers, Some people lack on there job. Nice break, needed better supervisor. No training just point to the aisle and get right to it."
good,"Although it is a very relaxed environment, as a cashier particularly it is a hassle. Considering there weren't many cashiers we were forced to work harder than any other Wal-Mart associate. Would much rather recommend any other role but they do have good opportunities so it's not that hard to move up!"
good,The company is great to work for if you plan on working there through your college years. They are very lenient when it comes to work schedules and schooling.
good,"My time at Walmart was unique since I worked at two different stores. The managers and crew did things very differently in each store. The music helped pass time, along with the ability to have a capped bottle of water on the floor while you worked."
good,Walmart is very fast pace trying to do thing on the fly. Changes happen very fast and sometimes take a lot of extra work. At Walmart we don't do it right we do it  twice.
good,"Walmart offers good benefits but overall on a corporate level the seem to not really care about their employees. Even on a store level, the assistant managers are more for themselves and less about helping you. It's a do it and get it done I don't care how just do it environment"
good,"Used the Walmart device (MC40), stocked the shelves up with dry groceries pulled from the backroom.  Communicated with supervisor on what I needed to do daily.  Pulled dry groceries from the backroom shelves to fill up on the sales floor."
good,I was working in the summer time so it was hot especially Texas . I was trying to get  promoted  but they didn't have any room for  promotion . It was a good work  experience
good,I would not have a problem if I could go back to days and they wouldn't by-pass me over the next advance and if the overnight assiment manger would not be bullying me.I love stocking but need to go to days but was told I could never go by the night mangment
good,Working at walmart was a great first job for me to acquire. It paid decent for what being a Tire & Lube Tech. Some of us would have liked a higher pay raise.
good,"I worked for Walmart several times and in many locations and there is honestly just as much good as there is bad when experiencing the work and environment it's not all the customers and not all the management or employees. "
good,The people are nice but the pay can be better and better hours. Some of the worst managers and coworkers but great customers. Would work here again hoping for a better experience.
good,The worst part of the job situation is the lack of staffing makes everyone elses day harder. The current management for my department is great upper management not the best.
good,Walmart is a great job especially when you are enrolled in school or just a typical work experience. It provides good benefits and a discount for the hard work we associates provide for the company.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work, but my place of work was poorly managed with hours and other aspects. Not good with working with school schedule. I would recommend if you can work full time and not worrying about school."
good,Walmart managers need better training and better understanding of how much time it takes to stock an aisle. Breaks were good and long enough. Employees get discounts and full time employees get great benefits.
good,"As an assistant manager, I worked 50+ hours and I was salary so I did not get over time. The schedule is not set, so I worked different shifts everyday different days of the week. It is not ideal if you have a family. However, it is a fun place to work and a great learning experience."
good,Walmart is a fast paced environment where you will be hired to work in a specific area but you are much more likely to end up running a register at the front of the store rather than what you were hired to do.
good,"Although working at Walmart can be stressful, it can be fun to get to know customers, and we associates are like family. Walmart does provide good benefits as well."
good,"Started working. Remolded associated move up to sales associated. love helping customers. and talking to them. Sorting, inventory, shipping / receiving "
good,"i like it somehow but not a lot"
good,"I worked there for 2 years, at first it was oaky, everyone was super nice and easy going. After a few months of being there, the management started to progressively get worse, constant nagging and nitpicking."
good,"They are flexible with hours, they can put you anywhere in store, like anywhere else the store morale depends alot on management team, which changes alot"
good,Pagan muy poco y es mucho trabajo y laboras en diferentes areas
good,"I was hired and promised full time, started out full time. Was told I was doing a wonderful job, winter came and I was working 3 days a week. Asked for more hours, but my manager could not give them to me, his boss was in charge, so regardless of hours promised, I was only working 3 days a week after starting out almost every day. I could not live off those hours. Co-workers were wonderful, my manager was awesome, but Walmart controls the hours and pay. I felt the reason they are able to give good raises is because they can cut the hours short or move you to part time. I loved working there. But low hours keeps me from going back, even though I've been asked and encouraged to re-apply."
good,It was ok mostly set schedules and kinda easy going can be stressful at times the pay is good and management is understanding of personal situations but a good job
good,my first year working at my store was pretty good but as soon as they switched management it went down hill very quickly. you just gotta hope your manager isn't money hungry and he cares about his employees lives.
good,"While it doesn't have the best reputation for its workers most Wal-Marts can be great places to start a career in retail or gain experience at least.It all depends on the location. Wal-Mart in mid size towns and cities were fine. Smaller towns or really big cities not so much. "
good,"The pay isn't amazing at Walmart but there is a great work culture and comprehensive training program for new trainees. If I ever had a question, a supervisor would almost immediately be over to my station to assist, and they were never mad at me for asking too many questions!"
good,"work hard theyll like you"
good,"The size of Walmart stores allows for nearly endless advancement possibilities. Pay isn't the best, however early advancement is possible for hard working associates"
good,"I was the only nighttime cashier, Also was responsible for two aisles to be correctly inventory and stocked. Not a big deal because that was part of the job and company. I even would stay late to help on other isles. The extra effort was never rewarded. Management played favorites at times. Also overtime was provide one week but then the following week they would adjust the schedule for you to sit out the extra hours. Bad Business. I also was let go for my attendance, I had to miss out dued to my daughter being in ICU. I love the atmosphere , especially the customers . The Business needs adjusting ."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, empresa com grande rotatividade."
good,"Hey, I am a sales associated in the deli of Walmart in the Whitehaven area. On a typical day at work the day can be a wonderful day. To work in the deli you have to have an extremely positive attitude. The hardest part of the job is when most of the your co-workers don't even bother to come to work and the day becomes frustrating because of being shorthanded. But, the more positive your are the more you would love your job"
good,It's a good job could have paid a lot better management was not to good but the hours was good I liked the job the workers was great people is was really a great fun place to work
good,"a typical day at the Walmart warehouse I would consider as I've been working here a few months would be stacking 2500 cases in a hot trailer all day and getting jams from line its running on. I've learned a lot and still got more to learn. the management is ok. the workplace culture is very good to as well. The hardest part is trying to keep from having jams and having your line backed up with a lot of freight coming on it. the most enjoyable part of working here I would have to say how much they start u off at, only working 3days and being off the rest of the week and the raises u receive after being there several months."
good,"Good for the people person if you can handle irate customers 80% of the time. store manager is worthless, no culture, no interpersonal skills. fun to work in the store and interact with associates and meet new people."
good,"I loved working for Walmart, but there are ""too many chiefs, not enough Indians."" Management doesn't communicate with each other before giving orders, leading to a lot of confusion. There were a few very good managers who were easy to talk to, but the ones who were not personable completely overshadowed them. I've held three very different positions at two different stores and had the same issue in each role."
good,Walmart was a good place to work when starting out. Moved up from entry level position to department manager for several parts of the store so I was able to learn many different aspects of the company.
good,I enjoyed the environment I was in . Wish management was for the people cause I feel like Wal-Mart has potential. Allways was rushed and on you if you didn't complete task with a butt load of task
good,"Its a okay place to work , management can sometimes be the problem. They promote raises and bonuses. After you've been  there for 3 months you get paid time off and paid vacations."
good,I worked for the best team within the company.  It was a great experience.  I wouldn't trade the experience & companionship for anything.  I was able to expand my knowledge outside the basic legal scope of the business.
good,"Large business, can go up the ladder if you apply yourself. Located in   many major cities. Easy to transfer. Job security. Has positions for everybody."
good,"A typical day at work would include checking out customer purchases and keeping my aisle clean."
good,I can say I loved working for Walmart but I hit some mudstones which cause me to stop working there and yess I would refer other to take a leap........
good,"A typical day at this job would be after clocking in we would have a review on the day before then everyone would go to what they where assigned, and after i would finish my job i would help the others finish what they have to do. The hardest part would be going to work on time, and staying awake.The most enjoyable part would be talking to the people their."
good,When I started working here I enjoyed coming to work and worked extra hours. Now management changes schedules at no notice and makes you feel your job is at stake everyday creating a very stressful atmosphere.
good,4 years working for retail. I have performed several duties and learned different task about the company. monitoring 3 departments and monitoring daily sales
good,I gained lots of hours and pay but not enough training. The work environment was not what I expected it to be. I would have loved to feel like I was part of a team but it was more like every man for themselves. I like when employers focus more on their employees to make sure they feel accepted and have a great working experience but I didn't receive that here.
good,"I thank Walmart for giving me the opportunity of employment, I admit you will get what you put into Walmart to an extent but it is very easy to get taken advantage of. Walmart cares more about the final result and less about equal distribution among employees."
good,"This company was a great learning experience for becoming a manager. But they lack the compassion of a working family person. If your child falls ill, or a baby sitter falls through, they will not be flexible and will even emphasize the fact that you are risking your job if you fall upon a family issue,"
good,I loved my job at Walmart. Change over in upper management was my reason for leaving. They didn't know how talk to their associates and they worked us to the lol we dropped at times at the end of my shift my back would be killing me but I pushed through in order to fifnish out my shift. I always went above and beyond to ensure my customers and associates needs were met but that wasn't good enough upper management never  appreciated  hard work they just assigned you more responsibilities
good,The  company  Ran  off  production  you  have  to  meet  95%  at  the  end  of  the  day  and  it  was  hard for  me  to  reach  for  the  most  part.
good,"Create weekly plans and activities. Make sure our service is what they need . i love a long productive day ,that keep me busy interacting with others."
good,Working at Walmart is alright they just need to hire more people. If you work hard and you're always on time it's easy to move up the hours aren't that bad
good,"It was a good job. I liked it. The job wasn't that hard, unless it was a busy day. It was a typical entry level job. While there was no overtime, your work hours were very flexible."
good,Working as a builder was great. constantly building different products for the company. Kept a steady work pace. Hardest part of the job was dealing with certain costumers that didn't want to listen to reason .
good,Not bad id work there its in side not dirty lite work and friendly people u get to meet alote of different types of people u learn how to stock shelves and learn to put away a lot of products fast and safe
good,Working here wasn't a bad experience but sometimes dealing with the rude customers can be over whelming. some days there are really nice customers who will greet u back. My overall experience was good.
good,"Not a great place for a younger individual to stay at unless they plan on moving up in the company, but it is a great place as a first job.  Gives the individual an appreciation for employers at their local stores."
good,"I would do my job as best as I could, but I would still be expected to do my subordinates jobs as well. I enjoyed working for the company, but they expected too much when I did not have enough people to get the job done. They also did not like it when I told them when something will not get done when I was just being honest that I did not have enough people to get that objective done."
good,It is okay to work at but is not for everyone. The management team could be much better if everyone work as a team. The job as far as customers goes is good but sometimes working under management it can be stressful.
good,"Worked there for about a year and a half, it was alright. The same things as a regular cashier, ringing through items and cleaning tills, occasionally stocking times onto shelves when it was slow."
good,"Typical days of work are basically full of stocking merchandise."
good,"Loved the job.  I transferred from a different store, because i was offered a set schedule. I had teens at home and need the shift i was promised.  After working there for a few years the department manager changed my shift,"
good,This job was both fun and stressful. Good for students fresh out of high school to get their foot in a decent paying job. However some of the management was a little power hungry and spiteful.
good,It was a good experience. I liked the people and the environment of that job. It was way going but the pay couple have been better and there could have been a few more chances for promotion.
good,"A typical day for me at work was a very busy and tiring day. I've had many different customers with various moods.I learned to remain humble, polite, and patient."
good,"Good start,good benefits, good communication, good fellowship, flexible schedules , good attitude with employees, opportunities for growth."
good,A typical day at WalMart was pretty easygoing.There were days where is was crazy and backed up but all stores have those days. I learned how to talk to different people and deal with stressful situations. The hardest part of the job is simply having to stand on your feet all day.
good,its alright. they do not care about their associates well being and will find ways to keep you from advancing. Some of management should not be in management. However employees nice and the good managers are awesome and will help however they can.
good,"Working here was very stressful.  They asked so much of people.  I was a CSM and ran the front end at overnight.  They expected 2 cashiers to cover breaks and lunches, put up freight, check out customers and sort thru returns."
good,It was eazy working there but i love it every a lot and i will go back if i can but  the hardest was unloaded the truck but it was fun to. i thick everyone car do it.
good,Overworked with freight daily.  Understaffed completely.  Unable to do job requirements do to lack of management cooperation.  .unrealistic time frame of work
good,It depends on your managers you can have decent ones that care about the job or you have the ones that are there for the paycheck. There is a lot of work place politics tho.
good,"I started I the shoe department, than I was a wireless representative doing cell phones contracts. I like the people. very helpful and well training. That was my first job I the USA"
good,"The hours are very flexible, perfect for students. Management does not listen to their associates as much as they should be. Pay compensation is rather weak, but it pays the bills."
good,"Diversas actividades atención acliente como estar en un departamento manejar caja chica,y limpieza"
good,"un ambiente agradable, necesario actitud de servicio"
good,"Can stay busy is you choose too. Otherwise, you can do whatever you want without the worry of getting fired. Just show up and leave on time.Helpful if you can read."
good,It was a good job by the management was very bias. They were always getting on the wrong people over things that were not wrong while letting people who were doing the wrong thing get away with it.
good,I've learned that you learn a lot of things in retail an all over departments for the company. Walmart is a very culture workplace you have a lot of different cultures not just one or two. Nothing was hard to me working there because it gave me a different outlook on retail an it can be very fun.
good,"My typical day at work starts with me checking my task and preparing for what my task wants me to do that day.Then I start on that task and through out the day help customers find different items as well. I love helping people and it's very interesting because I meet different cultures and backgrounds each and everyday. There is nothing difficult about the days that I work at this company. It's pretty simple, check my task , complete the task and help customers while doing so. I have no problems with management."
good,"Pay is good until they cut 5 hours a week. I expect to work at least 40 hours a week on average not 35-38 hours. Other than the problem with the hours, benefits are great co workers are good and the work is decent."
good,"Working at Walmart was a very good experience for me, it allowed me to learned how to work with the public, and interact with different cultures, I also learned how to work at a fast and efficient pace."
good,"Fast pasted.  Inventory has become more important than service."
good,"If you can ignore pettiness and drama in the workplace than you will do fine, but if all this gets do you well then it might not be the place for you."
good,Typical day was stocking and assisting customers. Hardest part about the job was being expected to run multiple departments and being short staffed. The best part about the job was making new friends and being fed on holidays and special events.
good,It's hard to work here when you are disabled. You are told you're duties in the beginning. The management change things at there will . I really enjoyed the customers. Both adults and children. I was able to get along with other employees and management as well. Until management changed my responsibilities. I would of been still working there if they hadn't changed my responsibilities
good,Do YOUR JOB Do everything your told to do the wey you are told to do it. Make sure everything that you do is confirmed by a saleried manager and noone else or you  cill be coached.
good,"Working at Walmart was okay, personally I think there is too many managers so it's hard to differentiate the things your supposed to do. Overall the pay isn't bad and it's a job you can rely on."
good,For the most part I worked overnight so it wasn't working with customers much. Working overnight leaves time to focus on your work. Management was there and making sure you get things done right for the most part. I learned enough to help me get my job done. The hardest part of the job would be other employees. Sometimes distractions or things like private life would have them interfere with work.
good,Nights are a relaxed time for working however we worked hard and pushed to get everything done before the morning shift arrived. The hardest part of the job was that it was night work and that the pay wasn't very good.
good,it was a very great learning experiences. great employees but the management need a little help on communication skill. talking to there workers in a better matter
good,"I've spent a total of almost 10 years working at different Walmarts and a Sam's Club. In all that time I found that while the money was decent and the benefits were good it was very stressful. The management has a job to do, just like I do, but I often felt they deemed themselves higher than the rest of us. They wouldn't help with cashiering during busy times and most of them used their cell phones for personal reasons while on the floor. They had a mentality of do as I say, not what I do. That was very difficult to work with."
good,"I work at Walmart for about a year before being force to quit, due to never having coverage for lunch and always having to due other peoples job."
good,"typical day greeting and helping customers. unloading freight. running the cash register. help stocking. two 15 minute breaks, hour lunch. Not a horrible place to work."
good,I enjoyed working with the associates. Always learned a lot from our management team. Safety was #1 at Wal-mart. Some days were long especially at inventory & Holidays
good,They job is good. Get to meet new people everyday. But i dont feel advancement is available in a short term goal. You are overworked and underpaid. Some jobs there deserve more pay.
good,"I didn't really enjoy working here, as management made cuts, so did the quality of teamwork and customer service. Its a great job if your looking for a 'stepping stone'."
good,"es una excelente empresa en el ámbito que te capacita en muchas áreas, ademas que tiene una gran facilidad para obtener una promoción"
good,Help maintained the facility and business.  Also helped set up displays.  The place was very well rounded and the crew is nice and the company is willing to help you grow.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was good I got the best pay i've ever had in any job i've worked. The work life had it's rough spots but overall "
good,Environment is good and the customers are always nice. Management try to help you at times. They also requires you to be on time and working the whole time you are on the clock.
good,they expect to much out of its employees it is very hard work for the pay i think it needs improvement managers do not use the open dorr policy like they should its very stressful sometimes
good,"Take you from one task before it was completed to another task , then wonder why the first task wasn't completed. Assistant managers, varied on managing skills and ability."
good,As far as being professional and organized the Walmart company is exactly that.  As with all companies dealing with the different personalities in management can be challenging.  My biggest concern was the unrealistic expectations set on certain jobs they would request.  Other than that it's a fairly decent paying job for this area.
good,"Cada día se aprende algo nuevo, trabajo en equipo."
good,"This particular experience left me feeling indifferent. While I had 5 years of experience that they were more than willing to take advantage of, company policy would not allow them to compensate me accordingly. This left me a little resentful, but the people I worked directly with were good people. I will honestly say I preferred my previous location over this one when it came to how things were done. The hardest part, the low pay and part time hours. The best part, good co-workers.. at least in my experience."
good,"starting pay was not bad, higher than minimum wage for every role. constant interaction with customers kept employees on their toes. immediate and upper management were friendly and helpful."
good,"My job duties were to do drawer change outs , make sure customer got checked out with little to no waiting, give cashiers breaks, make sure store was clean and ready to hand over to the next shift,"
good,They always worked with my hours for work no matter what I needed. When I had problems a manager would be there to help without asking questions. The hours are good and so is the pay
good,"The pay is very fair for the work. However, managment is going to throw you under the bus if it is between you or them. And they expect you to live and breath Wal-mart. The attendance policy is so strict that if you end up getting the flu and must call out for a week to recover, all the days you miss count towards your attendance. Management doesn't care because they view you as replaceable. Even if you have worked there for 5 years."
good,"Not much else to say, no one wanted to be there so it was always negative, i enjoyed my job but i didnt much care for the people i worked with, it was like everyone had something against the world."
good,"i liked working here but they dont really take care of their employees. i got sick and was taken out of work but since i didnt have any pto and they only let you miss work 4 times and then your fired, i had to quit since they DONT TAKE DOCTORS NOTES!"
good,Working at Walmart was ok. The typical day at work is good but when you have to deal with managers they don't want to do their jobs . You go to them tell them something  that is Important they take forever to get it done or oh they forgot. Front end goes over your availability. That's against the policy.
good,Walmart is not a bad place to work.  They put the schedules out in advance so you can plan around it.  I was a cashier there.  The pay is good and at the time they offered benefits to part time employees.
good,"A typical day at work is one consisting on helping customers and filing photos for customers.  The culture of the Walmart that I had worked at was one that was very friendly and great to work with.  However, sometimes the management team would take longer then excepted to resolve issues."
good,I was fortunate enough to work at the Customer Service desk. It was my first job and truly gave me some real experience dealing with difficult and challenging situations. I'm grateful for the opportunity to gain that experience and prepared me for more challenging situations.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart, because I enjoy helping people.  I loved running freight on a daily bases, while helping each customer and providing the best service I could."
good,"I worked at the Wal-Mart in Niles IL on golf Road."
good,overall the Walmart optical department is one of the best places to be located in as an employee. however you must be prepared to handle near constant policy changes with little communication as well as constant harassment and threats by customers.
good,"Walmart is ok to work for depending on what store one is in. You get support from management when needed. But hiring good, quality people can be a challenge."
good,It was a great place to learn how to deal with customers on a daily basis as far as helping them  find things that they need. I also learned how to work productively as a team member.
good,Stressful It Gets Hard And Really Annoying At Times Its Not A Place I Would Consider Working For Long The Customers Are Rude For No Reason But The People That Works There Are Nice
good,"It was a good starting point for me. I learned a lot on the job and how to interact with customers in a busy environment. I don't have too much of an opinion on the management. It was a part time position while I was in school. "
good,"stock and bin fright in backroom."
good,Walmart is a great place to work. My typical day would consist of running the photo department and helping out with customer service. The management was great and friendly. The hardest part of the job was fixing the photo machines whenever they would break. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers print their photos.
good,"An alright job kinda of not worth it, I feel like they expect way to much out of the people (me) that worked really hard. I feel like I was worked way to hard at times."
good,"working for Walmart was okay they don't give there employers good hours,benefits, and pay this job is good for a student trying to get extra money but this job isn't for anyone to make this a full time job"
good,Never asked to over work myself. Always made sure I took all my breaks. Workers were independent in seeing what had to be done. Good shifts were given. Hardest part of the job was 7a.m. shifts but those are expected with any job.
good,Builds people skills.have to be very versatile for anything that may approach. Have to be a quick thinker. Very good company over all have some bad stores but have some amazing stores.they try to balance what they need and what you need daily.
good,"Its an okay job. A good place to improve your communication skills. I got a lot of customer service experience thanks to this company. Job is super easy but the customers make it hard for us. Other than that its okay. Discounts, Health benefits, raises, Bonus's. But most of all I loved the people I worked with."
good,"its usually busy on weekends and on weekdays it isn't that much busy. what I learned over there is that I didn't know that Walmart actually does food donations, helps other towns in getting jobs easily. The management was ok but some are very mean and bossy. I like the fact that there are a mixture of cultures at Walmart and they don't discriminate. the hardest part there is the most of the csms they don't really care the actions or words they use towards other staff, they get easily annoyed on a busy day. the most fun part is helping people and getting to know them from different cultures."
good,"I personally didn't like working at Wal-Mart, but i know alotta ppl  who like it more than disliking...it just wasn't the ideal job to me...but they jave the perks"
good,"It's Walmart, not entirely sure what you really expect out of working for Walmart. There is plenty of room for advancement, management can be hit or miss depending on the store."
good,"The management here is horrible. Will not treat you good. But besides that great benitits, flexible hours, good hr team, they do all kinds of things for their associates."
good,"Often crazy, especially when working during busy times of the day. Sometimes management does not listen to their workers when there is a need for help on the front end, and then complain when they realize there is a problem. Generally, it is an okay place to work and not a bad place to learn how to deal with the public."
good,Is a fun place to work at. Enjoyed doing my job and helping others. Love learning new things. Start my day busy and then after lunch gets a little slow.
good,Well it's corporate America for you there is ok advance opportunities the managers were for the most part cool if you were doing what you were supposed to
good,Well let's see working at Walmart was a good experience it was a good first job the people there are very nice  management is very nice the people I worked with were very out going
good,"When I first started the job it was fun. As time passed, I was overworking myself with less time to study. The shifts are flexible with your studies depending on your supervisor."
good,Over this job helped me save lots of money as the pay was amazing and i only had to work a couple days at a time. Shifts were bad as I had the night shift.
good,There are a vast number of positions at Wal*Mart. What I learned at Wal*Mart was how to build a team buy building the individual. You will interact with some of the best people in the world. Workplace culture is unique and encourages diversity. Many fa-sits of management leading the way to complete daily tasks. Hardest part of the job is walking leaving at the end of the day if your tasks are incomplete. The most enjoyable part of working at Wal*Mart was helping the individual associates reach their full potential and be advanced.
good,walmart is an good starting place. but do not stay there. working weekends are mandatory and customers can be difficult but the coworkers are pleasent. also they wont tell you the job benefits and such.
good,"Great opportunity and ample chances to excel and grow."
good,"Good Work Culture"
good,Fun and friendly managment.will train to be a walmart associate.other employees are always willing to lend a helping hand. They strive for great customer service!
good,Good place to get your foot in the door in terms of working and learning what that's all about. There's lots of possibilities to move up and make more money.
good,"Hours were always cut because of tax season every year."
good,I love working for my store. Everyone is always in such a good mood and it's really hard not to smile while at work someone is always there to cheer you up and bring up your spirit
good,the company is okay they work you very hard for vey little pay. they don't like to pay you over time and there are a lot of immature upper management.
good,Walmart is a good place to work but they will take advantage of you if you let them.. Overvall its a pretty good job...............................................................
good,I am currently employed and management team is not the best. Fake and lie a lot. Love the benefits and Hours. You dont always get appreciated for what you do.
good,"I enjoyed the first couple years here but as a part time associate, there isn't much room for advancement and higher up positions don't really pay that much more. There's always a problem with scheduling but the people that work there are very nice and will always try to adjust their shifts in accordance with yours. It's a fun place at first but the longer you stay there, the more you dislike it."
good,"A typical day would be working with associates for any concerns they might have.  Help associates with training.  I became familiar with health insurance, workman comp cases, unemployment cases, etc.  The majority of the management team were willing to work with the associates. A couple were not.  The most difficult part of the personnel position was getting management to work with the associates so they could get their computer training completed."
good,"Having only worked in the Deli department for over six years, I can only speak of my experience there.  I have worked in two different locations.  I would say that depending on the location and how the management treats you, your job experience will either be good or bad."
good,"I really enjoyed 14 years there ,then came the new management with no clue from one to another."
good,This is a great place of work and very educational. Not to hard to comprehend and execute assignments. One of the best jobs I have ever had and i look forward to furthering my career in this area of employment.
good,Enid Walmart Supercenter was great to me and worked with me on everything I needed. I loved the people I worked with and management was always there to help and watch.
good,Fun environment. Very busy store. Associates are willing to go above and beyond for our customers. Store manager very friendly and open to talk to associates and customers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, but I did not enjoy working at any hour of the day. The staff is friendly to work with. Everyone helps everyone you just have to be willing to work"
good,"Working as a sales associate was fine and I feel like I did my work quickly and thoroughly. Most often I was tasked with zoning one department for my (usually <6 hour) shift and could get the majority of the department and the returns finished before I clocked out."
good,Work hard and stay on time. Listen to what the customers want follow safety guidelines and just a on your task. They however are hard to please sometimes and yes the customer is always right but you're the one who gets yelled at if you follow the  protocol and the customer isn't happy you are the one who gets yelled at even though you did follow the protocol
good,"Met great people and had a good chance to learn the ways and the work ethic of Wal mart. If i am to go back to wal mart i would re-apply as a manager, or supervisor."
good,I enjoyed my time working with Walmart. They were pretty fair. Not always on the same accord or even the same page as far as processes and training however they would except accountability for most of the confusion.
good,I was saving up money to return to college. I liked working at the overnight shift because I could focus on my job and not deal with too many customers.
good,"Havent had 40hrs in 2 years. Get pulled out of normal work area, because of lack of coverage. no holidays off except Christmas and weekends are not rotated"
good,"I enjoyed working in the departments and getting more done than most people that were my colleagues. The customers were the best part. Overall, both treat you well if you treat them well in return. The breaks were the hardest thing to get at this place of employment. There were good benefits available but this workplace always had a way of making you feel like you were walking on eggshells and hoping they would not break. The managements expectations were oftentimes unrealistic."
good,"it was always busy  "
good,"working with people who didn't always get along, had customers who yelled at me for something not being on sale. made friends with some of the customers"
good,"The job overall was good, the management and work atmosphere were good. However it was really hard to fit life around such an inconsistent schedule. It would have been nice to have a set schedule."
good,I loved working at Walmart of all the things I have learned over time. The store I worked at was very family and enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was making sure I still made time for my family boyfriend and kids. The easiest part of the job was that you really got the opportunity to really learn some skills that helped you move further up in the business.
good,I worked primarily as an assembler and as a toy sales associate.  The work was part-time and the hours were not enough to provide a living for myself.  The associates I worked with were friendly and supportive.  The managers were supportive and helpful.
good,A variety of different tasks on a daily basis.  Working with different managers making the task priorities hard to identify.  Keeping track of each associate and making sure that they are productive.
good,"I would work in the trailer make a pick list of things I need for the sales floor. At the end of the day, we would pull backroom for the unload teams."
good,Nice place for students or the elderly but has no actual possibilities for progressing towards a better job. One starts to feel unappreciated when your salary only goes up 30 cents per year
good,"A day here means more work for less pay. The management team is so scared, they over react to situations. The workplace culture is great due to the other employees. The hardest part of this job is not being valued."
good,Una empresa con estabilidad laboral y hambiente de trabajo competitivo que no remonera trabajo fuera de horario establecido y con poco impulso a personas con estudios superiores
good,I loved working at Wal-Mart . although there was very little opportunity to get overtime I enjoyed meeting new people and making the time fly by. I love to talk to the customers they really make the job a breeze .
good,Very physical jobs in this warehouse but good pay. Can either work four ten hour days during the week or three twelve hour days on the weekends.  Freedom to move around to other positions that are available.
good,"the hours was fine, money wasnt as good as it could have been but i liked working there you meet alot of new people that are fun but the customers are rude"
good,Management was iffy. Constant power trips. Conflicting authority levels. Constant change of pay structure. Expensive benefit packages. Inconsistent policy enforcements.
good,"Company provides associates with options to advance. Medical benefits, retirement, and vacation pay provided. Constantly changing atmosphere.  Many areas in the store that provide a constant learning experience."
good,Alright place for a part item job. A lot of work in a very short time. very fast paced. A lot of opportunity for advancement. Again a nice multi cultural environment.
good,The store that I have work for was a family. It was nice to have people to help you. There is a lot of things that are changing so Walmart can be on the top. They have change thing to make it hard to have extra people in the store.
good,the pay was alright but i was fired because i was trying to switch my schedule and missed time due to the fact that i just had a baby . i loved my jo but management did not do their job
good,"They gave me some  good hours, the pay was fare, most of the people worked I with was cool, some days it was slow, some days it wasn't, got paid every two weeks"
good,The job is a easy but they give less than 40 hours for a full time employee. The overnight managers are nice people except for that one lady manager who was so cranky and she talks in a bossy manner.
good,I just don't like the fact that people that catches the bus and have to walk to get there still get maked late but they was on they way to work I can see if they was an hour late but like 20 mins that's not bad but other than that I liked working at Walmart.
good,"I'd come in and open the deli, begin moving products from the freezers to the sales floor. Would organize and price the products. Would move products from the delivery bay to the freezers, organize and place them in their right areas. Then I would move items from the larger freezers and stock the main floor of the deli. I would then work behind the counter, preparing and cooking the products, cutting and packaging meats and cheeses, and finally serving those products per customers requests. I would also come in from time to time to do closing shifts. I would clean and prepare the tools and workplace for the following day. I didn't see management often but the supervisors were pretty strict. Culture seems more business oriented, but seemed family friendly. The hardest part of the job was doing all these different jobs throughout the week. I did enjoy the friendly employees, and chatting with the customers."
good,Walmart was fairly good at giving requested time off and staying true to requested hours or days off. Management overall wwas very fair. There wasn't any favorites among the workers.
good,Walmart is a good place to work good benefits and 401k plan to I enjoyed working there u are always busy doing something that's what I like about walmart.
good,"Generally good culture, but the desire to move quickly and catch up with competitors is forcing a lot of change and layoffs.  No long term job security anymore."
good,I hated working here pay is horrible you have to put up with way too much bs for the little amount you get paid so not worth it. Maybe for a high school kids but that's about it
good,Clean and pleasing atmosphere to the eye employees are great and give excellent customer service.  A busy and exicitng environment where you see lot of people.
good,"they send you home when you done.hard to make production very slow days,good pay but not good hours, good managers i wish they can offer permanent hours."
good,"great environment, easy going management, being able to be flexible n every department was a great opportunity. Lerned how to receive shipment to being a cashier."
good,"Walmart has good people to work with.Cannot do overtime.The company overall has decent managers but I Have run into some that think they are above subordinates. [ I think there are people like that in every company]. The pay could be a lot better simply because of the cost of living.As I stated earlier,the people are good and that means a lot. Thank You."
good,"Working at Walmart was not all fun, It was a lot better in the beginning when I first started. My coworkers and management team were nice, it was just like I imagined working there would be. Then after being there for a while things started to change, people left or got let go for various reasons. After getting rid of certain people nothing was ever the same again, the wrong people got put into positions and it hasn't been right since. My job itself as a cashier wasn't too bad except dealing with unhappy customers, I enjoyed helping people the best way I could. And it was an even better feeling when they recognized me for doing so."
good,"I started working at Walmart when I had no other choice, met nice people while working in the air conditioning during Arizona summers. Management was OK if you were on their good side. Pay was expected coming from Walmart."
good,It was pretty easy working there  everybody got along pretty well I spent most of the time on the floor fixing displays and folding clothes not bad at all
good,"The hardest part about working the job is managing the weather conditions. Sometimes it'll be too hot, too cold, or its raining. The management is cool but sometimes it can be unorganized. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the great customers."
good,"Not such a bad place to work at. For the overnight stockers the management team does put alot on one person to get the job done. In one night an overnight stocker can become an unloader, cashier. And still have to stock merchandise to the shelves and have all merchandise and pallets off the floor by 5am.  I was an inventory associate the system would generate ""picks"" items I scanned out placed on a cart and added to the stockers work load. I usually ended up putting the same items back in the backroom.  The counts for the store were never right."
good,"Things were great then things started really going downhill, the way the management, will treat customers and vice versa I've been on both sides, alot of of other walmarts that I've been to were nicer, and they treated they're associates and customers better"
good,Working for Walmart was a self building experience. There are going to times when Management will treat you worst then the customers. I dont think Walmart is a bad company overall . I do think they need to put their management team through more training.
good,"Cria oportunidades mas se desenvolve devagar entre funcionários mau gerenciamento falta de ordem ,sem logística."
good,"Lots of interaction with customers, several complements on the donuts made. A lot of positive affirmation from customers who were friendly and made the working day better."
good,The work it self is not bad.  Definitely get the impression that lower management is only out to make themselves look good.   They constantly put the people that don't make rate in easier positions while others get worked harder.  All this does is burn out those that can do the work at the required level and they end up transferring to a different area or quitting.
good,"En este trabajo aprendí a conocer las necesidades del cliente, cada uno es diferente y hay que saber tratar a cada uno. Me disciplinó en varios aspectos de mi vida, como en ser puntual, constante, a acatar reglas y a valorar el trabajo de los demás. "
good,"Like with any job there are good people and not so good people. There isn't enough training. They tend to let you rely heavily on SOP's which you can find on the web. When I'm trying to get the job done I don't have time to go hunt for SOP'S, because they aren't easy to find. There isn't enough communication throughout the store. There are so many assistant managers, so when you communicate with one it's like you didn't communicate with anyone. But I did move up quickly and wasn't even trying to. But be aware if you take a supervisor/dept manager job, you will be expected to get everything done without proper training. If you can befriend someone that knows how to do the job completely and will share the info, you will do great."
good,"Trabalhei por quase dez anos na empresa Walmart, a minha avaliação é positiva no que desrespeita a cultura e politica que a empresa prega, cresci muito com os meus colegas, sempre tive um bom relacionamento com o meu gerente. As vezes o dia de trabalho era tão bom como toda empresa tem suas baixas, mas ao mesmo tempo agente tirava de letra por ter uma equipa muito bacana."
good,Mucho trabajo en equipo pero el sueldo es muy poco para todo lo que luego tienes que hacer.
good,"a typical day at work consist of working freight pallets that are on your aisles, until all of the work is complete. with this job i have learned so much about my people skills"
good,fast paced production based work with lots of different areas you can move to and try out lots of hard work very hot in the summers. good first job pay is good
good,"Always getting pulled to cashier but that just comes with the territory. You stock, zone, replace watch batteries and resize watch bands. You work closely with apparel associates."
good,"I really didn't like my Manager, but the upper management was good. Pay wasn't that great. Also i feel like they should of gave me a better schedule i would have to work till 11 almost every night and i didn't really like that."
good,Walmart is a decent job. Had a problem with management when I took a few days off for surgery. They tried to say they fired me when I had to quit before this.
good,Benefits are great but the people that work for the company don't appreciate the people that work for them. Long hours but no thank you at times. No family time. The people that run the business for the company don't appreciate the people that work there
good,It's a great job. Just be prepared to work every single weekend and every single holiday. There is always room for advancement if you work hard.Be a go getter if you want this job.
good,"•	Hire new employees, set up new store, problem solving, leading a team, ordering, scheduling, staff deployment, disciplinary actions, training, work close with Pharmacist, pharmacy tech, price changes and overrides, customer service, working with staff to reduce shrink, changing planograms, getting change out of the safe for pharmacy, keeping up with continuous learning modules, resets, covering wherever and whenever necessary, inventory"
good,The staff and customers are all a pleasure to work with for the most part. I learned a lot about patience and fitting the customers needs. The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time but you get use to it eventually
good,People at Walmart especially in the management were fair and decent. If you ever had a problem they would work until it got solved. The most enjoyable part of my job was spending it with the people i cared about and who had my back.
good,"Empresa com grandes possibilidades de crescimento porem varias politicas internas, nesses 5 anos de empresa obtive vários treinamentos, mas infelizmente a empresa encerrou suas atividades"
good,"Enjoyed learning the basics of cash handling and meeting all the new faces. Learned a lot of basic work related skills! Traveled for Wal-Mart and loved it, did a lot of dedicated work remodeling the Sandusky store. Disliked work hours!"
good,"i had a good experience working here, but what I loved the most were the people.  Here people always had a smile on there face always encouraging and positive."
good,I loved the photo lab but this was my second job and it was very time consuming and I had to give it up when I married and moved to a different state.
good,"Fue un empleo con capacitacion autodidacta, que dejo mucho que desear, y creo yo que no hubo formalidad y/o compromisio de empresa a empleado"
good,great people to work with at Walmart.  they were changing a lot of things when I was leaving so it probably only got better.  management was ok as long as they we ok
good,"Get to do you own thing as long as your responsibilities are taken care of. Have to go help out in the parking lot which can be a pain, but other than that just a typical maintenance job. Collect garbage from the front of the store and lot to start the day. Keep up  bathrooms. Keep the bottle machines moving and perform safety sweeps when not doing anything."
good,"Productive, fast paste, always busy which is good to keep time moving. Great policies and a strong support system but lacks strength in management. Hardest part of the job is getting help to get work done"
good,"Aveces nos hace falta tiempo para realizar tantas actividades,pero se aprende a trabajar bajo presión."
good,Hard Work but starting benefits are not all that good and can be easily fired in the first six months. Job is also not the best for a career until you advance and become a manager. Managers also work long hours pay is not as good for the hours.
good,"listen how it all work and enjoyed meeting the people and listen happen fishing and tires, batters, paint and tools, the boss were nice and help me anytime"
good,"You can grow with this company. Nice enviroment. You can do hours and good compensation. A lot to learn, good stady hours. Managers are great. Awesome team."
good,I loved everything about Wal Mart but the position I held. Sometimes I would be in the rain or snow pushing carts. The vibe of the store was like a family. We we're a team. Sometimes work conditions could be bad outside for cart attendants.
good,Co-workers were nice but the managers could care less. I had told them about possibly getting a second job and they said they were fine with moving my schedule around as much as I needed but after a month they deliberately gave me schedules I told them I could not work so I had to quit.
good,"Retail is not for everyone, but I enjoyed my jobs.  There was always a challenge whether it be with a customer or new floor set.  I enjoy challenges.  Having the ability to manage two departments and prove that I could set them up and run them swiftly was a great accomplishment.  The hardest part of the job was when it came to big holidays.  The stress of setting up and getting features ready was challenging, but after it was over, the reward was much greater than the challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.  Whenever they would get frustrated, I would take a few extra minutes to help them in whatever they needed and ensure they left with a smile on their face."
good,It wasn't bad working there. It wasn't working with children.It was a clean store with great people. It also has a great reward system for hard work.
good,Walmart is always constantly changing. From new technology to make your job easier to new techniques to make the job more efficient.
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work. It is an ok place to work for new technicians with no work experience, students and/or young adults. Good part-time job as well."
good,"I enjoyed working there for the almost 2 years I did. Management on the other hand could do a better job at realizing what their supervisors are doing to their staff.. OPEN DOOR POLICY I've used it and nothing ever got taken care of. I continued to be bullied by my supervisor about my personal life until I had enough and finally quit..."
good,As much money Wal Mart generates could pay more to the associates. The pay does not match the work but you meet good people
good,"Walmart has an inclusive and diverse workplace culture with great incentives for the employees, easy-to-talk-to management staff and special occasions for staff appreciation. Typically a day in the life of a cashier is finding out which register you are assigned to for your shift, making sure it is stocked with all the supplies you will need for your shift and spending your shift processing customer purchases. The hardest part is the standing, bending, reaching for long periods of time but mats are provided to help alleviate stress on your back, hips and legs. I injured my hand at work and learned that Walmart is very big on providing modified shifts so that you can retain a paycheck while you are healing. Loved that!!"
good,I absolutely love the people I work with! I've made amazing friends; however I don't particularly care for the management. The changing of my schedule without any notice and going against my school schedule (scheduling me during my classes) and when notified that I have class during that time I was told it would be ok to show up late and it wouldn't count against me. It ended up counting against me anyways when I told management that it had been counted against me I was told there was nothing they could do to fix it.
good,"I have only been at Wal-Mart for about 4 months now, but I really enjoy the atmosphere. All my coworkers are pleasant and easy to work with, the management team is great and the customers in Wallaceburg are pretty great for the most part too. My only complaint with this company is the lack of full time positions available."
good,"Its a fun and clean work place...you just have to open up and be outspoken when it comes to working together as a team.great benefits, great overnight managers,you also get discounts."
good,"Devido ao quadro reduzido de funcionários o ritmo de trabalho é bem exaustivo, mas não impossível de ser praticado."
good,I've worked for Walmart total of 6 years it has more cons then pros. Pros about working there some of the people you meet area amazing and become family . The negative about working there the management honestly
good,I started working in the back end and was slowly placed in the front end. I had to report to my managers almost daily and keep customer interaction at a point where I could focus and pay attention to the what the customers wanted and put in what I thought was a great work performance.
good,"its very busy from 10pm-2am then from 4am-6am its extremely busy"
good,From 2 to 11 I will be unloading the truck and stocking the shelves. I love the job but I need a lil more money to get where I need to go. So if you don't mind can you please contact me asap. I will really appreciate it thank you an have a nice day.
good,"was a fast pace working enviornment with lots of hours and project to do. the coworkers were nice and the managment was excellent, i would consider going back in the near future."
good,"I would be ready to ring customers fast and accurate, I would learn other duties in store, also helping my store associates on tasks on sales floor, when needed to talk to management there was always someone there to assist, workplace culture was diverse, the hardest part of my job was able to get off my scheduled time, the most enjoyable part of my job was the customers I helped."
good,would recommend this company to anyone who doesnt go to school looking for a job. this company has very good benefits as far as healthcare and insurance.
good,"for the most part, cap team 1 was the overall best position with all the   managers and supervisors there to help you out.I learn the importance of having a first job and the responsibilities that come with it."
good,decent work space not enough lockers people were grumpy sometimes and rude loved the costumers and work environment mostly always busy and day would go by fast they were always getting mad about the master card sales tho because no bady wanted them
good,"My time at Walmart was great. I would always try to put a smile on peoples faces. as they would pass me, i would tell them ""smile"" and it would brighten their day up."
good,"A empresa tem uma boa cultura  para um futuro promissor, Pena não fornecer oportunidade de segmento dentro da empresa para pessoas que mantém um horário regrado e sem faltas."
good,"supervision of 50 + associates, projecting, planning, staffing, trianing and monitoring area associates. I enjoyed it very much but after 18 years was ready for a change."
good,"Meu dia-a-dia era tranquilo , colegas de trabalho muio agradáveis a gerencia era muito atenciosa aos funcionários , a parte mais difícil foi quando eu precisava fazer muitas funções em setores diferentes mas eu até que gostava um pouco que aprendi muito neles e a parte agradável foi as amizades que consegui dentro do clima do trabalho"
good,Walmart was a great job. You got the chance to meet so many people. Managers were awesome. A great company. Glad to have been given the chance to work with such great people. Could of been given more hours and more pay for all the work you do but anything is better than nothing when you have a family to provide for. Atmosphere at a whole was pretty good.
good,"un dia tipico atendiendo la caja a los clientes que compraban en el supermercado."
good,Buen ambiente. Clima laboral muy bien y excelentes prestaciones
good,"Just relocated to the Burbank area of California so i am a new comer looking to grab any possible opportunity that comes across me at this time, will accept positions only over 10.00 Hr"
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is always something new. You need to work at a face pace and be able to work under pressure. I Do not like how I have to jump from department to department, because they are short handed and can not provide enough employees to cover other areas. It is hard to stay and work in the department I was hired for."
good,"This would be a really great company to work for, if management actually cared more about the job they are doing instead of just getting a paycheck..."
good,Wal-mart is a typical retail employer the job security is high and there is always work to be completed. Some stores are under staffed and employees are urged to cover more areas to ensure customer satisfaction.
good,I just went about my day doing my job for the time being. You must show up to work on time. I kept my aisle looking nice but most of the time i interacted with customers as I scanned all their items. It was a very simple job if you don't mind standing for the entire shift.
good,Everyone is really nice. They always answer what you need to know. Always wants you to have a good time at work. They give you pressure but that's how they test you if you can do it while under pressure. Teach you a lot of stuff
good,"I enjoyed working with the people but did not like working all nights and every other weekend."
good,"it was an ok job but sometimes  the boss tell you to do something that is not on your job description. so if you are lets say maintenance then they'll tell u to be cashier since you have no knowledge of how cashier is ran but yet you have to be trained then you need a code to log in, there computers are mad slow and to do pathways is a pain since the computers freezes every 5 mins"
good,Walmart was a good start for me coming from school and getting some experience in the work field.But not only getting experience I excelled working with Walmart eventually became a manager something I would have never thought would happen for me. But that was courtesy of the people around me and the belief they had in me to get the job done !
good,Worked at fast pace but stocking was slow consistent work. Worked from 2 pm to 1am on average so didn't have much time with my family but I'm up for anything.
good,"Kool job. Friendly environment. Management good, show them your willing to work and they will help you as much they can. Poway stores is more like a family then Co-workers or fellow associates"
good,"The Walmart corporation treats their associates fairly and truly strive towards building careers for their associates. At store level, this tends to fall flat. From my personal experience, management teams' concerns tend to focus only on sales and they overlook the smaller, but important details, until visitors from corporate office show concern. This causes high levels of stress within the management team which leads them to over-working associates and punishing those who fail to keep up. Associate and Supervisor concerns tend to get brushed off until deadlines come around. Management also fails to take responsibility for their actions on numerous occasions, so associates tend to be punished and/or threatened to be punished by actions outside of their doing."
good,Working at Walmart and Albertsons really helps build your focus and responsibility. It also prepare you for harder take-ons in life and it has really prepared me for a more advance job
good,"a typical day would be unloading the truck and then stocking the shelves from grocery to pets and chemicals . "
good,I feel management is never on the same page but other than that it's a nice company to work for. Dealing with the customers is okay. They do alot of activities for their workers which is good
good,"At walmart I got to learn what it was like to lift heavy objects, move pallets/work a pallet jack. Got to work with people who were able to give tips and tricks about how to do something in a timely manor."
good,Wal-Mart is a fairly easy place to work. The people there are in general are friendly and easy to work with. Teamwork is fairly normal in this area of work. I am constantly doing something and this job can be very high pace. I enjoy always having something to do at this job and being able to keep busy. The management i find can at times be impersonal and uncaring towards employees. There are zero benefits and i domt agree with how much waist there is at this business but other than that it is a good and friendly place to work.
good,"A typical day at this job is pretty laid back as long as you stay at tempo and keep and constant pace, not much hard work, the hardest thing is pull freight out, my favorite part of job was helping customers and putting a  smile on there faces."
good,Tough to work during the holidays but great to have good experience with customer services. The benefits were fair when it comes to bonuses. The minimum wage is really good to work at walmart.
good,This job was up and down but for the most part was very exciting and new adventure every day. Learning the process of inventory and inventory control help me to process and move the trucks inventory faster
good,it was just as you would expect. people arent very personal but nobody was mean or unfair. The management are serious but kind. The story isn't as busy as some other wal marts.
good,"Overall, a decent place to work. Some of the managers are a bit pushy and angry all the time, but most of them are fairly friendly and willing to help. The co-workers are very helpful and friendly, willing to do anything that you need them to do to help you in your job. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with how busy the store gets at times. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with many different people everyday, in different situations."
good,"Not a bad place to work depending on position. The pay is pretty good NOW and benefits are awesome even for part-time bonus every quarter. Always busy with customers and work but always have a limited number off staff, scheduling sucks no matter what department. Management has gotten so much better but you still have those assistants who don't lift at finger but expect you to lift the world while they watch. Overall not a bad place to work if you can deal with rude customers and upitty management."
good,"My day usually starts off slow and easy then around noon it picks up and I have multiple things to do at. I've learned how to work the cash register and watering plants. The management team does it job real, but I don't always agree with everything they say or do. The hardest part of the job is when we are short staffed and the most enjoyable part of the job is that I interact with all types of people."
good,I love this store and I loved it even more while working for them it wasn't a permanent job but I still had a chance to meet some crazy cool and loving coworkers I had a great time while working there im going to miss all of my friends I met.
good,Great experience if you are a people person. I believe they underpay employees for what they are there doing. Growing and learning experience for someone just starting to work
good,At Wal-mart there were countless chances to mingle with customers and the company offers a variety of advancement opportunites up to being a store owner given enough time with the company. The hours are consistant and although they do not offer alot of overtime they do have possible quartlery bonuses based on store performance.
good,"A typical day for me as a sales floor associate at Walmart would be first & foremost, customer service. Although there were usually 2 or 3 of us in the department, when regular customers came to my department, they always asked for me because I was the one that was able to answer their questions, or help with their problems or just simply assist them with with a smile on my face. I worked in the toy department for 3 years & worked as a truck unloader for the last 10 years of my career at Walmart. Being an unloader was a fast paced, very physical job, but I loved it. Just like I was the best in the toy department, I also became the best unloader eventually leading me to the team lead position."
good,I enjoy the feeling of helping someone from start to finish and them leave happy.  It's nice to know I helped with that feeling and in turn I feel accomplished.
good,Great company to work for. Good benefits and opportunities to advance in the company. Upper management is helpful in most cases. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.
good,if your new the older employees are not so friendly. SOme will try to help you while others tell you its your job do it on your own. overall it was a decent work experience working for walmart
good,A typical day at work is providing customer service and filling shelves. I learned more patience and how to provide the best customer service. My co-workers are very fun to work with and have a blast everyday at work.
good,Needed extra work for the holidays. What better part time place than walmart. Hours were great and they were flexible with my schedule. It was like a world inside another world.
good,"What you'd expect form Wal-Mart.  Most higher up management doesn't care about you personally.  They look at you and see a worker, not a person.  Favoritism plays a big part in management."
good,"its really nice and fun to work around the customers, will feel really happy once you see you helped someone that got really happy ."
good,I go wherever they send me. I know the registers well. The people are friendly. Co-workers are friendly. Their mats are very worn out need to be replaced. The customers are very pleasant.
good,"I have enjoyed working at this company, since they hired me in 2011. It was an experience and definitely taught me how to deal with all different types of individuals. Also Walmart is really good with helping students with their work schedule."
good,"To start a career. Many opportunities to advance, especially if you are willing to relocate across the company. Great life skills are a part of working for this company."
good,"Typical day was fast-paced. High volume sales throughout the year. I learned how to manage my time and delegate tasks to staff in my department. My co-workers were great individuals who were dedicated and genuine. The hardest part of my job was leaving and saying goodbye to my co-workers, to start college. The most enjoyable part of my job was working as a time during the busiest time of year and inventory time."
good,"I started with Wal-Mart/Sam's Club almost 10 years ago as a cashier.   They have been a great company to work for offering excellent medical benefits, 401K, and stock share even for part time employees which I was in the beginning.  They offer the ability to promote up in the company if you so chose to.   At this point I would like to get out of retail and back into office work."
good,Everyday was a busy day. There was always something to be done. A lot of the times you would have to help another department in the store. And unloading shipment was heavy. closing in the deli was a lot of work.
good,"Paid well, work hard and there are a lot of rewards. If you wish to advance in store, district and company skies the limit. Very busy and demanding on your life and work life balance."
good,Great way to gain experience while working with an amazing team of intelligent and motivated people.  Plenty of opportunity to contribute and be heard from day one.
good,Management are stuck up and treat there employees bad. Its stressful but you get a discount card 3 months after working here.
good,"Working for Wal*Mart is beneficial in that it gives you insight in many different departments, not just your specific tasks. Bei g my first job, it tought me the importance of procedures, active coverage of your task and paying attention at all times to uphold safety, cleanliness and customer service. On the offhand, hours can be fickle, especially those without completely open weeks. You have to be ready to adjust everything in your plans by constantly checking your schedule. Your benefits will not kick in until after 90 days, and be prepared to take hours out of your shift for safety and procedural tests online (Pathways). For new recruits, these tests can extend throughout 6 months, and must be balanced out with the cooperation of your managers and your daily tasks."
good,"Very busy everyday "
good,"Greeting allot of people and making them feel comfortable while they shop.I, myself pickup from my does and don't.Making  alot new friends and better the pay rate.Picking on some new recipes from the food deli market,hard parts having to have a job done by a certain time when the store is crowded. And, The most enjoyable was the thank for shopping Walmart."
good,"It was decent pay, but getting your days off that you need was tough. Definitely give you enough hours, but availability isn't always honored. Long days, but everyone had different views on things."
good,My time at Walmart was never a dull moment. It was a huge learning experience as far as learning how to with different people as well as learning how a business runs.
good,Empresa orientada a mantener metas con trabajo bajo presión
good,Many things to learn and always something to do! I had never learned how to decorate a multi-tiered cake until I worked here! I would definitely come back to work here!
good,muito boa o ruim era alguns encarregados por mais que voce faca nao prestava pra eles mais e uma empresa que da orpotunidade
good,Very busy. Always running on my feet. It's an okay job. Working there made me realize it's hard having a job like that. We were always busy so we didn't have time to really do anything. But I had great coworkers. And sweet customers who I miss so much.
good,"Consisted of filling and managing patient's prescriptions, attending phone calls, providing customer service to patients. I learned the names of each prescription as well as how to provide exceptional customer service. Management was of exceptional quality and co-workers were great and helpful. Hardest part of the job was filling many prescriptions in a time limit. Most enjoyable part of work was seeing patients smile and assisting them with their medications."
good,"Moving, arranging, lifting and loading of storage boxes, bins and totes"
good,Les journées sont rude la cause est simple ils sont en train de faire une restructuration de tous les associés(es)
good,The hardest part of the job was having to deal with people that were either impatient or not willing to work with you when you tell them that there are curtain things you cant do
good,Be nice and polite to your co-workers and especially your customers. I like to work hard and focus on my job. I like to meet and greet new people. Keep your space and cashier very neat and clean. Stand and wait for customers to come check out in your lane.
good,"Walmart Is A Nice Job. My Coworkers Were Pretty Nice And So Was Management. I Would Recommend Some Giving It Try, Especially For A First Time Job."
good,"Tinha dias que era ótimos mais nem todos."
good,Learned a lot of things working with managements. Always busy even after the season rushes. Enjoy helping customers with their needs. Needs to see a workers potential and when exceeds expectations needs to appreciate the time and effort given.
good,"A very fun job it's good to get to know new people,and learn different areas of the store and the company.Also Some of the managers are so very helpful to the employees.The store have many options available to their employees to move up in the company."
good,I grew at this job in advancement and went into management but I don't like the clicks they have and use it to their benefit. I see people getting over looked for management and others excelling due to who they know.
good,"First and second never stock so thirds is always behind making up for their lack of work. I stocked dairy, frozen, home goods, health and beauty. I loved the people the job wasn't terrible, just hated 3 shift"
good,Different stores are going to be managed differently of course. I had a great time working there trying to figure out what I wanted to do for a career.
good,The Co workers was helpful at times. Sometimes a little more than the CSM. The cons was that the CSM was no where to be found. And when you have a death in the family they don't excuse the absence.
good,"Lovely management, friendly co-workers and wonderful customers , "
good,"It was enjoyable while it lasted. I was with the company, stocking the shelves of the Bellevue store, as I lived close to it. My only harrowing thought was the night I had thoughts of being done. Normally, I would shrug it off and proceed with the next work day. But not at that time when I made mistakes on call ins and not promising to actually communicate for help on stocking a specific department."
good,"A typical day at work was always doing the basics of everyday which included pulling carts, sweeping and scrubing entire store, operating the baler, cleaning bathrooms, and taking out trash. How to operate a baler and a scrubber. The management is well structured. The co-workers vary each day but for the most part are kept to themselves. The hardest part is the carboard baler, it can take from 20 to 50 mintues to complete one and sometimes requires hard work to operate. The most enjoyable part is the fact that Maintenance doesnt stand in any one place so we get to work the whole store."
good,the management was horrible the walked around all night telling people what to do meanwhile their doing nothing at all.
good,"There is no typical day of work at walmart. I learned how to work with others, manage teams, tasks and sales. Co-workers were friendly but management was not always willing to train others. The hardest part of the job was remembering all the compliance policies. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people."
good,"Management is decent. "
good,Empressa whallmart brasil otima empressa a trabalhar exelente gerencia funcionarios otimos
good,i loved the job and the benefits but employees are rude and its not worth the money you make working there. you bearly get any breaks and you are always getting into trouble although they move you to other departments and you dont know what to do. the hardest part fo the job is trying to stay calm during the holidays and the most enjoyable part is the amount of money and the few benefits they give you for working at walmart. ive learned not every job is a happy job but walmart was my worst and its not becauwse of anything crazy. its just the employees i was working with were managers and ranked higher then me and bearly did anything at all but fussed because i wasnt working fast enough on my workl and theirs.
good,"En mi parecer fue bueno el trabajo me gustaba estar ahi hacia tareas de más por mi propia cuenta, doblaba turno sin poner peros, siempre estaba dispuesta a cambios, casi nunca llegaba tarde y cuando lo hacia era por los vigilantes que tardaban en abrir a cualquier trabajador no solo a mi, habia muchas preferencias y en parte no valoraban el apoyo que brindaba"
good,"Enjoyable company workers"
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to work for anyone looking for a quality job with quality people. Everyday consisted of me unloading the truck, storing items in the freezer, and bringing the items ready to be sold to the floor display and organize them. All in all it is a great place to start or build on your career."
good,Es un buen ambiente laboral pero lo único malo es el sueldo que persibo realmente es muy bajo a comparación de otras empresas pero de hay en fuera es un buen lugar para trabajar
good,"A typical Walmart work day included cutting fabric, doing inventory (Negative On-Hands, Current Shelf On-Hands, Shelf Availability, Price Changes, Activating Cellphones, etc...) And of course Customer Service Needs. I learned quite a bit, I feel my time was well spent. My Co-Workers were great. Upbeat and wonderful people that did their all to make a difference. The hardest part about the Job was not feeling as though the Customers came first. It was a very difficult part for me. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to help and make a difference. When a customer could see how busy I was but saw I was there to help them through the odds. Knowing they had a great shopping experience really made the day go better."
good,"I worked as a seasonal employee at Walmart for about 4 and a half months while in high school. I was a stockman, so my jobs included pushing carts, helping customers with their groceries and other miscellaneous things around the store. The pay was minimum wage which was $9.52 an hour here in Washington State. Overall, the job wasn't too bad but as you can probably imagine pushing carts all day isn't really the best job in the world. I met some rather interesting people while working at Walmart, and the managers treated me very well. They made sure I had the right clothes for when it rained or snowed, and told me I was allowed to take a break if I needed one. All in all, they treated me like a human with respect and not just an object."
good,Each day is fast paced and in an ever changing environment.  Always moving forward with technology.  Must be willing to change. Co workers can quickly become like family.
good,"always want more from you. Company is not satisfied. some management does not care of outside life. "
good,"Walmart is a good place to shop at, but other than that. I would never work for them as an store employer, until they keep their words, I am  not the only that was lie to when I got hired. I was post to work the jewelry department and they put me somewhere else. In a department that I did not even know what to do. So I got yelled at by those department supervisor."
good,People were great but the company itself did not take care of there employees. I would not recommend anyone to seek employment here. It is the largest retailer in the world and my guess is this is why they do not care how much turnover they have in there business.
good,"Walmart is a good to place to work,if you are just getting out of High school or still in college. Management can be stressful, complicated and hard  when the pressure come down. Other than that Walmart is actually great place to work"
good,"a typical work day would be very slowed paced, because the Walmart was a new store it had just opened in april. what I learned was how to always keep busy and I learned to solve problems on my own before looking from help from another associate. management there was okay they weren't the best but they were very helpful there were some people in the management team that were not very friendly there were others that were amazing to work with. as far as co-worker I love my co-worker there were great other than the fact that some of the co-worker thought that they were above everyone and were  a bit rude. the hardest part of my job was trying to please every single customer that walked into the Walmart store because some where grumpy and rude. the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and seeing everybody smile and give me great feedback on my customer service skills."
good,The only real bad thing about working for Walmart is that you are a number. You are getting paid the same as other employee's that do nothing. There is not proper management to look over each department.
good,"My day starts when I clock in for work. I go to the front and search for a supervisor to tell me where to go. They tell me to either go on a register, or a self checkout. On registers, I make sure I scan every item and bag it in an organized manner. I make the customer happy by asking how their day was or talk about something that they show interest in so they feel comfortable. I count money and give the correct change back so that the customer gets the correct amount of change back, and the company is not losing money. At the self Checkout, I make sure that the items are scanned correctly. Sometimes, items are scanned twice or not at all. It is important to pay attention, especially if I am in charge of multiple registers. I also help customers if they have a problem or if they have questions. The management is pretty good, they are nice, but they are disciplined enough to get the job done. My co-workers are amazing, we get along nicely. The hardest part of the job is making sure that everyone is happy. Sometimes customers come in with a bad mood and it is impossible to make them happy. I had one customer ask me to be quiet and just bag her items, after all I said was ""Hello, how are you?"" Sometimes people have a bad day, but I learned to be sensitive to a person's situation. The best part of my job is bagging Items. I think it's pretty fun trying to decide which item goes in what bag. It's kind of like a puzzle."
good,a typical day at work . besides the heat that was terrible. my co workers were pretty good . i learned proper lifting techniques and organization skills while there. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat. the most enjoyable part of the job was the communication me and my co workers had. i loved when we all got the job done.
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart for 21 years as the back office manager. I learned a lot and worked with many people."
good,"Walmart is a very busy place to work, but I've learned how to handle a busy work place. They jump you around to do everything without experience. But you learn a lot from being jumped around"
good,I never really knew what department I was going to be moved to on a given day. Really didn't like that. I learned a lot about how all the departments are run. I was not really happy with the overall manager at the time. I loved working with everyone and really miss a lot of them. Everyone was ready and willing to help when it was needed. I think that the hardest part of working there was the fact that I was never left in one department for long. I really enjoyed my coworkers and the customers.
good,"A typical workday consists of clocking in and working your shift. If you are working an eight hour shift, then you get two 15 minute breaks and one, one lunch break. Co-workers were great people. Management team was the reason I left the job."
good,Aprendi a lidar com o público a avaliar documentos  números  carros mercadorias e etc...
good,A job that allows you to watch soccer games and enforces the many rules to the best of your abilities. this job really helps build independent skills and being able to manage your own schedule
good,"•Very simple place to work. "
good,"I learned how to be a fast cashier, I learned customer service skills, the management was ok I got to communicate with all kinds of people."
good,"Other then the unfair hourly wage of 9.50 the workplace is okay.  It a job I get along with all my co-workers and management.  It is a good workplace,  trhey give fair breaks,  and throw a celebration party when something good is done.  To reward there workers."
good,I learned a lot of retail and merchandising from this job and how to catch the customers eye. Management was great with training and all of the coworker were really good at explaining things if you did not understand something. Hardest part of the job was working overnights. Most enjoyable part was the different departments that you got to work in so you were never board.
good,"Within my first month at Walmart I was being left alone for entire shifts in my department, I felt as though I didn't have sufficient training for the situation. "
good,"Could use better customer service management, but a stable work place. They should focus more on the customers and given them better service. It's not always about the low prices, it needs to be about going the extra mile for the customers."
good,"After a few months, every day seems to go by smooth as sailing. Between being a cashier, maintenance trained, and cart pusher, I felt well acquainted for any task given to me which is great and all till you have to deal with the corporate side of things. it is a company that you accel from within and I feel I have but there are times when despite the job security I cant make ends meet to support my family. being the only one working while my wife stays at home to raise our baby, its kind of a big deal to me. Everyone at work makes you feel wanted and needed and I would hate to leave them but there are times when i feel i can be using my time more wisely to support my family."
good,"Walmart is a good place to learn new things. I learned to work with others as a team. Its nothing hard about it, its only hard if you make it hard."
good,a pleasant place to work for.  co-workers are willing to help you in all aspects of doing your job. management some were their to help and listen. our company buffet to honor the associate.
good,"Bueno es como todo hay mucho trabajo descargar cruces y mandar la mercancía a sus áreas de trabajo, y aprendí a usar el montacargas a dar entrada a las primeras entradas y salidas de mercancía la gerencia son buenas personas en su trabajo ya que todo se lo toman muy en cerio, los colegas son algo llevados en los apodos solo hacer la cosas bien hechas, es manejar el montacargas.al bajar los cruces y hacer todo con mucha seguridad ante todo y no estar jugando cuando estas en tus labores de trabajo."
good,"I've been working at Walmart for almost 6 years, the first 5 and a half at a location that recently closed, and God I hate it closed because I can't do anything right, good enough, or anything without being questioned and interrogated by my new supervisor. It's personal and I know it is, my coworkers makes mistakes it's no big deal but when I make a mistake I'm talked to like I am NOTHING. My former supervisor wasn't perfect but this supervisor is on a whole new level I've never had to deal with."
good,"My time is done working there, it's more for the younger generation now. In my years of working for Walmart, I was a supervisor for the back room for six months, I worked as a fashion processor for a couple of years and also worked as a stocker. I know how to use a hand held computer also"
good,"Lugar de trabajo adecuado para obtener un sustento seguro, prestaciones y seguro social. El corporativo busca constantemente nuevos talentos para su crecimiento. El cual es muy atractivo para los que entregan su vida entera a la compañía sacrifican su calidad de vida."
good,"i worked in the fitting room dept. Wasnt bad, was a VERY easy job. my only down fall with the place, is when needing to request days off, you had to do it on a computer there. And later it would be reviewed and approved/denied. it would take them Weeks to look at the requests you would constantly have to tell someone to look."
good,"A typical day at Walmart will be consisting of being at the customer service desk answering calls or assisting a customer with anything that would need help with. You could learn many valuable lessons from working at Walmart. It teaches you that effort in the work place is very important. Management at Walmart is great. When ever you have an issue or a problem with something, they work with you to the best of their ability to solve the problem. The co-workers that i work with are enjoyable to work with. We all get along and if one of us has a problem with a customer or with a task, we always try our best to help one another. Working at Walmart can get difficult at some points. The reason is because you never know what kind of customer you're going to be dealing with on a daily basis. As a customer service associate you get hands on with different customers everyday and its our job to always find some sort of solution with the customers problem. The most enjoyable part about working at Walmart is the quality of people that you work with. All of them are fun to work with. Also, management is great as well which makes working there better."
good,In a typical workday we loaded & unloaded shipments. Constructed displays. Organized backroom space. Stock shelves. Moderate to hard labor lifted up to 50lbs or more
good,a day at work i clock in get on the register check out customers. take a break get back on take lunch then get back on then take another break then go home. i have learned to have more patience with my co-workers and customers. my co-workers we very friendly and i enjoyed working with them. the hardest thing about my job was watching other co-workers get away with doing nothing ans watching management let them do it. most enjoyable thing about my job was seeing the customers faces.
good,Buen trato y facilidad de horarios. Ambiente entre departamento de unión.
good,"Aprecié mucho su cultura laboral, su administración y apoyo, pero también depende mucho del Gerente y Sub-gerentes de cada unidad. El único pero es que su salario es bajo, (De Ley), pero te respetan todas tu prestaciones. Por otro lado no entendí su esquema de desarrollo laboral, yo estuve 9 meses y promovieron a gente muy trabajadora pero sin liderazgo, con pocas ideas, que a veces se volvían engreídos y no trataban bien a su personal a cargo.  Como dije antes, depende mucho de Gerencia y Sub-gerencia de cada Unidad."
good,I work hard at this job and i was doing more jobs than most people in the job i took off a lot of day because i was in a lot of pain and i could not move to go to work the next. Did what was asked of me just to be fire when they asked me go to a aisle that was not done all night. Also i was not going to the aisle because i was pulling back a pallet of water from my aisle that no one was going to pull back if i left.And The person that told me to go to the aisle was head of maintenance with no maintenance experience over people that was there for 50 or so year.
good,"Answered phones everyday.  Barely ever did emails.  The center is closing soon.  I enjoyed my coworkers.  If you do not have any patience, this job isn't for you."
good,the managment for walmart were not great at handling issues or covering all areas of work. walamrt showed alot of favortism and would keep their friends but fire or cut the hours of the employees that they were not friends outside of work with
good,"Usually working in Walmart, my day would go bye fast depending on the day and the customers. every now and then I would get a nasty customer but they would always leave with a smile. I'm forever learning in Walmart with the new technology that has taken place in stores."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to customers and the hardest part was staying gone away from my kids. i learned while i worked their is customers are always right. also have to be on your toes at all time
good,"A typical day at work would consist of greeting customers, helping them look for whatever they need, cleaning up the departments and making them look nice and clean. Most importantly handling the cash register and returns/exchanges in a fast paced environment."
good,It had good and bad thing. A nice day had two to three workers. A bad fay was u by your self with a lot of people coming in and out.
good,start by pulling all out of date produce and check every produce crate for bad product. management didn't know how to properly pick associates that could handle the work load. hardest part was when someone would quit because no body would get scheduled for an afternoon shift so when i came in the morning i would have to do double the work
good,"Good job for someone coming out of school, but not to sustain a family on. Single person job. They do need to keep up with the proper tools to do all the jobs correctly."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo. Ofrecen oportunidad de crecimiento laboral.
good,"Great work/life balance in the tax department. However, turnover is high and career advancement or mobility can be unbending."
good,my typical day at work was a headache always under staffed and a lot to. my co-workers was the best part I enjoyed they company
good,"great associate positions for college students, flexible schedules, fast pace environment. At the time working there had great benefits package including 401K that Wal Mart put in for you with out having to put anything in yourself."
good,ok I understand I work really hard and pay attention to people what they need or help. I'm I love to help other
good,"I serve customers, I have learned so much while working at walmart. Management is good. My co workers are the reason ive been there for so long. Christmas rush and unruly customers make it hard."
good,"Some customer service duties, lottery, check cashing, and returns. Also work at cash register, politely greet customers, scan all items, and take payments"
good,"This place is ok only if you are bottom level and even that is sketchy, i loved my job and liked what i did but managers treat you like trash and everyone plays favorites, and if you weren't one then you were looking at bad treatment and a bad time. It is an easy place to climb up the ladders though. The co-workers can be good, and the regulars are nice, tons of people steal from there. They WILL ask you to go above and beyond constantly."
good,My typical day at Wal-Mart to help customers and maintain a safety workplace. Multi-tasking a must. Excellent service to customers. I worked a lot by myself because of staffing issues but when I do work with somebody twice as much is done. Most enjoyable part of my day is greeting and interacting with my customers.
good,when someone puts in for unpaid time off and you approve only half of it and the employee was never taught how to check on it. I liked my typical work day and the cashiers I worked with. but my manager was not very friendly with me. I believe an employee should get to know their manager which I was never able to due to never seeing them.
good,A typical day at work is relaxing not to much to do and also not so little much to do. I loved working with my co-workers. hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable is getting a task and being left to alone to get it finished. I learned how to work with people.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was overall easy and allowed for movement in the company. I learned many different positions from cashier to customer service to sales. The management was a hit and miss. Some of the staff on management were fun and enjoyable while others seemed to hate being there so they made it miserable for the employees. Hardest part of my job was how much was expected from me all at one time. I could be in the middle of 20 different things, but if one other thing came up and I didn't stop what I was doing to do that one thing it would make the rest of the shift hard. Most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know the customers who came in on a regular basis."
good,"It can be a very difficult, and stressful place to work, as management lacks communication. Can be hard to keep a positive attitude when Management does not have one to begin with. "
good,"A typical day at work is very long 10-12 hour shift depending which shift you are hired for. 2 paid break times and an paid lunch, however the building is huge and it takes about 5-8 minutes to walk to the break room. Co-workers were very friendly and a wide majority mainly spoke spanish. The hardest part of the job was feeling like a robot unless you are in a management position there is no thought process or brain activity which makes the day drag on and on. Pay and benefits were excellent and the only two reasons it makes it difficult to leave the company."
good,I loved the customer I love to make a customers day better the managers are ok. the most enjoyable was just being able to work with custiomers
good,On any given day I would manage any where from 100 to 200 associates a day including other Assistant managers.  I would help drive sales through out the store as well as assist in effectively reducing shrink within our building.  The hardest part of working with Walmart was their work/life schedule.  I enjoyed most days due to working along side my team and teaching and training them.  I learned so much at the same time and it was a very rewarding experience.
good,"You go to work a typical day at Walmart which could consist of doing tractor or trailer pm inspections. You go out and inbound empty trailers giving a greentag for ok to use or red tag for needs pm or repair. Or you could be assigned to repairing redtag trailers. Or doing pm followup repairs on either tractor or trailers. Also learned to repair tractor apu's."
good,"The pay at Walmart was decent and had good yearly rewards. Also there were 3 breaks for a regular 8 hour shift, that helped many days."
good,The management is okay could be better. lack of communication around the store. Taking brakes and lunches way to early.
good,"I have learned to deal with many different customers, the good and the bad, and it was a valuable experience I will never forget. Training and preparation could have been better, but the stress forced me to learn as fast as possible with minimal mistakes (or else). I have gained confidence speaking with customers and dealing with new situations, and MOST coworkers were pleasant to work with. All in all, a nice place to work for beginning in retail."
good,"Nice environment in the Pharmacy, and the Pharmacists were very helpful and great to work under.I enjoyed learning more about different drugs and how they were used."
good,"The work load wasn't too bad here, and my coworkers were all pleasant people. I think the hardest part of the job would be the faulty carts you have to use to lug freight around in. Pulling those things is borderline impossible, lol. The most enjoyable part would probably be when you get to just straighten up products. It's easy and very satisfying for someone with OCD. Lol."
good,"I love working with the public and this job gave me the opportunity to do so. I enjoyed being helpful to my customers unfortunately, that training did not occur, it was something I had to learn on my own. A typical day is customer service in the best way that I know how. I learned all about the auto care center at Wal-Mart. I liked my store level management but did not like corporate management. For the most part, I got along with the majority of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was trying to sooth irate customers. Making my customers feel their visit with us was an enjoyable one."
good,"Wal-Mart itself is not a bad place to work. However, the types of people you work with can make even the easiest day stressful. The one I worked at had many lying, unethical, and irritable employees with an attitude that caused drama and didn't like to work. The upper managers, while occasionally demanding, were usually not too bad."
good,"I loved working at Walmart "
good,Everyone was in my business rather than focusing on the productivity of the food service. I had several altercations with the daytime managaer. Considered to be my first job just was not a good experience.
good,"Everyday presented new and interesting challenges and opportunities. Balance, positive attitude, professionalism, and personal responsibility were constant features in this position."
good,Walmart is an alright place to work especially if you're going to school. Schedule was always flexible when I had things for school. My manager understood the importance of college.
good,It was long hours on your feet. Most of the customers were very nice. I worked with good people. We did not get alot of support from the managers. I supported my co-workers the best that I could.
good,The hardest part of the job is being able to coexist with your co workers that never give their 100% to do their part. Which then makes a person like me work twice as hard to accomplish the goal of the day.
good,A Typical day at work would be greeting customers and making sure they find everything they may need. My co-workers are caring people and it makes the work place loving. The hardest part of the job is getting the managers to care about you. They refuse to listen to the concerns of their associates. The most important part of the job is being able to make the customers smile.
good,"I come to work early, then clock in on my scheduled work day. I learned that i have to be patient when helping customers at cash register because so customers are in-patient when waiting on line.My boss treats his workers equally by giving them respect. The hardest  part of a work day for me is dealing with nasty customers that are rude because it is hard to speak to them. The most enjoyable day at a work place for me is when i can help customers in the store have a good experience when they are here."
good,"muito corrido,trabalhar em equipe,pouco participativa,trabalhar segundo modelo da matriz .aceitava novas idéias."
good,"A typical day is usually stocking shelves ringing up customers and helping customers find what they need. I learned about inventory, security, and the specifics of many new and innovative products. Management was disorganized and often blamed employees for storewide failures. My coworkers were fun to work with and often helped me out in my times of need."
good,"Es una muy buena empresa y se puede crecer, sin embargo los sueldos son muy bajos, se tienen prestaciones de ley, sin embargo si trabajas en un Walmart, olvidate de la familia."
good,"Working at Walmart was a fresh experience since it has been my first job. Any task could be done easily, such as stocking shelves, heavy lifting or just cleaning the work space. Management is friendly and will lend a hand and ear to any associate's problem even when it's very busy. I enjoyed meeting new associates and customers and came and went. It gets really hard during the holidays when customers disregard shelf organization and leave items all over the place. Walmart was a great first experience, but in truth it put me in a lot of stress since I was put in night shift most of my hours, and I would work alone, putting a lot of pressure on me to organize and deal customers by myself. It really put off ""working as a team"" out of its place. My hours put me in weekends a lot, and also working from the afternoon to midnight, which puts me in a position where I couldn't hang out with friends anymore unless it was day off or really late at night, even if I did, I would be tired and wouldn't be having much fun. I put a lot into working at Walmart at first but it started to become demotivating, knowing I get all this pay but no one to really spend it with. Balancing a social life was hard, even more so when the college semester started."
good,Found the over all store unorganized and in need of clear leadership also while having a pleasant work experience would rather have stayed with one of my old employers
good,"Walmart is a great employer as in the company itself ie: benefits, policy, and corporate management. As for upper management (immediate supervisors) is very unorganized, unprofessional and favoritism"
good,"easy work, pay is not that great but you get 15 min breaks and an hour lunch you have to pay for health insurance. overall easy job"
good,A typical day involved working with a good team of co-workers and managers unloading and loading store trucks. The most enjoyable part of the job is also the hardest trying to help customers.
good,"Día típico de trabajo, llegar esperar a la hora de entrada para fichar en tiempo y forma.. saludar a los compañeros que se encuentren en el lugar requerido, el gerente te manda a habilitar una caja y cumplís el primer turno, salís compras y tenes tus 15 min de descanso, volver sin pasarte de los minutos y volver a cumplir tu segundo turno."
good,es muy bueno trabajar aqui por todo lo que te ofrece esta gran empresa y tambien el trato que dan es bueno
good,Wal-Mart DC is an excellent place to work overall. There is much that could be done to improve on the upper management team.
good,I learned how to deal with customers even when they having bad day. I use to enjoy having conversations with the customers while i am helping them. I use to have amazing co-workers who helped me when I was new at the work.
good,"Well managed work place. "
good,In the pharmacy they tend to under employ and start techs at low pay for a job that requires licensing yearly. If they start techs with experience at a higher pay they just may get some good employees with knowledge of the job.
good,"Overall it was a learning experience that helped advance my portfolio but in the time that I was there, I was unable to excel to a higher level . I was often held back to the point that I often saw myself as a failure. It seemed that the harder I was worked as a person, the more that I was often taken advantage and not paid for my effort or time in that place."
good,A challenging job with kind coworkers to work with. is a good starter job for individuals who just graduated high school or are in college.
good,"Work Place, was good. Security, wasn't great, customer service was decent. Management was poorly managed, certain employers at Wal-Mart, was really rude and not responsible"
good,I unloaded truck.  I stocked shelves and worked in many departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great employees. also walmart food was great.
good,"It was hard working here, many times they would push me to do many things at once or have a certain time for everything to be done, I have to push carts but also be a cashier at same time it was super hard but worth it. Taught me how to be on time how job are not just easy but hard. Co workers were lovely they would help out if I was outside cart pushing they would try and calm down the lines so when I came in it wasn't to busy. Cart pushing isn't as easy as it seems its a workout!"
good,"Muy buena experiencia el haber laborado ahí, buena comunicación y aprendí a desenvolverme."
good,"Decent place to work, needed more staff, but wouldn't hire anyone. I loved to work because it passed by time but doing 7 different jobs was not too fun when you're ready for a break or for your shift to be over and you have to complete all of those tasks before leaving."
good,Empresa com cultura predominante clareza em seus objetivos. Dá treinamento adequado para seus colaboradores e busca sempre o melhor para seus clientes.
good,"day to day work was the same, I unloaded trucks then stocked the stuff that came off the truck. Management wanted the impossible even though they knew the team couldn't get it done, also didn't have the right amount of employees to get the job done efficiently"
good,"Muy buen lugar para laborar sobre todo en temporadas navideñas, aprendí mucho allí, la relación con los compañeros es buena, mucho trabajo en equipo, el jefe de departamento con quien me toco laborar fue una persona exigente en el trabajo pero amable y sobretodo apoyaba al empleado si se necesitaba ayuda"
good,i got the job word of mouth from family friend they treated me well and was very understanding people i felt part of a family
good,"Open varies store in different location thru out the state, learn lots and work was very fun, Coach and hire also fired.  Their site is awesome everyone interested learns everyday with the CBL's.  I loved working there."
good,Walmart is a wonderful company in regards to available resources to be productive and successful manager. Work/life balance is the biggest drawback.
good,Physically demanding job. Typical day at work consists of unloading a truck full of general merchandise and grocery freight. Trucks are usually loaded with over 2500 pieces of merchandise. After all the freight is unloaded it is then worked and stocked to its home postion in the store.
good,"The Walmart I work at great clean, helpful and management was nice and helpful. Except for a few employees they were great co-works I enjoyed working with and would love working with again if giving the chance."
good,"assistant managers are ok, store manager needs to act more human. job is fun keeps you on your toes. I enjoy working with the employees and customers are usually nice"
good,I feel that it is ok so far.  I have worked there a year and half by the time I have written this.  The opportunity to advance is really hard depending on what kind of person you are and the pace that you work at.
good,It was very repetitive and i have learned a lot about different types of fruits and vegetables. But wasn't my cup of tea the environment. co workers were good and the customers weren't too bad but not my line of work.
good,Walmart gave me first job.i always enjoy being a part of Walmart. Working in retail we have to ready to work with different shift and holidays.
good,"Great place to work at but horrible management team. No team work or communication. The Walmart located in Quincy, Fl is always low staffed and the managers show favoritism. I did however love my job because of the nice and generous customers."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with I enjoyed the work it was fast paced and easy schedule. The pay was something to be desired for, for all the work you did. The co-workers were some of the best people and became family. The managers well something to get used to maybe a change of attitude is more like it."
good,"The company works around your life schedule.  Advancement opportunities are available.  Pay is not the greatest, but it's better than minimum wage.  Managers are OK, could be better."
good,"A typical day at Walmart isn't something I could type a summary for. It's great because that means that no two days here are alike. Walmart is a wonderful place for those of us who enjoy serving the customers with a bright smile. I've learned so many things in my time here. I've learned patience and integrity and how to be an inspiring leader. My co-workers are my family. I have adopted so many of them because lets face it, sometimes we see them more than our real family. I have a brother and a sister here, many cousins, and even an uncle or two. The most difficult part of the job seems to be communication. The only problem I've ever had is there is just a general problem getting the same information from any two members of management."
good,"Wal-Mart has a management team that is dedicated to the well-being of the customers and helping shoppers better their lives by making everyday necessity available and at low prices. "
good,"I personally enjoyed working at Walmart. There is always some type of excitement; I rarely ever got bored. I loved my managers and my coworkers. I must say that if you are not a people's person, you may not enjoy it as well as I did."
good,"What you will learn at Wal-Mart can take you far within or away from the company. They are a very demanding and have high expectations from it's employees. However, there is plenty of growth and the opportunity to move up the corporate ladder. As a manager you will compromise your work life balance by working long, odd hours  but you will be compensated fairly well for it and not have to worry about benefits."
good,management was pretty straight forward about things . if you did something good they praised you if you did something wrong they gave you a warning and if it happened again they would take the proper actions. very fair work environment.
good,"I've had three different positions at Walmart. I really liked the first two. I had control over my work and workflow. I got to learn about new computer systems. However the computer programs are all really old, like Microsoft Office 2007 old. At times, it can be really confusing. The rules and policies seem to change depending on the vendor.  For example, we will do X for this company, but not another company. There is a huge difference in how hourly and salary people are treated. The benefits are not the same. There is less opportunity as an hourly worker. This creates resentment in the workforce. So the thing I really liked about Walmart is how co-workers and other associates are willing to help you. I loved that. They do not want to see you fail. They are willing to work with you to get the job done."
good,"I would recommend Lufkin Walmart to college students looking for a job while attending school. They work with your schedule very well and are more than willing to help. I was able to work evenings Friday through Sunday while going to nursing school and it really helped. My department manager was very supportive of my schooling and offered to help out with my schedule in any way he could. If I needed a day off for studying, all I had to do was ask and he would take me off the schedule. The management team is very friendly but can be firm when the time calls for it. It teaches you the value of teamwork and how important your input and initiative is toward the store. My coworkers were very hardworking and determined."
good,"Changes all the time, getting to work with associates and teaching and training. Everyday is something new. Getting the team to by in on changes that are better."
good,Wal-mart is just temporary job for me until I find something in the field I went to school for. Wal-mart is not a place regular associates would want to work at. But the my co-workers are nice people couldn't ask for better people to work with. Hardest part of the job is having to deal with the customers and their attitudes sometimes but besides that its not a hard place to work.
good,i enjoyed working there and meeting new people every day and a few loyal customers that came in on a daily. I stayed busy there was always something for me to do.
good,Osbourne int. was a new company to the area. Was excited to be a part of a new company in the area. Liked the fact that there was room to move up with the company.
good,Wal-Mart was a very good place to work.  I started out as a part time associate and within 2 months I was  a department manager.  I worked merchandise to the floor and helped other department managers complete their tasks.  I also supervised 7 individuals in my department and planned tasks for making changes within the department.  I planned when and how to implement merchandise displays for the department while continuing to get good sales growth. I helped with inventory management.
good,"Sometimes, working for a giant evil corporation is good. There's tons of room to move up and life gets really easy once you get up there. Moving up can be difficult though, depending on how the specific store is run. Sometimes they'll hire managers from other companies or straight out of college. There's lots of favoritism and corporate politics. They don't care if you're the best person in the world for a certain position you want, if someone they like more wants it then you're SOL. "
good,"i've worked at Wal-mart for almost 5 years and while at times its stressful, what job isn't? i have learned that if you have the right people around you any job can be worthwhile."
good,A day at walmart dc starts at 4:30 am Tuesday. Log into a headset with a little talkman attached to it. The talkman is linked up to walmart system. This is where you get your orders from. Once you log in and get your labels you get onto a power equipment which is like a electric pallet jack. Job is pretty easy but physically demanding. Talkman tells you what aisle to go to and what slot to go to. You call off 3 of the 5 digits at the slot and it will tell you how many to pick. You have to tell it how many you picked before moving to next slot.
good,This is a fantastic place to work! The people around you always seem to make you smile and keep a positive work environment. The customers seem to always keep up the positive energy and it always seems that everyone wants to be there and actually care.
good,"Very demanding job, but with decent pay. Walmart is a good source of income, but Human Resources is my passion. I have the dedication and drive to make any HR firm or company better and successful"
good,It was a good place to work and they had great benefits but it takes too long to move up the ladder. Management changed too much so day to day tasks were changed all the time.
good,"My time at Walmart has taught me many great skills that I will keep with me for the rest of my life. The people I work with has probably been the best thing about this job. The only downfall about this job is that upper management has little to no clue what is going on in the store and even when told directly about it, take no action."
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was assisting the customers."
good,"Pay raise once a year on your hire date anniversary. "
good,"preguntas de los clientes,administrar la mercancía, muy poca firmeza en sus opiniones, buen desempeño, la mercancía pesada y que no se encuentra, conocer personas."
good,"Fast-paced environment, no room for errors. The day typically flies by when you're keeping busy which is not all that hard to do."
good,Buena empresa para trabajar lo horarios son muy buenos y agradables
good,Wal-mart had a very fast pace and that I loved. Wal-Mart also had a rep of beig not so friendly and having so of the worst costomer service around. But on my shift I was going for the unbeatable experience. Im longer with this compny but when I go back and see the people I worked its always a great time.
good,Found that I have little time for my wife and family as I am doing shift work an it is completely random.  I found that my personal life really suffered as a result especially because my wife and I are trying to start a family.
good,"I learned a lot about customer service while working here, talking to customers and creating a relationship was by far my favorite aspect of the job."
good,I worked overnight at walwart with a couple of my friends and it was one of the best jobs i had. The managers were cool and so were the customers
good,Wal Mart offers opportunities for promotions however it is difficult to get full time hours. I was able to try many different positions at Wal Mart which help me to identify what my strengths are.
good,"Era un muy buen empleo, tenia companeros muy talentosos, aprendi muchas cosas en el trasncurso del tiempo que labore."
good,Slow Past Job. Depending on which department your scheduled it can a heavier task. Stock your product for the ale your on. Upon finishing your product you Zone your area then help others around you until end of shift.
good,"The Courtesy Associate position, which could also be called a ""cart pusher,"" isn't a bad job at all. It's likely easier than what you imagine. I am not a particularly fit person, and can handle the work day without being tired or sore at the end of the shift. The managers tend to leave you alone if the job is being done fairly well, so you're left on your own with your fellow cart pushers. Most of the time, you are ignored by customers too, which is definitely a plus. Despite this, they do not allow you to listen to music (which they allowed us at one point, which was nice). "
good,A typical day at walmart usually was always busy. I worked during the holiday season. I enjoyed gaining the retail experience.
good,"I worked here before they started paying a little better. The work load due to the short staff, and the overnight ordeal was nerve wrecking, but there were some bright spots working here."
good,If you have nothing else to do working here is okay. There is always room for improvement. Occasional fun environment. Great people. Different cultures of people.
good,es una gran oportunidad para estudiantes y adquirir experiencia laboral.
good,"My typical day at work is extremely busy, i have learned to have a whole lot more patience and the best part of working here is the fact that you meet new people. the management can be a lot more considerate and organized. i think the hardest part of the job is to stop being so busy, but than that is why i liked working at Walmart being busy was the most enjoyable part of my day."
good,"when i'm cooking and customers are watching me or when im in the front i love talking to the customers, and answering their questions."
good,The employees were constantly trained in all aspect of the job requirements. Although management was firm and intensive at times there were many opportunities to express ones view point. The hours fluctuated widely. I enjoy the part of the job of working with an international community of people and learning not only job skills but different cultural sensitivities. The working atmosphere in many department was cooperative but the management styles were not consistent. The lack of irresponsible workers was a constant determent to others. They offered weekly and holiday incentives. We also participated in many charitable work and contest that made it fun to be a part of. Yearly inventories were not well organized and double the work of many associates. They encourage inside growth and made it possible for anybody to train and become successful in their advancement. Management worked long hours and wore many hats.
good,I like working for Walmart because of the people.  The reason I do not like working for the company is because of the lack of respect by some of the customers and management.
good,It is the kind of workplace that if you work the will work you but if you just stand around the will let you. They will not give you the days off if you go into the computer and put in you want a days off. You will have to find a manager to change it.
good,"i worked there for 8 years, i was unloader for 6 years  in one year between i did loader for a year. i learned to do forklift and power jack. i unload box out of truck and pull out depterment pallet to the floor. i also do inventory when i get my job done. i moved to produce due to able work better enivorament and hours.  i work in produce for two years, enjoying stock the food out on floor to see customer be happy. hard part is keep management happy everyday, i had to keep up with food being clean. and throw out mold food,"
good,Walmart is a god company for beginners. Those who are not experienced and/ or would like to make a career out of their job in the company. It is a tough job and requires long hours and heavy lifting. Patience is required. There are the average rewards for employees.
good,"a typical day at work when a customer is not in the mood for nothing but dont matter what mood they are in i always made them smile,"
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. However, you must make sure you continue to check your scheduke, as managers change them without telling you causing you to be late/ miss certain days. Very busy and fast paced work enviroment and many different kinds of customers. Must be able to tolerate rude customers and stay calm as well as try your best to understand different languages, including sign language."
good,"Go to work and receive task for the day, Find out information to prevent shrink and complete the task during the day, The new programs coming out are very frustrating  and confusing to get done along with task. Great associates and good management team helps relieve the stress and pressure of being overwhelmed."
good,"gostei muito de ter feito parte dessa empresa,agradavel.tinha meta a cumprir,e ganhavamos por isso,colegas de bom animo"
good,I would deal with the customers and unload trucks at night. I also helped with the CSM duties. I liked working over nights. It was more productive. The management was fair. I had some really nice bosses.
good,the mason wal-mart has some management problems for accountability issues but overall i enjoyed the people i worked with
good,"I worked 3rd shift so I got to work at 10am and it is a busy walmart so there was a lot of work about 4 days a week you are expected to do a lot but not more than you can handle."
good,Pretty good environment and lots of fun people. I think its fun and a good job experience. You deal with a lot of new people as a costumer service worker.
good,I Had a great time working at Walmart as an Intern. They thought me the role of management as i shadowed the managers throughout the summer.
good,My time at Walmart was amazing. I sent a good 8 years. The management was awesome. I got along with all the managers. I also got along great with my co-workers. The pay at Walmart was enough to feed my kids and pay my bills. All in all my experience was great.
good,"Worked at the south Walmart for over a year as a cashier, and it is a great place to get experience. I enjoyed most of my coworkers and managers, and I do miss working there, but honestly, there is a bit of BS that goes on. But, if you're able to get on Full Time, the benefits are good, and you get a % of the shares from the stores profit every February, so it's like a late Christmas bonus."
good,"Working daily schedules becomes a force of will when your team needs you. Having strong team dynamics, a missing team member means everyone else steps up to the day to day challenges and goals of the pharmacy, making it hard to judge when you'll be free from working to live. For a sttrictly retail pharmacy the return customer base is excellent, I think it is because the team works like a family, and also because prices offered are decent."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know and grow my experience and training at Walmart. I learned a lot of new things from the company and my co-workers.
good,Not all the managers really cared about the employees. The managers that did care were great. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. They made it a lot easier to come to work.
good,Working here is good and fast paced just the way I like it. I've learned to do so many different things and have met great people along the way! At times there can be very poor communication within the store.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart goes as follows: I would clock-in and gather the necessary paper work and begin to work on the previous day's transactions. Being in the accounting office, I have learned to manage accounts and to become very detailed my work. Along with my co-workers, we were able to access shortages in the company. We work with Loss and Prevention to help manage the loss our store was having. We learned how to adapt to changes. Our management team can be approachable, but it depends on the manager and the day. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to locate loss and work closely with our Asset Protection Manager to appropriately assess the problems. What I like less is the inconsistency of management practices and behaviors."
good,"Direct management was great, and would always be there to help if necessary.  Best part was the people you worked with, worked more as a family than as individual people.  I was a Loader as title, but would never know what role I would be preforming when I came in each morning.  I could fill multiple roles as needed depending on who was out for that day."
good,"Waiting on customers and handle transactions as a cashier.  Learned something new everyday, new type of transactions all the time to be down on registers. Management was helpful most of the time as well as the co-workers.   Enjoyed waiting on and helping most customers."
good,"Minimal work life balance.  Possibility for advancement is great."
good,"My first store ever, I have never worked for any store working with Wal- Mart,is teaching  a different side of customer service"
good,A typical day at work would be long lines and different ethnicity and cultural background employees as well as customers. I learned how to deal with diverse population of people. The type of managers you work under determines how management will be to you. I had good managers to work under so my job was fairly easy.
good,its fun there. theres free lunch sometimes easy to move up in the company. my time there was awesome until my hrs got cut. I felt as if they were trying to push me out rather than fire me . they seem to find every loop hole possible if theres no cause to fire you .
good,"I assisted customers in choosing items of produce and goods to best fit their specific style and needs. Then, I organized racks, shelves and tables of merchandise according to specific floor plans. I handled customer purchase, as well as opened and closed cash register."
good,"Working in Walmart retail you must be able to keep up with the fast pace of every day freight, and service. Working in a fast, friendly, and clean environment we must all do our part to keep up, and maintain our facility. You get to work with great management, Great benefits. Work hard, be reliable, and you will always have a stable job. You get to work with great people from all parts of life. Work with your school schedules, and with anything personal that comes up. All, in, all a great company to be apart of."
good,Se realizan consultas diarias a personal y clientes de walmart. Atención de accidentes laborales y capacitación continua atreves de capacitación en linea y examenes periodicos. Al final de jornada laboral se realiza un SUIVE y gradilla
good,"You will work hard in a distribution center so it's not a job for couch potatoes. The pay is decent, but the benefits leave something to be desired. The worst part was that anything you do that a manager doesn't like they can issued a ""procedural"" violation. Managers are encouraged to give out ""procedural"" violations as often as possible. This leaves a lot of people either out of a job, or unable to move out of entry-level positions because of their ""record"""
good,"I worked for this company over 14 years and truly enjoyed the challenge, payroll was the biggest opportunity and damaged customer confidence."
good,"A typical day at walmart depends on your shift. 1st shift is by far the easiest. 2nd shift is busy and lines can be long. But it's easy work. Most people aren't inclined to have a conversation, but you get a couple regulars and they will look for you. Those days are much better."
good,I was cut from walmart after working there 10 months not because of my performance but because I ended up in the hospital .  My apendix ruptured and so I was hospitalized for 3 weeks and upon returning I was told I had less than 1 yr service so I was released
good,"Upper level management sets unrealistic goals, and will ride you if you cannot accomplish those goals. They are never around when you need them. They do not do their job. I have been the Department Manager for 6 weeks and still have not gotten my raise, because they avoid me at all costs, and send assistant managers to do their dirty work. Overall, the work itself is not so bad, but the management is horrible."
good,"work hard/customers"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers and direct management. A typical night would consist of stocking the shelves, answering customer questions, making sure the working area was clean and free of debree that could cause potentially hazardous incidents. Hardest part of the job was the overnight hours."
good,"I am a cashier for overnight, But I stock a lot and put up returns. The management is good and my co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is the lifting of the boxes. The most enjoyable is the company of my fellow workers"
good,"Learned that you have to have the Truck done at a timely manner, And to have everything separated by departments. When done completing those task you then have to take them to the sales floor."
good,"All around, it was a pretty good place to work. There was a lot of room for advancement which is very nice to see at a place of work."
good,Walmart has alot of potential career opportunities. As an hourly associate the job is more promising as you get paid for what you work. Once becoming salaried you tend to work to many hours due to the pressure from your superiors. You feel as if you would be jobless if you left the time you are suppose to leave.
good,bom local de trabalho e otimo de conhecimentos amizade maravilhosa que tiver la dentro.
good,An Average day there would involve me stocking up shelves with the merchandise that was dropped off at the end of the last shift. And when that was done I would cover for people on the registers when they went on breaks and I would assist customers getting things to their car when ever they asked for it.
good,"The job itself was really nice, it payed pretty well to be honest. I just stressed myself out because Walmart was my first job ever, and it may me feel overwhelmed."
good,"Hard place to work, very very busy, if you thrive under pressure this would be a great work environment."
good,"a lot of paper work. taking pictures of damages, filing claims, calling carriers, answering phone, etc. I had a lot of paper work, claims to file, coding purchase orders with no help. The other distribution center had at least one other person helping."
good,"•	Greet customers and determined their needs and wants."
good,"Operadora de caixa, atendimento ao cliente, organização de estoque, fechamento de caixas."
good,You just work and hope your doing it correctly. To many bosses no one new what was going on. kind of had to ask around if you wanted information. Managers were hard to find when help was needed in  the office. I.E. employee needed assistance with keys or letters of proof of employment.
good,"productive"
good,"Have learned a lot from the first day i started, have gone thru many management teams but all have been good people to work with. Moving up is hard unless your well liked by a manager."
good,lo que mas me gusto de mi trabajo fue que ascendí demostrando mis habilidades para otro puesto y mejora de la empresa.
good,Currently Wal-Mart is going through a lot of change.  It is currently difficult to give an opinion of how things will be.  The only certainly is that it will not be what is was.
good,"Assisting customers with electronics, stocking new items and upselling new items. Giving great customer service to everyone throughout the whole day."
good,"I changed price tags, and shelves with new ones. I restocked items, and moved them to a new location. I learned how to use a texlon (price gun that printed out new labels, to replace the old ones). The management was always good, and on top of things. The co-workers were dependable, and always doing what they were told to do. The hardest part of the job, no per diem pay. The most enjoyable part of the job, weekends were off, and close to my hotel. The breaks were also great, and lunch."
good,stated as a cashier. Became a cashier manger. Take care of cashiers and customers. Work behind service  desk.Wages don't fit the job.
good,"I was a cashier at Walmart and it was very standard. Clock in, ring people up, clock out and head home. Some of the people there were very negative and act like the customers are the bad people. Very few were happy and positive, and I stuck around them. It was very average, that's about all I can say."
good,"i get there at 7 am and go out into the store and find items for people that shop online. At about 11 I go to lunch, and when i come back i usually pack and ship items, or i tape up and bag the liquids. The other employees are pretty decent. customers can get a bit rude but you just gotta smile and take it. Working here has taught me patience and how to be more friendly and polite."
good,"Everyone complains about Walmart and them not having enough registers open, but its not only hard for the customer its hard for the cashier also. Having to deal with almost every customer complain knowing there's nothing you can do about it."
good,Fast pace work environment.  Most of the time we are under staffed.  Customers are always right.  Try to handle customer complaints ourselves.
good,"Overall, I found my time working at Walmart a pleasant experience. The largest contributor to this would have to be the positive attitudes of the management and my co-workers. This made for a very healthy Job Culture within the Neighborhood Market at which I was employed. The management at this facility were some of the best I have ever encountered and knew how to strike a great balance between work efficiency, professionalism, flexibility, and understanding."
good,Not a bad company to work for. Not enough friendly employees. Managements is all over the place which is understandable.
good,"The job of orderfiller becomes dull and mundane quickly and takes a toll on your body (lots of heavy lifting).  That being said, the pay is pretty good compared to similar positions, it offers health and other insurances, retirement savings, vacation time (starting after a year of employment), and a deferred holiday pay program.  Also, if you get burnt out from orderfilling (most do after a few years), it is fairly easy to switch positions within the warehouse or find a job elsewhere in the company if you want a change of locale."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is fast driven and busy, we have to help over 100 customers on a daily basis with many things. We answer questions on where the products in the store are and about what the product is. My management helps out where they can in any given situation, and my co-workers help each other out if the supervisor's can not get to them. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with difficult customers while the most enjoyable part is hanging out with friend's and meeting new people."
good,"At Walmart they are all about teaching you management skills and advancement is available in certain levels.  But as all large companies there are politics that are instilled, you either work your way around it, or decide if Walmart is the place for you.  The culture there is better than some places I have to admit.  I also learned that if you're more into Buying and Merchandising this is the company for you.  But if you looking to be creative, or designing, then this is not the company for you."
good,Make the day easier by helping each other out with our assignments.  Co-workers made it enjoyable to be at work and made it to where I never dreaded to go to work.
good,"Morning meeting and the job for that day and have a team member witrh you. In also Iearned how to handle to  people more and counts and stock,and using a telezone and management less communication on there part and co-workers was friendly and also just to much gossip and not understanding."
good,"el trabajo era bueno tranquilo aprendí a hacer cosas nuevas que no sabia dentro del locas , grato ambiente laboral compañerismo y"
good,"las actividades se realizan tres días por semana."
good,"Buena, es una empresa muy grande con muchos puestos a desarrollar, obtienes conocimientos en como administrar un departamento para este giro, por lo tanto las promociones eran constantes."
good,Working at walmart is a great job but can be tough at times you learn something new almost everyday if not from managment or from others who are their to help you
good,"With Wal-Mart  being about the busiest place in the town of Dickinson, that means there is many tasks to stay on top of to ensure that customers get the best shopping experience possible."
good,"Got to work with money, get to interact with others. Everyone works as a team and everyone learns a little bit of everything since its a small store."
good,I enjoy working at Walmart mostly because I like the people that I work with.  I have worked on cars for the past 2 1/2 years and it just isn't what I want to do.
good,I come into work around 3:30. I go to the back put out pallets. Start unloading the truck. Go on break when the tuck is done. I pull pallets out to the floor. Stock. That's it.
good,"Friendly co-workers and management. No set schedule and schedule made 3 weeks in advance, so working around life outside of work was hard if anything serious came up. Overall a good experience and enjoyable place to work."
good,"A typical day at work included processing refunds and exchanges for customers, cashing checks, money orders, wire transfers, bill payment, and solving customer complaints. I learned new cash handling procedures to add to my current knowledge of retail, customer service and cash handling experience. Some management was okay and some wasn't. My co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job is to remember that the customer is not mad at you, just mad at the situation. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to help people!!"
good,"can be stressful, fasted pace, great learning experience, always room to advance, team work, communication and delegation skills a must"
good,"Walmart is a great company. I would recommend a friend to work for this company."
good,Overall the work experience is not bad and I think it depends on which store you work at but sometimes the management can tend to ask for things that they don't have enough manpower for and not explain things very well. But they give you plenty hours and it is stable work.
good,I worked in the electronics department and learned a lot of useful things for my. I had fun helping people with their shopping needs. I later became a department manager but stepped back down due to no management support.
good,"Every day I either fill prescriptions, help customers, call on problems to doctor's offices or insurance, and input new prescriptions. I enjoy helping customers/patients."
good,"Each summer they hire me on as a cashier."
good,"Working for Walmart can be a great opportunity if it is a part-time job you are looking for, management can  be a trial.although they will work around your schedule."
good,A typical day would be me going to the back loading a cart and taking it to the main floor and unstocking. and helping customers with problems. I learned its all about the customer. My co-workers wasvery helpful. the hardest part of the job was being pregnant. the most enjoyable was helping the customers
good,A typical day at Wal-mart depending on the department can go very smooth. As long as your on time and follow the instruction of the manager for your shift everything goes well. What I learned working with Wal-mart as a cashier/produce associate was valuable customer service skills along with working in a fast paced environment. The hardest part of my job was completing all the tasks at hand in the short amount of time that was given. the most enjoyable part working with Wal-mart would be meeting new people friends and co-workers.
good,"Help all customers who needed it and handle money, bills, faxes, copies, and phone calls. My co-workers where great and very kind. I found the job was not hard and loved working their"
good,A typical day at Walmart is always busy  and our main focus s keeping customers satisfied..I basically learned that management is not for everybody my idea of management is team work and not just depending on employees. Co workers wasn't to bad  I can work with people. The hardest part was doing 13 palets and binding before you leave. I enjoyed everything.
good,"Typical day is correcting inventory issues, solving problems, correcting freight flow to maintain efficiency, and communicating improvements to all areas."
good,"this job requires you to dedicate a lot of time to the workplace. i learned that you to balance your work schedule, but it is hard to do other activities outside of this job."
good,"A typical day the mornings start out slow but it picks up throughout the day, management can be better with the sense of urgency to assist when help is needed. Coworkers are a pretty good at what we do as a team. The hardest part of the job well all jobs have protocol to follow, the enjoyable thing is getting to talk to different customers."
good,My most enjoyable part of my job was getting to socialize and help my customers. The worst part of my day was management was poor. My co-workers were awesome I enjoyed working with them.
good,Being in management for two years has been a little up and down. Some struggles you may encounter is staffing issues in which you yourself will have to take up the slack as long as do your own job. The compensation and 401k plans are great. Management works more than what they are paid but it is fairly easy to move up in the company.
good,"Very busy work environment."
good,"Empresa que além de dar oportunidades, é agradável de trabalhar."
good,"tipcal shift 7am-5pm "
good,IF you work hard they will notice also you can move up pretty fast but the pay is not worth the headache. Its a good company you just have to put your time in to make good money for doing nothing
good,"It's stressful and I work very long hours. Some Management is supportive, but others aren't. My Co-Workers are great. Nothing is really hard about working at Wal-Mart, but I hate my job. I've learned how retail actually works and the time that you have to put into it.  Prioritizing task and getting things done is a MUST! Time management is key to make it at Wal-Mart. I do schedules, delegate task, do task, work as an associates sometimes, ensure the store is being zoned, making sure I have enough staffing on a daily basis."
good,"Very fast paced and enjoyable. There was always something to do. There was never a boring moment, I was always doing something. I learned a lot about how to run the technology from working in that department. Also how to do mods and how different technology is operated. My co-workers were very kind and friendly towards me. Nothing was really hard, I love to work. I don't consider anything to be hard in the work place. Going to work and working was very enjoyable. I love to work."
good,"I start my day by going to my assigned register signing on counting the cash in the drawer in a timely manner .  Proceed to turn the light on go to the register close to me and bring customers to my line. Greet the customer scan and bag  there merchandise cash them out using cash, check, credit card or debt.  Assist customer with reloading pre payed credit cards and gift cards. Help customer load there bags to there carts. Keep all paper work and coupons togather. Keep area around register clean through out the day."
good,Crazy days with a lot to do. Learned how to handle stressful and high volume of problems all at once. management was okay didn't really rush to help customers when needed to. Nothing about this job was hard because I was promoted twice so I learned everything I needed to know. The most enjoyable was when customers recognized your hard work and appreciated the little things you did in order to make their experience exactly what they thought it would be.
good,I believe Walmart has its up-sides and also its down-sides to the company as a whole. There is room to grow within the company. There is room for improvement with the company.
good,A typical day at work would include standing at a register for about 8-9 hours a day up to at least 40 hours which was excellent. Managers were great. Co-workers were even better. The hardest part about working with walmart would probably be the variating shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and the people.
good,I loved working here I love been around people and talking giving advice it was cool to see different people and see thinking they do and eat in their culture.
good,"Working there helped me to refine customer service skills and working with a large company again. The job was just for the holiday period, and there was no indication of a permanent position."
good,"My job consists of handling and properly filing and inputting patient data. Pretesting each patient for the Doctor's, filling out chart work. Glasses sales based upon each patients specific needs Rx wise and style. each patient represent me when they walk out the door, trust and word of mouth is very important to me and all of my patients, I want them to come back to me and send friends and family as well.Organization with each order, probing each patient for personal details so that I can personalize with each individual! Insurance submission and HICFA's are all properly submitted. Follow up's and fittings are also and important to follow through with . Making sure we all work as a team and each one of us doing our part makes the day run smoothly. Communication is a huge key in Dr. ,patient, Optician relationship as well as other co-workers. Attention to detail as far as Rx and specific patient needs are a key factor. The hardest part of my job is all that is necessary to be learned, and I am always learning new things about my job every day. I love my job for what I do I love the patients and customers even in difficult time I take it as a personal challenge. Every day is a new day !"
good,"empresa ala cual me gustaría volver a trabajar algún día, aunque días se trabajaba día y noche día a día se aprendía algo nuevo"
good,"opportunities for advancement and change were adequate . for the most part pleasant atmosphere . "
good,"pay is low and they expect too much , poor management team the supervisors for the front just walk around and not help with long lines , but when you ask for an override it take them 20 minutes to come and you stuck with angry customers .But other than that they have very good benefits such as medical and 401k program."
good,"Durante el tiempo que estuve en Wal-Mart fue de mucho aprendizaje"
good,I am currently an employee here looking to leave the company because of the lack of respect that managers have for their employees. In this company you are judged by the people around you and not the work you do. The environment is ok but all the managers are new and looking to make a name for themselves. The policies change every week but you wont know until you have already gotten in trouble for it.
good,"Start out the day by reverse picking and picking out of the backroom. Audit the bins to make sure their 100% accurate. Bin leftover fright from 3rd shift."
good,"Atendimento ao cliente e busca da melhoria profissional são pontos importantes que pude desenvolver no dia a dia de trabalho.Diminuição de custos, produtividade, pró atividade, respeito pelo próximo e urgência com relação as metas foram pontos muito desenvolvidos com minhas lideranças. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é o cumprimento de metas com pouco orgânico e verba, mas que foi essencial para o desenvolvimento de soluções prática para superar as dificuldades. O ambiente de muita sintonia e união dos funcionários em prol das metas da empresa."
good,"women are not easily promoted as men. I loved working for walmart an learned alot.But things happen in life that out of your control,being coached being stuck in a position for over a year is wrong."
good,"I learn how to help customer finding specific items. The hardest part of the job was when I have to help other co-worker in other department, my favorite part of the job was when I see a satisfied customer, the management was friendly and be there to any employer that need any concern about the job."
good,"A typical day at work, especially towards my end, was me coming in early. opening and cleaning photo machines. I often helped other areas then until the photo lab was open. Then I would serve customers and keep up maintenance on the machines. As in, filling the paper, removing jams, fixing computer problems. "
good,"during my work day I would clean, get prescriptions for customers and stock shelves. I learned to double check everything. management was so kind."
good,"Its a great place to work at as long as they don't give employees job that's they are not supposed to do(Cashier doing cart-pushing, working in the warehouse). Other than lack of employees its a great place to work at."
good,"the hardest part of the job was the heat in the summer"
good,"As a cashier I work with a  great diversified group of people. I enjoy talking to customers and assisting them with their needs.The most difficult part of the job would be standing on your feet all day. Walmart has a relaxed atmosphere with great benefits."
good,I had the opportunity to experience what makes the company #1 in retail and I glad that I was taught so much over that work period.
good,"A typical work day includes taking care of patients from the beginning to the end of their appointment. I assist customers in placing eyeglass or contact lens orders. I also do administrative work, check in shipments, order merchandise and help train new associates. My job is never stagnant. I work well with my co-workers. However, it becomes frustrating when they are unwilling to work as a team. It is also very frustrating when the manager does not execute her managerial skills in a proper manner. I enjoy my job most when the day is peaceful and I am able to complete all of my work for the day."
good,"During my 10 years with the company I met a lot of wonderful people both managerial and associate alike.  While I did not always agree with corporate handling, the individuals in my store with whom I dealt were overall a positive experience."
good,"Started off really good.  Was dropped down to part time after the initial training period.  Was written up for non-existent issues, like many other employees.  Was told by managers doing the write-up and it was ""not a 'write-up' "".  Employee turnover was at one point 137%.  Manager turnover a wee bit better, though.  Received raises at every single 6 month evaluation and quite a few award pins."
good,"Days started with group meeting to tell about the previous day, to warm up and stretch and for any announcements. Pick your equipment, get your trips, grab a cart or pallet and start your trip. Once you've started your trip you get out on the floor and pick all the cases from trip and load them until you finish trip then once its done you take it to the doc. I had great co-workers, they were nice, helping and caring people."
good,"A typical day at work consist of picking  up returns that customers left ."
good,"Not so much of good pay, friendly employees, not flexible, department managers dont know anything about their department."
good,"Aprendi vários conceitos de trabalho, na parte de gerencia não tinha muito aos seus conceitos de trabalho para melhoria pessoal, tinha uma relatividade com colegas de trabalho e foi muito agradável em fazer da empresa."
good,when I was working for Wal-Mart it was fun  some time but it was work and I had to do it sometime it was brooding but I work it out
good,"It started out as a great place to work for the first year, but after that management had a secret agenda and did nothing to fix errors that were in their systems."
good,I worked as a cashier and customer service rep at Wal-mart at times the job got very stressful and the manger sometimes was not around to help out.
good,"The company requires a lot of work, but has so little to offer. Walmart doesn't treat workers with respect and appreciation. Wages are very low and not enough to make a living. They don't like to help employees further education and won't care to work around the hours. The best thing that can come from this job is getting to know other employees and building relationships."
good,"What i learned was helpful tips toward customer service, how to build a quick relationship between you and the customer from only seeing them for a short period of time. The management were helpful and happy."
good,walmart is a good company to work for yet the management is horrible and there is no flexibitygggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
good,"What I liked most about cashiering at Walmart was the people I worked with. It sounds kinda corny, but we really did become like a family. What I liked least is that my whole life had to pretty much revolve around my job. I worked most weekends, most evenings, and most holidays. I rarely got to spend time with friends because I was always working when they were off. Also, working with the public is very draining."
good,"Fast paced, high energy, working at Walmart is rarely dull. Lots of pleasant people, both co-workers and customers. With a variety of jobs inside each Walmart, if the one you start off with doesn't quite fit, another position is usually available in another department."
good,"Work at Walmart can be fun depending on the team you are working with. As management team, i have had to deal with push back from associates especially when trying to meet the customer needs with minimum labor. I have come to learn that leading and managing are totally different things, and i am more of a leader than manager. Working at Walmart has been part of mas a desire to learn more on how market behave in different seasons."
good,the jobs didn't last too long but they always had another job for you to go to. the pay was steady and the work was pretty enjoyable
good,Typical day at work was dealing with customers and front end staff. The most enjoyable part of  my job was i was awesome at it and loved to work with people. The hardest part of my job was getting yelled at by Customers. The management was easy to get a hold of and my co-workers were funny and helpful. I learned management experience and the retail industry.
good,It was a good first job to get some experience. i learned alot. from the management that worked there. My co workers where good to be around. there was no hard part. the best part about working there was  the people.
good,"Provide customer service, Assign employees to specific duties, Direct and supervise employees, Enforce safety, health, and security rules. Hire, train, and evaluate personnel. Resolve customer complaints, Answer customers' questions. Opened and closed the store, which included counting cash drawers and making bank deposits. Oversaw all daily operations of store. Collaborated with customer service team members to give exceptional service throughout the entire shopping and purchasing experience. Built customer confidence by actively listening to their concerns and giving appropriate feedback. Communicated merchandise needs and issues to appropriate supervisors in a timely fashion.

Offered direction and gave constructive feedback to motivate team members. Held each team member accountable for achieving brand and performance goals. Recruited, hired, developed and retained retail talent for the company. Directed strategic and brand-appropriate marketing initiatives to improve presentation and maximize sales."
good,You figured for being a billion dollar corporation that they would be more professional with their upper management at the stores. They would sit on their phones in the office giggling.
good,"I liked my job, but some of my co-workers were rude and management would not treat people with respect."
good,"Job duties are fun, responsibility was challenging, meet a lot of interesting people, training has a lot of flaws, staffing is never complete, work load and pay is often unfair"
good,Puts you in a specific department but makes you do other positions jobs and still gives you less pay then those who were in that department.
good,"This job has some benefits, though I will say that they have been decreasing over the years.  This company used to be very family oriented, but has really become very strict, and does not treat employees well.  I have seen associates reprimanded for leaving work because of deaths in the immediate family."
good,"Walmart doesn't pay their employees enough, in my opinion but on the other hand it's great place to move up in management. It's also a fun company to work at especially if you are a people person."
good,"I gained a lot of work experience working at walmart, i also met a lot of great people; both co workers and customers."
good,"My typical night because I worked overnight crew . we had our meeting before the shift started. then we would go to our separate work areas and check and evaluate what was to be done,"
good,My typical day at work was mostly quiet because I worked the night shift. The job was easy and I was able to do it without problems. I learned that if you have focus to detail and organization that people WILL notice. The management was friendly most of the time but was very busy so if you wanted to talk to them it was best to do it before or after your shift. The most challenging part was getting used to being on my feet a lot but I  got used to it. The best part about working the night shift is that there isn't as much going on and there are less demands and room to work without getting in the way of customers. Overall I enjoyed it mostly because earning an honest paycheck is very rewarding.
good,"A empresa em si é boa por ser uma multinacional tem muitos setores e vários tipos de atuação, mas só que por não ter um plano de carreira para seus funcionários se torna uma empresa onde o crescimento em promoções para áreas que pretende e gostaria de trabalhar quase impossível."
good,Stocking product on shelves and helping customers with finding what they need. What I learned is that there has to be a good team to accomplish the goals that are set (teamwork). Management stays out of your way if they see you working hard. Hardest part of the job is making sure to keep your co-workers who are working with you motivated to get the work done. The enjoyable part of the job is seeing your department looking nice for the customers.
good,Its a good job to have. My customer service skills are improving everyday. Management does a poor job and I'm not sure if this is every Walmart or only the Walmart that i am currently employed at. I love my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is downstacking the truck when it comes in with thousands of pounds of freight.
good,"My typical work day consisted of face pace working as well as working as a team. From baking, to cake decorating , to decorating donuts. MY co workers became my best friends at work we all got along excellent. The Hardest part of the job was having multiple managers telling us different ways to do things. My most enjoyable part of my job was no one was ever upset and if there was a problem with some one or something they would confront you about it and try to work it out in the nicest and simplest way possible."
good,"A typical day of work at Wal-Mart can range depending upon the staffing and the size of the trucks day to day.  A typical day in the backroom will not stress you out. You should have adequate time and resources to accomplish the tasks given to you. You will learn the basics shipments and how to properly distribute and inventory the merchandise while working alongside a wide variety of personality types and personal backgrounds.  The management and staff at this Wal-Mart is a hearty mix of caring, intelligent and understanding managers.  You should do your best to be kind and courteous to all those you encounter, most of all your co-workers.  You do not know the personal pressures anyone may be experiencing at any point in their life.  The most difficult part of the job could be the demanding nature of the scheduling of a 24 hour store.  But this is personal preference.  The jobs are easy to do and do not demand exceedingly of you, it is difficult to think of any parts of the job that are difficult for most individuals. The most enjoyable part of the job here, is the management teams friendliness, caring, and willingness to work with you and your needs on an individual basis."
good,the hardest part is the bad environment in the facility and having to make sure the customers aren't angry everyday by the foul language
good,I think a walmart is a good place to work. very friendly amd welcoming.
good,"A typical day consisted of Clocking in fixing my cart and proceeding to clean. I learned the many in and out of Wal-Mart and its associates. Management was slow acting but firm. Co-workers were friendly and very informative. The hardest part of my day was the health hazard dealing with other people bodily functions, and the most important part was the attitudes of the customers."
good,"Your job will consist of multi-tasking. You may be required to lift heavy objects, complete price changes, reset modular, stock merchandise, and much more. The management is not very understanding. Everything is on specific time schedules."
good,"I would say working at Walmart is not fun to work at, managers are so rude and mean to the employment they don't have empathy or sympathy when your hurt or sick they won't even send you home no matter how sick you are not unless you passed out.  It is very rare for Walmart to have a nice manager.  You just want  to work that company because you have bills to pay some co-workers are nice.  Its good to work at Walmart if they will hire the management have a heart that will run the business."
good,Pay is pretty low. Good training and safety culture. Not very willing to be flexible around school schedule
good,"The main thing I like about Wal-mart is the people I work with. They are happy people. We are all go though the same thing. And they understand. They are people you can talk to about anything. "
good,"Great Place to work if under the right management, however they have slipped away from the way the waltons wanted the stores ran. Most management here don't care about the workers or their personal lives. they just work you like a slave and if you get overtime they take it away."
good,"all in all the job was quite challenging. I took care of 7 departments. modulars, price changes, recalls, claims defective merchandise. and all this with very little help."
good,"Es una empresa que te permite desarrollarte, lograr tus objetivos, y conocer sobre todas las áreas sin limite, al igual que conocer la información en general de la misma operación y sobre la marcha adquirir experiencia."
good,"While working for Wal-Mart, i had a great time. Even though I had worked in past retail stores, I still felt that the job was quite challenging due to i had to re-learn my position. The co-workers and night managers was very understanding and lenient about how you work. They was always very helpful and wanted to teach you the correct and proper way of doing your job so you wouldn't make any mistakes."
good,"I liked it but didn't want it to be long term, but its a great company to work with and I wouldn't mind going back in the future"
good,"es, el lugar de trabajo confortable y el grupal. era más placentero todos juntos sentía un espíritu muy agradable"
good,"A typical day at work is fast, and friendly. I learn/learned to talk to customers and assist them with what they may need. The management team is a strict, yet fair, team. Always pushing to do the best. My co-workers are friendly and caring. Ready to teach whenever it is needed. The hardest part of my job is the toll that working overnights takes on my body. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friendliness and comfort everyone ensures."
good,Wal-mart was a good experience to say the least. Management needs a lot more managment skills for their employees.
good,"A typical day at wal-mart i would stock the shelves, clean and help customers. I learned how to drive and operate a forklift as well as how to unload trucks, talk to customers and the proper way to lift and carry heavy objects."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is working with very good associates. no one person can b a team, only good team members can make a good team."
good,A fun and interesting place to work for. The managers and workers are always helpful to the customers.
good,"Walmart Gave more generous benefits than Goodwill / Easter Seals. Had decent hours, working 40 hours per week. Had some good managers as well as some poor managers. Made friends with some Wal-Mart co-workers."
good,Good learning experience. Co-workers and management was friendly.
good,"You can go in tired and ready to go, but end up energized."
good,How to work and get along with others teaches life skills within a work environment and a society as a whole.
good,"The management team is very approachable and seem to really care about their employees, however, the pay rate is one that should be reconsidered.  Most departments are short staffed therefore it seems like the work never gets done.  Typically the co-workers are fun and easy to get along with, with the occasional bad apple in the bunch.  Hardest customer service position I have ever worked in.  Seems as though shoppers are always grouchy.  Overall good experience just need to work on the wages."
good,"Very fun work place. Unload the trailers and distribute the merchandise accordingly the department. I learned to Be independent and work in a fast passed environment. The managers work very well with the team members and are very flexible. The team members are fun to work with and are team players. The Hardest Part of the job was Adjusting to the grave yard Schedule, but once I got the ability to adjust I would enjoy working with great people."
good,"Uma empresa boa tem uma visão importante porem sobrecarrega muito os seu funcionários 1 pessoa trabalha por 3."
good,"On a Normal day of work I would clock in head straight to a manger to be assigned a task. Normally I would be given a cashier assignment, but I have recently been working on the front end merchandise(maintaining candy, chips, displays,etc). Sometimes I am called to the money center to help cash checks, process payments through different money services, and money grams. Sometimes it is a bit difficult to complete some task when there are a lot being thrown at me, but I always try my best to get things done in the most productive ways possible. I enjoy working with people. In fact, it makes my day to know that I have put a smile on customers face and when I accomplished all of my assigned tasks. I love seeing and meeting different types of ethnic groups and tourist."
good,"great team work "
good,"helping customers with products "
good,"Night Shift is not for everyone, especially for a full time student."
good,well I go in at 9pm till 6am soon as I get to work I go check the cooler to see what the department out of and just work all the old freight that's in the cooler and stock produce department at a manner time. My co-workers are fun and friendly we all have respect for each other and help each other if help needed. The hardest part of my job is pulling the pallets off the truck and I have like ten pallets every night that I got to go pull from off the truck and then walk them pallets all the way back to produce department. Management is terrible cause they don't communicate with associate as they should. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I clock out and go home but no its a fun job I like working with customers.
good,"loved working with a lots of people, good hours, always moving around and something was new everyday"
good,This job has been great for the time being. I needed a part time position while looking for another clerical like position.
good,"As usual, we work in good team to get job done. I have good co-workers. Most the times, we are too busy, and  get overtime, which is a benefit for us."
good,I have worked at the Wal-Mart Distribution Center for about 3 and a half years. The hours were long but I did not mind. The pay was great but they expected an extremely high production which most people had trouble meeting. We got a cost of living rate every year but the production also went higher. Job security and benefits were pretty good but I did not like they would sometimes make us mandatorily come in on our weekend with only giving us a few hours notice before our weekend was about to begin.
good,Wal-Mart  is a very fast paced company ;  They have taught me a lot of attributes that i can carry with further in life.  The hardest part of my job was telling a customer we did not have what they needed in stock. the best part of my job was knowing I made a customers day by  providing them with the  best customer service possible.
good,"I enjoyed the customers and coworkers but I enjoyed mostly being able to do Modular changes which was changing the products on the shelf to match the new floor plan.  Hardest part of the job was when we were short staffed and weren't able to leave the department to help another customer or not having any supervisors around to help with customer complaints or when something needed changed. Management was usually very helpful when we had questions or needed something to do and to help cover our department for any reason. What I learned from working in retail and at Walmart is how to prioritize my daily duties and patience with customers and management. I also learned how to do certain projects faster and how to maintain a whole department by myself. Lastly a typical day at work included checking in freight from the night before shipment, put away that freight, and help customers whenever they needed help finding a product or answer questions that they had, or covering another department that was short staffed."
good,"Nessa empresa eu aprendi bastante, trabalhava direto com grandes profissionais , e colocava a mão na massa mesmo , não tinha tempo para ficar atoa, era mais burocrática para resolver pois tudo tinha que passar pelo encarregado. O gostoso era que eu fazia o que eu gosto."
good,"Work was fun, management was mostly good people, and coworkers were good people."
good,Wal-Mart was a nice place to work for my first full time job. I enjoyed working with the other employees and I learned a lot from them.
good,a typical day for me would be going to my register and checking people out for two hours- I learned sometimes people are hard to deal with but you have to keep your cool in order for them to keep coming back to your business. my co-workers are nice and they all do a good job at my store with me. the hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers and standing all day. the most enjoyable part of my job is when I have made people happy and I can tell they truly appreciate it.
good,Helping out any and every customer. I learned how to print money orders and working with the bill payment department. The management was actually great as well as the co workers which made it easy to get up and go to work. The hardest part with working for Walmart is putting up re shop items. The most enjoyable part of the job was around the holiday's.
good,"Ambiente de trabalho agradável,"
good,"Overnight inventory associates are responsible for the cataloging and distribution of freight to the sales floor. The co-workers are pleasant and optimistic, even through the stress of the busy holiday season."
good,"When i was originally hired i was in pets, i worked in the entire department cleaning, aligning items, restocking and replenishing before going for fish orders as well as cleaning my areas. I also went and worked for the grocery sides and the paper department for chemicals and i even worked in the candy department and helped out at the doors."
good,"very hard dealing with different attitudes because the customers are sick, dealing with different situations."
good,"Great place to work and a fun, well organized business thats very entergetic. Shows displine and helps put a good head on your shoulders. Proves a big difference on short and long term goals in life, on how can work on the floor for short term goals, and thriving to make a career in business on a mangement position for long term goals."
good,"-service a la clientèle "
good,"Great place to work on people skills, multi-tasking. Also working here is very motivational in the aspects of wanting more out of life financially."
good,Always room to grow and to succeed in the company. Started in 2002 and ended up leaving in 2014 to relocate to IL
good,I enjoy the position I have.  It would be nice to get more hours
good,"This is a good job if you can't find any other part time or full time job.  You will start out as part time for a whole year or longer, and it will be minimum wage.  Keep your mouth shut, and listen to the managers if you can find them."
good,"days are great, there's always something do at Walmart you will not have a day where there's no work to be done at Walmart."
good,Overall good atmosphere to work in has a good advancement program with full benefits. Is fast paced environment which I like.
good,My days working for WalMart were good very busy at times but its a job. My co-workers were very friendly
good,Coming into the store walking to ensure all associate are at their work stations. I then go and access the conditions of the store and the expectations that need immediate attention. Then go pull up emails and compliance email and follow up to ensure all the assignments are started on and are getting complete.
good,"Assisting customers, stocking merchandise, operating registers, meeting new people"
good,"I worked as an inventory control specialist, i worked in the backroom loading and unloading the trucks. This job was very demanding for me and just was not a good fit for me"
good,"This job consists of unloading inbound freight, ensuring correct freight and count, and receiving it into the distribution center.  The work schedule schedule is Mon - Thu, 10-hour days.  The work environment is pleasant but hot in the summer months.  The distribution center is non-conveyable freight meaning it is too large or too heavy to be sorted via a conveyor system."
good,"fast paced, crazy customers. management is rude and ghetto very unprofessional."
good,"Good Job Security. Not bad management good environment. They dont want to make people full time, so theres always a fight for hours."
good,There aren't many hours and management always throws you under bus if anything happens.
good,"When I get to work, I go through all the aisles and pick merchandise that we're running low on with a telxon if my supervisor hasn't already done so, then I would go in the backroom and pick everything out of the bins and run the freight. The management team is always there to help me when I need it, and my co-workers are amazing. When the lines get long, I usually go to register to help get them down, as well as the customer service desk or whatever else is needed. The hardest part I would say is trying to get all of your tasks done, while being pulled to different departments to help others."
good,Working at Wal-mart warehouse I gained physical strength I never had. It was sort of like a workout everyday plus you're getting paid for it so I enjoyed it a lot. My co-workers were very helpful to me because I am small in size so I was not able to reach certain things. The management were laid back as long as you did what you were supposed to be doing.
good,"Walmart is not a good place to work.A perk is that they schedule you around whatever you got going on. I 'm currently a full time student in college, and I am able to go to classes in the morning then go to work. .Management isn't all soft like some places. They expect you to get stuff done and they will coach you if you can't make it happen. It's pretty easy to move up in the company if you work hard and communicate to management that you want to move up, then odds are you will. The people however, leave something to be desired. A lot of people that work at Walmart constantly complain about their jobs and they don't work hard. Some of the older guys and gals work plenty hard and they make work bearable. Same for my friends that work with me. But people at walmart are rude and will often ignore you when you try to help them. The pay is not very good. its good for a part time job, but when you're trying to support yourself like I am, then you would be better off finding a job somewhere else. There is an employee discount, but it is rather terrible. Otherwise, benefits are pretty much non existent for hourly employees starting out. After 6 months you get opportunities for bonuses, which are really good. They are pretty much another paycheck. You get a raise after every year you work there. There is insurance as far as I know, but you have to pay for it. Walmart doesn't pay for it. You can get small repairs done on your glasses at the Eye Center for free, but that's it. It is really hard to lose your job. You pretty much have to never show up and do nothing when you do show up"
good,"bien recibimiento de mercaderia,reposicion,atencion al publico."
good,"A typical work Day is sometimes easy and hard , I really don't like not being able to have a Good amount of work hours . and a constant pay."
good,"Having worked similar retail jobs, I can fairly say that Wal-Mart has a better system in general. Scheduling 2 weeks in advance can make it difficult to make appointments, but otherwise work-life balance is fair.  Opportunities to earn up to a dollar per hour more per year, and starting higher than minimum wage, with incentives for working night and Sunday shifts.  Overtime is available but not often required. Benefits are competitive, and advancement opportunities abound. My only issue is there is no real teamwork--they try to force a positive culture, but it doesn't often play out."
good,"En un dia tipico, llegar lipiar ir por mercancia ala bodega para el surtido de piso venta de la misma"
good,"Typical day of work I did cooler/freezer freight (stocking), helped customers, cleaned/sanitized equipment. "
good,come to my work area with other order picker to be assigned a trailer number to be unloaded and than gather our bar code scanning equipment. I learned that in order to meet my production levels I had to pace myself by setting hourly goals. Management was very patient  with their employees. the hardest part of the were the hour that I worked. the best part of the job were the people and staff that worked each day.
good,"stack freight that comes down the conveyor system, load pallets of various assortments. constant working. some jobs are rate based. management is open to ideas and suggestions. good group of people to work with"
good,"They give you 34-38 hrs for a few weeks the cut you back , over and over. Now they have  cut back our hours and are  HIRING ! I just want to have a steady paycheck which I work very hard for!"
good,It is okay place to work out if your just getting put of high school
good,"It was a good place to work, and my co-workers were all fun to be around. The job was fast paced, and took a long time. The management was singling out individuals who they liked rather than the people who were doing well."
good,"A typical day of work at Wal-Mart left me tired, but manageable. I would show up sometime around 9pm for the shift-meeting. We would all stand around the main entrance of the work-area (back of the store) and the managers would give us a summary of the work load ahead of us and any shortages that we had in workforce. They did their best to encourage us to stretch and go into the workday with a bright outlook, though high workloads that were beyond their control often had us dragging more and more as each day went by. We would go to work immediately after the shift-meeting and begin unpacking and shelving merchandise, answering questions for customers, and checking that prices and organization were all correct. Two breaks and a lunch later, we went home, typically on time, but I was asked to work longer several times due to the workforce being too small for the workload to be done in the correct amount of time."
good,"Responsible for loading and unloading incoming trucks, customer service, layaway, fork lift driving, moving pallets on to selling floor, painting and assembling new products."
good,"When I applied for the job in August of 2013, I didn't get a reply until the end of October. Strike one. I liked interacting with my fellow employees and the different customers. However, whenever I needed help with something, the management was slow to answer my call. They even forgot that I needed help sometimes, either from the many people or the fact that I was a teenager, I am not sure. Strike Two. It was fun putting items back on the shelves and being a cashier. Sometimes, it was confusing, though, because I wasn't familiar with the store since I was mostly up front being a cashier. When I would ask for directions, some of the employees I asked would look at me like I was stupid. Strike three. Overall, it was an okay experience."
good,"Despite the long hours, the relationships you make with your coworkers and regular customers made the job enjoyable. I still keep in touch with many of my former coworkers."
good,The days at Walmart are all pretty much the same. Just making sure the boxes get loaded into the truck without breakage and damage to the actual cases. So many units are expected per hour with varying amounts each day depending on the demand of the stores. It is very hard work but it is fulfilling in a way. The people I work with are really nice and are always willing to help when i need it. The managers don't really know what they are doing but most of them are new to the store and are still learning what they need to do. I enjoy the three day work week leaving me with the rest of the week to work my other job or do what I please.
good,"The best part about working at Walmart is........ The technology and the customers , I relate to the customers because most of them are gamer's and I myself am a gamer , So answering their questions were a piece of cake."
good,"This company is great for starters in the work force."
good,The biggest problem was there wasnt enough people there to complete the nightly work
good,"loved working there. great boss and fun coworkers, was let go but was told I was rehireable but when I tried I was not approved do to the fact they now check your credit??.."
good,Enjoy working with the company overall. Meet new people everyday.
good,el ambiente de trabajo es bueno pero en algunas ocasiones si se siente tenso
good,I typically had busy long days while working there but that was a good thing cause it kept me busy and made the time to go quickly. So far as the management team some were quite nice to work with but some I didn't like so far as backing me up on items that customers wanted to return and I would tell them that the item was non-returnable cause it was passed the time period for return. That would be the hardest thing about my job there. But the most enjoyable part would be the interacting with the customers and also the other employees.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be coming in at 7am scanning what merchandise sold out, the night before. Based on that I order whats low and out. I merchandise my furniture to end-caps to try to improve sales on items whom sales rates are low. I've learn to better prioritize my time so I get all my work done before its time for me to get off. The management team for the most part are very good. You'll have some managers come and help you if you have questions, and the rest will just sit in the office and don't care if you're doing a good job or not. My co-workers are helpful, and don't mind helping you out on a project when you need it. The hardest part of my job, would be the lack associates we have in the store. I feel that if you have enough associates shelves should be empty and you won't have to over work your associates, so they won't be burnt out by the end of the work week. Customer Service would be my most enjoyable part of the job. When customers are satisfied with your service, they will always come back when they need anything."
good,I have learned a lot in the 11 years I have worked there and it was a great place to work when I first started but in the past 5 years it has gone down hill fast. A new store manager is working on improving it and I Iook forward to the outcome.
good,"I learn everyday that a different problem can and will arise when dealing with the public, It makes a day at work always interesting, I have learned during my time with this company that if you work hard and do your job a lot is possible This company like any I am sure has good and bad management   Just have to do your job to the best of your ability and it usually goes pretty smooth. The hardest part of the job Is dealing with irate customers, somedays they try your patience to the very end but most of the time I have found that anyone will listen to you if you are friendly and courteous to them and treat them with respect, The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with everyday."
good,"A typical day working at Wal-Mart meant assisting customers, very fast paced and often busy. I learned a great deal at Wal-mart as far as cashier functions and state rules and regulations as far as the sale of alcohol,guns and tobacco. Management was a little on the unorganized side they would often forget to assist customers or move in a timely matter for cashiers to complete transactions in a timely matter hindering time. My co-workers were often cheerful and friendly and fit the Wal-Mart fashion of helping guest's as well as co-workers alike. The hardest part of my job was maintaining a speed to complete transaction which was not very hard unless a customer's card wasnt working properly or if they misplaced their means of payment halting the transaction. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing the same customers and greeting them and them coming through my line because they value me as a cashier."
good,"Loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays and stocking shelves."
good,"Overall, "
good,"Since hired,staring out was good.As weeks passed,we lost some coworkers ,then gained some.My co-workers most of them worked very hard,some slacked.The more they slacked,the more we did.The management here is disorganized.One day you have your scedule,the next day its changed,then 4hours later again,then back 4 more hours later,then they call you in on your day off,you go in,then they change your schedule to work 9 days straight then 2 days off,and call u and tell you to come in the next 2 days,you cant b working someone 11 days straight,when you have done hired new people the past 2 weeks,[.I ASKED.]especially when your schedule was set 3 wks. ago.and u made plans.Were told to stick to scedule,then not,then do,then not,,!-I enjoy working hard but to much is pushed on you,.I was PUT'' in positions with no proper experience or training,.They put to many tasks on alot of us,that theres no way we could do it,the right way.or even do it at times,.freight was late getting on floor,which also would get us behind at times,but I worked always and consistant,and did a great job despite the delays of others,and the push to do more and more tasks.A great job but management is the core of getting it together.A mixed up situation.When you got 8 hrs.to do your job,then why give you 12 hrs.to do it,.and do other tasks.Im not the only one,others are quitting,changing to daytime,or going elsewhere,,,,,Overnight working is unorganized,messed up,overworked here.HOPEFULLY,they will get it together."
good,"Managing a team at Wal-Mart is very rough due to the amount of people that are transferred out.  It feels like once you get someone trained to their job, they either leave or get moved to a different department.  It's rewarding though to see that person grow.  I will say the most enjoyable part about this position is getting hard tasks done efficiently and in reasonable time.  It always seems their is not enough hours in a day."
good,Working the money center showcased how efficient I work in a fast place environment.
good,Worked in a diverse environment which was fun and we all became a family within the work time.
good,"un día normal de trabajo, aprendí a usar scanner, zorra eléctrica y manuales, a estrechar pallet, a ser ordenado, a abastecer la cinta de producción. n hay nada difícil cuando pones voluntad y actitud, todo me gusto"
good,"opening electronics, setting up t.vs and computer, drawers"
good,"I would clock in and go to the front of the store where I would receive my cash bag. After counting it I would put it into the drawer and turn my light on for customers.  I knew a big majority of the customers so I enjoyed my conversation and waiting on them. Customer service was the  customer is always right so you never argued with them. You did everything possible to make their shopping and enjoyment.  It was easy for me to deal with all my customers; I guess that is why my register line was always filled from the time I got there to the time I left. I had many customers wait in line because they wanted me to check them out and stated other cashiers weren't friendly.  When there were complaints I let the supervisors know what happened and how a customer was treated."
good,"I love the people I work with we are like family there. Every morning I come in, my first stop is to look at my sales.  If I was up or down  I kept a log.  Investigating previous years sales and digging into home office bought feature recap to see what I sold the most of and ordering feature sized of the particular item/items. Multi-tasking and prioritizing would probably be the most effective part of my job. You have demanding customers that need assistance on top of your routines, not to mention flying from one end of store to the other at lightening speed. I am very meticulous I like things to be done right the first time and very organized which helps me do the best I can everyday."
good,"Not bad place to work, but you can never recieve full time. Scheduling was all off"
good,I recommend this be a good first job for people entering the work force. learn what you can with the mindset to move up or move on. I worked there while in high school and it was a good fit then. you will come to notice that your job description/ duties grow as needed while working there but your check does not
good,"I work 3rd shift at Sterling Wal-Mart, we don't get very many customers, and in that case we are stocking the front end(all the registers) or we are stocking other parts of the store. My co-workers are fun to be around and make the shift go a lot faster, management is great."
good,".make sure that the entire store is clean"
good,The job isn't hard at all to learn. Only takes about 2 weeks to get used to the pace of the workplace and learn majority of the the item locations.
good,"i would have to say this was probably my least favorite job, not because of the duties or hours. but because of the lack of communication between the management and the employees . I loved my hours but i hated being understaffed."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart you learn a lot about yourself and you also grow up. You learn discipline in many different ways such as workload management, making sure that you are efficiently your time at work so that you can finish all projects on time and correctly."
good,Usually a typical day at work would be normal processing of customer transactions.
good,over all fun but alot of pressure. team was good. hardest part was being on my feet all day
good,This is a great place to work when learning retail. This store will teach you a lot about supply and demand.
good,"As the biggest retail company in the world you would think having workers would not be a problem. But with Wal-mart they add more work constantly without adding workers. They add programs to track workers productivity but not all managers use them to follow up with associates, leaving the ones that work to doing all the work, and the lazier workers to do what they want."
good,A typical day is running around to get my job done at a reasonable time. My coworkers were fun and easy going. Management was there for the most part.
good,"Wal-Mart is great place to work, the company treats its associates with respect and is willing to help them in any way possible."
good,Through my 18 years at Wal-Mart I have gained a lot of experience in the management aspect of the job. I enjoyed the years of working with people and my co workers.  The customers had to be the best part of working in retail.
good,"This job offered me many opportunities to expand my knowledge and experience in customer service. It also allowed me to try out many new things that I was unfamiliar with, and gave me the chance to see how an industry this large works. The management team and the associates at my job are all very friendly and welcoming, and they make the job very fun. They are all very organized and we work as a team, so much that we almost always receive our quarterly bonuses."
good,"Inconsistent schedule"
good,I started with the company as a Cashier with in the 7 years I was in Layaway up until they took it out. Then I moved to Customer service desk. Where I worked until I move to Las Vegas Nevada in 2007 then I went back to being a Cashier for a couple of years then back to customer service desk the to Customer service Manger. When I first started with walmart it was more family like over the years they became so big and new people in corporate that it has got away from the way Sam Walton kept the company going. They got where they cared about how fast you can get a customer out of line rather that the service you give the customer.
good,"Fast pace work with organization depends on who you working with weather you can get task done.There is nothing to hard about this job,but team work is the key.."
good,"I've worked for Wal-Mart 3 years in the Produce department as an sales associate and as an whole I've liked it, my typical day is extremely boring and predictable, honestly that's how I like it though to a degree if you don't like that I would not reccomend Wal-Mart at all.. I love the environment of being around a lot of people since I work in a supercenter and management really does treat me like family a lot of times I've met managers and co-workers i'll remember for the rest of my life, but bottom line the pay is nothing, my wage is still around minimum wage after 3 years, I've gotten only 40. cent raises every year and a lot of the time management just treats me like a robot and expects me to do to much, if you need a job quick Wal-Mart would be great and if you have plans of being a manager one day as well..but please don't do it and just be a sales associate for many years and expect any $$ :(.."
good,"For the most part, I really enjoy working for this company.  However, I have only been working part-time for the past 3 and 1/2 years and I really would like to further my career with a full-time position with full benefits."
good,"A typical day started with a pep talk and meeting with assistant managers."
good,Great first job. Loved the time that i worked there. The co-workers were the best.
good,"empresa legal de trabalhar onde as oportunidades surgia, bastava agente esta pronto para corresponder com a mesma o ambiente de trabalho era bom."
good,The co workers there are great. Tasks get doubled upon a single person and all work is expected to be completed by the end of shift.
good,"I liked most everything, the workers, the job itself, except management didn't care about the individual."
good,"Conocí y apreníi de todos mis compañeros,a ser lider y a trabajar bajo presión. Trabajo en equipo,"
good,ummm honestly it was a okay place to work except some managers were not perfesonal.
good,"Typical day at work composes of cleaning, panning bread and decorating cakes. Every day is busy especially on Sundays. My co-workers are helpful and accommodating. The hardest part of the job is taking out frozen dough, cleaning and organizing the freezer. There would be a day when I would spend 30 minutes to an hour in a -18 degrees freezer. The most enjoyable part of the job is decorating cakes and cupcakes."
good,"photo tech, electronics, phone sales, garden center. learned a lot of sales and how to put stuff in the computer"
good,It was a great job . The co-workers are wonderful. You never know what you may have to do when working here
good,Good place to work if you just want to be part time. Friendly co workers. Like to cut hours when it is not needed. They let you work on your own and make you responsible. Trust you when you're alone until you abuse that power.
good,"A Typical Day for me at work would consist of running the cash register, meeting new people each day, and handleing any customer complaints and refunds at the service desk."
good,I have always enjoyed the grocery business. I like meeting and helping people. I get along well with my co-workers as well as management. A typical day at work is stocking shelves and building displays. The hardest part of the job is making my given time for a task in an area I'm not real familiar with. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and pushing myself to see how fast I can stock shelves. I am very competitive. I also worked for Wal-mart previously. I just started back but am very interested in relocating to Scottsdale in the future. I took 2 vacations there and fell in love with the town and climate.
good,"Working for walmart was a great experience. I learned how to work many departments. Deli, freezers, dairy, produce, bakery and meats."
good,"Muito bom para se trabalha."
good,working here was an cool experiment i would work for this company again
good,"A typical day of work was clocking in, doing your job, going on break, then going back to work. I learned a lot about marking down items, stock rotation, and baking. Sometimes you couldn't find your shift manager, but overall when you did find them they were very nice and helpful. People really didn't talk much, and some didn't do their jobs! The hardest part was lifting the heavy boxes when unloading pallets."
good,"On days off some of my co-workers we hangout eat, laugh, talk "
good,"Most days started with grabbing a handheld computer and scanning different items in the back to make sure everything was still there.  When that was finished, I would go onto the sales floor to see if any items needed restocking from the backroom.  I would make a list then fill the order by loading the required items on a cart and pushing that cart to the employees on the sales floor.   Other times I would take overstock from the sales floor and catalog them into different areas in the backroom."
good,Inventory management associate-My duties included unloading and organizing deliveries from the regional warehouse and getting the products onto the floor.
good,"•	Responsible for assisting customers and handle various types of situations to make decisions equitable for the customer and the company."
good,"a typical work day, friendly co-workers."
good,"A good part-time job overall, but training could have gone more smoothly."
good,I cashed people out worked my butt off. the slogan for Walmart is that they care about families. well they don't they care about the dollar that they are bringing in. I enjoyed the people I worked with a lot
good,"In my year as a Walmart associate, I was promoted once and given a raise three times, which I though to be impressive in the relatively short amount of time I worked there. My work was relatively straightforward and I was given plenty of training and I was treated as an equal, even by my direct superiors."
good,"Working on the floor, awsnering customers questions, organizing shelves. The hardest part wouldhave to be the training wasn't all that great, I wish I had better training."
good,"Helping customers check out,showing them where products were located. How to deal with dificult people. Management was pretty easy to work with as long as you did your job. Coworkers did their part. Working with dificult customers. When customers sent compliments in on you."
good,"Not the greatest but not the worst. Job conditions are okay, the management can be a bit overbearing but it's nothing to look too harshly upon. Job security is great, though the work is hard (although that doesn't bother me)."
good,"Unloaded trucks and stock shelves."
good,"There was always something to be done, but you needed to make sure that your team was also taking care of the tasks that needed to be done. It was a good company to be a part of I just worked in a section where I did not agree with some of the practices of my coworkers. Overall I had a great team and enjoyed the time that I spent there."
good,If you are a student who does not need a lot of money walmart is good
good,"L'environnement de travail au Walmart est très stressant. Les clients sont la plupart du temps très pressés et effectuent un contact très faible avec les employés. Cela nous demandait donc une adaptation très rapide. L'aspect le plus difficile était donc de s'adapter à cette ambiance de travail. L'aspect le plus facile était de communiquer avec nos supérieurs. Puisque nous somme une centaine d'employés, il y avait en tout temps un responsable à notre disposition en besoin."
good,"Same review as my last one, just a different store. They have a great culture in Eagan Wal-Mart and the employees treat you more like family then just friends."
good,Was good working for a large cooperation but the lighting of the buildings cause headaches and the environment at my location wasn't the greatest
good,"A typical day at work is clocking in, going to a computer and getting sent either to a CSM or a register. Checking out customers at a reasonable pace, getting high scans per hours and dealing with different transactions."
good,A typical day at work consist of working all day. You really cant talk but that's only in certain departments. But its a good starter job. Not something you would want a career in.
good,a typical day consists of Properly your body to reduce the chances of injuries. Then stage pallets in labeled sections to place the freight coming off the truck. Its a very easy going environment but also fast paced .
good,"I learn a lot about  team work, people, responsibility."
good,"I cooked foods for hot case,cut meats and cheese for customers. I learned how to make up party trays Some of my co-workers were team workws..My manager was some one you can go to, this was a enjoyable.We work hard stocking boxes in our coolers."
good,clean area getting ready for customer. working other areas of the store
good,"Working here has been fun and challenging, how ever i have hit the proverbial brick wall, I can no longer continue to grow as an optician at this place of employment. So i must expand my horizons and leave...This has made me very sad but I know that this is what i have to do in order to grow and expand."
good,worked in the sporting goods section.was a customer service associate
good,"Je rentrais au travail pour mon quart de travail, j'allais me changer, je  passait ma carte dans le lecteur pour entrer dans le système le début de mon quart de travail et je repassais ma carte dans le lecteur pour indiquer au système l'heure à laquelle je partais,"
good,"Loves working at wal-mart, stocking items and scanning to update inventery.. Must be fast and diligent."
good,the workers were good but the management not the best working for the company at first is good but then once your probation period is up the managers act like you dont exist and kind of make you do the dirty work. they have there favorites
good,"Being an employee for Wal Mart for over 5 years has shown me more than I ever wanted to know about Wal-Mart.  For me it has been a good overall experience.  It has been flexible enough with my school schedule and has given me opportunity of putting supervisor on my CV.  But I view it as nearly a stepping stone that I will jump off of once I have my bachelor's degree.  Not all stores are the same but I'd like to think (hope) that my store  was one of the bad ones.  I've heard a salaried member of management go through the amount of hours he puts into running his part of the store and when looking at it on a per hour scale, he actually makes less per hour than when he worked on an hourly wage before being promoted.  I've seen these managers put in 60-80 hours a week.  I've seen the store manager stocking frozen foods at 8pm at night when hes been there since 7 that morning.  Also as an hourly associate, your personal evaluation is only as good as the evaluation of the entire store.  You can run an excellent department but if your store is in bad shape, don't expect to get ""role model"" or ""exceeds.""  See for yourself though, if you get an interview you basically have the job unless you fail the drug test or confess to murder.  Just do your self a favor and keep looking for a better job if you decide to work there."
good,"A typical day at work for me is very fast paced and rewarding. I learn a lot daily dealing with the different prescriptions and insurance issues. The management is good and easy to get along with, as well as co-workers. The hardest part of the job is finding out a patient is no longer with us(passing). What I enjoy most about Walmart is getting a patient out of there fast and satisfied."
good,I enjoyed the later shift of the day. Meet wonderful people. Enjoyed the costumer interactions. Management could have cared a bit more about their employees.
good,Walmart is a fair and pretty decent place to work for a retail store. The health insurance could be a little better but all the other benefits are very resonable for a retail store.
good,"From my short experience at Walmart I have learned a lot in the work environment regarding to stocking many items and just, learning to appreciate the customer"
good,"I loved my job and the fast pace work, worked by my self. and with others when they need help."
good,My typical day was me being mostly working in the fitting room. I was one of the only ones who really liked working there. I didn't mind answering the phones and doing the over head. I didn't mind managing the fitting rooms. I also was a back up cashier. so whenever it got really busy I would jump on a register.
good,Meeting new people and helping customers. I learned how to work different departments.
good,Wal-Mart had some great workers. Though customer service I felt was majorly important I strived every day to ensure the best possible customer service. I learned a lot about different drug components and how they interact with different other types of drugs. The thing I disliked about working there was that you couldn't go to management with any problems because they were never resolved.
good,"Pick up grocery carts all day."
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart because of the open door policy. the policy though in theory looks good, management is overwhelmed with too many targets it makes it difficult to practice to policy. A great customer experience on each visit is very important to the Walmart family. being a peak time associate like me means, my hours can drop to 13 hours a week without notice even though the Manager in my Department tries to give me at least 24 hours a week.. Walmart celebrates all achievements by its employees but the peak time associates have no benefits except the employee discount and profit sharing. It is the people that I serve each day while I was in the bakery, while I was a greeter and now as a cashier that make the difference."
good,"Surrounded by good people. "
good,"Helping customers, keeping inventory stocked in the cases, customer service, ringing up purchases, showing merchandise, taking inventory, cleaning department and keeping it organized."
good,I have been employed with Wal-Mart for about two years now. The environment is good overall however the stress can go up depending on the season.
good,A normal day at work would be the basics . The staff and I would get there about hour before the stock truck arrives . Before it pulls up everyone knows which section they're in to separate each items. We would unload the items (stock) from the truck onto the pallets . After all items are onto pallets each pallet gets lifted and dragged onto the sales floor into it's aisle.
good,"A tipical day at work for me is work with responsability, honestity and  be able to learn every day and guive my best. i learn every day , i respect my managers and supervisors, and i am able to be a manager soon too, with my co-workers i hada no problem, is good keep a good actitud always and be nice, my hardest part of a job is with u had nothing else to learn, and u have not challenge."
good,"my typical day at work was sometimes exciting "
good,"While employed with Walmart, I learned numerous management skills. For example, how to train associates, run successful inventory teams, as well as, how to quickly resolve any issues with associates.Learned the importance of customer satisfaction. Being in a back room management position, you learn the importance of running a good & controlled inventory. The back room is the heart of the store, in order for the store to run properly the back room & inventory must be on point."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, los compañeros son muy amigables y se puede trabajar bien en equipo para poder lograr al objetivo de la empresa. Aprendí a como funciona la empresa para lograr al objetivo de vender cierta cantidad de productos diariamente. También aprendí estrategias para vender mercancía así como también de convencer al cliente para que comprara."
good,"Aprendi a ser Lider de Apoyo, a trabajar en equipo, trabajar bajo presión"

good,This is a fast paced environment that stays busy all the time and has a lot of employees and at times may be fun.
good,"great co workers, always busy, Love what I do. Weekend schedule is a must which is hard."
good,at walmart it was a very good company to work at but the over management was bad at times the workers had to get on the same page so that's the work could be easier than what it was
good,The job was good. I had a good time working here. Great pay when hours are given.
good,"I learned a lot over the 13 1/2 years at Wal-mart. They help me to develop better people skills. I learned how to do management duties such as delegate to others. I learned to work in the Cash Office, do interviews, hold meetings along with a lot of other responsibilities."
good,"Assembly line environment, so u have to know your task and also keep speed o ensure the line keep running."
good,Eles me deram essa oportunidade e agarrei com todas as mãos sempre fiz meu trabalho direitinho mas eles nunca dão  oportunidade para quem trabalha direitinho só dão oportunidade para quem é puxa saco.
good,This in tells I break down old fixers an put them on a pallet an shrink wrap them tightly an  get the pallet jack an take the old ones out back so they could be placed on the truck or shipping container
good,"the people are nice the job is awsome  but i need something smaller. "
good,Most people here provide helpful advice so that we can work in a easier and fast pace.
good,"Walmart in Kannapolis NC was kind of hard to get use to. It was a long distance from my house, but i tried. I would really like to obtain a job as a cashier. I am a college student ,but i work hard!"

good,growing in economics with moral conduct and great work ambitions
good,"exelentes capacitaciones, buen trato de superiores hacia los asociados, clima de trabajo, alegre, responsable, confiable y totalmente solidarios entre el equipo de trabajo."
good,worked in pharmacy otc. putting stock away handing customer's their prescriptions. Helping pharmacy staff get caught up on filling perscriptions. Constantly busy which I like.
good,I liked working for walmart for the most part but they work the overnight crew much harder then the day and that's a little unfair for the workers watching the other employees slacking off and getting paid the same but it was definitely fun for sure.
good,This job was extremely hectic at all times but having good people (co-workers) around made it easier
good,buen ambiente de trabajo ya que día a día hacen una junta para el desayuno y saber cual es la meta para vender mes con mes
good,Other than the relocation to a store from hell. My days of working at wal-mart were fun. They are flexible and there is room for advancement.
good,A typical work day in the jewelry department is making sure the customer is satisfied with the service received
good,This company has been good for me because it has been my first job in this country.
good,"Walmart is constantly changing looking for new ways to better serve their customers.  Through change, comes resistance.  Managing that change and working through resistance is a vital part of being a member of management at Walmart.  The best part of the job is the experience of your team succeeding.  At the same time, the most disappointing aspect of working there is when your team does not succeed.  You learn everyday, and not just about the company or your job.  If you pay attention, you learn about yourself, how to control your emotions, and how to alter your outlook on situations."
good,"my day at work used to began,at 10pm and end at 7am,during that time,i would bring out pallets of grocies,still in boxes,to open them up and start puttin them up,on the shelve,during break,i would hang out with the employee and talk and laugh..lunch break i would either leave and go home to eat,it was a hour,the hardest part wasnt the work..it was the zoning.cause by then your dead tired.."
good,"I have been in middle management for the majority of the time I have been with this company. My responsibilities have been maintaining the my areas and ordering, resets and for the salespeople in my areas. Sometimes with a big company the work can be overwhelming but always able to come through.I enjoy retail and working with people, customers and fellow associates,"
good,"Being an employee I got a chance to do a little bit of everything. I learned to work the handheld in tle to write service tickets, how to look up tires on the walmart computer, how to pick and bend merchandise in receiving with the 960 (handheld) and print labels if needed, run the register and stock merchandise on the sales floor in different departments. I could barely deal with the managers. When they are on the bottom they try to be your friend and once they get a higher position they change. I'm the same all the time. Their management team including the store manager do not care about their lower level workers which is not fair because they are the ones that do all the work and the reason the management get all of those promotions and recognition. My co workers were messy and tended to mind others business before their own. Beyond that I got along with just about everyone I just knew what and what not to say. The job itself I can say was not hard. The most enjoyable time was break and lunch. The only thing I disliked was that we were not getting enough hours and they should pay a little more."
good,Good place for families and for graduates starting out there careers.
good,This job allowed me to step up from being a cart pusher to a cashier to a customer service representitiave!

good,"Everyday I would unload and put away the truck that comes in every morning. Then I would start stocking the section i worked in."
good,"Working for Walmart was a great experience you deal with customers in person.Helping them find the items they are looking for and assisting them with questions they have on certain products and answering them well enough to convince customers to buy our product. Customers love honesty and a friendly sales associate and that's just what i provided great customer service. The co-workers were very helpful and nice, I did not find the hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is our customers, co-workers,"
good,"I enjoyed working here, I liked helping people and the people I worked with. But the problem was the management was overworked and underpaid. Which because of this caused them to misuse those underneath them which eventually left to large mistakes. "

good,I loved my job. Meeting new people and making new friends. I enjoy cleaning so when It was time to clean if I could of found a tooth brush I would have cleaned every inch of Walmart. Walmart is a very friendly place considering how many people where in a store at once. I never had any problems with the management or the staff. If I needed something they were always there to help me.
good,"In this job I learned how to supervise a small group of cashiers at one of the busiest Wal-Mart stores in Ottawa. This job also required me to carry out credit authorizations, cash overrides and  approve returns."
good,Wal-Mart was a great experience because it gave me the opportunity to work in a large scale environment. I loved the people there and how hard they worked. I was a cashier for some time until the hours became to rough to balance with school so I ended up switching to the deli. There I found that I really do love working with food and I also learned I had a skill for customer service and quality. More importantly I loved doing the job! In the end I quit to work at an herbal company.
good,"They do have good values and its easy to advance in the job, however, thats it. Horrible pay and terrible mnagement. Different story if you work part time though, much more enjoyable work experience."
good,I had surgery and they sent me a card and some flowers to the hospital. I found out i was going to have to be out for five weeks. Took my doctors note to the store manager and did my review for my raise. Received my raise and then got terminated.
good,"Entrar y tener una reunion de sector para planificar el dia,aprendi a trabajar en sectores de frios y electro,buen trato y diario de gerentes,la mayoria de colegas falsos pero en general buen trato,la mas dificil los compañeros y lo que mas me gusto fue poder aprender cosas nuevas"

good,"very productive "
good,Working for this company you can never get bored becuase you are constently moving which is good.
good,"A fast paced customer service orientated facility with good working relations with managers.  Workers help to provide the best service and work together to meet the demands of their consumers.  The demand can be hard to meet with the limited resources that are available, man power and service.  The work relations with co-workers is an easy manner and fast friends that make that day past."
good,It's a great place for students to work because the management always helps you  out to find the time  that would fit your schedule.
good,"It is very easy to move up in the company provided they have a position open, however, the company does not value some positions as much as they should."
good,"If any have worked retail then its practically the same bit as all the rest but their emphasis lies in saving all the money they can which can include: not willing to allow overtime, at most of 32 hours per week if working dayshift, 40 hours per week if working nights and only having a 'skeleton' crew daily. "
good,"I learned to use a scanner, price products, unload trucks, stock shelves , Order supplies, read modular plans, customer service, be creative in displaying product."
good,"Cleaned up the shelves, assisted customers with finding what they are looking for and restocking racks. "
good,"Running a cash register for 8 hours, unloading semi loads of merchandise, and dispersing said merchandise through the store. I learned money skills, customer service, and 'superstore' skills."
good,"Typical day at work for me starts by getting together a plan for the day. I put together a list for myself and my workers to get done each day. I then get started on my list to make sure I get as much done that I can that day. The Department Manager list contains each day some of the following: 1. Paperwork for yesterday's cars 2.Price Changes 3. Telxon work (Alerts, Counts) 4.Freight worked Labeled, and Binned 5. Markdown's on deleted items 6. Notes from Management.....etc..."
good,typical day at work is very busy and challenging. i learn how to multi-task and manage my time in a prompt manner. management was very supportive. Co-workers worked as a team to get task done in timely manner. the hardest part of work is when there is no team work. the most enjoyable time at work is when a task is done on time and to its perfection.
good,I got the chance to have more job expericne and more confidence that I knew that I didnt have. I like the fact that if you are done with all of your work that they let you go home and the customers there were very friendly. I got the chance to meet new people and my least favorite part what the pushing and pulling of the shelves that was  getting me back pains.
good,"Fast pace."
good,"clock in, count down tally, sign -in register, start tranasction, maintain clean area, break, clock-out"
good,"Good fast pace work"
good,"Cashier, 2012-2013"
good,my daily work consist of issuing supplies. Deliver frames and glasses to other labs. Liked the people that I worked with. The pay wasn't to great.
good,"A typical day would be that of always being busy, one's hands are never idle for long. I've learned the basic skills to run a deli and how  to understand certain systems work like labeling, pricing, scheduling, and clocking in and out. My co-workers were always friendly and willing to help when it was needed. I'd say the hardest part of the job was probably trying to clean when there are customers approaching every few minutes on the really busy days. The most enjoyable part about my job was when was customers would start up friendly conversations."
good,Helping customers with check out and their shopping needs.  
good,I started Walmart right after I got out of college. I worked directly with the public and that was something I always like to do.  My co-workers were very nice and helpful. 
good,Assigned an area and stock all that was needed. Management was not so great and the fact at one point I did not know where things went they expected me to finish as if I knew where everything went. Hardest part of the job was finishing on time and being fast. 
good,"you can go far as long as you do not say no, the work load is heavy, the skills learn there will open doors to other place, management are regular people just try to finish the day just like you, but the hardest part is the hours might be to little or just not something you can work around"
good,A day here could be very pleasent at times with great co workers. Managment at times could communicate more but other than that the hardest part of this company at times is the customer demand while mechandising. 
good,My day at work consists of running a cash register all day and interacting with customers. The management could have been better when it came to getting your breaks and lunches on time. My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest part of the job was standing up all day. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers and my fellow employees .
good,"For the majority of my employ at Walmart, I worked in the Electronics department as a sales associate. A typical day consisted of attending to the needs of customers in the department, such as answering questions about our merchandise or just about electronics in general, as well as running the cash register and ensuring the department remained clean and organized. "
good,A satisfying work environment with great customers to interact with.  Great co-worker to conversant an relate to.  I learn that customers are number one priority above all in which our company revolve on.  The hardest part of my job is the problem of it infrastructure.  The lack of communication between shifts leave the next shift to pick up the work of its last shift.  Overall its a great place of business.
good,every day was exciting to come to work and help the customer with there needs
good,Great Company to work for. Worked for this great company eight plus years. Many opportunities to grow with this company. 
good,"Acredito que toda a empresa deve, prezar os valores pessoais de seus associados e colaboradores,o que  mais aprendi com a empresa que trabalho é dar importância a PESSOAS, o valor de trabalhar em  equipe.Em minha função atual estou sempre  fazendo e aprendendo algo novo pois todos os dias aparecem diversas situações para serem resolvidas,a parte mais difícil é fazer com que as pessoas coloquem em pratica todas as regras que a companhia presa principalmente lideres que devem ser exemplos para os associados, pois para os clientes e sócios nos somos a imagem da empresa e para fornecemos um atendimento excelente precisamos nos espelhar em nossas lideranças."
good,"I typical day for me is working together as a team to get prescriptions done in a safe and timely manner for the customers. The hardest part of my job is handling the customers. Not all the time are they difficult but sometime they can be. The hardiest part about handling them is that they sometime don't understand what your explaining to them. For example a rejection from insurance on their prescription. You have to find a way to explain why its not going to be ready and when and if it can be. It can get a little tricky sometime, but for the most part i can explain and or fix the problem so they can get their prescription or get a new one from the doctor. The best part about my job is that knowing in some small way i am helping people live a longer healthier life. "
good,"I have worked at two different Walmart stores.  When I first began working for Walmart, I absolutely loved it.  The people were friendly and helpful.  Management would not only listen to you, but they actually took your opinions seriously.  Everyone was knowledgeable about their departments, as well as other departments, because everyone was willing to help their fellow employees.  Unfortunately, I had to transfer to another location.  At, first I was excited, but over the past year, I have noticed that my excitement has diminished severely.  Management does not listen to the associates.  They are constantly in the office playing with their phones.  If you need them for anything, you should expect to wait at least fifteen minutes for them to respond.  There is a lack of expectation and discipline among the associates.  Few are willing to do the work they are being paid to do.  People are adamant they can take what they please.  Our inventory showed over a $300,000 loss in shrinkage this past year, due to theft and poor work.  This store cannot keep employees.  In the past year, I have seen a total of seven people leave from my department alone.  My work does not go unnoticed.  Instead, I am expected to do others work for them.  However, it has not been a wasteful experience.  There has been a large learning experience that has stemmed from working for Walmart.  I have learned how to deal with people on all types of levels.  I have learned a lot about how to run a business.  I have learned that I am capable of succeeding, even in a hostile environment.  It has not been all bad."
good,I worked so hard at walmart I did the work of 3 people by myself and I was not appreciate for my talent and special skills.However I would work there again just no in the bakery.
good,"ringing up items, helping customers with their question."
good,"My days at work were normally surprising each day. I learned a lot about the cars, tools, tires, store merchandise, and more etc. The management was not well maintained at times. I worked with good co-workers that believed in getting the job done safely, efficient, and potentially producing good quality work as a team. The hardest part of my job was during the times when I was needed in many other departments i wasn't trained in. The most enjoyable part of my job was returning a customer vehicle with confidence and them leaving satisfied. That was the best feeling ever and to here yo boss say great job after interacting with the customer. "
good,"Walmart is a good beginners sales career, however the hours are different every week and the company doesn't hire enough people to cover the areas needed.  You are expected to work in multiple areas last minute so you are easily stressed.  The family orientation however is good.  You can make a lot of new friends and have new ties to the workplace.  Good social atmosphere but overall business ethics could use a lot of work from management. "
good,"Maintaining sales and following policy and procedures. Ive learned about audits,providing Great Customer Service, Satisfying Customers."
good,Its a good job for high school and college students. Depending on your position the job could be easy or it could be hard. The pay is not enough to live off of but perfect for second income.
good,"Its a fun place to work if you're a people person,and since I was,it made work an easy place to come to ,and even easier to dedicate myself to my job duties.Most of the co-workers and employees were great people to me.We depended on each other and cooperated to get many things accomplished..Management was fine,but they had their days were they were under lots of pressure due to visits from upper management..The hardest part of my job was gettng an entire truck loaded as much as I could during daytime hours.The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to meet people and merchandisers."
good,"At Walmart, I worked as a Sales Associate in the Frozen/Dairy Departments. The learning curve to this job was incredibly easy."
good,"Excellent gateway to basic and intermediate knowledge of pharmacology. Typical days duties include working with third party insurance companies for claims, receiving, typing up, assembly and selling of prescriptions. Working under direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist.  "
good,"At Walmart, usually we only had one pharmacist at a time. I often made myself a list so I would not forget things I needed to do. My day went really fast by working multiple tasks and stations."
good,Es una empresa mundial mente reconocida con un buen ambiente de trabajo.
good,"Typical day at work. My schedule is 8am-5pm Monday - Friday.

good,"A typical day at Asda included replenishing the shop floor and interacting with customers. "
good,"Company provides opportunities to advance within, drug education, insurance training, and customer service experience."
good,"Come in and fill prescriptions, and assist with insurance issues. I learned about the different types of medications & how insurance works with certain companies. Management was great! I never had any issues. The hardest part of the job was dealing with such a high volume of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers whom I'd come in contact with. "
good,Walmart is fun. The people are great and easy to work with. Once prove ypurself as a worker it will be very easy for you move up in the company.
good,"   A typical day as a Wal-Mart cashier is fun, lots of new faces and then the regulars! I learned that most people are intersting and genuine people but also learned how to handle the more complicated customers by asking questions about the problem they were having and doing my best to help solve it! My co-workers were all very nice to work with and even my managers. The hardest part of my job at Wal-Mart was dealing unusually complicated customers but i was trained how to deal with those situations. The most enjoyable part of being a cashier was meeting new people and seeing neat new products."
good,"I love helping the customers find things around the store. I learned how to work the register, that was something I always wanted to do. i got along with everyone. it really ways a nice place to work. The job wasn't hard at all."
good,There was no typical day of work. The hardest part of the job was that you know what your duties and responsibilities were but each day management would change it. No two days were the same and it became a very unstable environment. I think that my co-workers and customers made the job worthwhile. I loved working with the people.
good,Have learned everything there is to know about how fast food restaurants are operated and managed.
good,It was fun while it lasted. A little bit disorganized for my liking. I had a great time meeting new people each and everyday. :) It was quite the adventure being a part of the Wal-Mart team.
good,I started by 7am usually before. I would walk my floor and check for mechandise that needed fillings and endcaps that needed changed. Then I would check my email and check what merchandise I was getting in make a plan for the day and head to my backroom. I would pick the merchandise needed and then fill my departments. After filling I would check my inventory and if an item wasn't already on order I would order it. In between these things I would help customers and help on register. I set up features and modulars in different sections weekly and helped maintain store cleanliness. i also attended daily meetings. I oversaw anywhere from 4-20 associates daily and gave them instructions and guidance. My co-workers were awesome. Upper management lacked communication and was not very unified. I learned how to be a great leader and that customers are number 1. I loved setting up features and figuring out how i was going to make my department look fresh and every season.
good,"Uma ótima empresa que da muita oportunidade de crescimento, esta se expandindo muito no Brasil, ficando entre a primeira empresa varejista do munto e a segundo do Brasil. Eu recomento sim, mas uma pena que a minha área foi extinta da empresa."
good,good experience friendly family enviorment and easy trainin classes
good,"I work overnight maintenance, so whether you are recycling cardboard,cleaning the bathrooms,taking care of the trash, sweeping,mopping,waxing,buffing,or scrubbing the floors, you are moving fast. Management varies from week to week, or night to night depending on your schedule. Also my co-workers are mostly hard workers. The hardest part of the job is getting all of the teams job done, because you have to rely on everyone to do there job quickly and correctly. The most enjoyable part of my day is getting everything done early, because I know I did it correctly and it lets me know I completed quicker than what was expected."
good,my job is very labor intensive. not to many technical things go into my day at basic steps on a handheld and some organization required. you dont need an education to work here but to move up you will need some. i learned that retail is not where i want to make my career. it is very hard to move up into managment because the people in those positions rarely leave and it seem they mostly do outside hiring for these positions. working at walmart the pay is minamal and there is little opportunity to work overtime. the hardest part of my job was working very hard and watching others skim by while i pick up the slack. the enjoyable part was knowing i had accomplished a day of work and i was going to get payed for it.
good,The produce department is a fun easy to learn department. The department manager is easy going and always there to help.
good,"Working retail takes a special person, there is a lot of stress involved when dealing with the public, especially during the holiday's. You need to know how to handle criticism and rude behavior. If you can make it pass all of that then you can make it through anything."
good,"Bonne équipe de travail,c était presque une famille pour moi.J étais bien traité,une bonne ambiance et beaucoup d entraide."
good,"being a cashier was ok but the customer were alright ,not,some good ,but I enjoyed being a cashier."
good,I cooked and prepared for for the hotbox and kept in a clean and orderly manner
good,"An average day at the deli in Walmart is very busy and stressfull. I have learned to take it in stride and if you worry about too many things at once it will seem like nothing gets done. The managment, some will help but if any of them have anything against you even if you did nothing wrong they will try and get rid of you, but some are very professional and handle things the way they should. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with everything going on. The most enjoyable part is when they would make you feel appreciative for the hard work you are doing."
good,"Lots of multitasking, have to be able to handle phone at the same time interacting with customers and troubleshooting kiosk issues."
good,"Ambiente alegre, desenvolvi conhecimento no atendimento registro, abertura e fechamento de caixa. Membro da CIPA,"
good,Great people and good benefits. Ability to advance in career opportunities always available.
good,"Most of the time when I arrive to work i do whatever i am asked to by my supervisors.I cover the phone,run returns,claims,handle customers, cover lunches and breaks. I have learned how the retail business works. I have learned how important it is to be a team player and to be on time and show up when schduled.I Love our Management team they help with the associates anyway they can but some of them seems to have favorites.The hardest part about my job is dealing with grumpy customers. The motto is ""the customer is always right"". some of them take advantage of that knowing they are wrong. Some of the associates don't do their job and the work falls on the next person is worse than dealing with customers.I love my job for the most part. I love to help people and put a smile on their faces it makes me feel good to know I can be so helpful."
good,"Great people to work with. Not very good on the pay scale. Have yearly raises, working for minimum wage. Even managment jobs are only $2 more than minimum wage. No room for advancement."
good,muito bom o ambiente e as condições de trabalho uma otima escola pra se aprender
good,"un dia en el trabajo empieza con una caja asignada,monedero en mano y herramientas para un buen dia laboral,aunque a veces un poco pesado...aprendi mucho en este trabajo porque cuando comenze no tenia ninguna experiencia y ellos me enseñaron muchisimo,la parte de gerencia bien,cambiamos director, asi que mucho no los conoci,solo hacia mi trabajo y me retiraba,mis colegas buenisimos todos,excelentes personas y un grupo increible.La parte mas dificil fue cuando entre a trabajar el primer dia,unos nervios terribles,pero fueron desapareciendo con el correr de los dias a medida que iba aprendiendo mas y mas y por ultimo lo que mas me gusto fue la manera de trabajar,el compañerismo y sobre todo el respecto individual.Me llevo una linda experiencia!"

good,Always work to be done. Very nice people to work with. The management were great to me. I learned that working hard can get you high within the company quick. I was offered a assistant manager position after only 3 months of working there. Nothing was really hard about the job. The most enjoyable part was putting in a good day of work knowing you did everything that was asked of me.
good,"associate meeting, bank desposits,touring store and delegating to associates. have learned to work as a team player. the more enjoyable partof my job is that am doing a diffirence when pushing sales and profits."
good,It was a decent job for what it was they are accommodating schedule wise and I enjoyed working for them.
good,"O Walmart por ser uma empresa multinacional, deixa muito a desejar, não sei se todas as lojas são assim, mas a de Itu tinha uma falha muito grande em questões de pagamentos de salários, pois quatro meses antes de eu pedir demissão,o pagamento só vinha faltando, e nunca era corrigido, e sempre que reclamávamos no Rh eles sempre diziam que iam conferir, mas isso nunca foi feito, então por esse motivo decidi pedir demissão, pois afinal eu trabalhava certo e cumpria todas minhas obrigações, para que o meu salário no final do mês viesse certo."
good,My day consist of cleaning work area and putting items away. Helping customers' with returns or new purchases and answering phone. Management and co-workers were very nice to be around and work with. The most enjoyable part was serving my customers' and providing them with excellent customer service.
good,"Melhor gerência que eu já tive, um exemplo de líder de equipe. Colegas de trabalho muito queridos e companheiros, porém com diversas intrigas entre si."
good,"retail store love working with custamers and solving problem ,loading and unloading trucks"
good,"working for walmart in TLE was alot easier then when working inside of the store,there was lots of favortism in the store..in TLE they would pretty much leave us alone to do our job because it was the same thing every day,cars come in,we work on the cars,and send them on there way"
good,A typical day at work consists of taking care of customers and making sure that their properly assisted.
good,A normal day as an inventory management associate begins at seven am. You will go to the sales floor and check bin exceptions that are in the system and verify the floor count. Management is very good about keeping your day as smooth as possible. Most co-workers are very helpful and mind taking a minute out of their own time to assist you if needed.
good,Es una muy buena empresa.
good,"A typical day includes ""picking"" inventory out of the system that needs to be stocked on the sales floor for the first four hours of the day. The last four hours are ""binning"" what product could not be stocked back into our inventory system and backroom. This job consists of regular lifting, walking, and pulling of freight. Numbers play an important role in this job and they must be accurate. Sometimes the hardest part is meeting time requirements due to the amount of work hours we have remain the same but the amount of freight fluxuates on a daily basis. This is due to truck sizes and number of exceptions first and second shift were able to tend to. There are a few enjoyable parts of the job. One is knowing that my team and I are able to help get customers and fellow associtates the items they need on a daily basis. Another is that by doing our job correctly we are helping floor associaties to get their jobs done more effeciently. This in turn helps Walmart to run smoothly and provide higher customer satisfaction. This being said one of my favorite parts of the job is actually working with my fellow associates. I not only call them friends but some have become like family."
good,"Co-workers are easy to work with, 3rd shift, managment needs to get on the same page with each other,"
good,"Working hard everyday was normal , I learned that a team can finish goals faster than 1 person could , The management could have taught me more morals while working there , My co-workers were fun and I loved them , The hardest part of the job was getting through the pile ups in the backrooms , I enjoyed working there because I love Customer Service !"
good,I did a lot of jobs here and worked all over the place. It was an ok experience overall.
good,I had to just stalk shelves and that was about it. They really didn't teach me a whole lot when i first started. I learned just how to stalk shelves properly. Management was poor. They had lied to me saying i was doing a good job then went behind my back to and told the main manger that i was not working out. i got let go. My co-workers were fine for the most part. They didn't really help me they were rude to me a lot of them but some were good. That made me feel comfortable. the hardest part was keeping up with everybody because i was not used to it so it took me awhile to lean a strategy to be able to keep up. the most fun part was that i made new friends and leaned new things.
good,customer service i did for this company was where i learned how to deal with different people.
good,customer service
good,"They expect a lot, but that is the nature of any retail manager. The people make it worth it."
good,"I like my job. I go in and do the best I can do at what I am expected. I love working with most of the people there, there is just a few that act like they don't care and don't want to be there. There are some days that are very stressful because the lack of staff."

good,"I have learned over the years , in many positions, to handle just about any retail situation. It can be stressful at times but I love a challenge. I really enjoy working with the public and meeting all kinds of people."
good,Walmart isnt that bad of an employer. It just tends to be kind of an pop contest.
good,"help customers, slice meat an cheese,work with ovens and fryers, clean equipment. hardest part of the job is when the staffing is love and the best part is when everyone is there and we can all work together. my co workers were amazing they all had something special about them."
good,"A typical day at work isn't bad at all. I like the work, the managment, and my co-workers but the pay isn't nearly as much as it should be. Hardest part of my job is at the end of the night which is digging through the back to get what backstock we need. Easiest part of my job or most enjoyable is working in the back unloading the truck."
good,"I worked overnight shift at walmart, first as a cashier. As a cashier I was expected to take care of costumers, check their items out using the scanner, cash register and maintaining a cash draw. I would clean all registers, collect trash, random items needing to be put back on shelves, sweep and restock. I then switched to inventory associate position, which was more fast paced and kept me busy throughout my entire shift, unlike cashiering. As an inventory associate, I would use computer system to see what items were needed out on the floor and collect those items from the backroom for the stockers. There would be items in every department and we would have 5 hours at the most to collect all items shown. After we would then start collecting the overstock and enter that back into the system, with correct counts, package it and put in proper, designated area."
good,Fast paced and customer service driven. Management was excellent and allowed for flexible schedules
good,"some days very busy, but makes for a fast day, meet lots of new people, hardest part of job is getting time off, most enjoyable many things."
good,"era agradavel trabalhar lá tinhamos reunião mensal pra falar sobre a enpresa,venda e também pra reconhecer alguns associados,as vezes tinhamos até churrasco,tinha sala de jogos,tinhamos o cantinho de beleza,tinhamos fácil acesso a diretoria e gerencia fundador deixou uma politica boa com relação a isso,parte boa de tudo isso era que apesar de tudo conseguiamos ser como familia tem pessoas que vão ser sempre lembradas ,exigia muita força fisica porque nem sempre o quadro de funcionario estava completo e isso fazia agente se dobrar no trabalho mais com ajuda dos colegas conseguiamos driblar isso,e o sindicato da categoria deixava muito a desejar."
good,un dia de trabajo es llegar tempreno al trabajo cumplir con la obligaciones y un poko mas
good,The hours were not really enough to live on but the job was simple and i enjoyed helping the customers. the pay was minimum but it was a decent job.
good,Collect carts and do routine work. Management team was mostly helpful with any issues and easy to get along with. Co-workers was some great people to get along with too.
good,"- assign task to my employees,price changes,orders"
good,"on a typical day at work i brought in carts, stocked shelves, loaded cars, and unloaded trucks. this job really did not teach me anything new. Upper management was ok, but lower management was usually on a power trip. The employees were the nicest of all places i've worked. the hardest part of the job was being outside in the cold."
good,"Count and stock inventory while keeping area clean up to code. Replenish merchandise and face displays by making sure pricing, item is always is stocked. I learned how to control cash flow, up-sales, and use company network system. Co-workers work as a team dividing responsibilities and completing work in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with customers requests and maintaining inventory fully stocked. The most enjoyable part of the job was the opportunity to learn and grow within the company a non-stop working environment."
good,3pm-3am. Competitive environment. Great culture in the warehouse. Proper training and safety measures. Room for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work required me to be around an abundent amount of people different personalities but I am a people person and tend to try to relate to everyone. People would get upset of course in reatil you have to be patient and let them know you are there to help them. My managment team was great, they offered help and further goals to improve myself with there company. The hardest part of the job was the late ours going into night beccause I do have a young daughter. I learned with this job that I always have room to improve in everything I do."
good,Decent place to work. Wal-Mart for sure a great company that will be round for a while. Schedules are flexible. Unfortunately they frequently cut hours. The management is good.
good,Do what managers tell you...help customers
good,"Shortly after clocking into work, I applied sun lotion and strapped on my vest. I have one to two other associates assisting me. One would be using the electric cart machine with remote control to haul in large stacks of carts (up to 20 specifically). Hauling in carts was pretty much the entire eight hours of my shift. We would get the occasional call to do carry out service for a television set or household furniture. The title ""Courtesy Associate"" is very misleading, as ""Cart-Pusher"" is a more suitable description of this job as there is little contact with customers compared to previous jobs I've had. Management was fairly strict about lunch and clock-out times, but overall decent and friendly. All of my co-workers are friendly and I've never been given any trouble, since a cooperative, friendly environment is expected from every associate. The hardest part of the job isn't the physical labor, but rather the boredom that follows hauling in carts day in and day out. I've worked as courtesy positions before, but none required me to haul carts in for the full eight hours of work, just one to two hours worth. The most enjoyable part of this work is rather hard for me to fathom as there weren't many strong points keeping me tied to being a Courtesy Associate. I did however, appreciate being valued like a member of the team and very decent management."
good,"Input rx, check people out,fill rx. anwser the phone, call Dr.s for refil's, Call Dr.'s because we needs to verify the script,check a dose, they for got to sign the script, Call ins. pt does'nt have right card or no"
good,Dealing with a verity of customers. making own decisions not always supported by management. they play favorites. most people get hired back for walking off the job vers putting in a two week notice.
good,Training was non-existent on a human level but very much on an audio visual format.
good,"Cashing people out in the front of the store., There were too many managers that you had and everyone said something different."
good,"Typical work day is opening your register and making sure the correct amount of money was in it, cashing out all customers and maintaining a clean work environment."
good,This was just a very repetitive job. I only did one thing all day long. We weren't really able to get to know co-workers and management. Hardest part was the un-set schedule.
good,"Its very busy, exciting, fast paced and I am always learning new things. My co-workers are great but it can get a little hairy with all us females in such a tight spot. The hardest part is insurance and getting them to go through. I enjoy dealing with public and knowing I helping someone in need."
good,Day at work is usually 8 hours but in the past we have worked 10 hours shifts.Very busy all the time.I have learned to work on many tasks and 1 time and to be streamlined for efficiency.People i work are very hard workers and never miss any work even if there's a snow storm or hurricane on it's way.Hardest part of the job was keeping my area free of outs and keeping my area fully stocked because i worked in such high volume store.Most enjoyable time is when you finish and look at you're dept. and see how nice and fully stocked it looks and i know they customers like it as well.I have got alot of compliments on how well my dept. looks by the customers.
good,Working on cars and customer service. I learned a great deal about auto repair and auto care. My co workers were a great bunch and management was management.
good,"The company hardly has any benefits, it is a good place to work and alot of different people to comunicate with. customer service is a good way of interacting with others, and making new friends. The job it self is a good place to work. and always be on top of your hours and any paper work that you send to the offices."
good,"Wa-Mart is a great place to work. Coming into work and adjusting files were a great thing to do, as I enjoyed the work load task to work on and accomplish by completing. I've learned to not only manage my files, but also help others complete their work load. My co-workers were friendly and very helpful. The hardest part about my job is keeping the customers satisfied and helping the customers to understand why a decision was made on their case. The most enjoyable part of my job is the cultural interaction with co-workers as a family"
good,"Ambiente de trabajo agradable y confortable,,buen trato de los gerentes,,jefes y con otros empleados."
good,"the deli in any walmart is crazy, busy all the time frustrating. you slice and take customers fry chicken clean make sandwhiches, stock the deli areas"
good,it was a very decent job but around any holiday they lines are non stop.
good,"Working for Walmart was a memorable experience,"
good,"I learned team work, customer friendly, good work habits to make the job fun."
good,"I enjoyed my job,but not the people.Everthing was profit,profit.They didnt care about as a person.The woman were mostly older,they were hard to get friendly with.They didnt smile,and I dint find them polite.No team playing,no connections.I tried to fit in ,but it didnt work for me.The managers werent helpful,some yelled and no one would listen.I didnt find it to be customer friendly,employee friendly.I had surgery on my foot told to call when I could come back,I called no limited duty.Come back when you are 100% well. I called they said I quit.I said who did I tell,they said managers name.I said I didnt .No would believe me.They said well we are not hiring now."
good,"Being a employee at Walmart Supercenter is a good job, if you like dealing with the public. You meet plenty of friendly people in this trade. Being an employee at Walmart means being apart of a family. The management team listens to all employees compliants and ideas. I enjoy meeting all the new people although it can get a lil hectic at times, its still a great place to work. If they would give me a full time position this would be a great place for me, because I enjoy working with the public.But do to the fact that our econmy is on the rise I need a more reliable source of income."
good,Era un buen trabajo hambiente agradable de trabajo y se fijaban en la vida del empleado lo malo era el sueldo minimo
good,We work picks bring consumable goods to sales floor and pallets or water then end the day. The only mangers that are resonable are the grocery managers. Rest are a little shady in their affairs. The company is a good one to work with. but they hire questionable mangers and associates.
good,"El contacto con el cliente promover los productos y recomendar los mejores ,mejor manejo de las mercancias etc"
good,"good position calm, and collective no hassle. But have to be able to lift certain amount of pounds"
good,"I worked as a cashier here for a while, and I liked it. I had gotten very comfortable with the register; and if as cashier did ever need help in knowing anything, the managers there were very hands on. My only complaint at all, would have to be my getting sick (early stages of cancer), and I'd brought in my doctor's notes. Though, they apparently didn't get to the right party; and I feel as though that could have been handled more responsibly, maybe both on management & my part."
good,The cashiers seem more interested in their job instead of customer service
good,"a typical work day would began at 4 to 1. basically I get to work and unload trucks for about 2 hours or more. Than I stock shelves after that it is dinner hour. Than I pull out pallets to the sales floor for the overnights could run them. I learned how to run a pallet jack, walkie stacker, forklift and other stuff. management is cool to work with and some are lad back. In the area that I work in we are classified as a team. On Fridays and Saturdays I am the boss of the team because I have been their the 2nd longest back their.Some times the hardest part is trying to understand some of the arguments between co workers. I love listing to the radio that we have in the backroom."
good,Trained to know the products that are being sold throughout our department. Demonstrate the usage and importance of the merchandise. Inform customers who are interested on buying it for their enjoyment.
good,walmart is a very fast moving company you have to be willing to multi task and be willing to change your responsibilites as needed.
good,"This is a great 2nd job and wonderful for students. Very simple and easy. Every employee has his own job title, and will not be working outside of his department."
good,"Typical day: Arrive at work and make sure I have enough cashiers to handle the floor. Log in and assign my cashiers and give them their cash bags for the shift. Make sure all the registers and the front-end of the store is clean, there are enough baskets, bags at the registers, etc.. Handle any customer complaints or any issues that may arise at the check-outs. Make sure any items left at the registers and customer service was taken back to their respective areas of the store. Make sure all the cashiers and greeters received their breaks and lunches on time and they had their schedules for the week. Assisted the accounting department with the distribution and collection of money bags. Filled out time sheets and scheduled staff for each week. Relayed any issues or problems to the next manager to come in."
good,Multi-faceted task oriented.
good,"if you like computers, cameras and printers, this is for you. However if you need a good wage, than you need another good."
good,it is a a great place to work if you know the right people. Management is alot of politics. hardest part of the job is not being able to feel apart of the team. the most enjoyable part is working with the people i work with and are under me in my area.
good,Typical day at work would include talking to and assisting customers with various tasks. I learned how to work more efficiently with other people and to control myself in a stressful environment. My co-workers were wonderful people and we all got along great and even developed some friendships outside of the workplace. The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack of some of the other employees when it was a busy day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to constantly meet new people.
good,working there was great until you get out of your probation period and then it sucks
good,"A day at walmart usually is fun, and easy going, but it is hard work at times."

good,"Me gusto mucho la experiencia, aprendí muchas cosas que no sabia. El trabajo no era pesado, pero se necesitaba mucha atención, una de mis mejores experiencias."
good,"customer service , stocking, zoning, running cash register customer carry outs"
good,"Stocking freight is a everyday thing, no matter your job title there will be lots of times were you have to do other jobs. Management is good they leave the associates to do there task. All associates are set with several task at the beginning of the night and is set with a time. Every job is mainly equal. Dealing with customers is a plus I like to see the smile on there face when you give good customer service."
good,"Working for Wal-Mart by itself is pretty degrading, but as far as the actual job goes, it isn't tough work and you do get paid above minimum wage to start. I worked as a cashier for a while and was the main point of contact for the customers. But, after standing on my feet for 8 hours at a time and dealing with hundreds of unique customers, the money I was making hardly seemed worth it. Most of the customer service managers had been promoted from cashiers and did not know what they were doing. They didnt know policies very well because neither did upper management. So a lot of the associates would get ""coached"" because there was so much confusion between everyone about the different policies and guidelines. And I remember one time another co-worker of mine came behind me and wrongly ""corrected"" something I was doing right already. When I went to investigate the policies about it no one seemed to know who was right. My co-workers were mostly very friendly and when anyone new would get hired there everyone was really helpful with training questions. However, the wide variety of people and at our store having around 500 associates there seemed to be a lot of behind the scenes drama. Most of us referred to jobs at Wal-Mart as ""being back in high school, only this time its worse"". Not to mention Wal-Mart is so proud of its values but the truth is the company may represent certain values but the managers don't. They have to ""attend"" meetings for like womans rights and things like that twice a month. But I guess all they have to do is sign up and forget about it to uppease the public."
good,El ambiente de trabajo es divertido por que se trabaja en equipo con los compañeros nos llevamos bien con todos etc.
good,the ics associate just scanned all lecations and products and pulled the items for the floor
good,"llegaba y entraba a unas capacitaciones una hora o mas despues me iva con una persona para q mediera una caja y empesara a trabajar, aprendi a tratar un poco mas a las personas y mis colegas eran muy amables conmigo por que explicaban cuando algo no lo sabia"
good,Majority of work days consist of high volume sales with a very high customer count. Keeping inventory levels and managing tasks are a great challenge and can be rewarding to see your achievements when maintained to company standard. Associates are great to work with and are excellent team players.
good,"good job, it is a very well rounded company and they care about their employees"
good,This job was at my youngest age. I enjoyed it because it was a life experience to get me into the working world. I would clock in count my draw to make sure the right amount of money is presented to me. I was a cashier so it was automatic to greet customers and assist if needed.
good,"I enjoyed it...... I loved the people and the hours, and the wages.I worked in domestics,, the mangement was excellent, I did find I needed to learn where everything was in the whole store, as alot of people were on breaks, but I learned more from it,,,, the hardest part was matching skew numbers on the curtains.... with the ones on the shelves..... could get frustrating. The most emjoyable part of the job was the people, both customers and staff. I think there was one co worker who did not care for me.... as I had a hearing impedement, and she didn't have patience for that, but thats all."
good,"Money was good. Started off the day with stretching, which was odd but enjoyable. Worked 10 hours with two 20 minute breaks. Which REALLY sucked. There wasn't much interaction with other workers. Management did there jobs, we did ours. That's pretty much how it was."
good,"slow pace work,hard labor for no pay.not a great place to work"
good,was told after a year i was trained wrong and was writen up for it.
good,"Working at WalMart, taught me how to deal with many different things. The people I worked with also taught me different ideas on how to handle certain situations. The hardest part working at WalMart is some of the customers that would come to TLE. Understating some customers can be very difficult but with the people I work with it never seemed that hard."
good,"too demanding..co workers was great to work with for the most part, shift changes was the hardest part of the job, management was willing to help when needed, end of the shift was the best part of the day"
good,loved helping the customers and keeping track of everything im a very organized person so it came easy to me keeping up with everything and doing inventory
good,"-A typical day at work would consist of doing constant cashiering, either it can be busy or very slow."

The management team is involved in every aspect of their team's job and willing to listen to and implement suggestions from their employees.
good,"é uma excelente empresa para se trabalhar,seus beneficios muito bom,amigos que encontrei lá e até hoje eu tenho contato com eles. a parte dificil seria que nois nao tinha o apoio do encarregado do setor."
good,It good to work walmart.I learned lot more different things. best part is walmart help you to study.

good,"El trabajo es bueno me gusta lo que hago alli me enseñaron el registro y cobro de los productos mi jefa es comprensiva el ambiente es bueno,lo que no me gusta es que hay clientes muy chocantes y dia con dia tengo que aprender a como no enojarme y ser paciente."
good,"stocking merchandise, organizing floor display area, performing customer service; handling some customer claims with managerial assistance (product inquiries, customer dissatisfaction, etc.)"
good,"I work with a good bunch of people who make the job worthwhile, wich i think is the most enjoyable part of my job. Management are always there if you have any issues/enquires"
good,"I unloaded trucks at Walmart for about a year. I liked the job, it was hard work and we went through people fast because of it. The problem with the job was the managers and that was it. We would start out the day unloading a general merchandise truck, which doesnt come on pallets so we have to throw each box onto a line to sort them by hand. We would get trucks that would have 2000-3000 boxes on them. It would usually take us about 2 hours depending on how well stacked the boxes are and the size of the truck. No matter what the managers would be back there every 10 minutes telling us to speed up. It also would not always be the same manager. We would then have to pull all the pallets to the floor that we just re stacked by department numbers plus unload any of the other trucks that make their way that night. They push us to get this done supper fast so we can spend the rest of the night stocking shelves to make it easier on the 3rd shift manager. The year i worked there only one other person other than me gave their two weeks notice the others, which we went through a ton of people, just walked out or a couple were fired. I dont feel like they try and make the employee happy its all about the manager and making themselves look better."
good,"I liked working for walmart for many different reasons, I got to experance the muplti sides of customers"
good,Very decent management.All aroung good place to work.Customer Service rated high quality.
good,Overnight stock freight

You will get a lot if cases , some times the situations are dangerous but that's a but of danger at every job."
good,Wal-mart is an intriguing company to work for when you are just starting out because you don't have a lot of problems if you can do simple math you are great for cashiering
good,I enjoyed my job at walmart the employees were very nice and kept the job fun and interesting. Some of the work was stressful and time consuming but the end results were well worth it.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of setting up registers and restocking merchandise. As a wal-mart employee you learn as much as anyone would, from working the register to knowing your merchandise, depends what department you work in. Management isn't all that bad, aside from the 20-30 hour schedules they really help u better yourself as an employee. This job was easy as easy could be."
good,A typical day was busy.I learned how to run a cash register. Management was difficult.my co workers were nice. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was my days off.
good,Design merchandise plans for Neighborhood Markets and Wal-Mart remodel stores.
good,"My overall perception of Wal-Mart has been that some of the day to day parts of the job are becoming more impersonalized, and the asssociate is losing their feeling that their voice will be heard. The equity is fairly well established in benefits, but some of the core values are shrinking."
good,"helping customers, how to set up backroom, bin merchandise, training workers get the wrong information or not having the proper tools to do the job,"
good,Wal-Mart was an excellent experience that allowed me to work globally with Brazil and build upon my management skills.
good,I would have a very busy day every day. I learn customer services and leadership skills. Management was easy to work with and helpful. Co-workers are nice and nice to work with. The hardest part of the job was unloading a truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,"When arriving on shift it was always positive greetings and good feed back, There is allot of support threw out the store for any needs and assistance, There is always encouragement and affability to training to promote. The work loads became tough at times and more then expected but in the end the co workers together would succeed with even the toughest of challenges. It was a good positive work environment with plenty of feedback for growth in the company."
good,Its a job that is good for right now to make money. But one one thing is you have to be able to work with them. A lot of the time it can be poor sechduling. I have had a few problems with the managment doing that. But the good side is that there are a lot if nice people that work there.
good,Walmart is a very busy company an you automatically have to work at a face pace.
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Wal Mart was the interaction with the customers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal Mart over night because i was given a det 40 hours, and I love to always be working."
good,Working as a cashier was ok but the only problem was there was not a lot of hours. You would work like 4 hour shifts that was the major downfall.
good,Good Place but customers take pharmacist for granted. Think pharmacy is fast food. Use the customer is always right to their advantage.
good,Long short hours at walmart i was the only guy so they looked to me to do all the work but was still making the same as everybody else management was cooll my co-workers was sweet hardest part was going to work for 3 hours best part was the free meals
good,"at walmart i learned a lot of things, for instance i learned how to work registers better and communicate with customers better. the management there was good except for two of them because they showed favoritism towards certain people atleast it felt that way to me. my co-workers were nice atleast most of them was but some had bad attitudes and treated customers wrong and i didnt like that. the hardest part there was trying to keep my cool towards the managers because of their favoritism towards others and most enjoyable part was working around wonderful customers and helping them with their needs in the store."
good,"A typical work day would be to meet with supervisor and get the production schedule and make sure people were present at thier machines! Distribute work orders and assist throughout the day with completing the work orders! Set of machinery, Qc parts and package material for shipping! The hardest part of the job was when I couldnt get my overtime! The most enjoyable part was working with people and training them as well learn from them!"
good,Wal-mart was a good retail experience for me. I was exposed to lots of customer service communications. I had to develop good customer service skills which has helped me in my nursing career.
good,My 1 year old pass away and they was more worry about when Im coming back to work then anything else in to me that show me that this place isn't were i wanted to be; So I tranfer to other Walmart and they didnt care about my miliary status when it was time for me to get an operation on my chest. I have talk to there HR about why i have to miss some day and she also forgot to do her job at the time which cause me to lose minds.
good,"meet lots of new people, management wasn't the best and not understanding about any life situations. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting people."
good,good management; FAR TO MUCH EMPLOYEE DRAMA. good scheduling.
good,Great management and works with employees. Enjoyed going to work everyday.
good,WalMart was a great place to work. On a typical day I would go in to work clock in and be assigned a register. I learned that working in a retail store is a little harder than it looks but is definitely fun and rewarding.
