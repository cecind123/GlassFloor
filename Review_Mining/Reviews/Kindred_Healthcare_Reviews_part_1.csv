good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Manager fires employees for things she taught them to do by doing it herself. Company doesn’t have cna’s to ensure patient daily hygiene. Squeaky wheels dictate authority.
bad,"The place doesn't care much about employees, communication is lacking and no transparency. Patient care is the least important thing here. It's the monetary gains that is the absolute goal especially for higher up administrations, they're always looking to fill up their pockets first. Bottom line, its just a place to earn nothing more. Don't expect a lot from this company."
bad,This place is terrible I just started at this location and it’s the worse nursing job I ever had in my life. People are very mean and do not help you with anything at all. If you ask for help or complain about anything they’ll write you up with no warning. Please do not work here run away! I wish I did.
bad,I loved my sites and my team members.  upper management was not trustworthy.  world for the company for 10 years and new upper management came in and cleared out anyone that would not do things their way - aka against the law.
bad,Worst management  with worst service Zero Since of humor. Managed doesn’t know how to talk with employees. She make uncomfortable always. Not providing full information etc
bad,I was told that I would have good hours and when came down to it I only had very few. I would not recommend this company  to anyone unless you want to drive your vehicle everywhere for no reason.
bad,I really don't have much to say this company doesn't really care about employees its a so nasty and bottom line never valued employees. I wish I could stay but I cant
bad,"I worked for the kindred located in Philadelphia in their patient accounting Dept. very unprofessional from management all the way down. Jealous, bitter women who are always mad about something. Unfriendly environment, don’t  expect to be treated decently, lots of favoritism. I would not want even my worst enemy to work for that company. So happy i’m no longer there!"
bad,"Hard word, first job as a respiratory therapist where I was required to do oral care. Not enough hours in you shift to complete your work. Co-workers dump their work on you. No other staff member willing to address patients alarms but you. Aides and nurses sleep while you work, work, work."
bad,"Supervisor will stab u in the back,nurses are over worked... Patient ratio for nurse aide is horrible patient s lying in feces, beds are out dated , air mattress.. found unplugged.. I worked on wound care team. .."
bad,"Poor, poor management. They treat nurses and aids horribly. Extremely unprofessional. You will only succeed if you are ""best friends"" with the office staff. Do not recommend working there."
bad,The place is very unprofessional and people are over the place and there are too many management at the rehab.  Management are not friendly to their staff not good environment and I wouldn't take my elderly there.
bad,Kindred administration doesn’t care oboist their patients or their employees. Their pay is not competitive with other facilities. They don’t appreciate their employees. And when it comes to their patients they don’t care about them either. Family complains and they sweep the complaints under the rug..
bad,I have never found a worse run hospital company. Administration gets big bonuses quarterly and the Nurses get nothing just a 0.10 cenr pay raise a year. What a laugh.
bad,It’s was so dirty only one side of the hospital was occupied it was rats and roaches in the area we ate lunch a lot of stuff didn’t work and it was not enough staff
bad,"Worked as a COTA at Rehab care, Overworked with a high case load and productivity at the time was unrealistic. Administration did not listen to any of the concerns made just another money hungry SNF. wouldn't recommend this company fellow therapist out there. You'll find something better"
bad,I wouldn't recommend any family to be a patient at kindred hospital the management is a disgrace they don't communicate with employees especially CNAs they disregard ethical principles when it comes to their workers out of here
bad,"This place does not care about their employees. I worked there for 5 years as a CNA, I got a raise twice 10cents. They deny time off and patient ratio is pathetic. When you complain to management you are told “Technically I can give you up to X amount of patients, be happy you only have that many” that came directly out of her mouth. DO NOT WORK THERE."
bad,"Much like most healthcare providers, this place is full of liars who would like to make money at the expense of your health. Most caregivers are unable to do their best work as administrative team makes sure that patients are only seen if it makes them money."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"I had a bad reaction to me medication and I passed out  The employees stepped over my body to get to their cubicles    "
bad,It was a high stress place to work due to not being properly staffed. Many times I would have too many patients on my workload and the patients were not seen by me as much as i would have liked.
bad,"During my 3 yrs with Kindred, I had 3 different managers, the last 2 had no experience with rehab. The regional manager changed policy without informing the CEO of my hospital. Employees are expendable, managers are inexperienced, decisions are made during crisis. No foresight, no planning, no contingency plans. Very, very stressful work environment."
bad,"Negative vibes, racism, poor respect values, lack of hours and pay. I will never consider anyone to work for kindred in Fairfax Sc. The manager is two faced and a liar."
bad,This company does not care about it's employees.  The bottom line is the most important.   Patient care is lacking.   I would not recommend working at any of the Kindred locations.
bad,"Very poor management,  lack of professional staff . If you aren't liked by the upper management  staff friends  they will throw you under the bus . I do not recommend working here at all ."
bad,"All the business cares about is making money. They can close a whole department, and, ""It's just business."" They do not take care of their employees.  Not a good place to work."
bad,"If anyone disagrees with executive leaders they are watched.  You draw your own conclusion."
bad,"If u plan to work here;  just make to get a psych consult because this place will give u PTSD & depression. Not a healthy place to work if u don't want to commit suicide or kill somebody unintentionally. Someone's review said ""if u keep ur mouth shut, u stay but if u speak up, they will kick u out""; that is Kindred for u."
bad,"racial discrimination, if you are white, you're ok, if you are mexican, you're fine, if you are black, it depends. sharon the cco is always watching our time as ifshe owns the company, nissa the nurse manager, she rather loose staff than considering staff request, she move us around as if she owns oyr time...the worst management ever.."
bad,"Curo has all nurses on Salary. Very low Nursing Salries. Low mileage reimbursement . 50-60 hrs a week."
bad,They only care about top management.  Money is number one!!!! Management bullies staff my way or highway.   Write ups for everything.   Any way to get rid of old staff.
bad,"Managements was poor. Had preconceived ideas. Didn't listen to suggestions. Spent lots of money on rental cars, hotel rooms & food for travelers to office."
bad,When I started this job I was excited to work the there. The program director and myself got along well and we worked well together. Things were great until the activities director started. I started to feel lost and out of my element like I didn't know what to do anymore. There was no need for both activities and program director + 4-5 aides to be all together. It was very crowded and we were all stepping all over each other. I started to feel useless.
bad,"Very poor staff morale- staffing always too little- patients not being treated well, elderly, vulnerable. All manager were mandated to answer call lights, which we were not clinically qualified to do. Always under staffed."
bad,There are several bullies that really run the hospital. One particular is the director of case management. She will lie and belittle you. I was skipped over for a higher paying job because I was white. Worked off the clock and was not paid for those hours and the raise I was supposed to get. I was so relieved to leave. They talk about patients like they are slabs of meat in the marketing department.
bad,Horrible flips working there disgusting nursing care these Filipino nurses probably aren’t real nurses cover each other’s mistakes sleep most the nite horrible care
bad,Run horrible manager need to revamp the entire staff it’s just not worth the time. Manager is horrible horribly ran by horrible management ...........
bad,"They don't treat their patients with dignity, they don't care about the staff, the management is horrible. The company is going bankrupt so they are closing the majority of there nursing homes"
bad,"If there is a low census, the hospital will cut your hours by half if not completely.  If you do find a part time job to supplement these hours, it will be held against you and you will not be invited back.  If there is a job posted as full-time, it is disingenuous.  Great talent has been let go from this hospital and replaced with sub-par replacements.  Job turnover here is high due to these reasons and management is completely oblivious to it."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Most of the people who work there look down on dietary or housekeeping. My manager was always worried about her life outside of work. She acted like she was the only one who had a life outside of work.
bad,"There are select individuals who are very experienced and a joy to work with.  However, the facility is dirty and there are some employees who are embarrassingly unprofessional in front of patients and give very subpar care"
bad,Over 5 long term employees quit because of this one employee who was subsequently promoted to lab supervisor and then lab manager.   CEO encouraged her to tattle on fellow employees.
bad,The RN is given too many patients to safely take care of in this company. The patients are too sick for 6 patients per nurse. You run codes and most patients on trachs. Not supported by higher level nurses or managers. It was the worst job I ever had.
bad,"All they care about is keeping the beds filled. They don't care about treating their employees good or paying them what they are worth.no communications between management and employees.If you get hurt on the job,they treat you like you are a horrible person for getting hurt. If they treated their employees good,they wouldn't have such a high turn over."
bad,"Horrid experience. I worked there a year. My"
bad,"When I first started working here they didn’t have any benefits or any kind. So you were just working just to work & if you got hurt on the job that was on you because they didn’t have any PTO, sick days, no type of insurance, 401K or anything. & they fired me because I was pregnant & they didn’t have any FMLA or anything to offer."
bad,"Kindred is not the best hospital to work as an Phlebotomy."
bad,"This is the most unethical place that I have worked. Now owned by Curo Health Services, this company supports discrimination and unethical healthcare practices."
bad,You will have little opportunity to advance. Plus shady documentation standards. No productivity incentive but they require you to be productive. Awful
bad,"Worse healthcare company on the planet. Lazy nurses, gossipers, back-stabbers. Horrible management, liars, treat employees like dogs. Epitome of whats wrong with healthcare and never ever send a loved one there."
bad,"For the past eight months my life at Kindred has been A living shark.  No matter what I did, it never was enough nor was it right. It took over 6 months to get a PRN employee hired. I got to work with her for three days then I was let go. Sure, not everything was done according to the HIM national lady. (She can’t walk 10 feet without being out of breath). But I did the best that I could. On a 40 hour workweek, I was there over 50 hours. I came in on the weekends and left late all the time. Upper management thinks they do no wrong and we all know that is not correct. I made a call to corporate but who is investigating is an HR employee I. Tampa so it won’t go far and they will continue to hurt KHTPB. I loved working here. Before I was let go I had two offers already, which is great. I am now stress free."
bad,"Poor management with unrealistic expectations of systems that are humanly impossible to achieve, managers are unfair, pay is below average and benefits are poor"
bad,They only keep employees who are brown nosing. I myself quit because everyone was always trying to out do everyone else. When all we were there for was to take care of the residents.
bad,"Horrible management, inadequate schedules, no benefits worth anything! Slackers get praised, while hard workers are considered disposable. No time to complete CEUs.  Patients suffered from inadequate staffing and management did not seem to care!"
bad,"The place was terrible. Mismanaged, patient neglect, employees coming and going as they wanted during work hours, terrible housekeeping, out of date equipment."
bad,I've never hated a job so much until I worked here my spirits was up until I walked threw the door. Staff sleeping with one another gossip to much other employees from other departments tell you your job. They dont watch the patients I had to get one off the floor cause the CNA was watching TV. Very nasty hospital the EVS has been employed for years comfortable with no cleaning. When you do clean it's a problem. Old nasty vintage hospital I would take my DOG there. Do not work here or send your relatives there you will be disappointed.
bad,"I was still on orientation and was told my patient load was increasing from an already ridiculous 6 patients to up to 12.  When I expressed concern, they didn't appreciate it."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,I've been here many years as time goes on it has gotten worse  nurses are not getting up to standard alot of new nurses who need more experience at patient care
bad,One of the worst places of employment ever experienced.  Would not recommend for patient or anyone to work.  Simply a horrible place in general.  Managment the pits.
bad,"High stress, Low wages, Poor leadership, and nothing matters except the bottom line. If you're looking for a dead end job where they will gladly overwork you look no further."
bad,"Kindred is a facility that offers care, with care. The staff have a lot to do with limited amounts to do it with. More is needed. For the staff and the patients."
bad,"I would not recommend Kindred or Kin ""dead"". Poor facility, poor leadership. Do not be fooled by the fancy CCO title. It is all profit over patients. Several employees have left and are looking to leave the Indy North facility. I can't believe that Community would put their name on the building and let Kin ""dead"" operate the facility. Best of luck to anyone joining this organization!"
bad,there was poor management and no training... hired mostly new nurses with no experience... scary place to work. antiquated systems and old equipment.. you just had to make do..
bad,The pharmacy director is very rude! She screamed at me and caused me to loose my job. I'm not one to cry and complain about anything but she really is not a good person to work for at all
bad,"Horrible management.  LTACH is not considered ""real"" hospital experience by real hospitals.  Overworked RN's.  Dirty facilities.  Two patients per room.  Focus is on the $ and keeping patients for only 28 days to the mark."
bad,"Management is concerned with point of service documentation , TCR, productivity, and what CPT code you use , they have positions open for 5 months they can’t even fulfill with contractors . Very low pay , they pay women much less than men . The census fluctuates drastically , I would never work here the turn over is so high ask how many managers PTs OTs and SLPs were there and how long they stayed for before taking up any positions .nurses were great though"
bad,"The Team was good, but MGMT wsa financially driven ONLY! kept cutting staff and expected more. Was told I would never receive a raise. The patients we served was the BEST and ONLY part of the job that was great!"
bad,This place is horrible. They treat families and pt like garbage. bad place for a LCSW lots of ethical issues that you are not able to do anything about because admin would get paid (like shut them down)
bad,upper management is completely cut throat.  Everything they do is unprofessional.  Turnover is very high due to this.  They need to realize this and get rid of upper management.
bad,"Executive managers use intimidation and threats to ""manage"" staff. Have little regard for safety of employees. Have little regard for patients. Horrible work environment."
bad,"Kindred Mishawaka do not give you your hrs in a work week. If patient ratio drop you'll be budgeted which means you don't work which means you do not work. Unfair Manager, was very arrogant and will not help his employees, will call you to have you come pick a piece of paper up that he's standing next to. Very hot in the summer and working around a lot of extremely sick people with infection."
bad,"Rehabcare is the worst as far a unethical business practices, a cut throat environment, and I have warned many young therapists to avoid working for this company."
bad,"A typical night shift includes, rounding on patients while doing vitals and blood sugars. Turning our patient  every two hours, bathing, and safety precautions."
bad,"Management was not there at all, I worked 7 days a week 2am -6am and sometimes there would be only 2 ots to draw and I'd work a hr and no other labs are ordered so h had to go home, so didn't get full pt hours, I had no relief, I was the only phlebotomist and lab techs and supervisor would not relieve me for a day off. I worked 4 months straight and finally demanded and took a week off and then went back and put my 2 WK notice in. They relieved me of course before the 2 weeks."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,The company headquarters is in kentucky and they have offices all over the united states and every office does something different. nothing is organized
bad,"Rehabcare pays their female employees less than their male employees."
bad,I didn't like working here because the boss was terrible. my coworkers didn't like it here. no one liked it here. the patients didn't like it here. yep.
bad,"I have been with Kindred Wayne for quite a few years and the last two have been a exceptionally positive experience.  We finally had a CCO that brought us together and we succeeded.  Now he is gone and we all expect a decline in all areas,  I for one will not be staying.  Do not apply for any positions, high turnover rate in all departments.  You will be working with more agency personnel than staff."
bad,Closed LTC units and now strictly hospital and hospice care. They  don't  spend money on employees to keep them satisfied and happy. They were a fortune 500 company when I first started
bad,I enjoyed this job as far as working for and helping people that couldn’t help themselves however the nurses in charge were very rude and out of line when dealing with staff
bad,"Stressfull environment, patient to nurse ratio, overwhelming, no consistant direct leadership, no open door policy, conflicting work with responsibilies"
bad,The management is horrible no guidance. Work load was okay but never any help. Staff was rude and not team players. I would never work here ever again
bad,"I’m a Rehab tech & every week they adding all these new jobs for me to do + housekeeping but don’t wanna give you a pay increase , I can’t even afford to get there insurance cuz I don’t make enough, but I would never ever recommend anyone to work for them , all the different jobs they went Rehab Tech to do plus Administrative work + housekeeping we should st lease be making $14 or more, I won’t be working for them for long , don’t even give out yearly raises it’s sad"
bad,It started off very well a kindred January 2015 it was a great place to work every one help each other team work with no problem asking management was great no problem had a wonderful thanksgiving giving out turkeys Christmas party was off the hook every one came an enjoyed there self an then it all hit first we lost one of the best management we had mantelin an after that it went down hill but I stayed for a while because I loved my patients but could only take so much with the changes
bad,The worse place I have ever worked.  Poor management. Immature and catty nursing staff. Extreme high turnover rate.  Nursing staff are treated unfairly and like dogs.  They force you to take weeks off when the census is low and use your own personal time.  There are multiple Kindreds in different states and not one of them are on the same page.  They don't even follow and or know about their own policies.  The northeast Phila Division is known as the GETTO Branch.
bad,"Poor place to work. Life/family/work balance is out of the question. "
bad,"not reliable , would not recommend to work there , pay wise is a fair place , poor management and favoritism, lac of professionalism from supervisor and nursing department"
bad,"Extremely poor management. Low moral, more worried about how much they profit than the care of their patients. CNO was biased and there was a lot of favoritism."
bad,"Horrible place to work!  The Director of therapy isn’t even a therapist, but depending on who you’ve asked he’s told people he is. Very shady place to work.  Abuse aides as therapists."
bad,"There's a reason Kindred sold all their LTACHs in Ohio.  I wouldn't want anyone I loved to be a patient there.  The staffing was always short, patients would be sitting in soiled beds for hours, nearly every patient was in isolation for C-diff, central line and urinary catheter infections were rampant...  We watched all the upper management leave, broken equipment stopped being repaired/replaced, then they sold to Select."
bad,"poor environment to work in, cheap, and very poor management, other employees are very nice, not much room for advancement, constantly being undermined by the CEO and Medical Director"
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Cannot offer positive commentary. Limitations in healthcare mandates and legislation limit ability for the Long Term Acute Care Hospital entity to thrive or exist in the future. Refusal to adapt or advance in the midst of a fiercely competitive environment
bad,"A very difficult place to work, you are told to contact multiple different people if you have question and these people do not talk to each other. Poorly ran and management doesn't talk to each other."
bad,Awful comany. Cenus is low so prepare for them to cut your hours and use your sick time to compensate. Gave me wrong interview day. Sends letters to my residence with the wrong first name. If you are a per diem employee make sure they actually pay you the per diem rate. If you are per diem they only pay you for 3 major holidays the rest is regular pay. They have forgot to pay me before. Kindred makes ALOT of mistakes. Out of all my nursing conpanys i worked for in the past they are the cheapest most unproffessional. They have no HR in house so you have to call a hotline for any sort of help in which they can never really help you and waiting can take hours for the hotline and days/weeks before you can actually talk to someone about the issue or be resolved.
bad,"Over worked and under paid! unless you are a part of ""their clan"" and or a friend of theirs you will be treated like a piece of c#@p! Their is absolutely NO privacy, confidentiality, respected policies, etc., I can go on forever................"
bad,"Very understaffed, very disorganized, uneducated management.  Very disappointing for employees and for patients.  Terrible pay, constant call offs, lack of coverage."
bad,Working at Kindred was a complete nightmare. The hospital was in bad condition. There was so many blackouts and a back up generator that sometimes didn't work. I still suffer from emotional trauma when I see lights flicker. The staff loves to gossip and team up against you if you don't fit in any of their groups. It's funny how they have the nerve to complain/report you and they are far from professional themselves. Quiet honestly they aren't very knowledgeable about healthcare. The life expectancy of patients admitted there was very low. Most of the patients didn't make it out alive. The staff was ridiculous. It seems like they lack structure. I was poorly trained and treated unfairly. I had a hard time taking that place and management seriously. I was ashamed to say that I've worked there and regretful that I wasted my time working at that crazy hospital.
bad,This is not a good place to work or send your family member. Unfair work enviornment. Over worked and under paid. Have to work harder than average to make ends meat.
bad,I work here off and on for years the lose a lot employer because they barley have clients for you to go to they are vary rude to people if need extra money you like it but your checks won't be that much
bad,"Poorly paid! Constant call outs from staff, unable to keep staff because of the horrible drama.  Poor training and upper management doesn't care or believe the staffing issues.  No one helps each other and holes are left in the schedule because no one wants to pick up any extra due to the fear of being mandated to stay over past their scheduled shift.  Due to all the chaos of the staff the patients are neglected.  You have been warned!"
bad,I fell in love with my residents and had a hard time leaving because I didn't know what kind of care they would be getting. you are always short staffed and the higher puts could not care less
bad,A typical day at work would be come in at six in the morning and check the diet changes. Then start to prep the patients snacks and desserts for lunch. Go grab any dirty dishes left from the night before and try to bust some of them down. Then run to the line by a certain time to get the food out by 8:00 a.m.
bad,"do not work there, no money for good nurses and no room for advancement. managers only care about them self and no respect for employees, they use you and throw you away"
bad,"They are under staffed and over stressed the employees. This place is nothing more than modern day slavery. Within the first year there 3 social workers, 2 case managers, 2 director of nursing, 2 staff development coordinators and 5 executive directors. That alone should tell you something is wrong with the company and not the staff. Employees are forced into positions they did not apply for and when the job is not being done properly, employees are written up. How could you even pick up a pen and write someone up for a job in which he/she didn't apply for. The moral is so low management can't see the difference between burned out employees and customer service issues. Cooperate is the worst ever. Think twice before coming to work at Kindred, trust me you will be sorry!"
bad,"Such a toxic environment, upper management Executive Director gets drunk on company time.  Leaves early and never does anything.  This is her moto the company president does not care what i do as long as the numbers are good.  All she tralks about is greating drunk.  Whole office is in chaos because this lady is running it.  Thus is the 4th ED since i have been here, worst one yet area director doesn't do anything  after multiple complaints, both managers left.  Time for me to go soon too."
bad,Office is in total turmoil. Management needs to be replaced. They have made some huge mistakes letting certain people walk out the door. Upper management needs to investigate. I worry everyday I am here. Things need correcting. HELP!!  Corporate please.
bad,I do not recommend working here. I was not treated fairly as a CNA and would not like to see anyone else mistreated here. No benefits to being PerDiem and no appreciation
bad,I worked for this company for about 2 years and at the beginning it was okay but eventually they wanted me to do some things that was almost illegal to keep my productivity around 90% which is ridiculous.
bad,"horrible healthcare hospital. hard work, no encouragement from management. patients are difficult, poor teamwork, poor management, big turnover sfaff."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,They dont take care of their employees. In the long run they hurt their employees and show no remorse. They just dont care. If your a robot with no feelings you'll fit in just fine.
bad,Poor Management and work ethics - all about the money and not patient care. More than 10 employees have resigned and no see the manager as being the problem. The business as a whole is suffering financially.
bad,high turn over low patients staff gossips alot  would not have anybody i know work there no overtime nurses are overwhelmed but it is 12hr shift if you like those
bad,"Its bad enough to have a stressful job but when your manager is verbally abusive, throws you under the bus and micromanages everything down to where, when and how you chart the job bcomes a nightmare,  The workload was crazy, most people who were ordered treatments did not need them and weaning fragile patients was not in their best interests, but in the interest of making the manager look good.  Every day, when the manager hits the floor the RT's trembled because she would harrass us and then treat the other disciplines well.  If she was angry with you, she would not schedule shifts or you would be cancelled.  I do not recommend anyone working in this facility, its a lawsuit waiting to happen.  YOur mental health and wellbeing are jeopardized the minute you walk in the door."
bad,"in worked at this place before kindred healthcare took over, back then it was great. when kindred came in it went totally down hill. fulltime used to get 80 hr  biweekly now you only get 75hrs biweekly. the turnover rate is very high at this place when I was there we went through 3 directors, 3 asst directors, 4 Directors of nursing, a boat load of unit managers. we constantly work short staffed to were it was 16 patients to 1 stna. I worked at the place for 10 years and had to say enough was enough."
bad,the staff here is over worked and severely underpaid. the workload is outrageous. the staff is treated poorly by the the higher ups.
bad,"Beware!! Management doesn't have a clue about anything! They are good to the bad employees and vise versa. If they target you they will use unrealistic reasons to get you in trouble and they break policy and procedure but that's their complaint but they break it constantly. They are unethical, very unrealistic goals, terrible charting, pick on people and change the rules daily and depending on who you are the rules may or may not apply to you."
bad,Typical day would be scared to come to work. because you dont know if you will be working by yourself. They have the worst communication .When it comes to what should be done. payroll and scheduling never know nothing when it comes time to be paid. No one is held  accountable for they say or do. My co-workers are ok and helpful when you can find somebody. The hardest part of my job is knowing that management don't care about the employees and that my check is never right. The most enjoyable thing would be going home.
bad,They changed management 3 times when I was there. Used to have 26 people by myself at a time. Always told that this wasn't right and did this wrong. A lot of broken machines. Food horrible and rooms to small for patients.
bad,"I started out loving my job, coworkers, leadership.  Over the years, the company was poorly managed.  Company grew too big, and did not have any idea what was going on at all levels. Kindred was only about making money for the shareholders.  All the hospitals were poorly staffed and maintained. "
bad,Managers do not want happy patients or employees. They pretend to care but everyone knows better. Management sets out to hurt employees they don't like and employees have no recourse.
bad,"Poor management, constantly harassed. HR did nothing to resolve my complaints of harassment, and sexually harassment. I quit after 6 months. Patients falling out of bed, call bells going off staff sleeping. Never will I ever work there again or refer people there."
bad,"The company overall is not bad, but the director at the Temple office is so incompetent that it ruins the experience. Director delegates all work out due to not knowing her job and this in turn exhausts employees and is the reason for the recent spike in turnover.  Stay away."
bad,"American Home Care in St. Louis is bad business. The branch is positioned to do well, but the general leadership DNA of American Home Care lacks the genetics of success. Sheeple need only apply."
bad,"Lack of support from management, no compassion. No retention program for employees. CEO does not know her employees, has not visited on the night shift, does not understand the employees job roles. Census has  continuously dropped. Broken promises, need I go on!!"
bad,"Kindred took over Rehab Care. Currently they are purposefully pushing out senior level therapists to hire cheaper therapists to be their slaves.  Some employees are being forced to increase their hours or be let go.  There are no benefits for part time employees.  There is no respect for employee ideas.  An overly socialized company with only the top management receiving bonuses for therapists hard work.  No raises ever given, no advancement, pay cuts are given for switching jobs within 30 miles ."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"I worked for the facility for a short period of time. In that time management hired multiple people for one position and within less than 45 days they decided they were not cutting it in the position. The worst part they hired people with no experience and they trained for several weeks so actually they were on there on for really 2 weeks, so how could they catch on when management really did give them the opportunity. So the options are positions that they did not want and all the employees were only there for less than 90 days. As a new employee I did not feel welcomed, I felt like I was intruding in there playground and felt like it each day. I felt uncomfortable and was constantly walking on eggshells because I was wondering if I was next. Be careful it's another person opinion if your not working and you could be demoted especially if they did not like your personality."
bad,"Terrible place to work, no one wanted to help out or answer questions. Everyone was quick to throw people under the bus. Rude."
bad,A typical day at work is answering vent alarms  patient alarms the management seems to allow others to come in late never follow policy and procedure they let the people they like get away with a lot of things and give them no repercussion or consequences the most enjoyable part is my chance to make a patient smile or due my best to make them feel better.
bad,Very sick sometimes dying when the patients are wheeled in the door. Especially nursing staff ALWAYS SHORT. Administration knows about the shortage and can't get any new nurses and when they do they quit after a few days. I've been a nurse for a long time and I have never seen a place this bad to work for. The nurses are poorly paid and not appreciated for there work. CNA's are poorly paid and not appreciated. There is nothing good I can say about this place. Kindred admits ALOT of drug addicted patients who come here for pain medication because they can't get their high from drugs and they give them all kinds of pain medications. It's really sad because the patients that come in who really need medical attention are not getting it. You feel helpless as a nurse because you take an oath to take care of your patients. If there is any possible way you can take your loved one to another hospital please do.
bad,Benefits on good. Over work staff and don't care about staff and patients. Pay not good. Staff does not work well together
bad,"No Comment. Let my silence speak the loudest. If you have to pay your bills, know that is what it is and continue to look for something better."
bad,Every responsibility lies on the admissions coordinator although it should not. They want you to stay after most days and work but you get in trouble if you go into overtime. They do no respect you in anyway shape or form and are always putting you down. The absolute worst company I have every worked for!
bad,I am very thankful they gave me my nursing start. very poor job culture. no true leadership. no compensation. nursing is the lowest paid in Cleveland. the upside is you will see alot of different things will add to nursing expierence.
bad,They were unorignazed people do whatever they want to do the other aides played to many games and management did nothing about it
bad,"This was hands down the worst employer I've ever had, if I was able to give zero stars I would. The facility was severely short staffed, I felt as if my license was at risk on a daily basis. Management was not supportive at all and did not seem to be concerned with how badly staffed it was. We had more and more work dumped on us due to staff leaving in droves. All but one wound care nurse was left and she only worked part time and all of the special procedures nurses left."
bad,"always short of staff ,over worked employees .salary very low no matching 401 k.cant call insick. vey dangerous place to work.employees are all Filipino and mostly family related working together.all new graduate staff very dangerous."
bad,"Micro managed and overworked. Heavy Heavy patients. Do not plan on moving up in this company.. UNLESS you give blood to the wrong patient, or overdose a patient and almost kill them.  The patients are getting heavier and the assignment is always overloaded. Supervisors are rude. Horrible place to work. Run do not walk away from here run for your life and license!"
bad,"Typical day consist of having 5 to 6 patients. Excessive amounts of redundant paper charting. Med pass. Constant badgering of family calling at all times demanding updates which interferes with your care because  you're on the phone for a large amount of time. The way unit is designed,  you're constantly  moving beds to receive patients. We work 12 hours shifts but still not enough time to complete work. Reprimanded if you stay pass your time by management and staffing coordinator constantly questioning why we're late getting out. Short staffing. Lots of callouts. "
bad,"They hire full time employees and then they cut hours down to nothing, the nurses were jaded from the positions they held and left all the work to the nurse aides.  When asked for help it was hard to find any help from a good portion of the employees."
bad,"I have been a nurse close to 30 years and this company is another  example of why retirement looks so good. I will agree with the many, many previous RN comments/statements. We go through multiple hoops, licensing, credentialling, and certifications along with a plethera of titles behind our names to practice even not so simple bed-side nursing. We work an average of 16 hour shifts with the least amount of resources for inflationary wages. All this to be cheated out of much needed energizing breaks and lunches which is usually 75-90% of the time on any nursing job."
bad,"My experience, I was there for one year without a proper orientation, no support from management , short staffing, horrible working environment, everyone was stressed out, and over worked."
bad,"Terrible leaders and dishonesty all over the place. You walk in on a typical day and never know who will be there or who will not. Turnover rate is huge. Leaders are angry people who are full of fake smiles and lies.  The pay is the worst in the industry.  Co-workers are sad and unhappy,  nobody is happy to come into work."
bad,Kindred Hospital was the worst experience of my career. I worked on the third floor and the DON was awful. The patients are too sick to be there and should be in an actual hospital. The respiratory staff had some that were there for way too long and didn't care about the patients anymore. I felt like my license was constantly on the line every day that I accepted an assignment.
bad,I left because the Manager wanted me to take patients while be the hospital Supervisor.  I didn't want to put my RN license in jepordy.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"They are harassing. They tell you they always look to promote within, they don't. They judge you on your appearance whether you're thin, big, black, white. "
bad,"I thought when I was first hired here that this facility would be nice, I was wrong. We were always very short staffed, the nurses would never help you when you needed assistance, the management was mean and were not helpful at all. Some of my coworkers would help me when needed but most wouldn't. We had at least 15 to 20 patients a night, which was way more than we could handle, making it very hard to accommodate every resident that needed our attention. I made a lot of complaints about neglect and abuse that patients were telling me and the facility did nothing about it. They would never let you call out, even if it was an emergency. I had a really bad kidney infection and had a note from my doctor stating that I could not work and when I told them of this, they said if I didn't come in they would fire me. I immediately decided to quit and that it wasn't worth my time or suffering. Think twice before you consider working here. It was, in my opinion, the worst facility I have ever worked for and probably the worst job I have ever had."
bad,Management is terrible at this company. Expensive medical benefits and very poor training and lack of department leadership.
bad,"Co-workers are very dedicated and hard working. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with residents and co-workers."
bad,"I am an admistrator at Kindred hosspital in wayne NJ. All I need to say is that this is the most poorly managed facility I have ever been apart of. It's abysmal how they treat the staff as well as the patients, stay away from this company at all costs! Absolute nightmare of a hospital!"
bad,"Understaffed, low pay, incompetent management   You can lose your liscense here with the amount of work you are given.  It's not possible to do it in the amount of time you are there.  Do not come here !!!!!!"
bad,The insurance and benefits were not good. The management would make cuts to your department and provide you with no help but you are expected to do all the work. I hate to be so negative but when you have to cover two facilities with two people counting the supervisor. It's very hard if someone is sick or someone would like a day off or covering vacation.
bad,"As a Clinical Liaison you are truly treated as a child.  One would think you are a professional with the proper business acumen.  Just be warned this territory (Dover, NJ) management is all about micro managing because they have nothing else to do...instead of worrying about giving their employees incentives to achieve their goals, they turn you off and you hate the job...horrible management team!"
bad,"Do not expect to be acknowledged by the praise you get from your patients or the facility staff.  Administration will find it threatening and you will be out the door. The Clinical Managers have no training in how to build a team or manage people. They do not have their BSNs and do not know how to lead.   If something goes wrong you will be hung out to dry.  This company is all about the money.  The contracts they have the families sign are not held up.  Don't even mention crisis care, it does not exist in the Dayton office.  There are no evaluations, no raises and the PTO is a joke.  The mileage reimbursement is down to 40 cents a mile when the government standards are 55 cents a mile.  You can file for reimbursed in your taxes.  "
bad,Drastic changes once bought out.  No longer about patient care. No job security or room for advancement. Management very unprofessional. Not an equal opportunity employer.
bad,"Before I cam to kindred worked in a skilled and regular nursing facility. Kindred is not a hospital but a longtern acute care nursing home. There is no room for advancement here if you are trying to move up. The managament sis rude and does not care about your back when you have to take care of a 600 + patient. I stayed at this facility for too long met great people, but the end result for this facility is drying the pt out of their money and sweeping ALOT of things under the rug. DO NOT EXPECT A RAISE"
bad,"Don't let your talent show! When your co-workers and supervisors notice they will do everything they can to get you fired, Even though every single one of  your patients loves you and makes positive comments about you to supervisors."
bad,"This place is understaffed "
bad,"This company closed the office in our city and did not help to relocate the employees. While working with this company they tried to keep the atmosphere happy while we were closing. "
bad,"The floor staff is great! But the company has poor benefits, no raises worth anything, like maybe .17 cents per hour. Head nurse may give you a difficult time. She has questionable behavior towards doing things correctly. Also some staff get away with stuff (and aren't talked to) a lot has to do with the care of residents. It's amazing how dedicated most of the staff is. They really care and take good care of the residents. But most residents are unhappy with some of the nurses, and management. The director will be nice to your face and turn around and stab you in the back. Like I said most CRMA's,CNA's, and PSS's some nurses are great. Beware of management and the company Kindred!"
bad,this facility is owned by a new company now. Assignments were very heavy and consisted of 13 or 14 residents daily. The staff never wanted to work as a team either.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"*       Perform general cleaning assignments in residential rooms, hallways and common areas"
bad,"indignant, disrespectful and incompetent leadership. be very careful that you know your licensure/ethical guidelines, because they will not have your back if you follow what they do or tell you to do.  it is not all about having a job.   therapists put false times in and are pushed to get all time in, even if inappropriate.  no feedback accepted.  they do not go  by their word, so have everything in writing.  if you get hurt there,  they will not have your back either and try to cover it up. get a lawyer right away."
bad,I didn't like being there a as a student. the staff was rude and very dirty! Some was nice but others was not. the were not happy to show you anything. Management wasn't nice to us wither. I never felt welcome there
bad,"hard work, little supervision and training. If you can survive at Baypointe more than 90 days... you are an outstanding nurse. Good job!"
bad,"You first start out in orientation, which is about 4 weeks, then you are out on your own.  Hourly rate was good to have at that time, at least you are making money at that point.  Then you are switched to the per visit rate, which varies, depending on the type of visit it is: admission, discharge, recertification, resumption of care.  Also, I was hired as a full-time Psych Nurse, but mostly received Med-Surg patients; you get paid more for psych visits than medical ones.  Was not told by management that this would be the case, and when it was brought to their attention, they corrected me that I HAD to do both.  If you have a gas guzzling vehicle, forget about applying, as they only compensate $0.40 per mile, based on the companies assessment of your mileage and not actual mileage. Also, the amount of work involved is WORSE that hospital documentation standards and you work WAY past your shift trying to complete the massive amounts of data required to collected on ALL visits.  Poorly organized from the top to the bottom, but staff is friendly, at times.  If you can work for this company, consider case management, as it is part of the job, whether you have experience in it or not."
bad,Unprofessional rude New CNO is a very arrogant person. DO NOT HIRE WITH THIS COMPANY THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU
bad,The staff were cruel. The pay was horrible. The management needs to be nicer.
bad,Work load is too much!!!!! I was a temp. and was treat horribly by the RN. Never ever would go to work for this place.
bad,"Management is horrible!!! Managers will look down on you and white you up for no reason. Most of management will not try to help you. They basically look down on you and try to get you fired."
bad,"no union, "
bad,Taking care of very sick patients is rewarding but the politics of a for profit business makes it hard to enjoy your work.  Most of management has no empathy and when there is a good manager they leave.  Hard to make a point.  They don't really listen.
bad,"This place offers horrific care to patients with the lowest standards I've ever seen."
bad,In my opinion I do not like working here and neither does the majority of the African American staff. We have all came across racism in this place from the nurses and unfair treatment from management. Its awful when you aren't able to come to work on a peaceful note without being harassed and the environment made hostile for you.
bad,This place is always short staffed. Nurses and CNAs.  Theres no team work.  Also the person doing the stock for the building wasnt doing their job.  There was never any wipes to clean people with so employees hid the ones they found so they would have some for their shift.  On the linen cart they only give us 13 wash clothes and towels and theres 2 carts on each floor and theres about 50 people on the floor. Also employees had to hide the bags that go in the garbage tins in the patient rooms because the housekeeping manager was stingy with the bags and their was never any available when we needed them
bad,"There should be no such entitiy as a for-profit hospital, like kindred."
bad,"This company treats you like meat."
bad,"Very disorganized, finances were not correct for a short amount of time."
bad,"Terrible place to work. You spend your days working with pts. at ultra RUG levels who are not able to comprehend your instructions. Extremely high productivity expectations, no appreciation from supervisor, lack of resources, no 90 day new hire review, lack of collaboration among therapists. minimal training. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home at the end of the day."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Absolutely the worse management team.  Unprofessional.  Demeaning.  Negative.  Would not recommend to my worst enemy.
bad,"horrible, staff helps no one going home was the bast part of the day"
bad,Management is just awful. They have zero respect for their employees and are only concerned with numbers. They have unrealistic productivity expectations. They grind you down and make you feel awful and then they get down on you for feeling bad and hating your job. They never offer praise or recognition. They don't give raises or purchase new equipment for their facilities. The facility I am at is dirty with unsafe equipment. They talk down to you and are blatantly disrespectful.
bad,Horrible place to work with NO job security....you have now been warned.
bad,"Atlanta, GA: management does not follow through on items they stated they would do. job atmosphere is ""that is not my job"" and lots of finger pointing. not a team atmosphere. nursing staff extremely overworked with 8+ patients/nurse. Do not work here.  You will not be happy."
bad,"Present management,i.e, executive director, DON, etc., do not support staff. No pay raise despite evaluations,states it is not in the budge for past several years. Some very good nurses and CNA's, however are forced to work short staffed due ""to budget""."
bad,How many hospitals do you know of that have air fresheners because of a mold problem? I wish clinicians could be in charge. If you want to get thrown under the bus then this is the place for you. 12-14 patients at a time. All about the bottom line...
bad,Many have resigned due to the racial comments by the director. We have also determined that the 14 per hour for the duties should in fact be 24 per hour.  This is why we have gone elsewhere.
bad,The worst employer I have uncounted in my career. Poor management.
bad,"A company driven to eliminate every form of employee benefits to maximize the bottom line. They even went so far as to eliminate the annual turkeys they gave to every employee during the holidays. The company also put a freeze on ANY cost of living increases during annual reviews of employees, and then posted their highest earning quarter ever."
bad,"Accounting Firm,Hedge Fund,WallSt,BNYMELLON,"
bad,"I feel passionately about caring for people. I feel most comfortable among people I'm familiar with. I take the time to develop meaningful relationships. That is the reason I have worked at the same facility for  twenty seven years. It's unfortunate that Kindred is my employer. They boast about being a great investment.They have found a way to take what little money the states pay for patient care and put money into the pockets of wealthy investors. The same company (Vencor) that went under for being financially and morally bankrupt renamed itself and claims to be an industry leader. Administrators are financially rewarded for meeting budgets. I currently have an ED who is willing to sacrifice the reputation of the facility and the well being of  it's staff for her own benefit. I contacted HR about concerns about staffing levels and found myself suspended twice within weeks. The best way to get attention is to find fault in others. The workplace is toxic. Nurses and CNA's who are nurturing by nature have to endure unfair criticism while still improving the lives of others. It's not uncommon to see staff crying. Until our country realizes that needy people are not commodities to make a profit from, companies like Kindred will exist. Benefits disappear regularly as corporate greed gets the better of the deal. Caring and dedicated people will always exist, unfortunately companies like Kindred will attach themselves like leeches."
bad,"management is brutally forceful with its employees. They want to force you to work days that you are not available to work. In addition to this, they show favoritism towards other nurses, without any regard to others that are onlookers. This hospital is in a HIGH crime area, to fact that cars are broken into during the day time. There is no security, from law enforcement. They have a security guard on the premises,  but he is 90 years old. My co-workers were great, in addition to helpful and fun to be around off the clock, as well. The hardest part of the job is the disrespectful managers and CEO, CNO. The most enjoyable part of this job, is to have a great shift, and have a bunch of great co-workers,"
bad,This facility is for rehab and should be run as such. There is a lot of favoriteism though denied. There also is no real job security for nurses that have been working for them for a long period of time. The management also doesn't support their staff when they are right which to me causes unsafe practices.
bad,"This company is mostly smoke and mirrors, There are double standards as well as other issues that need to be addressed."
bad,high turn over rates are indicative of the for profit practice model. Caring for extremely sick patients can be tedious but unsafe nurse to patient ratios are the norm.  Nurse are not encouraged to pursue higher education or to implement evidence base nursing practice at the bedside.  Leadership has also a very high turnover which could be the root of the problem.

bad,"Early August I interviewed at the Los Angeles location the next day I received a call with a job offer and several instructions to complete the hiring process which I did over the following few weeks as I was to start on September 3, 2013. I was instructed to get an mmr vaccine which cost me $100.00 and made me very ill, and to pay for an ACLS course another $160.00 out-of-pocket. So September comes around I show up for general orientation at 8:00 am at about 11:30 am HR interrupt my orientation to ask have I ever worked at this location before I said I applied in 2001 and did the paperwork and videos and subsequently declined the job as another offer came alone, long story short I never worked on the floor with their patients or staff never was placed on the schedule, they said they had proof that I was there 3 months and was paid and terminated for poor performance I informed them that I never worked only applied here they said ok let me check this out further and we'll get back to you."
bad,"I loved my residents. The management had unrealistic expectations, we were chronically short staffed, and I was taking care of as many as 53 people on nights. Very unsafe. Falls, wounds, behaviors, dementia and so much paperwork it was overwhelming. Management writes the staff up for anything. No matter how hard you work it is never enough. Some nurses left when they felt their licenses were at risk. Some when they were told they were too flat, not excited, etc. No safe way to take breaks as the floor was left uncovered. I had never seen anything like it."
bad,"Management is terrible. Area manager in STL is terrible. Constantly being lied to by HR, managers and staff! They do NOT care about any of the employees and only care about the shareholders! They have a lot of contracts in STL and therefore ruin it for most therapists seeking employment. They also reward lazy non workers including techs and yell/gripe at hard working therapists. They also take away hours wages, PTO time, and benefits are insanely worse. You pay more now for insurance and are responsible for 100% of cost until you reach your deductible. They don't give merit wages, rewards, or tell you anything positive, and treat you like dirt. They don't return phone calls. They do NOT like employees who challenge their lies or speak up for the employees. They only want quiet zombies to shut up and be 90% productive at any cost. "
bad,"The management staff is overpaid and does nothing to help their therapists. They only look out for themselves and you don't feel like anyone has your back. You learn everything on your own, there is no orientation to buildings, documentation, computer system, you learn it ALL on your own. I wouldn't recommend working there at all. "
bad,"Poor administration, poor management. They continuously understaff and then when things don't get done they threaten peoples licenses. Terrible benefits and no raises. I am currently seeking other employment."
bad,"Poor management team, does not manage staff in a diplomatic manner. Also does not show any staff appreciation. "
bad,"I dont know who is writing these reviews, but if you work in the houston area kindreds they are horrible. They dont have enough staff you may get up to 8-9 patients who have alot of chronic illness, they are either total care or pain management. It is truly dangerous!!!"
bad,Its not a good place to work or a safe place for pts. They have a new CCO who exposes herself with tight dresses who has no management skills and who got the job bc she knows people. There are so many terrible things that happen at kindred bc the people who work there are incompetent...unsafe for everyone.
bad,"Kindred is a terrible company to work for, they have zero respect for their employees, benefits are awful, insurance is very high and terrible coverage. The turnover rate is outrageous, the worst of any healthcare facility I've ever worked for.  Nobody wanted to stay for very long, some didn't even last a day. The admin. staff are rude and disrespectful , don't do anything but smoke and gossip all day while nurses on the floor are so overworked you can't even take your lunch. I never learned anything new here, I actually begged for new courses, promised I would get new training but it never happened. There was nothing good about this job and I really mean nothing. The hardest part was the work load and lack of staff. I would starve in the streets before I worked for them again. They have frozen raises for 3 years with no sign of them lifting the freeze. They just don't care...about residents or employes."
bad,"The night shift supervisor hated me at the onset.  Nothing I could do would please him.  He is Gay and I am not.  Gave me 3 times the patient load leaving others with nothing to do.  Management is a bunch of back stabbing jerks.  There was nothing enjoyable part of the job.  I had worked at other Kindred Hospitals in Chicago, but the Sycamore Hospital really sucked."
bad,This place is beyond getting help the dug themselves so far in the ground it's not funny. The treat their employees like dirt the say we will work with you while you go to school or have another job the just make you work more over I feel so sorry for the residents there not enough staff to take care of them and they need to get a new director of nursing 
bad,"Patient loads could be anywhere from six to nine patients for the nurses and seven to ten patients for the CNAs.  Administration had numerous turnovers in the time that I was there.  If you go to work to take care of your patients and not to socialize and gossip, you are cast out and the cliques will spend numerous hours complaining to the nurse manager, CCO and CEO about you.  You are expected to read the CNAs minds and drop everything when they want help.  The CNAs can scream and yell at the nurses, but when the nurses try to teach the CNAs something the nurse is reported to the above administrative staff by the CNAs and reprimanded.  Administration plays favorites to the point where people were coming into work high and nothing was done.  The good workers either left or were fired.  Cameras were placed on our building for ""security"", but in reality it was to identify smokers.  The backstabbing and constant fight to try to get the best care for the patients caused so much stress that there were times when various nurses would break down in tears.  The work load was unreal.  In the special care unit one nurse was expected to take care of four to five acutely ill patients on various vasopressor drips by herself and if she was lucky, she had a CNA to assist/hinder her.  Orientation was a joke.  My preceptor was so vague I had to basically teach myself the computer charting and find my way around.  Sexually conversations were a norm, from the CCO on down to the CNAs.  CNAs were lazy and expected the nurses to answer all the call lights, even when the nurses had nine patients and"
bad,"If I had the ability I would have scored the overall rating a BIG FAT ZERO, which starts with a worthless management."
bad,"There are a few great coworkers that do their best but there's some employees leave residents a mess. Management is a joke, some truly care about residents while others don't care. Scheduling is absolutely horrible, we work short 75% of the time and on our days off we get harassed non stop to come in and work (filling in holes). We get patients (normally on the same hall) that are physically abusive toward staff and we can't perform care on them properly. Some nurses will help the aides (which is fantastic) then there are some who will sit at the desk the entire time except for med pass."
bad,"I been at this facility for 12 years and kindred occupied it for the past 8 years . Since kindred took over its the worst it's ever been . Constantly working short of staff. They cut hours , raises froze for 3 years or more."
bad,"Do not apply! Management noncommunicable, inconsistencies. Very scary place to work. Poor management, scheduling, no staff, long term management and some staff drug diversion, several staff using drugs and selling, no staff team work, several take staff take many long breaks, little work done by some management and several staff, continuous patient neglect, dirty, minimal employee benefits...and more."

bad,"The management is horrible, the background of some of the employes is questionable, poor/ outdated equipment."
bad,"Nice facility, food is good. Coworkers are good. The manager not trust worthy. So if you can come to work and not have any expectations of the director and do your job, collect your paycheck and go home, you'll be good to go."
bad,"Very Abusive Staff, When patients needed help they did slowest time on call- lights, patient not getting cleaned up alot of MRSA outbraeaks blood and bodly fluids not being cleaned up sterle"
bad,Management is top heavy. They lie to your face. I worked the green bay one and never have i been treated so horribly in all my nursing career. Always short staff. On medicare unit you would be the nurse and cna all in one it wasnt fair to the residents
bad,"This facility was grossly understaffed and underpaid. The facility looks beautiful on the outside, but the residents do not receive the care they deserve. Profit is the bottom line, not the employees, not the residents."
bad,Im PRN the pay is good. Some of my co-wokers are very helpful. Productive enviroment for undergrads to learn.
bad,"this place has no team work ,poor raise, poor,benfiets,the employers that does all the work gets no credit,"
bad,"A typical day at work was terrible. People calling in at the beginning of shift, but I didn't blame them. Some of the RN's were pleasant, while others were not. I had to do my job, as well as theirs because either they did not want to be bothered with the patient or touch the patient's blood or feces. I enjoyed making sure the patients were comfortable and cared for. The benefits were horrible because the employee had to pay for the total package,considering I worked double shifts, over time, and covered vacations/shifts, and care for 20-30 patients per shift; plus, you have to wait about 2 years before you receive PTO and holiday pay. The most important lesson learned was Kindred does not recognize the CNAs. There is no job stability, or work/life balance and management was never there to run the facility. I wish I had known about this facility before I ever applied."
bad,"Stay away from this place!!! They only care about making money off residents but do not care about the residents. Cockroaches, gnats and fleas everywhere. State has been called but they refuse to do anything. Corporate sent out a survery and we all filled it out but still no changes will be made."
bad,I would not recommend this joke of a company to anyone. I have never in my life seen such an unprofessional company. The rehab manager is rude and does not know how to do her job. I got a PRN job through this company at kindred in Newburgh and was fired before starting treating after my orientation over an incomplete I9 form to then be told they made a mistake and I was actually still employed to only find out 2 weeks later after not receiving any calls for my schedule to be told I was actually fired again! Them the rehab manager tried to tell me she had made the decision not to pay me for my orientation! I reported her actions to corporate which was a joke as well cause it took me 2 months and hundreds of phone calls before I finally received my pay. Absolutely ridiculous!
bad,Staff is good to work with but management is awful and does not stand up for employees.
bad,The company did not have the tools to provide to enhance our success.
bad,"OMG, I didn't know places like this existed with healthcare providers this unfeeling in the United States. Terrible care, I would rather work in a third world country with others who really try to help and make an impact. This organization is the typical American money grubbing, cost cutting, employee overworking, big corporation. They won't lose their license, you will.Stay away unless you're living in a cardboard box and have no food.Poor patients, at the mercy of uncaring management, and old nurses who could care less. Never leave their office to help super under staffed floor personnel."
bad,Run.....don't walk....disrespectful...hostile...unethical!
bad,"Very, very, very poor patient care demonstrated at this hospital. I would never, ever have a family member, friend, homeless person I never met...etc. receive care at this facility. Constant turnover at all levels. The staff was very uncaring and not helpful in any way. I had one good nursing supervisor who made the wise choice to leave for Cardinal Glennon. Most enjoyable part was going to my department and not being up on the floors"
bad,"I should have known that there was something wrong with this place because they offered me the job too fast. I have been an LPN working in long term care for five years who just became an RN, but they started me on the bottom of the RN pay scale as if I had no experience, taking NONE of my previous nursing experience into account. Then during orientation, the payroll clerk slipped up and told us that this company does NOT give out raises and had not given any raises to its employees since 2010!!! They paid me as a new nurse but as soon as I got on the floor, they had not problem taking me off of orientation as soon as they could because they knew I had ""experience"". How ironic."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Not a good place to work, no work ethics, no leadership, medical staff all over the place, no team work, I don't know what to call this place but I can assure you it's not like any hospital I've ever worked for."
bad,Unethical management with requests to not report patient safety issues. Multiple patient family complaints and on going lawsuits over care. Poor housekeeping. Building with water leaking from roof and behind walls. These were painted to cover up instead of correcting the problems. CEO had group of employees (friends) who could do no wrong. CEO never investigated complaints but instead made decisions on what information was given by favored employees. Insurance and other benefits not good but expensive.
bad,Kindred is firing anyone with experience and replacing them with lesser paid employees at the detrament of the residents.
bad,It was a great place to work before the new management came and made their own rules it's a very unpleasant place to work management walks down the hall and doesn't speak they haven't taken the time to get to know any staff members and they started a new no advancement/ promotion rule which is unfair especially since they have tuition reimbursement
bad,"I have worked many places, This is the worst one. Horrible management, unprofessional department heads, Tons of mistakes made. No one seems care. We all agree that we would not refer our friends or relatives to this hospital."
bad,"Work the skill unit typical have 19 skilled patient. You are running around trying to find supple you need to start the day. Management cares only about management, and that is the bottom line. Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is not giving each patient the time they each deserve and watching your back with management. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a patient get well and go home."
bad,I quit after a few months. There were cliques among the managers. Interviewed for another position in the same facility and was asked by the DON if I can do the job since I have a KID. I left the company.
bad,"Kindred initially was a great place to work. I worked there for quite a few years, but boy am I glad to be OUT OF THERE!!!!! Kindred in Tampa and St Pete is HORRIBLE!!!!!! Kindred used to be nice, but not now. I would not recommend ANYONE work at any of the local Kindred. Run away as fast as you can"
bad,"I've been working here for 1 year and I'm desperately seeking a new job. The benefits are terrible. Turnover is great. The reviews here are spot on. Senior management is awful, the company does not care about you. Everyone got a $50.00 gift card for a job well done and in your next paycheck taxes were taken out. :) File this company under worst place to work."
bad,This is not the place for you. The senior management team have no morals. Stay away from this place. When the patient census drops your hours are cut! The employees are loosing their homes because their hours were cut. Its not a stable place of employment. Its filthy dirty!
bad,"Overall, poorly staffed making standards of care unachievable. Toxic poor moral makes work almost unbearable. I had to leave for my own sanity. Benefits average. Culture of care is that average/standard care is acceptable"
bad,"Worst company ever. They care more about making the facility happy and maintaining high reimbursement levels than patient care, and they certainly do not care about their employees. You’re expected to use your PTO to supplement your hours when you fall below the full time threshold (which is every week) and never be able to accrue actual time off, you will go years without an increase in compensation, no holiday incentives, you’re expected to be available 7 days a week.... I could keep going..."
bad,The company was very unorganized. leadership was awful. There wasn’t any work/life balance. Nurse practitioners were treated terrible. Communication and professionalism was lacking
bad,The environment is awful. Nurses are leaving because management doesn't know what they are doing and they leave by 3 or 4 every day! They do not know how to run the place properly. All the good management is leaving too. You only have to follow policies if they don't like you.
bad,We were always understaffed which required us to do our job by ourselves most of the time. Patients are neglected because we don't have enough help. On the weekends there would only be two LNAs (three if we were lucky). We each would have to take care of 10-15 patients on our own (which I'm pretty sure is illegal - each LNA should have a max of 5 patients). Please don't work here.
bad,"Management was terrible, did not follow through with what was promised in the interview, did not provide equipment and resources needed, no marketing to develop programs."
bad,"Awful to many clicks,neglectful pt care.out of date facility. Bad management.if your not there family or slave do by go there. Low wages for hard work."
bad,The company was interested in profit and inflating its overall bottom line in order to ask a higher price for its skilled nursing division than it was in taking care of its patients and staff.  I would avoid this company at all cost and recommend sending your loved ones to another company for healthcare.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Consists of an  understaffed day with no supplies to take care of patients and uncaring management. The only thing that they care about is money at the expense of the staff as well as the patients.  It is poorly managed and no one really cares about this as long as everything is under the radar.
bad,"Great therapist very friendly easy to work with"
bad,"Company has no morals or ethics and has fraudulent insurance practices, facility extremely understaffed,  and neglect observed daily towards patients."
bad,"It is just astonishing!   This company believes in numbers and productivity, they will do anything to make more money. Hours are variable, if census is low, you are told to use PTO. OTA are preferred over OT to provide treatment. You are lucky if you get a good manager, which is highly unlikely because most them are ones who have worked for this company for long-term and are Puppets. Please, find another company which treats employees and patient's like humans."
bad,"This company will chew you up and spit you out like bad Chinese food."
bad,"Retaliation against prior employees that will permanently damage ones career. Assignment ended after two days upon initiation of 13 am travelling contract. By corporate HR kindred. No apparent reason. No explanation by director of rehab. Unethical business leadership, lack of transparency, from the top tier who was responsible for, unprofessional targeting."
bad,The higher level management team are vicious and retaliatory. They only care about themselves. The atmosphere is stressful and pits team members against each other.
bad,The corporate office in Atlanta has a high turnover rate. No room for advancement. The employees are not compensated based on work given. Poor morale.
bad,Our rehab team has experienced problems ever since our rehab opened two years ago and no-one even acts like they care.  Every issue is swept under the rug so to speak with no solutions.  We have had multiple PD's in just two short years.  Only one of which was fair and supportive of our team and this individual was demoted because of lies.  This company does show that they care for their employees or support them.  They're interest is not in you despite the fact they wouldn't have a company without their employees.  No-one has listened to our voiced complaints for the past 9 months.  They continually lie to us.  HR has continued to put off any meetings we have requested to discuss issues.  We are all to the point of walking out the door because of their lack of concern.  If you are looking for someone to be supportive  of your passion for the therapy industry then you need to continue your search because this company isn't it.
bad,The staff is very un welcoming and very critical. They did not have understanding and they had groups of colleagues that held conversations about non work related issues often.
bad,Poor management and job security. Management asking for productivity and they treat you like a number. Retaliation against employees when you don't meet their $$$$.
bad,"Poor management, dysfunctional and immature working environment, terrible benefits for a health care company. "
bad,got new supervisor who was mad that i knew more that i was supposed to know and i knew more than she did. so she mad up an excuse to fire me in 2 days. they soon lost that account.
bad,The worst organization to ever work for.  The Regional Manager is a nightmare.  Very unrealistic.  Very downgrading and unsupportive. Please keep track of your paycheck and what you are being paid.  They said they paid a bonus.  That will never happen
bad,"New managers every 3-6 months in both Sales and Ops.  This makes for lack of continuity, and direction.  MUST be a self starter and recognize that there is minimal support to  build the market place, no long term goals and they are way behind the curve to build partnerships in Ortho arena.  Kindred has the same problems in Denver, it's just different year and a different team."
bad,This company is not the company I thought it was when I began to work there. I would work by myself or Just with 2 aides with 65 residents. the environment was hostile and management did not do there job.
bad,"Horrible management. All they care about is making money even if it means asking therapists to provide services that aren't necessary or appropriate. They treat their employees horrible. Turn over rate is very high, people quit and/or get fired like it's no big deal. I witnessed 1 employee quit within 1 week of being hired. I have seen multiple of my co-workers cry because of how little they are about us."
bad,When it comes to the workers they will work with you but some of them will catch you to mess up and tells lies on you to the manager in charge then they will terminate you in a heart beat over what he said or she said. It's best to keep your mouth close while working at this place most five star facility do not play when it comes to their residents. So be mindful of what you said to a resident cause most co-workers will take it to a wrong offense.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Enjoyed the experience but not a great company to work for. Management is horrible, understaffed, staff is very rude and unfriendly. No job security because they are either laying off or canceling you all the time and the benefits are terrible. The company does not follow proper policies and procedures so that's a good way to lose your license. Only work for them as a last resort only"
bad,A typical day started with helping nurses and cnas to clean up after the night shift left. The patients were not well taken care of and nothing was ever done about it. The hardest part of my job was going home each day knowing that the residents in this facility had to live the way they did.
bad,"Want you to work for hours on end and blame it on a ""salaried position"". Compensation for salaried employee sounds fair until you work 80 hours a week for your salary. Corporate administration does NOTHING to help with poor culture in buildings although they are well aware of problems. Training is non-existent. Employees are not treated the same. Would never recommend this company you'd like to keep your license. Worked in fear of my job everyday."
bad,"Lack of staff for required work on hand."
bad,"Kindred would like to expand exponentially in the Rehab Market, however they had no geniune guidelines to maintian continuity between facilities as well as a poorly illustrated mission statement. They may find themselves much more successfull if they stop focusing on the bottom line and encouraging their building Executive directors to cut staff to save a buck, but rather encourage highly educated and superiorly trained staff to improve quality of care as well as improved outcomes."
bad,I worked for this company for several years and it went down hill quickly. They want you to put in as much work as possible but you cant get overtime then they yell and gripe at you when you are trying to be a dedicated worker and get your job done. I took work home and worked for without pay for 3-4 hours each night. They piled on more and more duties if you show them any signs that you are willing to be at their bekconing call. Management was ok until they pushed her out because she wasnt trained to be in sales/marketing. They want you to be a marketer aswell as a nurse or sw or cna it doesntnmatter to them. I never got a raise the whole time i was there. Freeze on pay increases because the census was low or we didnt meet quota.  I hated the way that they treated the staff and the facilities that they talk about behind their backs.  TRAINING WHAT TRAINING. You were thrown out to the dogs at first day.  I loved the principles of my job and was very good at it but you better not have an opinion or talk out of turn. So this hospice is not up to snuff. I am not sure about the other Kindred entities. But as for Hospice. THEY SUCK!!!!!
bad,12 hour shifts rarely a getting lunch breaks. You must punch out for lunch or you will be written up. Many employees punch out for lunch and work then punch in so they do not get in trouble. CCO negative and minimal interaction with staff. CEO not intersted in patient care or staff. Nurse to patient ratio makes it difficult to provide the care needed
bad,"Business office manager is a narcissistic, arrogant bully who enjoys humiliating people.  He expects brown-nosing and will make your life miserable if you don't, and has no respect whatsoever for others.  He also uses people as his scapegoat for his own screw-ups. "
bad,"The worst experience in my 24 years of nursing.Management team unprofessional , conniving  and unethical . Disrespectful to all staff members, schedule manipulation by the DON with no regard to people's lives and the ED useless as a resource. I would warn anybody from working for this building.Gossiping , swearing and complete un professionalism from the DNS ... Like working in a high school .. Attitude reflects leadership and it's as bad as it gets !!!"
bad,Basically the management ruined this facility and created a horrible work environment. Majority of co-workers were unprofessional due to the lack of leadership and management.  Therapists are not respected and work productivity standards are unrealistic.
bad,"this hospital is not a great place for a nurse looking for advancement, or a nurse thats entry level with no experience. Not a great working environment, there is no team work, poor communication between nurses and doctors, even the EMR they have needs improvement. I cant name one good thing about this hospital and i can understand why they have high turnover rates."
bad,"Management exhibits a great lack of respect for therapist's education, experience, and clinical judgement. Productivity standards are unreasonable and I personally was berated and threatened to treat residents that did not require a skilled service or to keep resident's on caseload longer than necessary. It seems that the people with the least amount of integrity climb up the corporate ladder. If you lack integrity and ethics, this is the place for you."
bad,Not a good atmosphere to work. The hardest part of job is getting along with the coworkers. Not very friendly. The pay is decent.
bad,Ur boss dont listen to thier staffs ech cna get 15 patients at times and nurses get 8 or more because they are trying to save money and also they try to  write u up for any little thing when u turn in ur resignation so that other kindred won't hire u. Poor management.  Whever state shows up we have full staff. Someone should report them to labor board!
bad,"Piled more work on than could possibly be done, poor training if any at all, Management not approachable. Point system abused...they look for any reason to give you a point. Treated like children not adults. Rules change every day. Bathrooms never have toilet paper or paper towels, cleaned once a week. Stairways never swept, floors always dirty, a smell in the air that does NOT go away.  Expected to clean break/lunch area"
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,I would not recommend this place of business to anyone looking for employment. The facility is based on high drama that ranges from line staff all the way to the top.
bad,Do not work here at all of you want to keep your license worked here for about six months at greenbriar was awful they treat there lna horrible over work and under payed they don't properly clean their faculty this place really discouraged me from being a lna most of their employees are on light duties from being hurt. residents are paying for services and there's not even any briefs stocked up half the time or wipes and if you get employed on building 5 2 fun as fast as you can the nursing supervisor is so underappreciated of her staff I never been talk to so bad in my life and once you give your two week noticed human resources harass you
bad,"Company creates sweatshop mentality. Since kindred merged with Rehabcare productivity has increased to 90%. Lost matching 401K, insurance sucks, freeze on raises, while upper management complains that company makes only 1% overall. Only good reviews seem to be from techs and non- therapist. What other therapist are not realizing, is that program directors are not paid increased hourly wages, they make their $ from bonuses related to increased med B revenue, high rug levels, picking up patients who are not rehabable and keeping productivity up. PD s are micromanaged and brainwashed on weekly conference calls, while preaching ""ethics"" It's an impossible environment to work in and meeting Medicare  ridiculous  requirements are making all therapist miserable.Now therapist are expected to carry IPOD mini while treating. Doesn't even fit into  pocket. a lot of patients complain that they feel neglected because therapist have to worry more about documenting, than paying attention to them."
bad,"""It is hard to call a place like this a hospital"" is the most recent quote of a former patient! I tell you generally speaking LTAC's are terrible places. Not only are most of the patients in contact isolation but this level of care attracts incompetent doctors and nurses. I would never place a loved one in a Kindred facility! I feel sorry for the patients at facilities like this that call themselves hospitals! If you want to place your reputation and license at risk then please do apply.  Spare yourself frequent complaints from your patients about faulty room temperature, roaches/rodents, incompetent care such as medication reactions going unnoticed! If I were you I would just turn around and run for the hills! As an RN, I wouldn't work for Kindred for any amount of money!!"
bad,"a typical day consisted of hanging up to 30 IV medications in a 12 hour shift, patients with IV push pain medications every 2-3 hours."
bad,"To start with the program director are non therapy one was a social worker, the other and worse has a high school degree. The techs are there right hand people who decide schedules and who go home early. It is a sweatshop and getting worse. If you complain you get let go. There is increasing productivity that is totally unrealistic, but to make it worse they dump obstacles in your way to being productive such as more and more duplicate documentation, Archaic computer documentation on a ""Word  program"", follow up phone calls, meetings after meetings just to slam staff with how unproductive they are. Absolutely no support or praise for staff. Staff and patients are numbers. The almighty dollar is all they care about. And there is no one to turn to. "
bad,Was fired after only a few weeks with no chance to improve a problem I did not even know existed.
bad,"We unfortunately often work short of people and of just basic necessary supplies such as clean linens and any worker that is found going to the main linen supply to obtain necessary additional clean linens will be immediately terminated. A few months ago, we were all given evaluation surveys by the state to be completed anonymously and then be placed in a box that the state would pick up. There was no box made available and we had to turn them into our supervisors instead obviously in complete disregard and noncompliance of the anonymity we were assured of. They did make their way to state however and despite the fact that not all had been completed or turned in yet, there were so many complaints about management and things such as listed above that the state immediately came for an impromptu visit and when approached by management they refused and stated they were there only to speak to staff. About a week after the state visit we all received a memo from corporate about how disappointed they were about all of the complaints stating that they had given us things such as free lunch pails and felt they treated us well. They also stated that it is difficult to find another job out there right now as well as making reference to Liberty Hospital recently laying off 152 employees. Frankly, all the employees took this memo, I feel rightly, to be a sort of ""keep your mouth shut"" sort of communication. There is not a team concept type of employment with your coworkers  which is a first for me at any place of employment in my nursing career. When I did ask if anyone needed help I seemed"
bad,"The absolute worse place i've ever worked in my life! The place is a joke! I worked in the dietary and the supervisor is a idiot who has no idea of how to run a kitchen! Two cooks quit within two weeks apart! Three other cooks quit before that. If your plan is to waste your life working for a place with no future,then kindred is the place to be!"
bad,"I'm writing this review to warn all licensed professionals who are looking for a healthy working environment and a strong organizational work culture. I've been with kindred hospital Indianapolis for 2 years. My expectations weren't high going into the facility based on the reputation Kindred has in the healthcare community. But I needed a job, and they offered a very good compensation. However, once I began my journey as a staff RN, I noticed the lack of training and nursing education Kindred offered. As I progressed, I witnessed scheduling conflicts, management gossip, favoritism among employees by management, and a punitive management style. Lack of effective leadership was also very evident to me and it eventually led to decreased employee morale. Management seemed non-engaged and unconcerned about their employees and work-related issues (i.e. lack of functioning equipment such as b/p and IV pumps). Family complaints were the norm, and hazardous patient safety concerns were prevalent due to the decreased knowledge bases from many of the nurses working there. As a supervisor, I was held accountable for the actions of nursing personnel, and as a result, was used as a scapegoat for many reasons. Kindred afforded me the opportunity to advance my education, but shortly thereafter, I was terminated due to the actions of others without receiving due process. In addition to the termination, they threatened to mark my license with negligence performance. I've since consulted a lawyer who assured me there was no bases for that claim. In any case, if you consider yourself a diligent,"
bad,"No infection control program in building, boxelder bugs crawling on patients. Mold on walls is a health risk to staff. Bonus's paid out under the table from administrator for lying to government agencies and kindred corporate. Don't risk your lisence by working here!!"
bad,I do not advise anyone to apply for this company. You are overworked and under payed! I did build good friendships that's it.....
bad,"run, run, run is all you will do working for rehabcare. Their producitivity standards is an impossible 90% now. They basically expect their employees to work off the clock, which is what most therapists do to meet their impossible standards. Our rehab manager now reads each person's productivity out loud at weekly meetings. That is all management is concerned with; quantity of care. There is no concern about quality of care or quality of work for the employees.Management is a mess and so therapists end up doing way too much administrative work (which they end up having to clock out for, of course!)"
bad,"My first impression of this place was guarded , but , I was assured that it was a great place to work because of the warm , family-like atmosphere , and the great opportunities for learning . Then , as I saw how they worked their staff to death , with no positive re-inforcement but always looking to place the blame and cover their trails for legal issues , I became very concerned . The constant stress and demands of management are ridiculous ! When was the last time these administrators put on scrubs and took on a full assigment on a busy day on the units ! Or had to juggle twenty problems all at once while being pulled in all directions by other demands ! In my opinion , this is not a safe or firendly place to work .I now know why there is such a high turn over in their staff ."
bad,"I have never in the 27 years I have been in healthcare, dealt with a more disrespectful, unproffesional group of women. The don and adon are like school yard bullies!!! They are always short staffed and the quality of care suffers! I would not let them take care of my dog!!!"
bad,"Too bad as there are many great people to work with but Kindred has no loyalty, they cut everything with no understanding how is affects all of us. They have no idea what our jobs are like and even when we make them money they still don't give us basic needs. And pay is so bad, really low, that positions stay open for months even years and we all pick up the slack.  Leaders talk about caring and being great to their employees but its empty talk.  Beware."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"At Kindred I hired for a part time PT position.  They wanted availability daily, weekend coverage pool.  Hours were only given if a report needed to be generated.  At times I was given 30 minutes or 1 hour of treatment a day.  My travel to and from work was more than my hours at work.  Problem was upper management not with fellow staff.  Other clinicians were great people."
bad,TERRIBLE DON over the Farmington MO branch!!! High turn over in the Nurse Resource position who is Community Care Supervisor! Supervisor does NOT stand up for her reliable nurses and the DON is not truthful...flat out liar to get what she wants or to save her own hide. Fires nurse without cause and then says they are NO SHOW/NO CALL!!!! RUN from this place! You won't be there long! Small Town politics run this branch. Horrible for their clients! Very sad!
bad,Unorganized Corrupt Healthcare Company that has changed their name several times due to CORRUPTION!!! A lot of Internal Theft going on in this Corporate office.
bad,"Day would begin for myself getting therapist schedules printed out and make sure no messages on the machines to catch any cancels that might be on the phone."
bad,"Hard work/knowledge is not rewarded, pay does not come close to their expectations of an employee. Kindred will use people up and find someone new for even less money"
bad,Kindred is a great company to work for but unfortunately it is now a Curo owned and operated company. They are not supportive and mistreat staff. They expect staff to work round the clock for no additional compensation. The care of patients is suffering.
bad,Unfortunately there was no culture at all.  There was favoritism.  Their policies only applied to certain employees and were not enforced.  Available jobs were never offered to staff first.  We were only open 10 years and I was the only original hire in the nursing department.  There was no teamwork between employees of the same department or different departments.
bad,"When i first started i was a little scared but super excited! My Director was amazing and every ounce of what types of bosses we need in this world. She was very helpful, and encouraging and quick to re-educate if needed instead of discipline right away. Needless to say my ADO could really careless about the employees, if you report neglect or abuse-AND YES THERE WAS-you get reprimanded and have a target on your back. My PD was told to step down and they later hired a new PD FROM Hades! She came in and shredded every binder and threw out any type of organization we had. Our office was pretty self functioning and for the most part we all worked very well and helped each other out. Organization was key and we worked our way from their, she demanded things her way, completely tore the office apart and put us all in a heap of a mess before going on a 2 week vacation leaving us scrambling to adjust. She messed up the schedules, didn't add patients to the planners, canceled appointments with out telling therapist and any time i talked to my team and tried to address concerns i was shut down and then she started gossiping. I took it to the ADO -whom she got to first- and wouldn't you know I GOT reprimanded. The job i thrived at and LOVED became Hades overnight. The ADO always took the PD side no matter what and then they started having ""Gang up"" sessions where it was only us 3 allowed to be involved in the meeting and my character, my work ethic, everything i worked so hard for over the last year was tore to pieces. I was left feeling insecure, worthless, and fighting a loosing battle."
bad,"Don't recommend, management lies about job security and pay increases. They make you see 16 to 18 patients a day but are only paid 8 hours, they make you concurrent treat patients even if the are bed bound and on isolation. They tell you to ""make it work"" or are let go."
bad,Always short staffed having 11-12 pt’s.  Never have enough time to get all your work done. They don’t pay their long term employees enough and the new employees start off making more. I enjoyed the people I worked with but the company is all about paying the upper management and not paying the cna’s. This place will be better if they could keep the staff and pay more for their current employees.
bad,"Poor mgmt and advancement "
bad,"After 3 years and dedication to complete my daily tasks, keeping the company’s records up to date without a glitch and if there was a glitch , I problem solved and still completed my duties... pay raise came after 3 years I got 6 cents... what a joke!!! No employees received pay raises for yrs... all that money we made this company, we got both company and we got NOTHING"
bad,"Management our friends outside of the workplace including CEO. Also roomates within management rConcerts and karaoke  they do it all together. So they'll have each other's backs no matter what's,  Nothing you say it's confidential because their friends. honesty does not go a long way at all. You basically train yourself.  Company employees and staff or set in there always. Not welcomed to fresh and new ideas For the patience.. And no Room to grow."
bad,"no raise from this job in 6 years, not a good place to advance. no more comments. If you are looking to advance quickly do not apply for the job. management is not resonable"
bad,"The mid-management was fine, but corporate management would fire at will to make themselves look good. There was no concern for employees well-being. All departments, especially nursing, were overworked. Patients suffered because of it. Out of good conscience, I could not stay at that facility and I left voluntarily. BUT there were so many people fired because the leadership wanted to blame the floor instead of review their upper management operations. Corporate management was always present and always intimidating their employees to increase their productions. The turn over was ridiculously high. It was always negative and everyone left their day stressed. The moral was non-existent."
bad,If your the type of therapist that thinks ethical practices and patients should be a priority this is not the company for you. Yes I realize I am burning a bridge with this statement and this company but I would never work for them again anyway. By the way there are companies out there that do put patient care first.
bad,"Patients and co-worker were very biased. You were miss treated if you were not a certain race. Color was a big factor. I was called racial slurs often, openly by patients. I was often lied on and laughed at, despite how hard I worked."
bad,"The job was a breeze but  co-workers would constantly harass and  bully the Technician. It was a very hostile work environment and when it was brought up to management it was addressed for a moment. Then the retaliation   of co-workers started. It was not easy working each day. Being told to “ shut up “ or just plain being ingnored was not easy . The communicating with others, it seemed impossible to do so when Treated with disrespect.I would not recommend this place because of the workers . Did enjoy working for the company and wished I could have had more time . I would have moved to another campus but they didn’t want to hear why I was leaving at all . I wish they asked but they never did . The management was not willing to work with employees if New. I would NOT recommend the Dover , NJ campus Pharmacy.  Couldn’t wait to leave but couldn’t had sick family member with no compassion from coworkers or emplyor."
bad,"No matter how hard you work, or how much you give to this company, it is not appreciated.  Perfection is expected and upper management is ready to use anyone as a scape goat to cover their own mistakes.  There is no work life balance."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"I’ve been with this company for 3 months. I’ve only been getting 20 hours a week even though when I was hired they said they were desperate and needed full time people."
bad,Kindred gave me the opportunity to work in a management role and further develop my ability as a financial professional.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people.
bad,My duties daily were typically routine but yet demanding and sometimes challenging. I learned patience and tolerance. The hardest part of the job was maintaining stability my clients lifestyle. The enjoyable part was incorporating humor and inviting environment.
bad,"Great people work here. A typical day involves dealing with patients all day and taking care of equipment. The staff is generally friendly and accommodating,"
bad,"I enjoyed my job,which was 4 jobs at a normal hospital rolled into 1 here.Mismanagementt is a big problem and backstabbing goes on all the time among management which makes for an unhealthy atmosphere,lack of pay and cutting back on all benefits and time off didn't help matters,when you have to use your vacation days to make up for days lost that's a problem."
bad,"Gave them 16 dedicated years. Then they hired a pitbull with lipstick that systematically got rid of the staff to hire her own. They either quit or got fired within the first 4 to 6 months she was there. Complaints about her to upper administration went unheard. A bully in high heels created a toxic working inviroment. So it was either quit or get fired, I did both. Would hate thinking of her as a nurse, thats a very scarey thought. She has no compassion for the job or the employees..its strictly by the book..in her words."
bad,"Hours are taxing, management does not help with staff issues. They have insurance benefits which are costly, but not competitive, coverage is very poor."
bad,Management and leadership had very narrow views of what an made a good employee.  Your performance was based on unrealistic expectations for admissions.  No support from leadership to meet goals.  Managed with threat of losing job.
bad,Management was rude and very unorganized. They would wait until you started your work and then say someone called out so we have to move you to a different floor. They definitely had their favorites and did not like when people challenged them.
bad,"high stress, poor management, not enough team players, high turn over rate, overworked staff, unable to provide quality patient care d/t understaffed."
bad,This was the most stressful job I have ever had only because management didn't have a clue. The harassment and discrimination was horrible. I literally had a manager demand that I put my junior high aged child in daycare! Don't work for them at any level unless you look like you walked straight off the runway.
bad,Management has no respect for employees to the point of demeaning actions and verbal confrontations.  Upper management is out of touch with the employees.  The overall atmosphere is sadly  hostile between the managers and the employees and the employees are there for benefits and a paycheck. Turn-over is no laughing matter.
bad,"Financially driven, very little regard for providing appropriate and adequate therapy services to patients, did not allow the personal aspect of patient/therapist relationship, hours were never guaranteed making personal financial commitments difficult to meet, management was not supportive of staff"
bad,I fell in August while at work due to the floors waxing procedure.  I was in bad shape and was off for three months.  When I went back to work most of the staff was rude to me and the work was hard for me.  I continued to complain about this and they finally fired me due to a Supervisor reporting me because she had reasons that I am sure of.  Would not work there again and the worst care of patients I have ever seen. I called state on them and I hope they close the place.
bad,I did not feel connected to the leadership at Kindred.  It was difficult to find ways to grow in the environment as it was impersonal and distant.  I learned much from having to work on growth on my own.
bad,I was very unhappy with my job management was terrible they have no respect for the help and they over work you and under pay you also building smell.
bad,"Very poor management , doesn't show value to the employees , useless compliance center , several complaints about management to upper management, problem never gets solved , push for productivity , hostile environment  ."
bad,"Unsafe, unethical patient care provided by incompetent staff and administration. OSHA, ACHA, and TJC should have shut the place down by now. Many sentinel events swept under the rug. Do not work there if you value your license."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Staff here is amazing and hard working. The employees truly care about the well being of the patients. Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Speech Therapist and Nurses all work to improve patient outcomes."
bad,"Before they even decided to lay off 500 people, Kindred was one of the worst places I've worked for. The money and benefits at kindred are terrible; it's obvious that they don't value their employees. For example, what company in this day and age doesn't match 401(k)? Kindred. In addition, there is no chance for advancement. No raises. No bonuses for merit. No yearly performance review."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Underpaid, underappreciated, no raises. Very sick patients who need the care, but employees too overwhelmed to provide the best service. Favorite employees get away with calling out, leaving early, and no shows while others are constantly   picked on. Management is childish, temperamental, and egotistical. Just horrible! Employee moral very low"
bad,"I was hired along with 2 others to open a new unit and within 5 months of start up 2 of the three quit and the other put their resignation in but, decided to stay. "
bad,Productivity productivity productivity you're expected to be at 90% which gives you six minutes downtime out of every hour it is impossible to make those numbers in a large building  they don't really care about the quality of care that is delivered to the patient also he cares that the therapists are registered therapist Fraud is committed on a regular basis though everybody including management seems to turn  thier head PRN staffing is a joke with shift cancellations on a regular basis pulling from other bldgs instead of giving the shift to the PRN therapist that scheduled months in advance I guess if you can't get a job anywhere else this is better than nothing
bad,"You will always be understaffed and continue to have a full patient load and they will continue to accept admissions. worked there for 18 months, sewage flooded first floor twice, sewage smell in icu. there were also three fires, two nurses fired for stealing drugs. no hospital security, so night shift your on your own. Reports of RN's sleeping on the job go unrectified, even though we have several pictures of them sleeping, they promoted one to nightshift charge nurse!!!"
bad,"Great group of people who care for the patients, really try to do the right thing for the patients, wonderful to work with; all of the nurses, techs etc are excellent and have their hearts in the right places.  Unfortunately, administration consistently puts more value on number of patients in the beds than about the care of the patients themselves.  Administration prioritizes ranking within the corporation above everything: patients, families, and employees.  Be cautious if you are ethical and caring as the pressure from the administration can over rule patient safety."
bad,This is not a good company to work for. Some days there is no work and you have to go home. On other days there might be 10 or more hours of work and it can be hard to leave. Paperwork is either done while treating a patient or you do it on your unpaid time. You will want to stop being a therapist after working here.
bad,"It is surprising the state has not banned admissions to this facility. The residents residing at this facility are at the mercy of being cared for by unskilled and poorly trained nurses on all levels.  The facility's norm is scrambling to find nurses on all shifts.  The nursing staff come and go...perpetuating the pattern of dysfunction and unfortunately, the delivery of substandard care to their residents.  There are few nurses that truly care and are striving to provide quality care but they are few and far between.  It is a pity the few good nurses will eventually, sooner, rather than later, resign.  Kindred corporate needs to open their eyes to the reality that this facility is broken and needs substantial day-to-day, corporate, support and reinforcements to restore the health of this facility."
bad,"Very high stress hospital which was very understaffed and a disorganized management.  No consistency or did I feel i was working in a safe environment. Too many critical patients to care for at one time. Unsafe facility to work in. No computers to document care, charts were missing important information, patient confidentiality was abused by staff and family."
bad,"you wouldn't even think you were working in the health care field! its all about attaining high productivity numbers!!!  RUN RUN RUN away from this company!  they will exhaust you,make you physically and emotionally ill. some people have left their positions because they had headaches ,stress, even chest pain!!! from the pressure of hitting your expected productivity. You are assigned half -dead patients and expected to perform an hour of PT on them--some cant even get out of bed ! Very unethical,immoral; you are encouraged to ""be inventive"" w/ patient treatment time, i,e. LIE about your minutes of treatment! expected to do 90-100% productivity!!!.....you dont even need to be a PT to work for them, because you dont get a chance to use your knowledge,or expand it!  i cant say enough about how terrible upper management is!  they put pressure on middle mgmt to work the therapists practically to death!  ihope they go under...i quit quickly!  lots of discontent among therapists...exhausting!"
bad,"A typical day at work meant keeping up with the many reports that were required weekly on top of doing my job.  Hiring good, reliable people sometimes became impossible due to the low salaries.  The most enjoyable part of my job was when I left."
bad,"The company did a great job in remodeling the facility. It looked much more modern and clean than it had prior. The nurse to resident ratio was overwhelming say the least.. Very short staff on the evening and night shifts. Who am I kidding? Day shift also most days.You had received write up's for asinine things such as not clocking out for lunch/dinner breaks or having to work over the shift to try to finish the charting/admission paperwork from the shift you just worked. These type of write up's were due to the amount of work load to be managed. The managers that were in the facility at that point did not ever help the staff floor nurses if they were working short. NP's, MD's would come in leave charts with new orders all over the nurses station. As the nurse you had to keep attending and passing medications all shift for the minimum 30-40 residents-Don't forget blood sugars and insulin to be administered if needed. These, ofcourse, included the constant interruptions of running down the hall to answer the phone ringing at the desk, if any incident should be discovered or happen, or emergency as sending to the hospital. "
bad,Staff - wonderful for the most part. Great personalities to work with.  Management - awful and unprofessional.  Doctors- one in particular - awful - pompous and condescending.  Very overwhelming and staff not treated equally.  I can prove that.  Doctors basically in charge.  No support for the staff.  Very disappointing first job.  I do not know a single staff member that is happy there. Other than enjoying each other's company.
bad,"RehabCare is a subsidiary company Kindred Care. Kindred Care is the company which was forced to close all of its facilities due to numerous state violations in the state of WI. "
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Worked at LTAC for many years with a pay rate of about $5 or more, less than other hospitals in the area. Executive director and upper management tracks every minute of your time including your own documentation. They’re the worst micromanagers. If you don’t flex, they will tell you to flex. WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE. JUST WORK HERE AS A LAST RESORT"
bad,"I find it difficult to properly express my opinions, without sounding completely negative. Co workers were for the most part were very good to work with, especially under the unsafe workloads frequently assigned. RT supervisors were good, hospital management was the absolute worst I have ever worked for. My advice would be to review all the employee reviews and make up your own mind."
bad,"Bad work culture. They will fire you for next to nothing. I would clock in exactly on time. That was one of the reasons I was fired.My boss encouraged me to bring a book to read being that I worked 13 hours a day, I started to bring a book but hardly read it while there, but that was another reason my boss gave me for firing me. I called off one afternoon, because I was in the hospital for a possible heart attack. I provided proof but that one call off was another reason he mentioned for letting me go. His review went on and he pretty much fired me and turned everything they taught me against me."
bad,Lack of support from first level and upper  management. There are no written policy and procedures. Policy is made up as you go and changes daily to fit Management's agenda. Ask for guidance and get wrong direction only to have the director intervene ending in being chastised and belittled by an incincompetent supv and a micromanaging director. read yelp reviews!
bad,Management are micro-managers and will take advantage of you. Do not expect to get a raise. You will be blamed for things you are not responsible for.
bad,"I love working in the facility I work for and I love working with my department but the company itself is not very good. They offer no raises, most of the higher show no compassion towards their employees. I would not recommend working for rehabcare"
bad,"The rt employees were helpful with educating me and it was a good place to get my foot in the door. But not a place you ever want to send a family member. The place smells like cdiff and Mrsa, the nurses are overworked and under paid... it’s actually made me depressed going to work and eventually quit."
bad,"This is a review for Lacuna Health which is a Kindred Healthcare company. Initially this company was The Kindred Contact Center. During this time Management was good, the mission was patient focused, and employee satisfaction was high. Then management changed, the company became Lacuna, and everything changed. The focus is less clinical, less patient oriented, and all about making money. There have been several rounds of layoffs that were handled very poorly. There is no job security for nurses and management is demanding and awful with communication. If you are thinking of applying for a position with Lacuna, proceed with caution and understand that it may be a very short-term job."
bad,"A terrible company to work for. A real disappointment especially for it being a ""Fortune 500"" company. Very poor business practices and ethics."
bad,"Management will throw lower level staff under the bus anytime there is an issue with a patient or patient's family. I have seen Kindred ruin the careers of nurses who have worked there for decades, just to prevent themselves from law suits. The pay is the lowest I have seen. The culture is very ""clicky."" If you are not in with certain people, your job and/or career could be in danger. Lots of Medicare fraud, where case managers create reasons for patients to stay, just so they can use up their Medicare benefits. Absolutely horrid place to work."
bad,"Employees are disposable. They hire new grads, pay them peanuts, and when they leave, hire more new grads. This is the foundation of their business model. They don't give raises, insisting they haven't made a profit in years. Hmm..I wonder how much the executives are being paid."
bad,"Rehab is a tough career, but when the company is not encouraging staff nor supporting during stressful times, it is very sad. This company promises the sun, moon, and stars, but delivers on very little. Corporate does not understand what the real world is like in small towns!"
bad,Would recommend this job to nobody because coworkers run the nursing home instead of management instead of them offering existing coworkers better positions they would rather higher new employees for Less pay
bad,I was very qualified for the position and did a very good job. Management did not feel that I was a good fit for a management position. I feel they were bias because I was a black female in a Account management field.
bad,"My typical day at this company is very hectic my original schedule suppose to be 8:00 5:30 pm . However, most of the time i got off from work at 10:00 pm sometimes at 11:00 pm . It canb be  fun place to work if the manager know her job or his job "
bad,"Not a great place to work. Patient load was very heavy, all patients were total care, the Management team was not supportive, no team work, could find help. this was a very depressive place to work."
bad,upper managment poor no staff available on night shift.staff doing two jobs for pay of one. Didnt getg bonuses in timely manner. open door policy meant the whole work place knew any concerns not confidential at all

bad,"Warehouse pts and throw oxycontin and drugs at them."
bad,"Facility is old and very unsafe.  Management appears to look the other way when violations are noted.  Not a very nice place to work.  Some team members were absolutely amazing up to the Supervisor level."
bad,"Poorly managed, insufficient funding from corporate headquarters. Patients families not given enough information as to choosing this place. Staff changes, no continuity with management. Lovely nurses though, and from all over the world."
bad,"I worked there when it was owned by hill haven.  It was just starting out as a new facility and had great staffing, great management.  Everyone worked as one unit and helped each other.  The patients came first and foremost. We always had staff that we needed"
bad,"Had high expectations but this place is horrible. Some very nice people who work there but also some who I wouldnt let empty my trash. Dirty, disorganized and mostly agency works here. Moral is bad, attitudes are bad and staff  not very nice to new employees. Orientation program was few days in a room watching tv but no purpose. One nurse who is a male very rude to nurses and a ego maniac. All in all a horrible experience and made me question whether I wanted to remain a nurse or not.  New pay rates and a few nice people but the bad out weighs the good."
bad,"The only thing good there is the building. It looks nice and it's new. Other than here are the negative things:"
bad,"This is a beautiful facility with wonderful residents.  The management of both the rehab department is corrupt, manipulative and controlling.  It is unfortunate that patient care is compromised just to fit into the ""in crowd"".  They compromise the well being of the residents just to keep the money flowing.  Blame will be passed when their own inadequacies are revealed, especially the management."
bad,"Poor management and not enough help on a daily basis.  I would not recommend working at kindred hospital,   low pay.  Poor benefits."
bad,management very poor and micro management with  very little support only harassment   problems with management are often swept under the rug
bad,"This place speaks about RESPECT Kindred Hospital of Ontario ca does not offer that! "
bad,"Management  is poor.  All they care about is the numbers.  Long Term staff is lazy and running the show.  Staff do not work as a team.  In fact, employees harass other employees.   In my facility there are staff members mostly PT &OT  assistants and Nurses aides that think they run the hospital.  They intimidate everyone and harass the other employee who are actually doing their job. Supervisors know, but they simply do not care.   IF you are a new employee still idealistic and there to really help patients, leave immediately.  If you stay you will be beaten down by the other lazy staff who only make up numbers to report therapy that they never provided.  What a scam.   These long term employees have no conscience at all.  If you really want to help patients don't work here.   Rehabcare is only interested in profit even at the expense of good employees and sadly at the expense of the patients."
bad,"Prior Nursing Experience."
bad,"A typical day involved stress with scheduling, use of technology and productivity reqirements at 90%+.Therapists were told to write their times with pts on a board and often did not match times pts were actually seen.  I often had to manipulate my palm pilot so that pt times did not overlap with other therapies.  Not a true point of care system.  This board was hidden when management visited.  Unreasonable treatment minutes were often expected, I.e. 52 minutes daily with demented pts for cognition.  Had to leave early often to maintain productivity if caseload dropped, with an obviously reduced pay check.  Co-workers were helpful and friendly.  A lot of $ was spent for PT/OT equipment and technology, but only approved a few workbooks for ST.  I purchased most of my own books.  I learned a lot about what questions to ask at subsequent interviews and to avoid working in SNF setting."
bad,The people are work with are great. Excellent care given to residents
bad,"I accepted a PTA job with this company following graduation and the passing of my boards.  I was promised mentorship and easing into a full caseload....I thought this was great and I would really have the opportunity to gain some level of comfort before being required to meet 90% productivity....however, this couldn't have been further from the truth!  I came in my first day---no orientation to the facility, only a quick introduction to the staff that happened to be in the department at the time---which coincidentally enough did not even include the manager, she was not in until later in the day.   I was then handed my schedule of 80% productivity expectations (and by day 3 was at 92% productivity----way to ease me in, huh?!?!) and left to fend for myself....I will say some of the staff were great and really helped to update me on some of my patients.  I actually had progress notes due on patients my first day and had no clue where to even find documents or specifications as to what was expected per departmental procedure.  Oh and my pre-employment drug test that was administered by the manager was done at the end of my first day AFTER I had treated my entire caseload---this showed me how much quality patient care mattered to them, their only interest seemed to be the bottom dollar and having bodies in there with licenses to maintain a certain level of cash-flow.  Needless to say, this was not how I anticipated my first day going and was stressed out beyond belief.  I went home almost to the point of tears--questioning whether or not I made the right career choice!  When I gave"
bad,"I beat myself up everyday and question why this is so much different then anywhere I have ever been. People here are very unhappy, complain and discuss trying to get a new job everyday, patients and family are under the impression that it is acceptable to treat staff poorly, certain night sups are rarely seen and do not offer assistance of any kind or even check if assistance is needed, assignments are not acuity based and are often unsafe, high profile families are given together as an assignment to one nurse setting the shift up for failure, multiple tasks are being signed as performed but reported not done per pt/family, miscommunication often leading to substandard care, management under the impression that since 'they have been able to work under certain circumstances, then everyone should be able to', policies regarding narcotic administration are not followed the majority of the time and verbal/ written  reprimanding is not consistent,  staff members have been know to be rough on other staff and it has been reported and nothing has been done to provide a safe and secure environment, staff members quitting/resigning after short periods of employment  or even completion of orientation,  low levels of moral within the facility causing undue stress to nursing staff, patient care suffering due to lack of staffing.  As an experienced nurse with less then one in this Kindred facility I highly recommend avoiding employment at any of the facilities owned by this company. I have been in multiple situations that have jeapordized my license and and am currently looking for employment"
bad,"I met my manager once, when I was hired, never had a review. There is one CNA who works like 80 plus hours a week so no one else is ever able to pick up an extra shift if they wanted to. I worked nights and had 24 residents by myself and was expected to have 6-8 residents washed and dressed in the morning, which was very unsafe as other residents were getting out of bed without supervision however all day shift wanted to know was ""how many are washed and dressed?"" Never enough linen or personal care products.. and the unit kitchen was poorly stocked and the main kitchen had everything under lock and key so when a resident wanted something to eat at night basically all there was, was graham crackers. Bullied by a CNA that told me she could get anyone fired and before it happened to me I saw it happen many times..her word was gospel. I loved my job and the residents I took care of but this was the worse place ever..respect for the resident and their belongings was lacking. Getting the PEOPLE up at 4 a.m. for breakfast at 7:30 a.m. is absurb. A total house cleaning of management should be done from the manager who has affairs with staff to the DON who is to chummy with the staff to the receptionist who has been inappropriate with residents."

bad,"I was contracted here for a year to work in support center doing data entry and insurance requests. The training was poor, management ignored me until I made a mistake. I randomly received a threatening email from my manager about my productivity accusing me of not doing enough work all because assignments were not given to me and I often ran out of work. I emailed her for a meeting and she declined. Months went by and i found out that i replaces a corker and she was complaining about me because she was upset i was doing her work. She constantly harassed me saying i wasn’t doing my job right. Finally i went to lunch and received a call from my agent telling me not to return and they would not tell me why. Management refused to talk with me. No teamwork, no employee appreciation.discuss it and she declined."
bad,not a working good place to work very high turnover. the management puts you in unrealistic working conditions. most employees are good people but the culture is cut throat and untrustworthy.  I would not work at Kindred or refer them to anyone.
bad,"As an experienced (20+ years) physical therapist, I was ignored by my ""supervisor"" and spoken to in elementary school language ""ie MIND your communications""."
bad,"They do what they have to for the money, they dont care for their employees. They change policies so frequently you cant seem to do anything right or know what's going on."
bad,"It all depends on the branch manager. As a social worker each branch has different expectations. I had a nice career there when management allowed me to manage my own caseload and not have unreasonable productivity guidelines. South Charlotte required social work to make four visits a day and then come into the office if that expectation was not met. They asked MSW to make welcome calls during that time. Four visits a day is not feasible with area covered and time spent on casework and scheduling.  They do not have a social work manager so you are completely autonomous with no support. There is no car allowance given so wear and tear on the car is awful. It used to be a good place to work when it was Gentiva but was not impressed with Kindred and their management. Did work at a Kindred/Humana branch and that was a very good experience. Branch manager at South Charlotte did not treat me well and was extremely punitive. I eventually had to quit so I didn't get fired. I was written up and told it was my final warning without ever receiving a verbal warning. This was all because I wasn't seeing four patients a day which would have been a 10-12 hour day. Several reports were made to HR in Atlanta, Georgia but nothing was ever done. Do not recommend at all."
bad,"Take take take   ......mmExpectations are beyond unrealistic for the CM RN in the field. Call time with extra admissions. Time off is spent trying to catch up. Charting! reports, meetings, corrections, call all of these people, get this and that, go do extra visits, follow up, document everything, does not count drive time and get 5 stars. It Never ends for even less money. NO Family time for RN in the field. DO NOT WORK HERE YOU WILL BE SORRY!! TERRIBLE PLACE ! POOR SUPERVISION   HALF TGE TIME SUPERVISOR IS CLUELESS  EVERYONE PASSES THE BUCK!!! SUCK THE LIFE RIGHT OUT OF YOU"
bad,"Starting out was ok. They would send you all over the place if the numbers weren't. High enough. I was a unit secretary, then switched to monitor tech for more hours. Then they would switch up the schedule, have me to swing shifts. It got too much. You never knew what was up. They finally closed the White Rock location 😲"
bad,"Co-workers were fun. Building director amazing, flexible, supportive. However. Upper management is out of touch with anything actually going on in the buildings. Area director was Condescending, rude, verbally abusive. No raises in the 4 years I was there, but they hired a girl with zero experience to be a tech with me at a higher pay rate, and refused to at least match our wages. Said “market value analysis” says they can’t do raises, and there is never a performance evaluation. They company doesn’t care about anyone. Find a better place."
bad,"Always being put down, not just me, but all of us. I don't want to say any thing else. STop bouncing me back please. "
bad,"It is a highly stressful environment.  I was definitely treated unfairly. I got a great deal of hostility from mangement.  I was not free to speak my mind. I was constantly threatened with my job. Management never has your back. They will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat. You work yourself to exhaustion and get no thanks. Forget about team environment. They look at you like you lost your mind if you ask for help. If you are not part of the ""old girl"" network you will never succeed. You are constantly worked against by management and insiders to give you the hardest assignments. The CNAs hide from you and refuse to help you. The other nurses trash all over you. It's fair to say reverse racism is at play in the Rivieta Beach facility. The CEO changed 4 times when I was there because they hired one Natcisist after another. Management tells you everything is your fault. You get crazy, busy assignments every single day. No one gives a hoot about patient safety. Your license is constantly at risk. Worst job I ever had. "
bad,I've said enough.  Toxic environment with very little care for patient's and only concerned about bottom line and returns to stock holders.  Poor upper management.
bad,Training was inept. Worst manager I have ever had. Complaints ignored. Terrible clinical decisions. Medical director was great but management bullied and undermined him repeatedly. CTRH is dysfunctional and a terrible place to work. The money isn't worth it.
bad,"The benefits are horrible and very expensive, the pay is low and there are no incentives but a bonus that you can receive. "
bad,"Love who I work with. Love the patient's. Love the field. Love the flexibility with hours."
bad,There was a location where management resulted in poor employee retention. Resignations and terminations have been a persistent pattern due to micromanaged culture which demoralized employees and burned most of them out. The only positive thing to note is that their compensation was competitive.
bad,Not a good work environment.  The Administrator had his favorites and it was evident to all.  The employees were awesome and my immediate boss/bosses were great.

good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"The manager that hired me was let go. When I went to the other manager for direction, I was told to speak to the team lead. Going to the team lead also produced no satisfaction. She would either just do the work herself (and not train me) or would explain it with out allowing me to ask any questions."
bad,You are over worked. Never staffed properly which makes your job difficult. All employees are over worked not just the nursing team. Management seems to care less just as long as patients keep coming in and beds are full.
bad,Very strict and uncaring management.  Management doens't seem to care about employee happpiness whatsoever.  It is a work farm.  ......................................
bad,Patients do not get the care they need due to being so understaffed. Patients are mistreated by employees.  Employees do not want to train new employees nor do they have time. The managers don 't take employees threating other employees seriously. They are in such dier need of help they won't confront employees about their wrongdoings. It's a mess.
bad,They started a new payroll policy and didn't let there employees know. So they will mail your check without verfitying the address or with your consent. Then when you still have yet to receive your check they will procrastinate and give NO Concern about your finances in the process. Horrible place to EVER work. No one deserves to work and not get paid!
bad,"I did not enjoy working for this company, as a contractor they offered no room for advancement and did not work with employees with any concerns, including that of pay or benefits"
bad,They only take the worst patients .. and staffing is terrible .. because they take only the worst patients. Company is for sale .. no room for advancement. Patients stay in bed if not enough staff .. Very sad
bad,"I was excited when I got my job with Kindred. I loved my clients and I was finally in a field I enjoyed. However they fired me for having sick notes. They are also still docking my last pay for training I never received and refuse to refund it. The scheduling is always changing. And, they are very ungrateful."
bad,"Worked in the kitchen, because I was new I was automatically assigned to the dish room. Co-workers were not helpful some were lazy and even left early. Based on the amount of work required the pay is insulting."
bad,"When the CEO cries weekly about how people hate (him/her), And that no one understands them. You know things can only go down hill from there."
bad,"A typical day consisted of anwhere from 18-26 patients that needed anywhere from total care to just linens being picked up on an assisted living unit."
bad,"the work with the pt's was great experience the co workers was nice but the DON and the new Nurse Mangement is awful how they treat their workers.The corporate should step in to see how they treat their workers. Something needs to be done. One time the DON was written up for writing up employers for stupid things dhe was wrote up for 60 days but when that ended she started over again. I am talking about kindred of Oakdale PA,"
bad,I assist with patients and the program director with duties.
bad,Terrible place to work and I'm disgusted I even am a part if it. Nurses turn their heads to ones. There's little team work. Supers do NOT care about the well being of the residents. It's all fake!
bad,"Benefits: dedicated and friendly coworkers, flexibility in scheduling, competitive pay."
bad,The Don and Dsd are very unprofessional. The Cna's are underpaid for all the work they do. The facility it's self is not organized at all. I see why people come and go! I would not refer no one to work at this place!! Very short staffed!!
bad,"Nonstop all day, understaffed for patient acuity."
bad,"Non ethical work conditions and very argumentive enviroment,"
bad,All butterflies and cupcakes to get you in and then watch out!
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"The project manager on my team truly ran the team, but in a very toxic manner. The manager of my team literally got rid of staff if the project manager didn’t like them. It’s a cut throat environment, because other team members wanted to seal their role by being cut throat, not allowing other team members to learn and thrive with the workload. Worst company I have ever worked for!"
bad,Each patient needs to be evaluated to see if they would benefit from Hospice or Palliative care vs being kept existing in their condition. I saw pts with huge bedsores.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of patient care but also worrying about repercussions from management for non productive time.  You risk loss of hours for non productive time and employees fighting for hours, loss of commodore"
bad,"For profit hospital where they are penny wise and pound foolish.  Staffed mostly with travelers as they can't keep regular staff.  High nursing burn out and turn over.  RN's are forced to choose what they can't get done on a daily basis.  They will send nurses home rather than work with a decent nurse to patient ratio.  They don't have enough CNA help to help handle the nursing load.  One CNA to 15 patients, and CNA's do no vital signs or blood sugars as is standard in most facilities."
bad,"Great hospital to increase your nursing knowledge. Great physicians that bring patients to this hospital.Challenging med surge with over worked staff,not enough staffing and broken down equipment. Punitive middle management. Would not have my loved one admitted to this hospital."
bad,"I truly loved my position at the hospital I worked for merely due to the staff that surrounded me. The management and higher ups, however, were extremely secretive and kept us employees in the dark about a lot of things. Communication between ""them"" and ""us"" was p*** poor and they didn't do much to resolve any issues when they arose. The benefits were decent, however, if you are expecting a raise, start to expect otherwise. I get that Kindred Healthcare is a business, but the people running things are cold individuals and eventually you'll feel it no matter what department you are in. Look elsewhere for your sake."
bad,They bought several Kindred Hospitals in different states & had no intention of maintaining those services. We continued to accept patients that needed our level of care when their plan was to close the building. A very painful ending to what had been a great facility.
bad,"This place is horrible to work at. They are so unorganized, understaffed and poorly managed. What is needed to care for residents is hardly avaliable.The condition of the building is in terrible shape. The laundry, dietary and maintenance staff is just as bad. Everything about this place isnt worth working at or putting a loved one in. They pay was ok but what you have to deal with isnt worth it. The outside looks better than whats on the inside. Trust me and I will save you the time."
bad,"My very first job as a PTA in Oregon I worked for Rehab Care. The PT quit the day I started. Medicare reviewers came to the building and stated to them they needed to hire a PT for supervision. They did not, continued to try and have me do paperwork outside of the scope for a PTA.  I quit with notice. When I tried to work for a Rehab Care years later in a different state I was informed I was put on a do not hire list. I tried to get to the bottom of it but no one in any department knew why. Productivity expectations were 96%."
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. Our staff gave wonderful patient care, but the office politics and drama were through the roof. Branch managers, Corporate managers seemed to look the other way & condone the chaos.........the worse you treated fellow employees, the more popular you seemed to be. An industry such as hospice should be compassionate and kind-hearted to employees.  The only way Kindred seems to care about a person is if they are collecting revenue for that person.....very sad office environment. Four out of five Executive Directors and Patient Care Managers caused more gossip & drama than all of the employees combined! Obviously, they were not hired for their professionalism or common sense."
bad,Worked there for a couple weeks and got scabies. They tried to convince me it was an allergic reaction. I also had to negotiate with them to pay me 11.00 when minimum wage in Massachusetts is 10. I never understood why they were constantly losing CNA's until I worked there.
bad,The facility was sold and we found out via the CEO's monthly newsletter distributed regionally. The work itself was not difficult and enjoyable. Management had favorites and was not afraid to make that known. Hard workers were on the bottom oddly enough. The only pro was that most of them  were understanding of you had to handle a sick child at school. Raises were minimal and subjective. The café food was great though!
bad,"There is no job security because anyone who has a dislike of you can call a hotline number and make up anything about you.  Management has no clue about who carries the real load in keeping the faculty afloat, and caters to the employees that kiss up to them, regardless of how horribly there job is done.  Trust me, do yourself a favor and skip this application."
bad,"always understaffed, under appreciated, give write ups like they go out of style. no structure in management, management will lie straight to your face, bottom line they will throw you under the bus, just to cover their butts, even if you didn't do anything wrong."
bad,Terrible place to work management is clueless. They really have no idea what goes on. To busy to even get a break. Benefits are terrible. Paper charting is ancient! It's just ghetto.
bad,"Nursing staff leave their CNA's to struggle while they sit at the desk and talk. CNA's are over worked having to many patients to deal with and no support from nursing staff. Only a couple nurses will help if you need them or offer to help when call lights go off. CNA's have no voice in this company and treated like maids. I've had to work two floors several times over 25 patients by myself with the nurses to assist me but they don't help you. I've had to work under staffed to many times and felt that I put patients at risk cause I can't do my rounds on time. Patients are left unchanged and soaking wet when you finally get to them because you have no help and nurses WILL NOT change patients. Hard work and no appreciation from upper management at all. If your a CNA you will feel as if your drowning here with no lifeline. Can't get vitals done blood sugars or baths in a timely manner because no one helps to answer call lights and the nurses hound you for vitals and blood sugars but see your answering call lights in between and won't help to answer them. The nurses will not help patients in pain or wanting to talk to their nurse so the patients stay on call lights constantly.  The facility is nasty housekeeping only cleans rooms when patients are discharged but not during their stay so rooms are gross and floors are nasty and sticky. Doesn't matter which shift you work it's all the same but day shift nurses are really rude and will not help you at all, nights are a little better but not much. CEO and upper management were fired so corporate is there and it's still not any better"
bad,"HR is nothing but a gossip machine, telling employees oother employees personal information. She might be decent if she wasn't terrified of losing her job. Former CFO got hostile with another employee and HR informed employee ""Don't worry, you won't get fired."" Employee was then accused of warranting the attack. Management is a joke and do nothing but attend countless meetings and gossip about employees. And make sure you fake smile and say hi to everyone or thhe staff will tattle on you to your boss."
bad,"RUN!!! Other than the therapy co-workers there is NOTHING good.  Poor spending allowance for treatment equipment, poor compensation, AWEFUL therapy management, poor culture with nursing/management staff, expectation of 90% productivity.  There is NO managment support for therapists and no chance for advancement.  Kindred/RehabCare is just a poorly run company and Greenfield is the WORST!!!  The Rehab Director needs replaced as does her supervisor!"
bad,The caregivers are taken advantage of by management. Management knows that good people feel obligated to the residents and instead of rewarding them for it they use it make the staff work in unreasonable situations that could jeopardize their career and the patients.
bad,Don t be fooled by the good benefits of this company because thats as far as good will go. The management is horrible. That's if they can get anyone to manage this building .The manager is sorry and don t care about their employees or the patients. The productivity rate far surpasses what can be done ethically and legally.
bad,You will not find poorer compensation and benefits. The health insurance makes medicaid look great.
bad,"upper management is constantly changing. Very clear the ""C suites"" are there for their pay checks, so very out of touch with what really is going on. When they are exposed to the truth, they simply ignore."
bad,As soon as I started my director fell ill. I was sent to training but they focused more on sales v/s rehab qualifications and lingo.  The managers bullied you and criticized everything.  The pressure was always on to find and bring in business.  I was not trained well at all and learned only by making mistakes and made to feel stupid.  I was talked to like a child and bullied daily.  The stress was so much that my last day I ended up in the ER.  I am not a job hopper and stayed at one company 21 years.  I tried my best to stick it out and in the end they won.  I ran screaming and never looked back.
bad,Was a good job until corporate Kindred got more involved. Patient outcome and satisfaction were not high priorities. Shifting billing requirements were.
bad,"Your day starts and ends when you want it to if in the field, but it never ends with the paperwork.(this is the only flexibility you will see) At the end of the day you have to complete paperwork which includes triple and/or quadruple documentation. A new start is 26 pages long. Several nurses don't update the plan of care so the same information is being taught to the patients over and over and over again. There is no communication among staff in the field. If you are not in the right click then you are not in period. Some nurses in the office are fine, but others like to micromanage.....Some management even though you have to sign a confidentiality form, rules do not apply to them. they talk with other people out in the field and gossip is horrible! Instead of communicating with person or issue at hand, they make it harder on the hard working honest staff.  The bad ones get rewarded it seems. You don't get pain for the paperwork you do unless in the home. Most training done online. Your phone is now a work phone."
bad,"Very stressful and low moral. Very dishonest WEO Night Supervisor,  Nurse manager and CCO.Workers are verbally and emotional abusive to new employees. Very heavy patient load with nurse doing primary care a lot , sometimes with 5-6 patients . Impossible to turn and reposition patients every 2 hours with amount of staff that is available but it is being charted as done. False documentation all day everyday! A lot of favoritism is shown and it is  made very obvious. You may get a verbal coaching for something while you see other nurses doing much worse things .If you decide to take a position there than you WILL receive a verbal coaching about something sooner are later. Just be sure to get a copy of the paperwork and draw lines thru any unused spaces and initial the front page even if you are refusing to sign. They will edit your verbal coaching, add more information that was never discussed with you and turn it into a final warning.. JUST THAT EASY!! .The separation from this particular location was the best thing ever for me."
bad,"My MCP was the best manager i have ever worked for, she is leaving to seek another job opportunity. The rest of the management is not there to support their employees. The RN case managers are having to manage to many pts and they are unable to hire any help but continue accepting pts. Their health insurance is horrible for employees and family"
bad,"I worked at a SNF as the only PT and supervised 2 PTA's and a rehab aide.  Rehab Care, despite its stated company values, and my manager in particular, were profit driven.   The desire for profit took precedence over patient needs/appropriate care/appropriate RUG level placement."
bad,"productivity standards are the normal. very busy low functioning patients.  rehab to home was a joke, because the patients they brought in was rehab to LTC.  Do not expect any orthopedic patients because they will not send them to this facility.   I use to work for Rehabcare in the past and it definitely is not the same."
bad,"Corporate office out of state makes it difficult.  Several supervisors at various levels.  Sub-contracted to local facilities, so not employed by facility making team process very difficult."
bad,"the place as though you owe them your life and "
bad,There is absolutely no communication there and they really are bad about not doing good investigations. This place needs much improvement on how they organize things too. I've never worked at a place where team work is completely out of the question!
bad,"Felt like I was risking my license working there. Had a huge pt load which resulted in having to do things quickly without giving the utmost in pt care. When I asked questions about pt care i.e ""What if this happens?"" (being an emergent situation) I was told ""just go get another RT"". Some of the people I worked with were great and that's probably the only pro I can speak of. Definitely saw that they are a for-profit organization."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,My experience there was not good. I would have 25+ patients most of the time with only one tech. They want you document work is done even if there was no time to do it. You will get written up because your tech takes off without telling you. You will haave to clock out for breaks but wont be able to actually take them
bad,Not interested in saying too much about this company. The turnover in staff and residents saftey us not good.
bad,"Kindred is very fond of treating respiratory therapists very poorly. In some facilities they have actually dissolved entire respiratory departments without notice. All employees FT, PRN or otherwise were either ""laid off"" or moved to a non clinical role."
bad,My experience with kindred was not a good one. The charge nurses were very unprofessional and spent time sitting at the nurses station gossiping about everyone than taking care of the residents. The nurses created a lot of conflict that was unnecessary and unprofessional so I quit my job to get away from them.
bad,No comments it’s not an employee driven company it does not give good pay to its employees  it cannot retain a lot of nurses even with increase bonus coz it does not pay good
bad,"Work culture is not as it was advertised in the interview. Unethical working conditions and would not recommend. Management does not support you and they only do whatever will make the most money, disregarding the patient's needs."
bad,"In the Department I worked in, the Manager had favorite staff members. One worker was allowed to intimidate and yell at another worker with no repercussions."
bad,"Saw lots of patients on a daily basis.  Poor management, unable to go to them about problems with other staff members.  Best part of job was the pay.  Worst part of job was all the drama and poor management."
bad,"I am an RN.  The patients at Kindred are high acuity.  I work very hard and pride myself on my work ethic.  Unfortunately there is a high staff turnover.  Because of the rapid turnover, there are no rules or standards enforced for the nursing staff.  Other disciplines, such as RT, OT, and PT would rarely help with lifting or repositioning patients (with a few very awesome and notable exceptions.)  Most of the nurses seem overwhelmed so they shut down.  There are a few exquisitely lazy and stupid nurses that are tortuous to follow (12 hour shifts).  The worst part is, Kindred is so desperate to hang on to staff that they keep truly incompetent, lazy, moronic nurses around; which makes the job all the more difficult for those of us whom actually Do work.  Morale stinks.  Most of the “good” nurses end up quitting pretty quickly because of the chaotic environment.  There’s a few core staff members who treat new staff like dirt.  I heard open, loud, discussions of nurses stating they wanted to “beat up other staff in a boxing ring.”  Nice. Management doesn’t care.  Kindred has several “quality control” personnel who walk around pointing out call lights and alarms going off.  Their responses to the alarms, etc is to find the nurses and tell them the alarm is ringing.  Really?  Like I couldn’t hear it?  Maybe get rid of some of the so-called “helpful” upper management and hire more Working floor staff?? I sent a few emails to corporate and my DON.  No response or acknowledgement whatsoever.  Kindred is a disaster waiting to happen.  If you’re desperate for work, apply here.  Kindred"
bad,"If I could give this company 0 stars it still would be to high I worked at this place for many years and I have to say this place should be under investigation for fraud and abuse to patients. "
bad,"A typical day goes fast pace, my co-workers are wonderful. The hardest part about the job is delegating the work. I loved my job because I knew the payroll system like the back of my hand. I could not make the overall review higher because the site would not let me."
bad,Most enjoyable part of my job was serving my patients. I learned the value of teamwork
bad,If anything I would say stay away. Nothing but bullying and Corporate will do nothing.
bad,Worst place I have ever worked.You have to constantly watch your back for fear of being fired.Highly unprofessional management.Workingat kindred is a very physically and mentally challenging job-few people have the stamina for it and can remain calm under pressure-if Kindred were better managed and they stood by their philosophies of a fair working environment they would retain their employees who can handle this type of work and provide excellent care-its really not worth the pay they offer -and they are more interested in the dollar than the patient. Don't bother-better places to work for your sanity and health.
bad,"For years this was the best LTAC in colorado. Last 2 years drastic changes in qaulity of management,  unsafe staff ratios. Benefits decreased including  pay, shift differential,  sick pay eliminated..  education poor to nonexistent."

bad,This is an awful place to work you are over worked and under paid and never appreciated for the work you do... they don't even pay mileage for travel...at this job you are just a number that is all and management is never on the same page  I think in a year they went threw a lot of managers i can easily say 4 or more....i don't feel they are there to protect their workers....i would highly not recommend anyone work here avoid at all cost!!!
bad,"Kindred has too many Chiefs not enough Indians.  Poor patient care, poor staffing, poor communication, horrible management team, always cutting hours to stay in the budget so the management team could get their quarterly bonus check.  Not enough supplies.  The list is endless......I wouldn't send my worst enemy there for care or to work there."
bad,The management was unsupportive.  Unhealthy and hostile work environment.  Ill maintained facilities and lack luster patient care.  Unattainable expectations

bad,"The patients on this particular unit were not kept clean, smells were unbearable, constant loss of staff, management was nonchalant, certain nurses would constantly nit picked while you work your butt off. Also not strict enough on the call off policy."
bad,"This is the worst healthcare company I have ever worked for. I send just 3 months there. The entire management staff is incompetent especially the CCO. There bed are very old they do not lock so if you want back problems Kindred Rahway is right for you. They also have the CNAs carrying garbage and soil linen around the they are house keeping. The scheduling coordinator who have no degree speaks to license personnel with no respect. at one point the entire nursing staff was sick kindred is dirty, because house keeping never do there job."
bad,"Excellent working relationship with clients -kept them informed and satisfied.  Flexible, never asked anything of an employee that he hadn't done, or wouldn't do himself.  Would often to the Courthouse to file documents in inclement weather instead of asking an employee.     Made arrangements in schedules when child care became an issue."
bad,"do not care about employees or residents, management was very poor they did not do their job to the fullest nor with their hearts in it and in the medical field that isn't possible."
bad,once I arrived to work . I  talk with the charge nurse to get reports about the patients conditions and then I go do my runs.The Management is poor. lack of communication and really no team work.
bad,"The upper management is terrible, unprofessional, uncaring and just all around awful. For the most part, my former co-workers we're nice to work with (nurses and aides) and took good care of the patients. My biggest complaint is that of the management. The job posting on Indeed states that if you want to work for a company that respects you and challenge you and so on...This is not the place!!! Wouldn't recommend to anybody! "
bad,"could use some better communication within the company, some appreciation would be a plus once in a while"
bad,"My PD was a total jerk who wanted to get rid of me the moment he arrived. Wrote me up for nonsense things. He would bring patients down to the gym (when he actually treated), leave them for either meetings or to make a phone call and still charge the time. I, on the other hand, had a patient in the gym ran out to my car to look for my kids keys who were missing and ran back in. Well I got suspended for over a week, and following an investigation was fired. Not only was I gone for under 5 minutes but now they are calling the state board to report my license for medicare fraud. I am sick thinking about this company and how the hypocritical management can destroy my career."

bad,"I worked for Rehab Care through a staffing agency two years ago.   I enjoyed the patients in the facility I worked in and staff in that facility.  The manager was very nice.  Recently, I applied for a position at Rehab Care. On the day I applied the recruiter called me immediately.  The position he called me about was for an OTR and I'm COTA.  For nearly two months, on a weekly basis I called to follow up on the openings in my area and never received a call back.  An RN I know works in a facility where Rehab Care had and opening.  She gave my number to the manager.  The nice manager called to set up an interview and instructed me to call the recruiter (the one who never called me back) and I left a message that I would be interviewing at the facility.  He finally left me a message.  In the mean time I got a text from the RN stating that manager had told her I was not re-hireable.  When I returned the recruiters call he said they would be filling that position with a current employee.  Which is understandable.  Then I mentioned ""I heard I wasn't re-hireable.""  He said that Rehab Care or Kindred would not hire me in my area and he had no further information.  He also stated ""we had this conversation last year and I told you this before.""  I had never spoken to the recruiter prior to him calling me when I initially filled out the application.  I find this all rather suspect due to the fact he called me for an OTR position and claiming we had spoke last year.  I don't believe he would have mentioned that I was not rehireable unless I had brought it up.  Not very forthcoming."
bad,I enjoy working for the company they foster career growth and education.
bad,"Asked for full orientation as this was a new population for me; they promised 12 shifts and labeled me ""disruptive"" when I asked for 12 shifts."
bad,Manager understaffs rt's to obtain bonus. Patient overload. Patient's will go 48hrs without trach care. Doctor's do not know what they are doing with ventilator yet there are no therapist driven protocols. If you want to keep your license do not work here.
bad,You will be sorry working in dietary at this location.
bad,"This company is very unprofessional. If I could, I would give them a (negative)-2 stars. They called 3 hours prior to my scheduled interview because of an ""emergency"" that the interviewer had. I called back 3 days later because they had failed to call me back to reschedule. I was put on hold for 5 mins. only to be told the position was already filled. I am glad I don't work there. They would probably fire me if I had an emergency."
bad,"This hospital is ghetto, the director of nursing and managers could care less about their employees. They walk around high with their head stuck-up in the clouds and think they're better than the employees. This hospital has a bad rating even from their sister hospitals and as soon as employees establish themselves in this hospital, they transfer out to other kindred facilities if they haven't been fired first. Orientation sucks because the nurses don't even want to train you properly. They leave in the dust to figure things out on your own because they are trying to keep their job and seniority with the company. They over work the employees by assigning the nurses too many patients that you can't even finish your work by when the clock strikes end of shift. You end up staying over time and they would give you a hard time about paying over time, they want you to get your over time approved by a supervisor and have a good reason for it. They don't even train their nurses about quality care, all they want them is for nurses to be quick with their tasks compromising quality care. You can't even talk to your patients and see how their doing because you have 5 things going on. The patients are angry all the time because of this. And if nurses are nice, they're being fake about it and there is no genuine side about them because they're always rushing on to the next patient. I can tell you that the CNA's are even unhappy and everyday I went to work, all I heard was complaining. And if they didn't complain, you could see the tired look on their faces. It's horrible.

If your case load is heavy good luck asking your supervisor for help! Your on your own! The nurses and aides in this company Get treated like modern slaves while kindred sales team get all the bonuses!! This is just a job, please treat it as such and don’t loose your mind or sanity trying to please the people here"
bad,4 of the 8 Administrators had little to no experience in the area in which they were “ managing” seasoned employees. Most of the decisions are knee jerk reactions to a situation rather than well thought out contingency plans. 401K match was 1/10 of 1% of your salary. If you disagree with upper level corporate management you will be let go despite your work performance.
bad,I worked at this location for a year month after I got hired the entire kitchen quite and moved to a Different facility where the kitchen manager first got employed I worked 7 months no days off cause of lack of help worked 122 hours every 2 weeks 12 months in the finally started to hire employees the director is not Certified she has failed the exams twice the kitchen manager is not a Certified Dietary managerreally from top to bottom the hospital is poorly ran the ceo knows nothing that goes on in any depe
bad,"I had 7 total care patients, I had to share a CNA with another RN who had the same amount of patients. In a total care environment this is inexusable! I felt that my patients were not getting the care they deserved!"
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"No raises even after 3 years of employment."
bad,"Horrible Administrator and DNS but they don't care because they are selling their long term care business.  Screaming, name calling and inappropriate conversations are the norm!"
bad,"No job security. the staff there use the worst language I have ever heard. If the DNS  doesn't like you, watch out you will be gone.... you never know from day to day if you will have a job. The administrator does not stand up for nurses at all. The cnas and Lpns are over worked.... this place has went thru loads of staff in the past 5 years..."
bad,"They are far from compassionate. There definitely favoritism between administration to patients And employees. They currently put a pay freeze on employees because they spend 1/2 million last year on alcohol for their social meetings. The CNA will take all responsibility because of a nurse's mistake of any other co-worker if they are favored or had a higher education. Last but definitely not close to least don't bother ever being sick or taking a doctors note or getting "" sent home"" sick its an automatic write up. The administration Is out for them self's and does not care who sick nor the patients as stated on their so called "" statement"" you get when admitted that they will be in to check and see how everything is going don't bother they never walk onto the floor unless it's to yell or write up an employee with out getting any evidence to their allegations. My opinion I would not send my family there first hand experience. Not because of the CNA their great because of the administration."
bad,"not enough staff, frequently changing management, documentation system did not flow or connect, unable to see pt lab results or radiology reports, three different owners 1st SCCI then TRIUMPH, and 3rd owner currently Kindred. 3 owners in 4 years."
bad,"Run as fast as you can away from this facility. Bullying and verbal abuse are an everyday thing and reporting it to corporate is a waste of time. Nothing is ever done to stop it. They will still be there the next day, week and year later."
bad,"worked for this company for 8 months....basically my experience was good, but the drawbacks outweighed the good."
bad,"There is no typical day at work in this facility. You may orientate on one hall and be put where ever they are short the next time. There have been instances of being pulled off orientation early and put on the floor due to the fact they are almost always understaffed. If they have call ins and are unable to find replacements they force/intimidate/threaten you to stay over instead of working the floor themselves. Raises were taken away about 2 years ago, they haven't contributed to 401ks in quite a while, and recently they have taken away pto time. The floor staff is amazing and help each other out for the most part. The hardest part of the job is getting everything done in the time permitted, don't skip a lunch break or stay over unless you want to be in trouble. The ED will be the first to tell you that she does not have her staff's back, if something happens you will take the fall. This facility has deteriorated in the past year and I would caution anyone who applies to think it over very carefully."
bad,"Started off well, and got worse with time. The stress level got so bad that it affected my health and family life. Would not recommend anyone on the job hunt looking at Kindred"
bad,Employees will not get a raise this year and they are taking away a PTO day this year and next year. Have stopped matching 401 K and are looking at other benifits Expect total committment to do overtime whenever they choose. Write up employees constatly until staff become frustrated and quit-which causes shortages of qualified staff. More of a dictator management style-no nurturing style at all. Educator constantly tells staff they are stupid.
bad,"I worked for rehabcare/kindred for over 8 years. When they were rehabcare I truly felt appreciated. Do keep in mind that your experience greatly depends on your facility and facility director. However, at the end of the day, this company values money over people, profits over happiness, and keeping their contracts vs employees. And this IS company wide. I’ve worked at over 6 facilities during my time with them. I can think of 4 that were great. The other 2 had the same director who was and still is AWFUL. Lack of real management, lack of support and appreciation for therapists, favoritism, only thinking of their own bonus, company looks and making the facility happy vs employee happiness, allowing wrongdoing to happen and then stating they had no choice. Don’t get on their bad side or they terminate you as quickly as you can say goodbye."
bad,This company lost it's contract in the La Grange facility in May 2017. The while staff lost work and had to pick up open positions with the next company to take over the facility. Most staff lost jobs or went to another company when the company went under.
bad,"excellent rehab team in this facility.  different standards in different facilities and different standards for different employees. Some are able to be totally unprofessional ie; having inappropriate relationships with employees you are supervising, not really seeing patients when you say you are, picking on certain people not in your circle. Meanwhile you could be providing excellent care and really care about what you do. I've mostly learned if you speak your mind and see what is really going on you are to become a target. I truly enjoyed working with patients and the rehab team."
bad,"Poor management. Nursing staffs are not treated well in this Organization. I have nothing good to say about this job place."
bad,"Unsafe nurse-patient ratio, work overload, block scheduling, frequent cancellations due to low census, poor management (does not really take care of their nurses that’s why the best of their nurses leave)"
bad,we had an exceptional director then for no reason he/she was gone.  the interim cco(never met) we were told had a part for this along with the eco.  they have no loyalty

good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"long hours, large work load, no pay difference for sub-acute nurses, short staffed forcing us to get more patients. Rude patients and family members with no management support. Forcing nurses to deal with abuse"
bad,"preparing meal and diet restriction, delivering and picking up trays, cleaning the kitchen down, sweep and wash floors, dish washing and setting up the for the next meal."
bad,"This position was nothing as expected during the hire process. Unfortunately, this position included more that the job description specified and management was not supportive in providing help to maximize the demanding laundry list required of this position."
bad,"Working at Kindred is not for the faint of heart.  It took a great deal of stamina, determination, and asking a lot of questions to get through a day working at Kindred.  It is a great place to learn new skills and provide much needed patient care!"
bad,"Kindred staff are nice, the security management works you non stop and very rarely approves days off that you earn. Always getting called into work on days off, manager expects you to meet anywhere and anytime regardless of what you are doing"
bad,"Never got more than 15cents a year raises and mgmt doesn't care about you at all, mgmt pretends to care to your face, but does nothing for you like they say they will"
bad,"This was a tough environment to work in.  Nursing staff difficult to work with as a team.  The company cared more about productivity than anything else!  I was very disappointed with both the company and the facility.  Fellow Therapists were great, but a general low morale among them.  Glad I moved on!"
bad,Glad they are gone! worst management company ever. company treated patients badly. I did not enjoy my experience there.  company hires people out of favor not out of experience. worst company ever
bad,I enjoy the patients who are there for long-term care. The hardest part of the job is being so fast-paced that it is hard to leave with a feeling of accomplishment.
bad,Company has brought in the third CEO since the three year tenure that I have been there with multiple upper management layoffs.  Not recommended.
bad,Though Kindred Health care has it's advantages there is no room for advancement and the management does not look out for the employees.
bad,"Work environments are created by the people who work in them.  I found this work environment to be rather chaotic and inconsistent. Several employees were not properly supervised (held accountable) and allowed to overstep boundaries of professional behavior creating anxiety in fellow employees and patients alike. This created a problem getting employees to have a team approach as many wanted to distance themselves and work independently to maintain job security. Not all days were like this but the nature of an LTAC is to ""hit the floor running"".  Often acuity was not considered in the assignments and the expectations a bit unrealistic.  Higher management seemed a bit aloof and disconnected."
bad,Was hired to do a job that I had no background in and was giving NO TRAINING - finally they had someone from a different building come in to show me how to order supplies. When they got there I had no computer passwords. When I would ask for help I received none what so ever. On day 17 they gave me a written warning for not have the supplies needed and not doing my job. Needless to say I quit. What a joke of a place to work no wonder they can keep help. 
bad,Overall the diversity of equality for all is not practiced.
bad,"Stressful, short staffed, angry management, poor pt care."
bad,Very stable company. Has its UPS and downs. The people you work with make the job what it is
bad,High turnover throughout the past year. The work environment and training were not what was explained nor expected during the interview process. Limited training and unclear direction on job duties- causing late nights and stressful work days.
bad,"Never consider employment at this company "
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,The management was TERRIBLE! So much politics and back-biting. All they care about is money. They didn't care about patients. I tried very hard at first only to be lied to later on. No support. No education. No training. And then they yelled at you for failing.
bad,"You will learn everything here when it comes to basic fundamentals, however, the workload can be heavy at times as the patients at Kindred are post all ICU/DOU/Step down unit patients from big acute hospitals like San Antonio Regional Hospital and Pomona Valley Medical Center.  It is a team environment; 1 RN, 1 LVN, and 1 CNA for 7-9 patients on the med surg telemetry floors.  The nice thing about Kindred is the team environment, however, all staff members are paid on a low pay scale which causes poor staff retention and staff members leave to accumulate more money hourly.  I will say this though, you will see and learn everything there is to fundamentals for patient care in nursing. It is a great place to start if you have great time management skills and prioritize well."
bad,The emphasis on productivity takes away from the true meaning of therapy and patient care. Due to high demands relationships with co-workers are poor leading to decreased happiness in the work place. Poor leadership has lead to higher demands.
bad,"Never enough for this company.    Its always, What did you do for me today.   Very cut throat    People would be fired with no notice which kept the entire work force on edge.   Could never trust anyone including management to deal with any problems that I might have.   Most of my co-workers very unhappy and looking for new jobs at all times."
bad,"Working at an LTAC is extremely difficult and Kindred doesn't make it any better. The work is difficult. They want you to work as a team and my experience is that most people do but it is difficult to help someone else when you are inundated with work. The raises stink and based on merit as should be. Management has ""thier picks"" and gives them good raises and will start ""friends"" at higher rates than nurses that have been employed at Kindred for years. You work HARD."
bad,Kindred cant seem to keep any good employees because they don't pay their employees a fair wage. They mess up your paychecks countless times and its like pulling teeth to get someone to help you to fix any issues.
bad,You get paid well until census is low which is often. No team work unless you kiss a nurses butt and let her control your 12hr shift with out sitting down. And they don't help with call lights and butt wiping of there own incontinent patient. But when it gets to the end of shift they ask you all assessments of there patient they haven't seen all night shift.
bad,"I don't know how the hiring process works to become a director of rehab for this company; however, the level of incompetence of the DOR at my facility was infuriating. At St. Mary Medical Center in Hobart, IN, the DOR presents with a lack of leadership, empathy, and people skills. He is unfit to have this job and a lot of wonderful employees will continue to leave as long as he is in charge. I cannot speak for other facilities but I am sure the incompetence is spread throughout management."
bad,"It was with a company called Lubys, in the kitchen,  they had a meeting every morning about the food, recipes, etc. The Hospital staff made it all about the food. The staff and Lubys  management tried to make the cafeteria like a five-year star restaurant. They make a retail cook feel like nothing that you cook, make, or do is ever good enough. The job is so stressful and hurtful."
bad,"When I was hired I agreed to a specific set of responsibilities. Since then they have tripled without prior discussion or agreement.   Enjoying the people I work with and  what I do no complaint has been made. However, after surpassing the yearly marker of first year employment and then having to ask for an evaluation and raise  more times than I care for and still be ignored has me looking for another job.  What I’ve experienced is that the company dedicates more money to market the importance of showing appreciation and value for each employee than actually following through. Options? Only 2. Go to HR and then it’s only a matter of time I’m found to be the problem and be eliminated or find a new job.  Although a boiler plate response from HR will follow this post with instruction to pursue discussion without concern along with the number to the compliance hot line, my experience dictates that finding another job is probably the better solution."
bad,one person will do the job of 4. parking is bad food was okay but got worse. very nice people but bad work environment. everyone is looking to have someone else do there job for them. never really know whats going on.
bad,"Requires a complete overhaul of the management , have the will and determination to work hard with scant resources availed to staff. Poor staffing  coordinator, mostly short staffed"
bad,I worked for this company for numerous years and felt very unappreciated.  Most of my fellow therapists felt the same way.  We were made to feel like machines that had to meet production so our upper management could make bonuses.  And when they did not get a bonus they let us know we needed to pick up our game.
bad,poorly managed and kindred benefits are the worst of any hospital. they are very expensive and have very high deductibles. 401k with no employer match. Unsafe patient care ratios and not reliable hours.  AMAZING WOUND CARE staff!!!!!
bad,"Management does not care at all about their employees. Communication is non existent. RN staff are thrown onto the floor before orientation is complete. Supportive staff for complex problems are non existent. Wound care team is overworked and additional staffing is needed to adequately take care of the multitude of complex wounds many,if not all, patients have. Communication with doctors does not exist. Most doctors do not ask nursing staff what current problems the patient has, or if there are recent changes. Poor  support overall, and staff are overworked."
bad,I knew there was a problem with management from the first moment I started working at CTRH.  They never solved any issue.  Whether it was poor patient care or coworkers who were constantly absent or lack of morale; management refused to try to fix any issues.  I felt completely helpless.  I +uit when my nursing manager said she just didn't care anymore.  If management doesn't care why should anyone else?
bad,"The Clinical Liaison role itself, on a day to day basis, is interesting and enjoyable. One of the best advantages are that you are imbedded in your assigned hospitals and become one of the staff. This enables you to build deeper relationships with referring healthcare providers. "
bad,"kindred healthcare was terriabily understaffed and unsupervised, I do no recommend this to someone who values their work and time"
bad,"I began working in early March of 2014, I loved it, I was learning and growing and continuously developing my skill bet then the company began a reorganization and from that everything went downhill. The work became overwhelming. I can't recommend working here in good faith."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,very busy with very heavy loads to work with.  have lots of inexperience new clinical staff. pay is extremely low compare to other bay area hospitals.  unsafe work environment.  patient are often neglected due to short staffing
bad,"Management is terrible, there is no administrating skills from anyone, and the only way the company will work with you or your personal schedule is to say it's their way or the highway."
bad,Not a place for an LPN to work. Very hard getting ahold of a physician when you need one. Ratio of nurse to patient is too much for the severity of illness. These patients are critically ill with infections from all over. Always work  to do.
bad,"i enjoy doing the work but the management is horrible at this place, i would never recommend this employer to anyone."
bad,"The Rehab Director is the worst supervisor I've ever had in my life.  She doesn't care about the therapists that are working so hard.  She is unorganized and screws things up on a daily basis and then blames the therapists.  She doesn't respect the Therapist's clinical judgement about the patients or their rehab potential.  She only cares about getting the ultra high mins on patients, even when they are continually refusing to get out of bed or are too sick to tolerate the therapy.  Don't work here.  The census is declining, a majority of the patients are not rehab appropriate, you will be pushed to get high mins on patients who cannot physically tolerate high mins, Your professional, clinical reasoning is disregarded. There are no raises.  The health care coverage plans are terrible and expensive, It takes forever to get your reimbursement back for continuing education,  there is no room for professional growth.  This place is career suicide.   "
bad,Management has their favorites and lets them get away with anything. Benefits are horrid. They also cut hours when census is low.
bad,Not the best to company to work for (in my personal opinion) but its a job.
bad,"Hardest part of the job is not having the supplies necessary to take care of patients, ex: no juices, snacks, pouches to crush pills, applesauces for crushed pills, no ice or water, running out of filters for TPNs. I enjoy working with the people I do, they are always helpful."
bad,I would not work for this company again if it wasn't for the pay and the low pay from private facilities and lack of openings in my area. Do not recommend anyone work with this company if you have any moral/ethical integrity. Company turns a blind eye to ethic standards when it comes to productivity expected
bad,"No respect for nurses, upper management does not support employees. For new employees, if there is a problem with staff, they claim to take care of it, but don't. Charge nurse is lazy and treats everyone like dirt."
bad,"Management is out of control. Census is failing. 60-80 hours a week filling out forms and logging in sales calls into databases after having two census calls the same day to go over the same info. Ridiculous. Co-workers were okay although everyone complained about the company constantly, especially after they reduced our vacation and cut hours."
bad,"management is aloof "
bad,"The CCO's only concern is her bottom line, not at all concerned about the staff. They are cancelling staff members at least 2-4 times per 2 week pay period but they pick & choose whomever they want to cancel and ignore policy on order of low census cancellations. How are staff members supposed to make a living? To add insult to injury they are asking staff to contribute to a ""giving table"" to help another co-worker in need. Well if they would stop cancelling staff that coworker wouldn't be in such a predicament."
bad,The morale is extremely low  and there is no teamwork . Too many cliques and constant turnover. The good employees are usually forced out.The rotten apples stay.
bad,Kindred was a very chaotic work enviroment. It was very nasty unsafe. Horrible staff for the most part no wonder they closed down. I met five good workers that was dedicated to the well being of the residents.
bad,Don't expect to get any training. You are expected to know what to do and then never make a mistake. Your management will never even speak to you. I left job after 7 weeks. I sort of like knowing what I'm supposed to be doing
bad,"Poor quality of management."
bad,Kindred is a great start for new lpn/RN and the patient ratio is hard but if you stay committed you will be able to balance patient and use critical thinking.
bad,"The Nurses sit back and watch how well you work,and then they make you work harder. The only thing good about working at this place is the pay. Need more CNA's with skill."
bad,"I worked in dietary for five years was bullied by two staff members in my department told my manager and other office ppl they didn’t do nothing I was forced to leave my job of five years I can’t believe that place , on top of it I seen CNAs do things to residents and they never did anything to to them I’ve had family members complain about the poor care there family members was getting I don’t   Recommend  That place"
bad,this is a job to have while you look for something else. You are hired as a full time but have to use PTO to make up the shortfall in hours which happens more often than not. The lack of hours also raises fear of losing benefits.
bad,"Management is a joke, no appreciation for good workers, everyone is replaceable for cheap new grads, company first attitude, wage freeze because they push un ethical billing."
bad,The people r very nice but it long busy day the pay is very low doing Ekg strip 3 time day is a bit much...I work 3 12 hour day people r leaving left and right l learn a lot about telemetry
bad,"Hospital in Santa Ana is often understaffed, patient to nurse ratios are out of compliance, management promised a two dollar raise to all employees but ultimately it did not happen, often management will force you to work out of your scope of practice and add extra responsibilities thus creating a very stressful work environment, management appears to be more interested in earning their bonuses rather than foster a positive work environment for its nurses and staff that work directly with patients."
bad,Very stressful due to management pressures for productivity and building caseload especially Medicare part B insurance.  The company does encourage training and offers reimbursement.
bad,"My biggest complaints: 1) The director of rehab at my facility was beyond incompetent. So much so, that over 5 people that I worked with had complained directly to his boss within a few year period. I did the same expecting something to change; however, I quickly learned that corporate will always take the side of someone with a higher job title. If I had 5 complaints about me from patients/coworkers, I would have been fired. I felt ignored, and all of my complaints were pushed aside. "
bad,"Very busy short staff no supplies when needed over worked we had some great times with residence  ,its not easy being a resident at this nursing home the staff that have been there for many years are the back bone to this compahy"
bad,the upper management their was a joke. The E.D was a guy that didn't want to hear what was going on around the building. the Nursing department was some what ok. The days are long and stressful when others don't do their jobs.
bad,When working for a For profit Hospital you are run by census and number of patients. As a staffing coordinator I was required to staff according to the number of patients and intensity of their care. But when budget did not meet need patient safety and nurse care was compromised.
bad,"Worked for this organization for years. Started off great until our annual 2.5% max pay increase decreased to 1%. More and more responsibilities were added to the workloads decreasing patient bedside time without any compensation. It was impossible to finish your assignments and take your mandatory 30 min uninterrupted lunch and breaks with only one or two other busy coworkers covering up to 14+ patients each.  No one will cover especially management. "
bad,Management here sucks ever since we got a different ministry here a few years back the whole building seem like it went downhill from there I come in I do my job I don't say nothing to upper management anymore because it seems like when you do it gets thrown right back in your face I  used to love working here but now I don't
bad,"No satisfying growth opportunities, poor working environment- unskilled employees. Customer service is poor for all employees and patients; overall just no good."
bad,Very hostile place to work has been under transition since bought out in June have had many interim seals cno's Human resource reps and we're never told their names or their numbers iPad Mini staff journalist sense bought out has occurred very much nepotism and favoritism
bad,Very unorganized and nurses are not treated with respect. Over worked and undercompensated for the amount of responsibility we take on due to being very understaffed.
bad,"Lets begin by saying there is no job stability. There are weekly ""announced"" layoffs and not much chance for ""promised career growth"". The work environment is very hostile and all upper management for the district are caddy people who only care about themselves and love to brush issues under the rug if they think it will make them look bad- HR is absolutely no exception. There are promises of ""bonuses"" however they are VERY few and far between."
bad,"This hospital typically hires inexperienced nurses due to high turn over rate. The hospital will hire an abundance of nurses to cover the busy season instead of paying overtime and then start calling off when things get slow. Typical call off would be 1 day per week for several months, which always leaves moral very low."
bad,Too much favoritism occurs. No support from administration. Nurse manager is absent. CEO doesn't care. No recognition for hard working staff unless your friends with the managers.
bad,"Kindred transition and rehab of San Marcos is a Ghetto place to work  for. No organization at nursing station. Papers are everywhere.  They don't offer proper training. They aren't welcome to new staff. It smells bad, and their priorities are all wrong."
bad,"I loved working with my customers and dealing with patients and families that requiring our level of care but as far as my employer, a different story. It was always a more,more,more mentality without regard to work life balance. I felt like a commodity versus a teammate."
bad,People were great Interested in their patients. Management was pretty inconsistent most of the time.
bad,Company is poorly managed and organized. Employees  must meet unrealistic productivity quotas and therapists are pressured to treat inappropriate patients and keep them on caseload. IT support is disorganized and spotty with overall poor resources for employees. No motivation or support to improve job performance--no raises or any type of incentives. No positive feedback or performance appraisals--only negative feedback. Poor overall moral at my facility. Very fortunate to now work for a company that is professional and well-run!.
bad,This was an ok place to work overall. The therapy team was excellent as noticed by patients improvement. Other departments did the best they could with what they had. Due to shortages the employees were worked like animal and in the end the residents had to pay. This place is neglecting the residents and its not the workers they do the best they can its the managers at the corporate office who are money hungry and not giving this facility the supplies they need to run a good business. The administrative director has to shovel the snow and unclog the toilets. There are no maintenance  workers. Overall this facility is just ridiculously poor.
bad,"This company lacked consistency in expectations, as well as respect for employees, and a distinct lack of ethical values."
bad,"This was my first ""real"" job after graduating college. Even though this was not in my field, I still learned a lot from this position."
bad,"I am a registered nurse with a B.S.N. Throughout my employment at Kindred, I never received a salary increase. I started at 24.63 /hr and my salary stayed at that amount. I usually worked at night so I could receive a deferential. Management was rarely seen on the floor.DON did her best to belittle you at every chance. No matter what you did , it was not good enough.Very toxic environment to work in. Some of my co-workers would sell you under the bus at a moments notice,  I am not a new nurse, Prior to becoming a RN ,I had been an LPN for 10 years I had been an R.N for 5 years..Younger nurses with less experience were paid more money. I worked very hard. I didn't sleep at night. I never called out . I was not appreciated as as employee."
bad,"This had to be the worst job I had ever had.  The company's culture is not what I thought it would be. Co-workers will throw you under the bus.  Management shows favoritism. DON""T even think of applying.  "
bad,"Kindred has been taken over by people only interested in the bottom line. The company has gradually reduced benefits and compensation. Over the past three years the company has stopped contributing to the 401k, taken away 7 days of PTO, reduced the maximum number of PTO days allowed to be accrued, and given no raises (yes, three years without a raise). The company requires therapists to leave during the day if there is not enough treatment minutes, yet they want you to be available for full time work. The rehab managers are micromanaged and have completely unrealistic quotas to meet. The productivity requirement has been raised to a point that there is pressure on therapists to be unethical in provision of treatments. The building management is under pressure to cut costs; so you can imagine where they cut. Patient care has degraded significantly. My coworkers were great. They really were family. I still enjoy helping people and working with patients, but I will never work for Kindred or RehabCare again."
bad,"Low moral, difficult supervisors and administration. Coworkers can be decent. I do enjoy the patients. I love what I do but not where I practice."
bad,"No support from management, not enough aids on the floor, nurses sent home daily due to census, no job security, management never complimented on your hard work, absolutely no team work. The most enjoyable part was making my patients day better and knowing I was helping people."
bad,"i worked for kindred/rehab care and they push high productivity, and monitor you to the minute with a hand held ipod device where you have to enter every minute of your day and tx start/stop times. they push RUGs, and will take any type pt. even those completely inappropriate for therapy"
bad,"This facility caters to every type of patient, from trach, dementia, MS etc. So if you are looking for a place that you can gain experience in various work sitiuations"
bad,I hated it. Most of the nurses also hate it. 10 patients on a medsurg unit are more like 12 to 14 patients at easier hospitals.  Everyone is extremely overworked.
bad,"I worked for Home health department of kindred health care. The pay and benefits are decent comparing others. However, senior management doesn't care about clinicians. Not at all. I was laid over with severance package but got no notice for it. It came all of a sudden. It took a while before I could find a new job. It was extremely stressful."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Productivity is focus, unsupported by management.  No matter how hard you work you are not seen as anything but a productiviy number.  Reconfigured market with placement of 3 buildings under 1 director.  No advancement."
bad,Started off great but now not so much .... Grateful to have a job in this day and time but looking to move on !!!! Compensation and Benefits leave a lot to be desired!!!
bad,Kindred Hospital is an okay place to work. Patient to CNA ratio is TERRIBLE. Most CNAs are overworked and underpaid. The hours and overall patient census is always horrible and can cause CNAs and RNs to be either sent home early or cancelled from working! Not good.
bad,Would not return to work or send any family members there. Would not return there or place family member there. Not a good experience at all. Loved my residents.
bad,Every member of management has poor communication. Benefits are really expensive. There is no accountability which is why the turnover rate is high. Pay is just ok.
bad,Admin both local and Corp try to push unethical practice not in the patient best Interest. No administrative support as well as HR support. Constant employee turnover.
bad,I can’t view them I still work here but this was a great place to work and the people that were here was very easy to work for as long as you did your job
bad,Kindred is not the place for an experienced nurse. It may be beneficial for new nurses looking to gain experience. The staffing ratios are horrible. The patients are very rude ad disrespectful and management allows them to constantly disrespect and degrade their staff.
bad,"LTACH airway management and weaning protocols were well defined. The multiple airways and situations were interesting. It was a unique challege, testing skills regularly."
bad,Unorganized and unprofessional work environment. No proper training or sense of teamwork. Too much gossiping (even up through management). Very stressful and negative workplace.
bad,the training is inadequate. the staff is always short staffed. the staffed  have little or no input on patient care. complaints go unheard. constantly overworked. there is no teamwork within the organization. To high of patient load for staff to give quality of care.
bad,With the high amount of turnover it is difficult to understand expectations.  I have worked with 8 different CEOs the past 2 years.  This place does have potential but they need to work on the quality of prescriber interaction with the medical staff and patients.
bad,Unreasonable expectations. Insincere colleagues and management . Lack of team support. Do not recommend in the central Texas area. Flexible schedule. 6 day work week.
bad,I use to love my job until Kindred was sold and has really become a stressful place to be. We use to have enough staff to do our jobs efficiency and now the entire staff run around like crazy people trying to get everything done. All departments are under staffed and its all about money not patient care.
bad,There was a lot of radial tension. I felt bullied on several occasions. I felt alone and could not wait to get out of there. No wonder that facility closed.
bad,"The staffing was short at best, 3 CNAs for roughly 48 patients. Rude employees and poor management. Really an overall poor place to work, had it not been for my patients I would've left it long before my maternity leave."
bad,"Majority of pts are total care 200-500 lbs+ unable to turn. Isolated contact precautions on nearly all pts. Most pts have trachs. Help is hard to get when short staffed especially weekends. All floors smell horrible. RN/LPN to patient ratio 1:4, CNA to patient 1:9 if full staffed, 1:18 mostly.  Ratio based on 2nd floor med/surg having the most filled rooms. Small hospital not much offered for someone wanting to a large range of experiences or advancement. Pay needs to be better for how short staff it is and the patient care provided."
bad,"Like most contract therapy companies, the main focus is on how many billable units can be squeezed out in the work day. Very little if any time is available to focus on documentation, building a viable job culture or treating the patient as an individual. "
bad,The Nurses here never wanted to assist with some care. You will be extremely tired when you leave for work. Your never ever acknowledge for the good care you provide and management can be very condescending.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Too much micro managment and interference.  Job responsibilities are not delineated according to job description or role.  Daily instances of emergent situations that become non emergent or critical thereafter i.e. all smoke no fire.  Too much time spent with poorly performing or inattentive colleagues and underlings.
bad,Prefer not to give a Review. Not supportive of staff. NOC gets on recognition For their work of taking care for the patients with no back up resource.
bad,"Slow work place "
bad,"Chronic mismanagement on all levels.  Overstaffing and intimidation rampant.  ""If you cant work weekends I'm sure I can find some new grads that can.""  Good luck calling HR or compliance, you are treated like an annoyance.  Pay was fair, if you could ever get a 40 hr work week, though they still brought in PRN...curious.  PTO was very fair as well, they let you roll it over.  Would recommend for a short term way to build some money, but I would not bank on a long term career here.  I was with them for over 7 years.  Solid c-"
bad,I worked eight hours a day. I worked five days a week. Management was always changing. People did not feel secure in their positions. I did enjoy the people I worked with.
bad,"I would go to the home that I would take care of my patient. I would sign in and take a look at what the patient needs, what they will eat, if they needed any meds. I would look to see if there were any errands to be made or appointments that needed to be made. taking care of the patients needs and wants and making sure that they wer comfortable. Documentation was one of the main priorities especially as a in home caregiver.."
bad,Upper management are extremely difficult to work with.  I feel bullied and unrespected as a female in this organization.  The hierarchy is male oriented and the lack of respect for females is well known within the facility. The workplace culture is stressful and always edgy due to the hostile environment.
bad,"The work is none stop. They expect 12 hours of work from an 8 hour day. That includes unpaid work from home.The people there are great, the management is rather wanting though."
bad,"RUN!!!!DON'T look back! Nurses are not very nice and click to their group with their Charge Nurses. Nurses bring food everyday for themselves and if you don't do what they do, you are outsider and they make you want to quit. The doctors don't respect nurses and the administration couldn't care.Compensation well below the other hospital with their so called ICU units. Other hospitals pay  52-58 dollars/hr but kindred only 41/hr. Very high turn over of NURSES!"
bad,Upper Management and supervisors hard to deal with.  On the job training not adequate. Negative attitudes. Loved the floor staff and patients.  They made the job tolerable.
bad,from day one treated staff and residents like objects not human. the residents were why I was there. but had no time to give the type of care I wanted to give.
bad,"good workers, wonderful hospice aides, some lack of communication which made field work difficult at times with some duties remaining undone or not done in a timely manner. Wonderful nurses to work with, sadly management not, very organized and sweet HR nurse and Social workers,"
bad,Management and staffing problems  would be amazing place to work once the issues are fixed. I couldnt continue to work the sixty+ hr
bad,"working for this company has gotten progressively worse with each passing year.  upper management and executives enjoy hefty compensation and bonus' while ground level employees continue to work with no raises every year.  opportunity for advancement is non existent and the company is too large to care if the entry level employees are maintaining job security/hours.  Considering the size of the company, benefits are below average.  compensation is average but there are no raises, merit increases, or cost of living increases."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Kindred hospital San Diego is a horrible place to work for. The management does not care about it's employee's. for one year the snuffed us on raises. Hr is baised and really doesn't have the employee's interest at hand. this place is a hostile environment. If you read around these reviews you will see this is a reoccurring problem for all of Kindred.
bad,"Just a big meat grinder. One big ICU but w/o the staff to adequately care for pt's. Nursing with up to 7-8 pt/day. RT up to 16/day. Upper management insensitive to what goes on on the floors as long as census is up. They know state won't shut them down because who else is going to take these patients?  Physicians not aggressive to wean; too much money to be made on on sick, ventilated people."
bad,"Most of the patients needs are IV fluids,you will be administering them the entire shift,also giving IV push med the entire shift. the documentation requirement is horrendous!!!  its just too much and not worth the pay."
bad,Working for this company is not for the weak.  The pace is fast and the patient load heavy.  Policies change on a daily basis and the turnover is extensive for higher management. Supervisors are petty and do not provide leadership.  They are reactive rather than proactive.
bad,great company!!!!! This is a ventilator facility. On a typical it was fine the staff was different they was a variety of different attitudes and no ethics is what I found out. I don't like it there because i'm use to people that care about what they do and most of there staff doesn't. I'm looking for and ethical environment is what I'm use to being around a hospital that cares about they patients I'm in this field because of my passion for patients or clients.
bad,"Job Work/Life Balance - 3 stars, because your shift ALWAYS runs over because you can NEVER finish your work in the time allotted due to ridiculous patient/nurse ratios. It is not uncommon for a 15-23 nurse to still be charting/finishing admission paperwork at 0300."
bad,Not a good place to work was better in the past but has had a lot of changes and not for the better.
bad,"Poor management. Values very poor of staff members. LPN's and RN's care is very blurred and not following Ohio Nurse practice act."
bad,at the end of the day it was a job.It could have been a little better.
bad,"Facility is outdated, meals lack, staff burned out due to continuous staff shortage. Unorganized. The admission process is a nightmare for a nurse. No unit clerk. Training for different wings is non existent. Too mant call ins...if a nurse cannot be replaced to come in, you will be working min of 16 hours. Rns in management do not EVER step up and say they will take the shift so the burned out nurse can leave. Admission coordinator promises anything to get residents in, then staff on the floor has to deal with family that is very unsatisfied. Residents suffer the most. Need major overhaul."
bad,"Arrive for 12hr shift. I visit each patient and check on their well-being.Immediately check T/P/R/BP, Blood glucose,check repositioned patients, make sure all are comfortable. I am learning wound care and how to foresee upcoming problems. My co-workers are dependable and caring. We compliment each other thru our work ethic. The hardest part of this job at Kindred is telling a patient we don't have the food items they're requesting nor do we have the items for their wound care. I enjoy most the look on a persons face when they recover and are able to walk out and return home."
bad,"A typical day started at 8 a.m. with Business Development Officers calling in for contract proposals 5 minutes before closing time. While they courted prospective clients on the golf course, we were expected to stay ridiculous hours, with very little appreciation. This organization was one of the most clique-ish offices I've ever worked in. No wonder their classified for the job read ""must have a good sense of humor"". I thought I did until I worked here."
bad,I feel this company is all about profit and places that over quality of patient care. I wish the Dept of Justice would take a much better look at the length of stay of patients
bad,Helped to pay bills at the time. I stayed 3 months. No one really stays there. Pay isn’t based on experience. Felt burned out at the end of the shift.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"..you will work hard for your money!"
bad,Management is NOT GOOD. They DO NOT care about nurses and CNAs. No support from management and all they care is profits. DO NOT work here. Charting system is a joke. Nurses work hard here but NO acknowledgement from management especially if you are NOC. You also will get written up for speaking your mind. Also benefits are laughable. This is not a good place to work at.
bad,No advancement  no follow no annual review had to leave mistreated as a black woman in the work place and through the company played so much favoritism it was sicking
bad,"Upper management comes off as being very employee oriented. But, wen it gets down to it, they are. Productivity reigns supreme and they are willing to compromise quality for productivity."
bad,"I would not recomend working for this company... this company does not care about it’s staff.. "
bad,"I was employed years ago, so things may have changed... "
bad,Patients need more supplies to care for them. There is always short staff with the cnas and nurses. Management needs work. Benefits are not that great.
bad,The kindred hospital is closed down. The one in glendora. It's a different company now. It was a rehab and long term nursing home. So not sure how the new company is doing.
bad,Won’t  work with this manager again.  I asked for a day for a day for bereavement when grandmother passed and she never got back to me. Is one of many issues .
bad,"friendly nursing staff"
bad,This Job is horrible you are under paid and the way they treat patients is Horrible. If you work here you will not be employed for long. Seek employment elsewhere.
bad,"No longer a fun place to work.  Staff morale is at an all time low, hours have been cut and leading them to seek out other jobs. What use to be a family atmosphere is a now a distant memory.  I learned a lot during my tenure at Kindred and was afforded opportunities to expand my knowledge by learning from all areas of the hospital."
bad,Pay was good.  Management was fair and approachable.  Hours good.  Work load too much. Redundant requirements in documentations.  Staff is not friendly most of time due to hard work load.
bad,"Kindred's management is extremely attentive to the RN's they employ, my reason for moving on from Kindred was actually their tolorance for patient neglect. I became a Nurse because I wanted to take care of people. Kindred's RN's and MD's actually frowned upon this ""patient 1st"" mentality, several fellow RN's and a few MD's that actually resented me for my desire to care for the patient's we were responsible for."
bad,RehabCare never gives raises.  RehabCare bases a workday on increased productivity.  RehabCare never acknowledges the hard work of an employee.  Insurance programs are not good programs.  Does not provide 401K contributions unless employee contributes.
bad,There were a lot of unethical occurrences with this company that resulted in corporate staff either being terminated or quitting  which left the staff on site uncertain about job security.
bad,"Tell you to follow rules in training, but when working....break them."
bad,Worked for the company for 8 years. I am not interested in sharing any further information about this company. I do not work for this company anymore.
bad,"A typical work day is coming into work and printing out my list of patients to have blood work and starting my rounds, then if there is a code blue or respiratory alert I must stop rounds an cover the blood work for that."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"12 hour shift assignments, 1:6 nurse:patient ratio. Multi system failure residents and long term patients with extensive completely dependent needs. Very difficult environment to give quality patient care."
bad,I would happily still be working there if they hadn't decided to close.
bad,"Very disorganized, patient ratio is high, and the computer system is old. Patients are most of them total care, High turn over of staff do to stress and poor management The only thing it maters is the number of admissions."
bad,High acuity of patients and wound care nurses does not do all wound care. Primary nurse has to do all wound care on Sunday  Pt. load is heavy. No charge nurse. Nurses have to call their own doctors.
bad,"Management had cliques. If a staff member was not liked by a member of the clique, all members of the clique would make that staff member's work experience miserable. Middle management would see it but were powerless to help the staff member lest they also would become targeted. Since part of management was part of the clique you really had no one to report problems. As HR knew of issues you really couldn't go to corporate either. Staff that went to corporate no longer work there."
bad,"A typical day would be expectations  92 % very busy, had a good supervisor who was some what flexible. The facility had a tough clientele, many homeless, drug attics and alcoholic types. I enjoyed my rehab team and most nsg staff. Management always texting manager if productivity low or not starting pt on time on ipads"
bad,I enjoyed Kindred I needed the experience and so I stayed for six months and I built a connection with the staff they were great for the most part but very busy days ofttimes you have more residents than you can handle due to lack of nurse.
bad,short staff. facility not convenient for employee and residence. elevator not working. staff are friendly and resourceful. supportive to each other and to residence
bad,"I loved working with the residents and the staff. The management needed improvement. I was constantly working short staffed. Most 8 hour shifts I would not receive a break nor a lunch. I do know that since I left the company, a different company bought the building and removed the previous management, so it may have changed now."
bad,well I wouldn't recommend it since the hours fluctuate too much and you never know if you'll get a full day of work or not. Sometimes (and I think this may only be at my building) the people can be very catty.
bad,No balance within the company high turn over rate. They had three ceo in a two year period. Lots of employees would quit because of the way they were treated by management.
bad,I was lied to from the interview on. I was told things would be one way but they were another. The unprofessional behavior from the manager was way too much to make the stress of not having support staff worth while.
bad,"Leadership sucked, lack of work-life balance, pay was fair, lack of management advancement.  Would recommend that the company better train their managers"
bad,I find Kindred to be an unfair and an unprofessional working environment. Those in management always take time to criticize their employees and rarely  reward good deeds. I would not recommend this Job to anyone.
bad,"Senior leadership was ineffective, unrealistic, and inefficient. The expectations are unrealistic for the nursing staff and the medical director is a joke."
bad,Not enough workers lots of patients not enough time to take care of everyone food is alright litany of overtime a lot of workers call in all the time management is ok
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Run fast from this company management is the worst only care about there bonus long hours and a lot of paperwork on pay per visit so you do many hours per week without pay do not except a raise ever with this company the only people that get raise is management a lot of travel and they make it impossible to see how much you get paid per mile even your pay check is very hard to figure out this is by far the worst place to work also there is no support from management at all you are on your own
bad,"Learning about different culturals."
bad,I believe kindred hospital was a great place to further my phlebotomy skills and techniques. On a typical day I draw all the patients and send out specimens. In regards to management I believe there can be improvement. I feel that at times its very unorganized. The hardest part about working at kindred would be working with the nurses. They're very unprofessional.
bad,"I worked for the company for about two and a half years and we went trough four different program directors. Rehabcare is now being sold to a different company. The company and the facility are financially centered. They make all decisions for patients based on money and try to keep them there longer than they need to be or send them home too early. The turnover is very high for all positions, especially management. Therapy Management is by far the most unorganized and micromanaged program. The director is unprofessional and favors certain employees.  I would highly recommend NOT working for this therapy team, atleast this location."
bad,Bottom line is it's an every man for himself kind of job. Kindred has a hard time keep employees because management sucks. I've personally seen doctors get frustrated because multiple orders had been ignored.
bad,"This place is the worest place i have ever worked at. The work environment is ridiculous. The CNA staff are good, is the management that is trash. They work there staff to the ground. Than when you can't do your job they want to fire you."
bad,"light cleaning, washing clothes, washing dishes, making beds, changing linen, light cooking something a walk around the track, picking up medicine from pharmacy, and combing and brushing hair."
bad,"Visiting patients,hardest part of the job was the charting,too much,management was ok, no new learning experience regarding position. Orientation program was too short. The most enjoyable part of the job was visiting the patient's"
bad,"The worst part of this job is being belittled by supervising nurse staff.  Management staff are rude and down right mean to floor staff. The shifts are poorly staffed leaving nursing and aides with too many patients to care for. Overall, great place to potentially lose your nursing license."
bad,"The fun part of working in a Rehab Hospital is the collaborative work from the Rehab Doctors to Attending Physicians, Case Managers, PTs, OTs, STs. dietary  etc. In this job I learned to be an effective patient advocate."
bad,A typical day included orienting new employees. Management and staff was a rotating door. Co-workers were afraid to report anything for fear of their job. The hardest part of the job was you could never tell the truth about the care. The residents are always the best part about a nursing home.
bad,"great nursing, many had a lot of experience in the Medical world. Not much support from Headquarters in Louisville. Always cutbacks or lay-offs so they can buy other small medical facilities."
bad,I enjoyed working with this company but would like to stay neutral on my review. The hands on staff are really caring. I hear they are leaving LTC and I am not familiar with the other part of the company.
bad,"The job itself was nice, enjoyed being around and interacting with all sorts of people. The owners of the bar Peanutz Bar are racist though and very ignorant."
bad,"Very unprofessional atomesphere, poor management.Acompnay that has gone down recently. No Sructure the list goes on...."
bad,Worst hospital to work for very lazy staff patient care was not a concern only making money was their concern. Those agency nurses are horrible and the manager was the worst manager ive had in my entire life
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Management kept changing. Making it difficult to keep with a consistent routine. Co-workers were great but department heads were in constant conflict.
bad,"patients are always willing to learn, and do what is asked of them to be able to return home. Very few co-workers who are willing to help one another, poor teamwork with in nursing staff. Management does not show interest or concern when it comes to what staff members have to say."
bad,This was a per diem job. Would have been great if I was provided more working shifts. Interaction with the patients at this hospital greatly helped with my bedside mannerisms.
bad,Very unorganized and high turnover in many different positions across the board. Would not recommend Kindred as a decent employer.
bad,"ventilator and nursing support for ventilator dependent clients, medication administration and treatment performance for staged wounds, I have learned a new type of nursing ventilators. the hardest part of the job is meeting all the disciplines needs for the client the long term care is new for the company as well somewhat disorganized the most enjoyable part is the residents"
bad,Was a nice place to work. a new field of work i became accustomed to. Great hours were offered. Not flexible on scheduling when it came to 'sick days'
bad,"Very little orientation was provided.  Enjoyed the job while I was there, however, shortly after being employeed by organization, was presented w/ a career opportunity I did not feel I could turn down"
bad,"Company itself is undesirable.  No raises for the past three years.  No 401K match, no opportunities for advancement and no team building opportunities.  Hard line between revenue producers (therapists) and corporate.  Company is nothing more than an 800 phone number-from which you get no answers or support."
bad,"No open door policy, poor communication with staffing, hard work environment."
bad,"I already reviewed this employer.  I passed meds x 2 on pm shift, treatments, transcribe doctors' orders, ordered tests, scheduled appointments, dressed/undressed, ambulated."
bad,"pay was terrible for the hours I put in, bad management, cant keep employees, aids are terrible with there patients"
bad,"i typical day at work for me has been very stressful. i feel overworked and under appreciated. All though in the past ten years i have learned  "
bad,"They were just not a good company to work for. If you displayed intelligence and efficiency, you were treated as an enemy.Nothign short of work place harassment and on occasion, sexual harassment.  No teamwork whatsoever. Departments compete against each other rather than work for a better working environment. Any personal accomplishments especially in customer service is met with resentment by other staff. Jealous management will stifle advancement out of fear and paranoia you may be awarded THEIR position if you prove to actually be competent. Alliances will be formed via petty office politics and even conspire to be rid of you for showing initiative and caring about doing well. Even former Director of Nursing was allowed to ""go after"" people which resulted in high turnover rate. Not a pleasant working experience. Extremely hostile work place environment. Kindred did very little to alleviate this despite all of this unprofessional behavior being against their policies. Kindred eventually simply sold building rather than actually address problems. Patients were a joy to work with however."
bad,This facilities staff has little to no concern over patients over all well being. Nursing rehab relationship is poor at best. Patients are rarely gotten out of bed.
bad,"Poor team work, prejudiced management"
bad,High pace work environment everything must be accurate.  Management has thought me a lot.
bad,"Administered nursing care under direct supervision to assigned residents/patients in order to achieve maximum level of independence; planned, organized and implemented care & rehabilitation programs; ensuring the smooth daily operation of the nursing and rehabilitation center in a diverse group of nursing assistants and support staff; kept accurate records of blood pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature, height and weight; gave routine care to pre and postoperative and pre and postpartum patients; basic procedures such as applying dressings and bandages, aseptic practices and cardio-pulmonary techniques; reviewed and recommended supplies needed for rehabilitation facility."
bad,Approxiamtly 20-25 portable xrays on ventilator patients.  CT on an as needed basis which is usually 3-4 a day.
bad,"Most of the people are nice, except my boss. He was easy to work with the first day after that, if i as so much as walk by he would roll his eyes, or talk to me while walking away. Never ""showed me everything he knows"" like stated after i was hired. I guess it depends on who youre working for here."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,This company pays well but be prepared to spend your life at work 24/7 365 days a year. Support from corporate level was low with high expectations with little back up. It used to be a great place to work but many changes occurred which made it impossible place to work.
bad,"This place was a terrible place to work, dirty, no supplies, no staff and a management team that sat around and did nothing. We we always understaffed, lots of work related back injuries. Management really not helpful, they would sit around and do chart audits and find missing details and then want it fixed now.The facility was smoke-free so the smokers would leave and drive around the block to smoke, while non-smokers picked up the slack."
bad,"Did not have adequate amount of help, the co workers were fine. There was an extreme amount of work for cna's"
bad,"The Pharmacy Department was open fron 7:30AM until 9:30PM, and even though the nursing staff knew this, they still expected me to stay there all night long. I lost 40 pounds the first 6 months of the job because they would not allow me to eat supper; since I am Type 1 diabetic, this really put me in a bad situation. After I resigned (a situation which was forced by the DOP of the Arlington facility), in my exit interview (conducted via telephone from Lexington, KY), I was asked if I would consider working for Kindred in the future. I responded NO, because I felt that Kindred had second-rate physicians, third-rate technology, and, for the most part, fourth-rate nurses."
bad,"understaffed, no job security, more worried about bottom line than quality patient care"
bad,Very hard place to work for .There is not much team work. The best part is the Patients they are so thankful for anything you do. I liked caring for the patients needs.
bad,Decent company but the experience is solely dependent upon who's in charge; the values and overall culture are not instilled from top to bottom.
bad,"Horrible management at this facility. High rate of staff turnover. Patients are acute care, meaning alot of meds, treatments, trachs and g-tubes. Patients themselves are great, but job is very overwhelming. Training is lacking. Great learning experience but not a long term option."
bad,"overworked with little time to take a break, the family was great. when a issue or problem arised hard to get help"
bad,I feel there are no incentives to grow in the  company.  I have not had a  raise in 2 years.  I mainly hear negative feedback versus positive.  I build positive relationships with my patients and co-workers.
bad,"As an employee for 14 years, company was bought out and no jobs were offered at end of year.   We were not offered to remain with Rehabcare or transition to another building.  I personally would not work for this company again.  What I can say they were advanced with technology and documentation, and reimbursed continuing education."
bad,"Used to be a great company but now they are empire driven and think HIGHLY educated people won't notice the offending trickery they pull. They take or reduce benefits then try n trick you into thinking they are wonderful because your getting a great deal by getting them back but they are either less than before or there's a new fee associated to have it to reduce their cost for offering it. Rising insurance rates, decreased HSA comp, Reduced driving comp, took away 401 match but gave it back with reduced ÷ and charges you fees to maintenance it, give you a few cent raise for 1-2 years, when ""hooked"" NO MORE RAISES!"" EVER!. My boss hasn't had one in 17yrs!!!! When you ask.... their in a ""raise freeze"" but expect you to do more work or ask you to step up in supervisor roles with no increase then go n buy up as many hospitals or med facilities as they can, shove it in your face by advertising it through numerous work emails and then sends you usless penny trinkets for rehab week or anniversary gifts. They over spend, give bonuses and cost of living to corporate, upper management and forget those that MAKE them thier money. They need to appreciate the great employees they have so they stop leaving and stop worrying about being EVERYWHERE and having their hands in EVERYTHING! Quality not quantity Rehabcare/Kindred!"
bad,Was a per diem phlebotomist on the night shift.  Your basically working by yourself or with onther phlebotomist. There rate of pay is very out dated for someone who has over 12 years experience.
bad,"The good part is, there is lots of room to learn and grow as a new grad. The cons are that the administration is tough to deal with due to motivation by money vs providing best patient care."
bad,Good as a training place. There not a lot of extra benefits other than suitable vacation time and pay. There is too much focus on operating expense and not on employee training.
bad,"During the short time I worked for the company, I had 3 different supervisors and one of the locations closed.  There were rumors of other locations closing and morale was low."
bad,"I think for such a small place it's way too much side drama. The food is good here and more than most of the techs are pretty nice. "
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Understaffed in all areas"
bad,"My typical day at kindred hospital was to collect on aging accounts for commercail claims from arizona.  I had five accounts which included: phoenix, tucson, scottsdale, north west arizona and denver, co.  I  also worked managed care, medicare advantage and kaiser hmo plans. "
bad,"AWFUL PLACE!"
bad,"There is a bully employed at this Kindred. She is right under the nose of administration and corporate. Open your eyes, Kindred!! This type of bullying would not be acceptable in a school, yet Kindred condones this type of behavior in their managers. Employees are dropping like flies here, either being fired or quitting left and right, in the past year or so. Ironically, this bully has been employed for this long. Coincidence?? Probably not."
bad,While working for this company there has been a number of changes.
bad,"It could be a great place to work at, brand new facility. Just hasnt gotten there yet, keeps getting worse in my opinion."
bad,"The management team at my specific location was a well oiled machine. Team concept very evident. Leadership was great, promoted change and advancement."
bad,"I have worked for the company for 10+ years, but my experience this last year has given me a negative attitude toward company.  I have had to take a cut in pay and they keep taking bu8ldings away from me so that I have short hours.  I get told to build the caseload in my one building so I can maintain my full time position, and if I can't, I get told that they will pull my benefits.  Before this time I enjoyed my time with the company and would refer other therapist to them."
bad,"While comp and benefits were good Kindred's culture is not for everyone.  Lack of communication and transparency at top leadership levels.  Employees do not feel valued, at least at corporate level. This was not the case when I first joined the company and has progressively gotten worse. Good employees who were at work on Monday are mysteriously gone by Friday. It wasn't until I left the company that I realized how much better management and culture can be with other employers."
bad,"It has taken the entirety of the 3 years that I have been in the this position for there to even be a discussion of better positions to further our careers.  The pay is atrocious.  The environment can only make up for so much after a while.  It has definitely been a great place to learn and practice skills, but not a great place for growth."
bad,"Worked for 4 years. No raises given once. No cost of living increases, nothing. Upper management completely out of touch with those in the facilities actually doing the work. They treat employees as numbers, and completely replaceable."
bad,The people aren't well attended to the way that they should be. They are left alone too often and they get mad when you take time out to show the patients a little attention
bad,"If looking for a place to work for a long time, do not apply here.  Managers are not looking out for you, only themselves.  It's shameful the few good employees aren't able to advance."
bad,"the staffing ration is rough, heavy 8/1. Skill intensive, these patients are sick!! Management is not very present at the ground level. staff is supportive of each other."
bad,The people at kindred were the best I ever worked with.they all became my friends and I loved it. Work seemed so easy when your with people who like you.Yes the place had a lot of negative things going on mostly due to the fact that management and corporation is under a lot of pressure to keep these poor patients alive and they get very little support from our goverment. I wish I could have kept my job there as I think god was helping me realize what really matters in life.Those patients suffer some much because of their injuries and sickness. I felt i was making a diffence and it felt good. Real good.

I felt i was making a diffence and it felt good. Real good.
bad,"Until about 4 years ago, it was a great place to work. I actually enjoyed going to work...but then all changed in many negative ways and attitudes. A lot of good people there, but many were pressured out and  total atmosphere became negative."
bad,"With Kindred unfortunately there are more cons than pros. The patients for very high acuity, and requires a lot of attention. Plus there just is not enough time in the day to complete all scheduled task, so the whole day is spent running around. There is no time to actual look up information on the patient. And there is very little if any help."
bad,The patient load is highly excessive due to a severe staffing shortage. It makes for a dangerous work environment not to mention the stress the residents to through daily by not being able to have their needs met in a timely manner.
bad,A typical day at work was doing caseloads for 8 staff and prns.  I learned that I-pads are more important then the pt. you need to treat.  My managers did not help with training nor were they supportive of there staff.  Hardest part of the job was working with the manager.  The most enjoyable part was my great staff.
bad,"not a good place to work. poor staffing ratios, not enough help, not a lot of resources. no one seems to care until something goes wrong then they try to fix things. the state keeps coming in there. too nurse driven and they are piling on more and more responsibilities daily"
bad,"Employees are overworked when staff is not complete, overtime is pretty much mandatory...patients complain about care they receive on a daily basis, bad nursing department."
bad,"The facility itself was nice, but the culture of RehabCare was not right for me. Productivity was pushed over patient care which was very stressful as I'm someone who strives to perform well but am more focused on patient care during treatment time. And you were allowed very little time for chart review, paperwork/gathering signatures, documentation, or filling out forms for patient updates - time spent on those things lowered your productivity percentage. Staff complained a lot about this making it a pretty depressing environment."
bad,"it is a sad place to work, the needs and well-being of the patients are not the concern of the management, only who strokes who's ego and which click has the most power. it is ashame really, has the potential to be a great company"
bad,"I was asked to do DC summaries and progress notes for patients that I had never met. The focus was on productivity/RUG levels. There was not enough support staff. I was encouraged to treat Medicare patients in groups to maximize productivity, sacrificing the quality of care.  Horrible experience.  Felt many aspects of the care were unethical. Now in a different state and wouldn't work for this company again......."
bad,"Overall - The job was very good  - RN's were very helpful  - most all of them help the CNA's when needed. Management  was available as well . Then we were canceled due to lack of patients -- some kind of issue with the State.  Had to look for other work."
bad,"Management was constantly changing and was always understaffed."
bad,"A typical day at work can be extremely frustrating"
bad,"I would have never taken this job had I known the weakness of the head director and nurse manager. The facility was terribly understaffed and, thus, resident care was extremely inadequate. Nurse to patient ratio was horrid and I am surprised a patient didn't die and a nurse not know. Nurses were overworked and underpaid and nothing was done even though there were constant complaints concerning the poor working conditions. I would never put a family member in this facility."
bad,"Benefits are not good for healthcare company.   To many management changes and unprofessional conduct of staff.   Turnover rate is high, but they don't do anything about it.   Need serious changes in management, nurses do their best but only so much you can do in this environment."
bad,"work intense work loads "
bad,Ensuring the best quality care is provided to all residents who reside in the facility. Adhering to state laws. Putting families minds at ease by ensuring the safety of their loved ones
bad,"Passed out food trays to the patient"
bad,"The people I worked with are fantastic people, hardworking, light humored and tempered. The only reason I stayed there so long was because I worked with an excellent crew. the management however falls short, everyone I ever talked to there said you couldn't really go to management for help because they'd ""nod there head"" but in the end nothing changed. My main concern however was that there wasn't enough time to do your job, everyone in the kitchen had to work off the clock, if not daily then often, to get their job done. Nursing also has this problem though I don't think it was as prevalent."
bad,• Billed all commercial insurance companies primary and secondary
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,Typically on my floor/wing in a work day I felt very overwelmed and taken advantage of.
bad,Not such a good benefit package/medical insurance and currently not the best leadership.
bad,"Stressful environment, learned how to assist with weaning patients from mechanical ventilation, and wound healing, management was unstable, my co- workers were wonderful, the hardest part of this job was not having enough staff and enough equipement and supplies to take care of patients and/ or staff"
bad,"Upper management needs to be trained to improve their management skills most especially in handling people., Most of them lack leadership skills. HR should ask employees to evaluate their Managers and Supervisors performance as well. It’s for the good of the company."
bad,"I have been with the company awhile now..I like the hospital environment but not there.They tend to play favorites a lot and penalize you if you don’t pick up shifts,stay late,etc.They do not give appropriate raises or heck raises at all sometimes;it took me 2 years to get a .20 raise!"
bad,"Just note the best experience with the facility and company. Stressed productivity too much and never at ease. High employee, rehab director, area director turnover"
bad,Rehab care is a good company that was bought by Kindred back in 2011.  They have an excellent therapy team.  They were always committed to excellence in patient care.
bad,"Lacking any plans for skills enhancement, there are no pathways for advancement, and no focus to deliver quality solutions to the user communities. Seems to be a constant backward spiral."
bad,"My time with Kindred Hospital was positive. It was my entry-level position in pharmacy, and it provided me with the necessary tools to advance my career at the time."
bad,From the interview to working I did not have a good experience here. The management is unprofessional. Very flexible and accommodating with the schedule.
bad,"I really love my hours, days I worked, and commute.  I dearly love some of my coworkers, but others won't even say hi! It is unbelievably cutthroat, how some coworkers won't even teach you as a new employee how to do things! Poor management and communication breakdowns, especially with specific Charge Nurse's having special employee's! Not a great place to work!!"
bad,Kindred has been bought out and I do not know anything about the new company. But if you are looking for experience as an LPN it will provide this for sure.
bad,There is no teamwork. Employees run the place with no real guidelines enforced by management. It's a very difficult place to work with no proper structure.
bad,"Facilitate referrals through customer contacts and professional presentation of facility compentencies.  Manage relationship with all customers and provide excellent service and management."
bad,"Heavy work load anywhere from 9-11 patients at a time. Most patient are either on or has vent,isolation,total care or phyc"
bad,"Pass all medications for 9am and noon, assist nurses by getting vital signs and anything else they required, and assisted CNAs and residents in all aspects of resident care, toileting, grooming, transporting to activities etc.The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing at the end of the day I have help someone."
bad,too much drama.I need a place that can help me to grow as a nurse
bad,Employees hours are cut while all Administrative salaried employees still receive full paychecks. 
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Initially started as great company, as have most over the last 10 years. With the development of hospital ""corporations"" comes the gamut of the corporate setting...we all know what this brings. I truly pride myself in being able to get along with all people in any given situation--Kindred was no different. We started as family and we ended as such, with the feeling of being more like step-children in the end (LOL). The times were great! All good things end...but I believe so that greater things may come. So for those of us who are looking, we must all look forward to greater things."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of much confusion, no organization, staff hating their job and how they are treated. Management does not stand behind you or encourage you to advance or give you an opportunity. You never learn anything new, it's very repetitive and there it no difficulty in performing my job and there is nothing that empowers me to work in such a place that operates and treats their staff as such."
bad,"Patients are very sick and there is so much work to do and steps to take in so little time. Management seems like all they care about is money, and staff seems to be overworked and underpaid. The most enjoyable part of the job are my co-workers; most are friendly and very helpful."
bad,a typical day is stressfull! I have learned a lot from this empolyer but its time to move forward. I need to find an employer who will utilize my skills and talents to overcome constant health care challenges that will provide less stress and pay more money.
bad,The work culture is ruff because the patients are very sick. The buildings in Tampa are old and falling apart. Your co-worker are great people. upper management only thinks about census when they need to update the building and the stand of care.
bad,Continued poor management with frequent turnover of nursing staff created a very frustrating work environment.Was initially given certain demographic regions for patient coverage but was forced to work in unsafe areas of Baltimore City
bad,"Kindred gives new nurses an opportunity to get experience and gain confindence in the field, the job is hard for the salary they offer. They also do not promote from within, I have been waiting for a promotion and still have not gotten it."
bad,I left here due to a bad manager but he has since left there - there are a lot of really great staff members and I have heard that the new manager is really great so my ratings here may no longer be valid.  It was a great place to work for many years but sadly not over the last 8-12 mo while I was there.
bad,"I find the staff and management easy to work with, and Kindred as a whole has a good reputation in the acute care industry.  The frequent turn over is based solely on their compensation.  I feel most individuals choose Kindred as a stepping stone to earn experience, as the low pay and limited chance for advancement is discouraging.  The Health Care benefits are fair, yet Kindred does not contribute to offset monthly premiums."
bad,I have not worked there for a while but poor management  at the time there was a lot of prejudice in hiring and promotion abilities. Rules only applied for a certain set of employee.
bad,"Very high equity patient needs, for the patient ratio of 9-10, not have enough time to do job at a proper setting. Short on equipment at times, management sometimes are understanding though."
bad,"typical day was traveling to sites and upgrading computers. "
bad,Great residents who truly appreciate the hard work you do. The layout is a bit different but if you work well with your staff it can be okay. Management could use some work.
bad,"This place has way to many unsafe practices, how can one give GREAT care with the patient ratio and falty equipment or lack of supplies.  If one is a money hungry person the is always the opportunity for OT and extra hours, but personally the longevity of my license is way more important."
bad,"I enjoyed working for RehabCare only because of my fellow therapists. The higher-ups pressure rehab directors to make every patient Ultra High and this is almost always inappropriate and unnecessary. When asked to lower minutes for an easily fatigued patient with limited participation, director stated ""just see them for 2 shorter sessions."" Management is made up of people who have either never treated or haven't treated in years, so they have no concern for the ethical standards of our occupations nor for the clinical judgement of their therapists. Also I never know if my day will be 4 hours or 10. If new MedA patients are admitted, I am required to conduct a full evaluation even if they have no needs."
bad,"Overall the work place environment is great, although we have had"
bad,"Training promised, but never delivered. If you are an individual who can learn and train yourself this is the company for you. If you need any guidance whatsoever...keep looking. Turn around VERY high with this employer"
bad,"How can I say this? I got hired in December and was looking forward to working there. Unfortunately, I have chronic pain and depression that caused me to miss some days during my orientation and was sick with a sinus infection at one point. I had a conversation with the hiring manager shortly after but the attendance policy wasn’t discussed at any point during that conversation or during orientation. I was just told to be careful of my absences. Another night came about that I couldn’t work. The staffing coordinator put me on the schedule for a different night and the next day I got fired via email. No steps of disciplinary action or paperwork. Maybe I should have seen the signs. This is a facility that has a high turnover rate, limited resources, and cancels shifts. Maybe it’s a blessing in disguise."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,I couldn't recommend anyone to work for this facility. It was all about them and not so much about the patients. Teamwork like pulling teeth. I left many a night upset.
bad,"Over all I am not pleased to work there. No good administration, cooperative, and patient care. The work place is unattractive. I do not have any other review comment."
bad,"great place to work, coworkers are easy to get along with. Some of which can use improvement on patient care. Management can be more involved with training."
bad,"it was  a very stressful environment, unrealistic productivity expectations. I never saw a raise in the two years of employment. When I was hired full-time I was not informed of a non-compete clause, in result I lost my job due to the negligence of the this company policy."
bad,"Work/life balance is considered, benefits & pay are not great but acceptable. Hardest part of the job is working Holidays or having to use PTO if you don't work. Best part is the work.life balance."
bad,Really hard work with not enough staff.  The pay is decent but you really work for every penny that they give you.  The staff can be rude and the patient load heavy.
bad,"This company depends entirely on who your DOR/Program director is as this can be a rather ""take advantage of my employee"" company. A good supervisor will make this job palatable."
bad,Working at kindred is not for the lazy or relaxed nurse. You are on your feet the whole shift and barely have time to get all your work done in the 12 hour shift. A majority of the patients have come from a short term hospital with complex medical issues and required high level of attention. Many on breathing machines and complicated wounds. Family is very needy and involved in the care. Usually short staffed with high turn over rate due to the stress of jon and low pay. GREAT place to learn and expand skills just very draining.
bad,"I enjoyed my work at Kindred Communications however, I felt personal conflicting political issues influenced the amount of work I received.  I feel professional and personal should be separate."
bad,Didnt really fit in just felt like the care for the patients was not as important to the staff like it should have been seems like they didnt take there jobs as serious as they should have
bad,I was part of the management team. It was a great learning experience. It was just not enough teamwork from the management team as a whole.
bad,"High acuity with multiple co-morbidities, difficult family dynamics, for profit hospital.  High patient ratio with minimal staff, employee longevity"
bad,When i arrive to work i am the first aide to arrive my staff is usually 15-20 mins late everyday.I go to get my assignment if there are any printed.I then proceed to stock my linen cart for my shift most of the time the linen cart is empty.I will say that the staff on my unit are helpful but the facility within it's self is very unorganized and typically there should be 4-5 aides on a unit we only have 3.yesterday i had to work short meaning 2 aides for 38 residents i would have to say this is the hardest part of my job because i cannot give quality care to each of my residents.the enjoyable moments are being empathic to my residents needs helping them with there daily activities and knowing im making a diffrence in their lives.
bad,Not a well respected department.  Overloaded with 16 hours of work or more.  No registry allowed so if someone calls off you pick up their load.
bad,bullying at the workplace.managment sucked. lazy nurses.
bad,Very devoted and hardworking staff.  The most enjoyable part of the job was enjoying the residents.
bad,"The company offers opportunity for career advancement. "
bad,"Typical days of work were extremely consumed with routine daily duties ex: Front desk operations, busy phones, call- lights. Admissions, transcribing orders, scheduling procedures, labs, diets and other medical necessities."
bad,The patients we took care of were total care patients. Some of the nurses were very helpful others were too busy with their own work load. As a team we would start at one end of the hall and complete our work load. Overall Kindred was a difficult place to work due to the lack of help or staff. But with the hope of helping patients and the help that was given it balanced it's self out.
bad,"My typical day of work started with clocking in, get assignment from the head nurse, get report from cna's who had your clients previously. Check on all patients to make sure they had there alarms on and to let them know that you are the cna on duty now and if they need anything to call you. check on all patients at least every 2 hour. i was assigned at least 16 patients per night. make sure everyone is safe at all time. i did transfers, feeding, changing, bathing..... ect. basically adl's and vitals. a very physical work experience "
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
bad,"Management is the worst I have dealt with. If you don't absolutely love what you do for the residents, this is not an easy place to work. The CNA's are great and very helpful. The majority of nurses are no help to other CNA's and spend most of their day standing around gossiping."
bad,overall great place to work but unflortunaly not very appicable with school hours and work hours.
bad,LTAC is a difficult arena. People don't typically know what LTAC is and what population they serve until faced with a difficult time. Lots of experience with many patients having multi-system organ failure.
bad,"Was a decent hospital to work for until they started cutting the hours for over 2 years, than finally closed the facility."
bad,"I was a nice place to work with the staff I had upper management was not always nice to deal with, poor communication between shifts, and not everyone worked together as a team"
bad,"It was very fast passed but many of the nurser didnt regularly give their patients medications at times and resulted in myself having to spend more time with that patient and less with others that needed the same care. I was working on the floor when i heard a patient screaming for help and the CNA had left the bed rail down and the patient fell to the floor and i called for assistance to help, I was very  worried that due to lack of staff that there could possibly be a law suit. I managed to multi-task and get the job done but i needed more staff to meet the needs of the patients."
bad,"Use to have 4 or at most 5 patients, now told 6 all the time. Really? Our patients are a lot sicker then the average medical surgical patient and yet now because of an ""acuty tool"" which doesn't capture all that we do, 6 is the norm."
good,Management was not organize. The ADON was not well organized and you could tell by the way she came to work to represent herself. I did love the pay form kindred.
good,"The management here wasnt good at all. The workers here wasnt treated fair. Alot of things went on here, that management should of resolved."
good,Company more untested in their bottom line than their employees. On site management is excellent. Lack of coverage is frustrating at times in this rural facility.
good,"Good place to get some entry level IT experience in all things iPad, iPhone, and some legacy systems such as AS400."
good,"I worked 5 days a week caring for an elderly lady.  I learned that I really love working with people.  I was very organized.  I didnt work with co-workers as I worked on my own.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with toileting issues, however that wasn't that bad at all.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my client.  She was amazing and a joy to be around.  A typical day at work was coming in, getting my client bathed and ready for the day.  We would hang out and talk and watch movies and enjoy each others company.  I would clean her house every day and take her to church on Sundays, which she loved."
good,Dont pay a living wage not a lot of hours But good people to work with very loving and caring Good If working ful time not good working part time on benefits
good,"hated working there, gave no consideration for help for 30+ patients to 1 CNA , certain patients got more care than other patients, staff members were snotty and rude"
good,There were major problems with patient care due to poor departmental management. Because of this reason the pay was not competitive with other facilities with the same types of positions.
good,"Days are hard, stress is high because there is not enough support for the staff working the floor. Management turns over too frequently.  There have been many vacancies, CEO, CCo, CM, Nursing Educator over the past 5 years yet a majority of the floor staff has stayed the same."
good,A lot is expected. Be prepared to work constantly.  You are responsible from open to close and weekends.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,I'm sure that all Kindred locations are not the same but this facility is suffering from lack of concern for the well being of staff and patients alike. The facility is poorly staffed and by doing so compromises safety and proper patient care. The workloads are heavy and management has little concern of the staffs well being and has total disregard when concerns are brought to their attention. Employees work with poorly maintained equipment and often are short of supplies. Sometimes staff does not get their full 30 minute uninterrupted lunch break. Much of the staff either is poorly trained or is just burned out. Raises were on hold for many years and now they are given at a rate of 1%.
good,"Not worth the time. If you want to catch up on skills real fast come and go. Yet how can you do that when you have no help from anyone? Favoritism is High! And rotation is out the door!"
good,wanted a change for an improvement to move higher and attain more skill. a great company for a starter who is ready to learn. A place where you can have a good relationship or long term care with a patient.
good,"Great people to work with.  We are like a family.  Poor management, horrible patient to RN assignments."
good,Slow decline in care for patients and staff.  Disorganized schedule would have to call in to find out if on schedule that day. Was told to come in and if low census would be sent home.
good,"Although they pay some of the highest CNA salaries in the city, you have to work extremely hard for that money. The patient to worker ratios are almost never fair to the workers, and they have no respect for your personal life at all. There is no room for advancement and there is a lot of favoritism displayed."
good,Floor nurses are respected but management and medical providers are at odds.
good,"I was hired to work for one person, who was hiring me for her replacement.  Typical day was chaotic, were going through an ACHA review.  The initial review was not good and we had to come up with plan, write the plan, and then implement the plan in about a 3 week period.  People, including myself worked until the middle of the night."
good,I always having enjoy the fields i've choosen I'm a people person enjoy helping other
good,"I left Kindred because I would like better benefits & more job security.  A typical day at work was always busy, which is great.  I learned how to get along with people in close quarters but wish I had a manager who was better with making sure work was completed.  The hardest part of the job was making friends with patients at the facility & losing them to sickness & death.  The most enjoyable part was also making friends & always being there for each other.  Working together as a team was great!"
good,"Type A personalities need only apply here. Great place to learn a great deal of content/hands on nursing in a very short time. Typical day includes all nursing responsibilities for typical team of 6 chronically/acutely ill patients with many comorbidities - these patients would typically be considered PCU candidates at local area hospitals. Majority of patients are trached, vented, receiving parenteral nutrition, on telemetry, receiving in-house dialysis, have 3 or more lines, tubes or drains, total assists or heavy 2 person assists - walkie-talkies are the exception to the rule. Medication administration and electronic charting are extremely cumbersome and time consuming. Electronic charting system is not intuitive or user friendly. Nurses are responsible for HUC duties, CNA duties, wound care (including wound vacs), entering orders, calling physicians, obtaining consents, assessments, admissions, discharges and complete management of 6 patient team. The hardest part of this job is learning to do more with less; the most enjoyable part of this job is bringing comfort to the patients."
good,Been with this company for over 15 years and never experienced the disrespect that I have this year.  All the years of hard work and promotion that I have gotten have been taken away because of leaders not knowing how to manage effectively.  This have made me rethink the goals and values of Kindred Healthcare.  Integrity is a major value to me and I feel this company really needs work in that area.
good,"There is nothing wrong with the company, just very poor management.  There is no team effort in the inpatient rehabilitation department with other co-workers."
good,Nice place to work .staff r very friendly under staffed and nurse can work triple shifts which is not only lawful. It's dangerous.  Always short staffed.   Cancels the aides and run nurses only.  These nurses r right out of school.   Have no one to look over them.  I have seen so much in the time I've been there
good,"A typical day at kindred hospital is never the same, you never know what  to expect. the hardest part of the job is the amount of patients that are assigned to you. the enjoyable part is helping so many people each day to get better or manage their pain. management is unpredictable some are caring and involved and others have no compassion for the workers nor the patients."
good,I love the job I did there at kindred hospital.  I lived the people I worked with and the people I came in contact with. I learned a lot of things at kindred hospital.
good,"Convenient Locations in many cities across the country, human resources available for movement between sites, optional out of town positions available"
good,"I worked at Kindred Southwest. The management does not demonstrate the integrity I would want to be associated with. My fellow colleagues as well as the nursing staff are wonderful. The support of management does not exist. You are not treated as an adult even though you have been doing the job many more years then your supervisors. I left due to the stress, questionable ethics, . It can be a wonderful learning experience. It was the most difficult place to work in my entire career. I stayed as I enjoyed the patients, wanted to be exposured to the learning I obtained."
good,The people that that work at kindred rehabilitation were overall pretty nice. The atmosphere was ok minus the smells of the place. The nurses were a bit rude sometimes but the other mental health counselors were kind to me.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Taking care of others is a great joy in my life and I able to do just that."
good,"A typical day at work is full of laughs and cries but over all we made it through"
good,The CEO and CCO are  below standard and have caused good staff to quit. However the care of the patients by clinical staff are top notch and do not get rewarded enough
good,As documentation demands increase productivity expectations increase as well.  This has put a lot of stress on the therapy team in the rehab gym.
good,"Pt care is rewarding. Most co-workers are friendly and helpful."
good,"Being with the patients was the real experience. I loved making sure they were clean, fed, and happy. Working for Kindred taught me a lot about helping other people stay healthy."
good,"This job is extremely stressful, there is alot pressure but it is also rewarding if you have heart for patients and families. Sharing neccessary information with those who can use it the most."
good,Each day varies at Kindred but its always busy.  Coworkers work well with each other when it come to patient care.  Hardest part would be seeing a patient get discharged that you developed a relationship with.
good,"Great employees and high opportunities for advancement good place to learn a new discipline, very poor benefits"
good,"Great team of RN/LPN's.  Learned a lot about wound care and use of VAC therapy."
good,"kindred healthcare seemed like a family oriented place when i first started but quickly turned out to be a drama filled environment where people cared more about them selves rather then the patients and familys that trusted them. It became a very hard place to work for after 4 years. But my most enjoyable part of the job was making a difference for the patients and families seeing them walk again or talk or even go to the bathroom on there own and thanking me for putting time in with them stopping by to say hello or sitting with them made a change in me for the better.Management there were in my opinion to buddy buddy with the nurses to install order and values of the company for these patients to be treated fairly at times which made the job hard everyday. But i honestly learned so much being there at kindred healthcare i learned how to love more , how to truly care for someone, how to be kind no matter the circumstance because you truly don t know whos listening or watching. It made me a better person and i thank Kindred Healthcare for that."
good,Expect to work with 90% African American bully’s with attitude. Coworkers are reluctant to train in detail because they do not get paid for it. I got very sick and provided a doctors note and was still fired. Clique oriented. Make sure you know sterile IV mixture and calculations because the proper aseptic technique for the laminar air flow hood will not be taught by a professional.  Good Luck!
good,"Working at Girling Community Care provided a great opportunity for advancing my management and Excel skills. Unfortunately, with our acquisition by Humana, the management team and culture suffered."
good,"Recruiters lie about the differential shifts."
good,No consistency. Was labeled a troublemaker for bringing bad care to the attention of management. Very clique. Friends got preference on vacations and holidays
good,"Kindred once cared for its employees and understood that quality patient care required this.  More recently, decisions have been made to outsource positions at the expense of employees and to the detriment of customer service."
good,This is a company that is growing and has seen many changes over the last several years with ceo’s. The company does offer OT if you want it. They provide free meals for lunch
good,I worked with great people but the days were long and the work is hard. The house supervisors are great and always very helpful. Worked both shifts and have worked on every floor. Management encourages teamwork because of the level of patient care.
good,"As the stat (emergency) delivery driver, I was on call 8 hours per day to deliver emergency narcotics and other meds to Nursing homes from Saco to Bangor, per van.  This was a fast paced and no nonsense operation, due to the seriousness of the product as well as the need."
good,"This job is every emotional. You have to learn how to deal with a lot of death, which some people cannot. You have to be able to talk to families and learn how to be very patient and understanding."
good,"The healthcare system is a huge business.  This place definitely embraces the concept of this.  However, so many people have just been given a position with no training.  Training is needed all across the board."
good,"I was grateful for my time spent at Kindred Healthcare. A life-changing experience that matured my career and decision making as a nurse and leader.   "
good,"Although the company starting pay is comparable, the increases are far and few in between.  Also, if you are not part of the ""Good Ole Boy"" team you may very well  be overlooked.  "
good,As a new grad Kindred offers so much education that nursing school could never prepare you for. An excellent first job! Fast paced learning environment with experienced nurses that are always willing to help!
good,Good coworkers everyone works as a team however management too heavy and burdens the staff facility runs smooth on the weekend without management present
good,"To be a Healthcare company- poor health benefits for employees"
good,"The work place was very stressful due to the different diagnosis of the patient population. If you do not have thick skin, this is not a place to work."
good,Was opened up to be an acute rehab for patients and the management group would dump on us with too much work. We never took a lunch or break and were running all shift. It was very stressful.
good,"I worked there over 10 years ago, so, my gripes with Kindred may no longer be issues at present. That being the case, I won't run them down in this review."
good,"I have been an employee of Rehabcare for 8 1/2 years. The company was bought out by Kindred a couple years ago. The employee benefits have slowly eroded. They also say client first but also remind the staff that Rehabcare is a business. Mixed messages, loosing their contracts and treat the employees as disposable. It was time to  jump off this train. I loved working with my colleagues."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed the work I did, but once I was put on restrictions due to my high risk pregnancy management became rude and unwilling to help me or place me where I could continue to work full time or even work at all."
good,Kindred is a great place to work and has lots of benefits it can get alittle overwhelming because they stay short staffed all the time. There are alot of other benefits as well . Most of the staff is easy going and willing to help. In my opinion team work is essential .l put my uncle in wedgewood and he has been very content over all . I would definitely recommend Wedgewood to any of my friends and associates. They have a wonderful physical therapy with very caring staff members .
good,"I was able to work with amazing people at the Hospital location and learned so very much from them as well as built strong nursing skills.I valued the time I worked there until the new managment took over. The structure, respect, and dignity towards patient care and employyees changed drastically."
good,The management is pathetic and the hiring bias is a disaster since 89% are employees from the Philippine  and there are no 1/10000 Black employees and Latinos not even in Janitorial jobs!
good,"save your self the trouble of applying here it's not a good place to work in, management is horrible they don't care about their patients and especially not their staff and they will make sure you know you feel unappreciated"
good,I really enjoyed most of the clinicians here however management and the facility was bad. They were all about making money and not so much the patients and staff.
good,"When patient census is low staff are cancelled frequently without any compensation. However, the staff that work for Kindred provide excellent care. Facility is clean, well maintained. Management has improved but has more room to improve upon. The staff are close nit family. They all work well together. The job is hard, stressful, but rewarding in your own way. Management does not reward staff for doing a good job. There is compensation with good evaluations if you are a new employee. Those who are long time, do not get this but bonuses instead which does not make up for the performance compensation. The hospital is a for profit, so they spend little on equipment. Much of their equipment is old, and does not work. They have computerized charting, the database is an old Dos system, out of date and difficult to use."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"I gave them six years.  From my point of view, it's a younger man's envirnoment - pushing a portable all day and lots of late-night STAT calls from home."
good,"it was a great place to , but  some of the staff wasnt understanding"
good,"typical day at work would be non-stressful, i've learned a lot on my previous wok, management is undergoing restaffing. co-workers loves to eat. hardest part of the job is continuous of care for patients. enjoyable is at the end of the day, i established sense of accomplishment."
good,I would not recommend that anyone works for this organization.  The management is terrible and there is a revolving door when it comes to employee retention.
good,"A typical day would consist of having 8-16 patients some having to be turned every two hours.  Checking their vitals daily, bathing, and grooming.  Some patients are continent of bowel and bladder, some require assistance walking to the bathroom.  There was very little team work among my co-workers and management would do very little to resolve the staff from working short or making an individual accountable for not carrying their own weight.  The hardest part of my job would be to loose a patient due to their illness overcoming them.  The most enjoyable part of my job would be bring peace of mind to my patients and their family members.  I learned that all patients want to be treated with respect, and dignity by all staff members.."
good,My experience with Kindred has been a no-win environment based upon two different branches of the corporation. It is a share holder based company which only has the interests of the profit margin for the shareholders at heart. The body of the company suffers.
good,"This location with the company has been absolutely horrible to work at. Mgt. staff are extremely unprofessional and rude. DON does not effectively communicate with staff and believes in public shaming!! The staff are bullied daily. Corporate knows and joins in!! Clue; care about and respect your staff and you will be respected. I was used and set up to be terminated as was anyone who possessed more knowledge than DON. Again, run away now."
good,Company is a decent one to work for. Worked for them for 4 years and no raises in that time. Offers decent benefits. Required to work weekends and holidays very hard to get time off. Unrealistic documentation and productivity requirements. Evaluating therapists are required to write ALL notes assistants do not have to do any documentation
good,work short staff alot and no raises and management doesnt care about their employees.never have enough supplys to do our job. insurance is expensive!
good,Kindred is a great place to gain experience such as critical care. Great expericence caring for acute care patients. There is good team work I would say you have to be very thorough at what you do or you could end up in a bad spot. The management is horrible at kindred particially the Nurse Manager horrible..
good,"They do not appreciate the employees, lack of good management. Not enough employees and they treated the staff and the patients very badly."
good,"A stress free job we flexible schedule, management was understanding with life situations. This was a part time job I had after school during my high school days and it was perfect."
good,In a normal day I will get the residents up for the day and continue to care for them through out my shift. Most of my day consist of me helping with ADL'S and helping my residence director with some of her duties & maintain a clean environment. Some of my co-workers relay on the other shifts to do there work for them while they hind thought out the day leaving work for other people so this make my job harder walking in behind someone that do not do their duties on their shift. What I really enjoy coming into work just knowing I make a difference knowing that my residence enjoy doing activities with me or just telling things that went on in their life.
good,"My typical work day is non stop from start to finish.  I learned great clinical skills which motivated me to return to school to receive my RN degree.  Management is always changing.  The hardest part of my job was caring for up to six total care patients, and not having a chair to sit in for 12 hours.  The most enjoyable part was doing good work with a great team of people."
good,"nice people, but a cold hearted corporation,  many problems related to productivity requirements and conflicts regarding serving the patients most efficiently (many would do better at home than a longer yet more profitable stay at a nursing home)  Also, many times I was expected to evaluate and treat people that I did not agree needed my services.  It was frustrating and I eventually lost my cool and probably won't work for corporate healthcare anymore."
good,working here felt very depressing pt outcomes were very poor due to lack of team effort.
good,"clean gym, take down water pitcher, copying filing taking take paper work to each unit. Pull patients medical chart put PT, OT, Speech paper work in each section of medical chart. Come back tp gym put PT OT Speech paper work in cabinets and folders. Go back to unit check on residents, making sure they are ready for therapy making they had breakfast and medication.  Put them in wheel chair and bring them to gym.  Help therapists with the residents.  When residents are finish took them back to rooms.  Come to gym and clean it up eat lunch, and resume the process over again.  Management was okay,same as co-workers.  The hardest part my job had no support from therapist.  The enjoyable part the residents acknowlege my hard work and said u should be the therapists u do all the work.  My joy was putting a smile opn my resisents day that made my job complete"
good,"This company pays well and has decent benefits, however, many 'workers' commit fraud on a daily basis, there for making this a risky place to work!"
good,"The company itself overall is a good place to work. As with any company, you have to watch out for the insecure people that are willing to sacrifice their souls to get on top. They were in a merger situation during the time I worked there, so maybe their onboarding process has gotten better. They pretty much got rid of their entire HR & Recruiting Departments when they merged with Kindred Healthcare."
good,I really enjoyed working there. Everyone got along great. If I could I would go back there.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"The culture that the company would like to instill and the reality of it are two very different ideas all together. The company liditure paints this nice place where you would want to work, then when you get in and meet everyone, it's nothing like that."
good,"I enjoyed working with the patients families and the medical staff. The nursing and respiratory staff are pushed due to the financial constraints of the facilities. Micro-Budgeting and cutting corners on staffing to meet their budgets hurts everyone. The moral was low. The staff take it out on middle management as if they can fix the problems. Everyone is busting their tail ends and they get burned out and angry and chippy with one another at the Brea facility. Push Push Push then when JCAHO arrives,"
good,Kindred Healthcare provided a good source of income.I was laid off with no warning. The culture of the company definitely needs to be improved while considering those they affect.
good,"Was good there until my current DON left, and once Administration/ Management changed, the place went down hill! Pay was decent though! I did many different jobs there!"
good,"Too much drama, positions are never filled and there's a high turnover rate. Not a sense of family or trust. Not a good environment. I stayed there for over 5yrs and All the supervisors were quitting"
good,"I worked at Kindred in Greensboro very briefly. I discovered quickly that the workload here was unreal and you were expected to always be ""on point"" and you hardly had anyone to help you. The patients are very sick and often on ventilators and are obese. They had to be turn on schedule and the nurse who works during the day would often make visits on nights to make sure the patients are turned on the correct side at the correct time. This would not be a problem if you didn't have to turn every single patient all by yourself and do hygienic care as well which could take about 30minutes or more per person. When you are new, the other staff have a clique mentality and will single you out. Try to make it seem as though you are doing something wrong so that you may get in trouble. My last day here at Kindred...I had worked a 12 hour shift and had a heavy load of patients, many of which I had to change bedding up until it was time to go. My whole body ached and needless to say, once I got confirmation of a new job....I left and never looked back."
good,"I did not have the extreme pressure of productivity being an on-call therapist as the full time therapist had.  This type of culture was best for the company, but not necessarily for the patient.  RUG levels were being abused often to have better reimbursement.  Patients were getting the same treatment twice a day to have the correct number of minutes to make the RUG level.  The treatments I observed were mostly lack luster by most of the therapist, but not all."
good,"I enjoyed working at Kindred. I was learning all sorts of things. I had a shift of difficult cases and an aide who was unwilling to help me. I had to perform pericare and wound care on a quad by myself (because the aide declared ""It's Mother's Day and I ain't missing my lunch!""). It took me over 90 minutes which got me very behind in passing scheduled meds. I asked for help from the nurses on the pods on either side of me and they said they were too busy (though I saw them leaning and chatting with other nurses and looking on their phones). I called the supervisor and asked for help but she too said she was too busy. I didn't get to take a lunch that day. I finally got a quick restroom break 9 hours into my shift. I didn't get to leave until 90 minutes after my shift ended. This day was my breaking point. My doctor took me off work because of acute anxiety related to work. HR immediately started harassing me about returning to work, they didn't care that my doctor wanted me off for a while. The saying is true here, they really do ""eat their young"". Seasoned nurses don't help often, they prefer to sit back and watch the new hires fall on their faces. In order to get the timed charting in, many of them just marked what the previous shift marked, rather than truly doing a full head-to-toe assessment (this is what several of them told me to do in order to not get behind). They only did the right thing when someone was watching. I worked by the book while watching other nurses and aides cut corners all around me. If I did things like they did, I probably wouldn't have felt so overwhelmed."
good,Then kindred community is very diverse. As a nurse you are expose to a variety of cases and situations that can quickly train you to be  a fast  and resourceful nurse. On a negative note administration does not have it together at all. You always end up working stressed out to the max. It does not promote a healthy work/ personal life balance.
good,"I had a very knowledgeable, supportive, and ethical Area Director of Operations. This is not typical, from what I have learned from other company employees."
good,"A typical day there consisted of providing care for patients in an  acute or sub acute setting."
good,Loved the job but the management was questionable.  They did not try to work with the employees or listen to their issues.  Management was not friendly or approachable.
good,"My supervisor Sabrina is very organized, versatile, the physicians and staff love her.  She coordinates multiple departments and manages her department excellent"
good,I love the work that I do and I love everyone of my  patients it brings me joy to be able to say I helped someone get back to doing what they love to do in life.
good,Feedback about performance and communication regarding job duties is not efficient or effective. I do not feel they provide the most effective training and expect too much too soon.
good,"Good team work among nurses. Consistently short on nurse's aides, making load on nurses worse. Great experience with residents. Good opportunities for skills."
good,"Kindred is not in this area any longer.  It was a tough job.  Management was out of touch and the culture of floor staff was terrible.  Towards the end I hated going in,"
good,Benefits and job environment comparable to most large therapy companies with major focus being on unrealistic productivity numbers with quality patient care sacrificed. I felt local management sympathetic to difficult challenges but didn't have authority to make changes.  Not enough support for local managers due to upper management had too many facilities to give individual facilities attention.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"12 hour day"
good,"Several people tell you what to do even though they are not your supervisor.  Talked down to on several occasions treated less than. Poor management, lack of team work."
good,"They have great staff which is why the rating is high, however, the upper management who does not have conversations with you directly or interact with you place heavy stress on lower managers which trickle down the stress to other employees. Leading to poor job culture. Most enjoyable was working with patients but this gets minimized by excessive productivity standards that leads to non-optimized patient outcomes."
good,"The management was terrible her, especially in the Rehab department. They put too much work on people and pay them an inadequate amount. Benefits are also very poor. Coworkers were great, other than the Rehab Director. Overall, the company does NOT look out for their employees or patients, only monetary gains."
good,"Kindred would be a great company if there were incentives, also team work in the work place amongst peers,I really love this place because of the residents and the administration"
good,"Except they've cut out the DOR and now have a ""clinical leader"" who is expected to do it all and work 50% of their day. They don't care about anything but the money... just like everyone else."
good,"Great care for patients, unfortunately they continually took more away from employees each year.  There was no longer an incentive to keep working for a company that did not appreciate their employees."
good,Worked there 7 years it's ok to a certain degree they pick and choose who they going to fire they let people do anything and sweep it under the rug which is not fair
good,Kindred Baypointe upper nursing management while knowledgeable they are rude to staff. Turn over is very high I've seen 3 unit mangers leave with in 2 weeks of hire as well as a ADON.  The floor is poorly stocked you can never find any equipment. Nurses have to bring their own vital sign equipment. The nurses who work the floors are hard working and caring without proper equipment and supplies it makes the job even more difficult then it has to be.
good,I was hired as a PRN with the impression that I would have the option to work as little or as much I wanted.  I was hoping to work between 25-30 hours a week at the multiple facilities.  The past two months I have been lucky to work up to even a full day A WEEK.  The communication between management is very poor and I have been cancelled numerous times at the last minute.
good,Corporate changes philosophy frequently which changes roles of therapist. Inconsistent management backing for clinical appropriateness of patients and rug levels
good,This company provides decent insurance benefits.  The management  has its challenges to work out a balance of complying with their demands and providing an environment for their professionals to feel just that.
good,"Sales, marketing and patient assessments throughout the day.  Unfortunately the job continued at night from being on call and patients calling, difficult work life balance."
good,when I first started at kindred healthcare I loved everything about it from the residents to my coworkers and just how the business was ran overall but as months went on the turnover rate in management became to be to much for me!
good,Nice facility to work in.  Great team work and in house staff. Kindred Admissions cooperate Department likes to micro manage. Most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new residents.
good,I enjoyed working for kindred because of their passion for patients. Nurses are on time with meds and narcotics. Over all I think is a good place to work.
good,We have a very friendly staff and the nurses listen when we have something to say and the nursing supervisors are very helpful.We get busy at times and get a few residents that need one on one care and its hard to do when we have a full group and people always on the call lights wanting pain pills. we work 12 hour shifts and are exhausted after 8 hours but we still smile and get the job done. but over all its just like a nursing home very demanding and you must be afficiant. I can say I am looking forward to working in a vent unit again though.
good,"Was a weekend on call job I took for a year,  Enjoyable staff but everyone seemed burnt out.  I appreciate the opportunity."
good,Needs improvement. Administration constantly changing. Facility just got union voted in so hopefully new changes coming for the better.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,This job provides a lot of training in the nursing field. Learn a magnitude of skills hands on. Management could of been better with communication. Co- workers are great. My most enjoyable part of this job was the clients they are the best.
good,A typical LTC/ LTAC company.  Work short staff and long hours. My biggest issue with them is that they initially hired inexperienced management. All you need was LTC experience. Lots of turnover.
good,"Can get very busy,  one rapid response or code can scatter your whole shift.The plce is a great place to work once they get th kinks out.I wouldn't think of working anyplace else."
good,"It was fun going to work in the morning. Everyone went the extra mile for each other including the nursing staff. Unfortunately , the company lost the contract with the nursing home and was unable to place most of us in another location."
good,"Love the work, love the residents.  I was happy, residents were happy, it worked.  Managers decided to shuffle the staff, now I work with people I do not like, to spite repeatedly asking not to be paired with them.  At the station where I used to work, falls have increased, residents seek me out.  "
good,"For a new graduate in the field of HIM, this was a good entry level position to start out. However there was no room for advancement and the work atmosphere was incredibly stressfull."
good,Good people to work with.Doctors were easy to talk to and get along with.Flexible schedule with coworker. Just a long drive to work daily.
good,"Everyone is ready to help each other, and are always smiling even on a stressful day."
good,I worked as a cook in Wilmington cypress point...And was hired part-time dishonestly to take someone's place that was on fmla. The manager came up with a bunch of lies and UN truthful things to let me go the day before that employee was to come back. The manager in the dietary department is lazy...sat in his office all the time..lied to me countless times and lied on paperwork in regards dismissing me. I did win my unemployment battle in spite of the efforts to keep me from getting it continued. This manager was terminated from other kitchens in healthcare...and he somehow knew I knew it and had something personal against me. I have no respect for him at all. The whole bldg was unfriendly and over bearing. The administrator would not even talk with me because I hadn't been there 90 days and people work of the clock daily in the kitchen and bldg to get their work done because they get written up if they work over on the clock and if their work isn't done. Management knows this and turns a blind eye. I've never worked in such an oppressive and nasty kitchen. And never will again.
good,Management was horrible the staff really keeps this facility going
good,"12 hour shifts, flexable people, can be rewarding yet diffcult at times"
good,"I enjoy working at Kindred when I am there, Every work place have concerns that needs to be addressed."
good,"worked 8 yrs, and let go . management kept employees with 1 yr. (and they made less per hour.) its all about the money. not a family environment at all."
good,Kindred is a great company to work for. Everyday you have team players and respectful staff. The hardest part is when co-workers don't show up to work and you have to pick up the slack. The most enjoyable part of my job is the loving patients and overtime hours.
good,"you get to see, do and learn a lot. Hard work but can be rewarding."
good,"Fun work with co-workers, good experience with patients"
good,I have a wonderful times at work the patients some of them or such a joy to be around the family's are also nice. I also have a lot of co-workers i can depend on if i need help with anything.The hardest thing about the job is not having enough time in the day to do all that u want to be for some of the patients but the little we can do they appreciate just the same.The things I enjoy the most is see them smile and them knowing that they can call on u if they needed to.
good,"Small cozy hospital. Very easy to master both staff and hospital functions + patient care is balanced,"
good,"I feel the management is not sincere or honest with the employees. New hires are not fully trained to provide the holistic care to these severely critically ill patients. Staff won't speak up afraid of consequences. I feel that some are lazy or pretend to not understand and , when indeed they konw."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,Most enjoyable was helping the patients and their families.
good,"A typical day at work at Kindred, some days were better than others. Some days we had 7-8 patients and other days we had 9-13 patients a day. You had some nurses that would talk down to the CNA's because they were an RN or LPN. They didn't want to help with their patients. My passion was working on the Wound Care Team that was the most fulfilling job that I ever had besides Total Patient Care. My co-workers were wonderful. Kindred doesn't take up for their employees. Sometimes the patient isn't always right. Management had employees lying about very serious situations to cover the hospitals behind. But when it came to speaking up for their employees they would rather just fire them instead of being dedicated to them for all of there hard work as we were to them. For the work that is done at Kindred their CNA's should be paid a whole lot more!!"
good,the things i really enjoyed about this job was the relationships i had with the residents and some of my co workers. I learned alot of different things than my past jobs had taught through training. The management in my eyes was not the greatest. The hardest part of the job was lack of staff. A typical day at work included housekeeping resident checks charting cooking and food prep transferring toileting and helping resident with their daily living skills and each personal needs. i also took care of personal cares of several of the residents.
good,Management of rehab department has fired 4 employees in one year. Job security is not good.
good,The Kindred Healthcare is well organize and fun place to work at.
good,I learned how to be empathetic while remaining professional.
good,"Ethical company  but corporate structure rarely  stands for employee , very uncertainty. few great people at local office makes company good place to work."
good,"The typical day at Kindred Hospital is very busy. There is always an opportunity to see and learn something new. Assignments are heavy, usually with not enough staff. I still feel good at the end of the day when I put a smile on a patient's face of family member. Work culture is friendly which helps alleviate the stress of the job."
good,You are not respected for what you know.  Management does not respect its employees nor addresses problems.  Revolving door of employees.  Facility is very clean.  Food service for employees is open 1 1/2 hours per day.
good,"As a current Cook, Server and Prep Cook for the Mercy Rehabilitation Hospital I have watched many great employees leave due to the way the Kitchen Manager speaks to them. We are not talking about young adults walking away from a job with beautiful benefits but grown people. The Kitchen Manager creates a lot of unnecessary drama in the work place making it a very toxic work environment."
good,"It was the hardest job to staff that i have ever had, but there are still people that I hired that are still working there and still call me boss man."
good,"The kindred family once they accept you is nice and warm but there were other things not too nice. Understanding that patient satisfaction is important, management let patients disrespect the nurses and techs. They never stood up for us. Some doctors were also extremely rude. One of the medsurg manager definitely played favorites and it was obvious she did not appreciate workers of color. She would give open opportunities to her close allies as opposed to going by merit. Would I go back? Yes.. if management changed."
good,The job itself was great. I loved being a CNA but one it doesn’t pay enough and management was a joke. They were not helpful at all. Multiple calls to corporate were made nothing was done.
good,"Senior leaders changed as often as the budget changed.  Minimal senior leader support & practice of some leaders to take advantage of cm staff."
good,worked at two separate locations and both managers were terrible. billed too many minutes when not appropriate. management made fun of other employees. all they care about is the minutes and getting paid
good,Our workload is an ever-changing mixture of assignments in Human Resources Operations. We are an unique and cohesive group. Our teamwork has helped to create a highly efficient and productive department.
good,Direct Bill locations were run without constant management interferance.  Unfortunatly Senior Management was not involved with facility relations.  Senior level management were not professional
good,"If you are a part of the in group you are fine."
good,When I first worked for Rehab Care I was quite happy had an excellent regional manager but when the company restructured to regions ended up working with a regional that was not as good as the first.
good,Patient to nurse ratio was very high. Eight and nine patients with a lot of care needed was an average day. It was very stressful trying to accomplish daily tasks.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,The managers needed to work on balancing the workload by planning and organizing the intake and output of patients for better budgeting in all departments. Kindred Healthcare seems to have a low satisfaction rating from employees and is noted for the high turnover.  I personally took the opportunity to use my time at Kindred to learn as much and teach as much possible to my staff.  The hardest part was the inability to make changes in the department due to lack of authority.  The most enjoyable was the ability to make a difference in the patient's life.
good,Some good core people - regional leadership is lacking a local understanding of environmental dynamics.   THe lack of local context impedes regional leadership ability to gain local truat and affect change.
good,"Complete bedside nursing care, family education and support. Worked with Md's and other team members to provide complete, holistic care. Had a good rapport with coworkers and enjoyed the job even though it could be difficult at times helping with end of life issues."
good,The workload was heavy with very heavy total care patients.  Management expected you to do nearly impossible tasks and put you at risk to lose your license or certification.  The pay is low compared to the amount of work you have to do.
good,"would not recommend working there.higher management not interested in actual care of residents,Workers not respectful of each others jobs and abilities.Supplies not provided so residents have the best experience of life."
good,"No room for growth/advancement, low pay - no raises or very minimal, not enough training you will have to figure out stuff on your own, poor management/only care about themselves, they throw so much work on you and you get new job duties on a weekly basis or so including housekeeping duties with no increases in pay. They just take advantage of you."
good,"I arrived at clients residence, greeting and information exchanged, I attended to immediate needs proceeding with the day on a positive note, with good communication and healthy interaction."
good,Always worked the Noc shift short. Little to no materials to do the effectively. Most of the time charge nurses wanted respect but wouldn't give the ssme respect back. They were very rude
good,It is a good job to have. Pays well and my personal experience was very good. It was just too stressful on me because of the distance I was having to drive to get there and then having a 2nd job in a town in the opposite direction in the afternoons.
good,Good solid company- very big in quality and checks and balances.  Easy to take time off.  Some on call work.  Paperwork/computer work is excessive.  Nice co-workers but you don't see them
good,Overall the company has gone downhill. Don't trust upper management. Culture personal is great. Enjoy my peers and my job. My supervisors are amazing however advancement is not occurring.
good,This use to be a great place for career growth.. Management changed and the work environment changed. Employees not supported to succeed at this company.
good,High intensity environment. Chronically ill vented patients with an array of medical problems. High nurse patient ratio and all around heavy patient assignment with limited auxiliary staff. Having a poor nurse patient ratio  4:1 in the chronic ICU is very stressful. Difficult place to work and manage chronically stressed nursing staff. Typically they have 12 patients per nursing assistance which leaves little room for all hands on deck when everyone is running around with actually giving high quality of care.
good,"Decent place to work, average with work/life balance. Corporate management does not seem to know what front line management does. They certainly do not have a culture of positivity in the work place. No raises for many years in a row."
good,Managers micromanage their employees.  The training is not very good at all and once your out of a week of training they expect you to know everything. Major lack of communication between management and the employees.
good,"patient care"
good,"was purchased by another company while there, they made a lot of changes and let a lot of staff off.  minimal patients and difficult to keep a caseload."
good,"Unsure of future, You have to be ready to search for what you need. You will come across a lot of missing medications that others did not order. You will spend a lot of time fixing others mistakes. This is very time consuming unless you become like some other nurses that really don't care."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Outstanding rehabilitative care"
good,"There are several managers and executives "
good,"Dietary kitchen department poorly run by current supervisor I performed cooking am and pm cooking also did supervisory duties such as ordering, cafeteria menus, schedules, ordering food. Working with my staff to produce good food for patients and cafeteria."
good,"This hospital is a Long Term - Acute Care Hospital. The patient population is primarily the chronically, critically ill. The average length of stay is 20+ days. Many new graduates are hired into this hospital."
good,"Would I place a family member in their facility ,No.Its all about making a profit.The pay was above average.The management was stressed.In nursing it was like you worked for an agency. so much turn over.The Pt's are usually very complex to take care ..Absolutely no loyalty to the staff."
good,Highly Visible Role that relies on the ability to multi task on a daily basis and interacts with all levels of the company on a daily basis.  in this position you must rely on your interpersonal skills and the ability to communicate with coworkers on a daily basis.  the hardest part of the position is that at times you must have the ability to manage from the bottom up.
good,Nice place to work. Nice co workers. Does not have good benefits or room for advancement however. Needs to focus more on employee needs.
good,The staff helped me to be very efficient and effective at my job. Charge Nurses were very knowledgeable and  professional.
good,"I work with up to 12 patients daily with cardiac related issues. These patients also have other comorbidities, such as diabetes, cancer, or respiratory issues. There are 24 private rooms, split for care between 2 nurses and 2 CNAs."
good,"Normally a team approach 1 RN, 1 LPN, 1 CNA with 10-12 patients that are very high acuity. Many come from acute care hospital ICUs."
good,The post acute care business is a very tough business.  Most of the revenues come from Medicare and Medicaid which are highly regulated.  It seems that every year brings new challenges due to reimbursement rate changes.  Normal less than more.
good,"Daily duties are increased daily. Appreciation is minimum. Money is all that matters to them, not people. The CEO's are actually administrators that let the title cloud their grip on reality."
good,Unfortunately this location had a poor CEO and XO when I worked there and after I resigned they ended up closing because of them. All in all Kindred is a good company
good,"Company does not encourage education for employees, should promote employees when status change for better, open door policy should be ecourgae."
good,"The people that work here are fantastic, the work expectations are overwhelming. Limited resources, still paper orientation few computerized processes."
good,"Great team work among the RRT's."
good,"Rehab Care was very strict on time management and meeting patients treatment minutes, but not the most ethical. Management pushed that treatment time met even when inappropriate. Every minute had to be accounted for. Felt tethered to job and not much freedom and didn't feel like a valued employee or staff member. Lots of travel between buildings all over St. Louis region. The instability of schedule made home life difficult."
good,"Will not Post any notes at this time. "
good,"Each day was like the one before it. I learned specifics of rehabilitation, physical and mental. Management seemed detached from the workers. My coworkers were awesome. The hardest part of  the job was the physical demands.The most enjoyable part of the job was the comrade re among the workforce."
good,Did not like working for an LTAC or having to perform phlebotomy in the AM. Also had to be on call for blood bank every 3rd week.
good,"Every CNA had the same group which helped build a routine but also meant that you would have the same difficult residents everyday while others had no extra needs residents. Management was poor due to favoritism and a high turn over rate. Hardest part was working holidays and constant on call days. Easiest part was working with residents that cherished you and looked forward to your company daily, becoming attached was hard but worth it."
good,"easy to get along with other workers in housekeeping, nursing staff, and doctors."
good,"Hired part time and was scheduled to work 6 days a week and every weekend for 3 weeks. Extremely short staffed as they couldn't keep employees. DON never met me pre-employment or after I was hired. Saw her once as I was walking past her door but never talked to her. Everyone was either quitting or wanted to. Some 15 to 20 yr employees went to other facilities. Worked with 1 or 2 CNAs taking care of 40 residents with 1 resident a 1 on 1. Co-workers were great but overworked and tired. The best parts of the job were the residents, the coworkers, and the paycheck as they did pay slightly higher than my previous employer. Would definitely not work there again."
good,Good place to work but is very demanding and can be a little stressful.
good,"Assist the Program Director with multiple task on a daily basis"
good,"I have learned quite a bit since beginning employment with this company 4 years ago however the lack of employee morale and the job culture causes many employees to leave feeling unsatisfied. Currently, I perform many functions daily that include business office duties such as billing, accounts receivable, collections, filing, data entry, answering phones, communicating with state and federal agencies, communicating within depts. coordinating patient care. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people that I serve, the residents that I meet and assist. The hardest part of this job is discharging patients due to financial reasons."
good,The best part with this job I get to take home whatever I want but I dont think I will ever work for them again but that is okay.
good,Loved Patients.-co-workers were for the most part team players
good,"My experience at Kindred Healthcare consists of numerous levels of challenges. I expect the challenges involved in providing cost effective and positive outcome wound care, but the hurdles that I have found during my employment are taking me away from my objectives that I have established when I provide, recommend wound care for my patients. I have developed a strong work ethic over the years and a commitment to my patients. I maintain my wound management skills and knowledge base without the assistance of my employer because I feel it my responsiblity in order to provide superior wound care. Currently I feel I can no longer meet my commitment to my patients despite numerous attempts to make effective changes. So I am looking for a change. I need to feel effective in what I do for my patients'; but I also feel a need to teach staff, patients and familes in various areas of wound managment, (i.e., prevention  strategies,wound  products, cultural and skin tone idiosyncrasies that can effect wound healing).Wound management is my passion. However, I cn not do all I'm responsible for as a team of one. I am currently responsible for the wound management program for my facility that consists of weekly skin assessment of all patients, including weekly measurements for all patients with wounds, as well as the photography of all wounds monthly on admission and at discharge."
good,"A typical day at work would involve obtaining patients vital signs, glucose level, daily input/output and helping patients with daily activities such as hygiene, rehabilitation, and re-positioning body posture to prevent skin breakdown.  "
good,"My local job settings are very pleasant.  I enjoy being part of a skilled and compassionate rehab team.  My rehab managers are very supportive and knowledgeable. I work with nursing home residents performing CVA rehab, and working with other populations including brain injuries, dysphagia patients, Parkinson's disease.MS. and dementia patients.  The most difficult part of the job is the varying work schedule and not getting enough hours to maintain full-time status. "
good,"Treat and evaluate patients, oversee financial operations of the department, attend meetings"
good,Decent place to work. Busy lots of turnover. would work there again
good,"Many different clinical cultures in the rural settings, can make it difficult to be a part of a family/team feeling, but it is a good company"
good,"Work days are typically 5 to 8 hours depending on census. Ipod Touch devices are used to record daily patient notes. I've learned to co-treat patients with other therapists. Management is supportive but can be unfriendly and disorganized at times. Co - workers, other therapists and rehab aids, all work well as a team. The hardest part of the job is working with patients who do not progress due to the seriousness of their medical condition. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing patients graduate from therapy and return home."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,im a hard wkr i get along well with others i learn new skills easily i am dependable an reliable
good,"When I started working at kindred central hospital they were doing very well as far as having enough staff and more than enough patients for the size of the hospital.  However, after a change in upper management, the hospital headed into a downward spiral. As they lost patients  they cut hours from staff while adding more to the job description across all departments causing staff members to quit and others to pick up the slack. There seems to be no change in direction any time soon."
good,"I loved this job. I stayed for four years because of the people i took care of, and the staff that stood beside me. Although working conditions were very rough."
good,"It is a fast paced environment which is good, although there is  just very poor employee support from facility based management.  All endeavors to improve my skills were adequately supported but had to be researched and covered on my own, except for time off to attend such continuing education opportunities.  The hardest part of the job was providing the amount of care each client needed because of the disproportionate minute allotment provided between the 3 disciplines and the stretch for my needing to cover multiple buildings, as well as the lack of supportive PRN for time off.  The most enjoyable parts of the job were the patient diversity and the relationship with my peers on the therapy team."
good,"The most rewarding part about working in the Nursing Home, is that it was like being able to see your family members every day. No matter what, I always treated my residents as if they were my own family members, because that's what I would want if my family member were in there. Another rewarding part is being able to see the great improvement the resident is doing, and being able to see them go home with pride, and a smile of their face!"
good,"The hardest part of this job is the human factor in a nursing home, so the scheduling is constantly changing. The work environment is sad and depressing. However, this job is not without merit."
good,I enjoyed my time but the overall culture of the company was not in line with what I wanted.  Not as advanced as I would have expected in such a big company and very political.
good,"I was working as a CNA in preparation for Nursing School and found retirement homes to be chronically understffed.  As a male, I was assigned to the Alzheimer's wing usually by myself"
good,co workers were very supportive and worked together. the director at the time I was there was very unprofessional. the job requirements are very stressful. company dress code is casual.
good,"A typical day working on the floor as a CNA involved assisting the acutely ill residents with activities of daily living as needed. The ratio of patient care per CNA is 12-15 patients. A good handful is completely dependent on staff for assistance. Physical therapy is often around to help staff as needed. A lot of the residents depend on the CNAs for assistance in bathing/grooming, toileting, and feeding."
good,"Typical day is giving baths, assisting with feedings, and helping with daily living activities. I learned how to help people that can't do for themselves. The management and culture was ok. The hardest part was when a resident died. The most enjoyable part is the smiles and thanks I got from the residents for helping them."
good,"manager need better training on properly doing write ups , and employees rights. like was not given a chance to defend myself, nor was i  allowed to touch the screen with blurry picture to see if i was truly doing what they said"
good,It's hard working in Kindred. Fellow co-workers are excellent except those who brown nose the higher ups; so yes there's BLATANT favoritism. I love the company but the management sucks (quoting from a previous co-worker asking why she leave; completely agree with her!).
good,i loved the job i did but it was  so much down time as well as no supervision. not that it was needed but when problems arose there were no superior to resolve anything.
good,The job I had with rehab care was at a new facility.  The hours were not stable due to changing census numbers.  Unfortunately the onsite director was not great and was fired.  I left shortly after to have a more stable work environment.
good,The facility I work in is one of the better homes which makes it easier to work in this atmosphere. Staff is nice to work with and manager is good. I would recommend working for her.
good,"I've learned a lot working at this facility. I've been able to improve my skills over the years here and assist other's as well to perform specific skills with confidence. A typical day could be rather chaotic at times due to the acuity of the patients.  The one thing that I felt was not safe was the nurse/patient ratio.  This was only because of the needs of the patients we are receiving.  It's not always like this but more often than not. I did enjoy the comradery of the staff, those that were willing to assist if they weren't too bogged down with their assignments. We all did work well together."
good,"The company would rather cut all costs than focus on patient and employee safety, which ends up costing them more in the end. Needs better leadership."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"I really love my coworkers and the atmosphere at the Ontario location. There is team nursing, which means a team of 1 RN 1 LVN 1 CNA, but the fact that you get up to 10 patients per shift, to me, is dangerous. Though Kindred is a long term acute care, it is still acute. Patients still have major uncontrolled issues. This, of course, comes with the job, but my problem lies with the ratios. Yes, we have team nursing and yes there are many more eyes on the patients than there would be with just an RN or RN/CNA combo, BUT 8-10 patients is a TON of responsibility and work to handle, especially when there is a shift of patient census, more acute patients are being admitted, and there are a lot of confused patients on restraints and each team ends up with at least two or three restrained patients on tele, multiple tele patients where sometimes you end up with 6 or 7 tele and 9 patients total. The support of supervisors and managers is there, but to a certain extent. There are also a lot of older nurses and other staff who work there that are set in their ways and do not communicate effectively. The hospital does, however, hire a ton of new graduate RNs, and there seems to be a shift in age difference between the RNs. "
good,"Unfortunately, Kindred has not provided health benefits for its employees since 2012.  Now begin sold, so my review will be seriously outdated - management changes as well."
good,"This Hospital was a good place to work when I started working with this Hospital. I looked forward getting up in the morning, and come to work with my rehab team, and worked my appreciative patient, that was my typical day at work, generally the staff was friendly, and respectful. The management turnover was the hardest part of time due to learning new rules and regulations, and when we were under-staff. Towards the end of my time at this hospital. we were working short days, and had to use my PTO to make up the hours. I love working, and enter act with my co workers and patients."
good,Good place to get some experience in the healthcare field. I wouldn't recommend this job if you're a single parent because they expect you to be there whenever they call you regardless of if you have other obligations.
good,The management and nurses are always willing to help when needed. The culture is diverse. The hardest part of the job is having 12 patients at one time.
good,"A typical day may start with one client all day or up to 3 clients in a day. Every case is different. The duties may include light housekeeping, cooking, person care, taking them out shopping. The hardest part is losing client by death or being placed in a nursing home. The job can be very physical or we are only there to allow family some time away for home. The best part for me is getting to know the clients and all their stories."
good,New manger made staff changes and implemented changes in how the sales/Liaison staff functioned. Many policy and processes were changed and lead to many staff changes occurring.
good,"Job wonderful."
good,"New ownership"
good,Staff or overworked have large territories and too much paperwork.  Management all about the dollar.  Patient care does not come before the money.  All about money and what the company can make
good,Need more mgt bodies. ones there were overworked which lead to ppl being spread to thin. Which lead to gaps in commicatio which trickled dwn the line.
good,"Rehabcare was a wonderful company until Kindred purchased them.   It no longer was a caring, mission driven organization.   It was more about the money and less about patients.   Very stressful, poorly managed in Regional Director roles, low pay for amount of work."
good,I spent more time going to meetings rather then working in my department. Nursing seemed to rule the roost. They never worked together with the other departments to benefit the residents
good,This employer was a typical Nursing facility.  How ever I noticed that New charge nurses would be placed at the station with the most difficult patients.  This is the reason I do not recommend to entry level Nurses.  A nurse with experience in long-term care would be a better fit for this fast pace environment.
good,"My co workers at Kindred were amazing , My boss was amazing and caring and always thought of me and his coworkers . I learned how to be more patient and caring to customers and patients. The workplace environment was always a great place to be and i always looked forward to going to work. The hardest part of the job was when our boss passed away and we had to take over everything on our own for a while. We all worked together and got everything done."
good,"I loved the fast pace and work environment, I gained a lot of knowledge from various patients. Managment is your typically corporate managers which is a down fall."
good,"The manager did not have a rehab or medical background and did not know how to manager therapist.  He did not have a good understanding of how therapy works, but instructed on what to do and how we were to go about completing our therapy."
good,Worked multiple positions during employment. With many ED changes the environment became more stressful. Big improvements were made. Had less complaint surveys from the state. With each new ED these increased exponentially
good,"Unfortunately due the changes of the current medical system, LTACs are facing financial ruin. Which leads to not putting enough staff on the ""since it isn't in the budget"" and when staffing stuffers, so does patient care."
good,The company was in udder chaos. Too many changes in management and staffing in general. You never knew what kind of day it would be and who would be there
good,"Nothing smart to say, it's a company like any other corporate company. Fun to work and meet new people. You can learn a lot about anything in medical field."
good,"Nurse turnover is very high. I wish there was a longer training period for new nurses. Not focused on customer service, but focused on patient care. ."
good,"Kindred is a great company. They provide many perks and even some ""leave early"" days to their employees. Kindred is ever changing, expanding some lines of business while dropping others. "
good,Kindred is a  hard place to work with the level of stress from upper mgmt.Im not here to bash the company. Staff to pt ratio is over whelming.Mangemenr seem to hear staff but not listening to complaints and or concerns.
good,Will not give raises. Productivity standards are very high. They do have good documentation standards. Decent managers. Very flexible with hours......
good,"This place requires a lot of help in the staffing area. It is hard to keep up with patient's demand/needs. the atmosphere is not bad, some people just deal with stress in a different way."
good,"I loved working with the patients and understanding their needs. I did not enjoy the management at this job, because if you don't have a higher title they don't care about you."
good,I particularly didn't like this job for a number of reasons including the upper management of the company and how they handled their own policies and regulations.
good,"Kindred (known as PORT therapy in New York State) was brought in as a contractor to provide therapy services in our skilled nursing facility. Our therapy team was hired on by PORT. Their focus on therapy minutes for profit was borderline unethical at times. Therapists were pushed to ""get their minutes"" with geriatric residents. I felt the RUG goals and productivity expectations were not realistic. Management seems to prefer new graduates over experienced clinicians. I stopped enjoying my job and did not feel valued. One positive change PORT brought in was to increase minutes for  individuals who might not typically receive therapy. Overall, I would not recommend working for them."
good,"A typical day at Kindred was Frustrating at times. I' ve  learned  never depend on anybody but yourself when it comes to work. The management was some timing and never there when you need them the as for the co-workers it was also the same as the management goes, the hardest part of my job was finding team work when you need it , and the most enjoyable part of the job is having  a job."
good,"A typical day at work was always eventful, some events better than others.  I worked with great people.  I feel the management could have been more supportive in certain areas.  I learned to always trust but verify information.  Follow-up is key in any situation.  The hardest part of the job was juggling the employees needs and wants regarding scheduling and time off. The most enjoyable part of the job was when our goals were met after the teams hard work."
good,"This company doesn't exhibit care or compassion for patients or employees in rehabilitation setting. Unrealistic productivity expectations. Pressure to see patients who are not appropriate for skilled treatment. Company has not given raises in the past 5 or so years. Generally flexible in terms of setting your own schedule or vacation. I stay, because I really like my coworkers, but I hate seeing how patients and fellow employees are treated by this company. Also, insurance is not that good, and you need to jump through hoops in order to keep prices affordable."
good,"Working closely with other disciplines to maximize patients outcome for discharge is a great part of working here.  My coworkers keep the mood fun, having a willingness to assist at all times, and are goal oriented to providing excellent quality of care.  Lack of communication from management and between therapy and nursing staff make the job harder."
good,"a small yet productive hospital with friendly staff."
good,Worked here for a short time. Under staffed . Difficult to get time off. Pharmacy is closed after hours and you have to call charge nurse to get meds. Would mow lawns before I would work there again.
good,"Very overwhelming duties and expectations that negatively impact the care provided to residents.  However, learned excellent time management and case management skills."
good,This facility would be a great place to work if they would hire enough people to cover all shifts. You will def. get all the overtime you want if you was to work here.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,co-workers were great.we made a great team together. working on the ventilation unit could be very stressful at time. the patients at kindred were critical. working at this facility was very educational.
good,Busy work load with handling 6 - 7 real sick people. with complicated wound care to carry on other than that most co workers are excellent and friendly.
good,I had to draw every patient in the hospital (morning rounds). I did all the lab work alone. The institution is very small so there is only one position in my field of work. I came into work we hours in the morning if the workflow would be significantly heavy. Management was very poor. Had no help in that department. I kind of had to make my own decisions and what I thought would be best in certain situations. The hardest part of my job was working alone.
good,"I worked night shift a typical day for me, find out my destination the individual I'm caring for familiarize myself with there care plan, take vital signs, document on the resident. Answer call lights, answer phone calls at nurses station, assist residents with daily living activities. escort residents to activities or their rooms, clean there rooms."
good,Patient to nurse ratio inadequate to provide safe patient care. Good learning experience for tube feeding and ventilator patients.
good,a typical day @times was not pleasant because some of the workers did not give standard care to the patients and resented when approached in a professional manner no support from management
good,I process credentialing application (initials and reappointments) on medical physicians for the hospital. It is very busy and detailed. You have to be accurate with data entry and verify everything. I learned how important it is to verify all information for a physician and to have Accreditate. My co-workers are great people to work with and they are very knoledgable.
good,"It's not the work that is hard, it is having to deal with Co workers that think they are superior to you as a human being. They are really unprofessional when it comes down speaking another language in patients room the patients not being able to understand what they are saying. Talking about other employees in another language while they sit at the nurses station. And when confronted by department heads about not speaking another language at the nurses station or in patients rooms it gets ignored and laughed at."
good,"I loved my residents and my co-workers, but the management is off track,and in my eyes the team is only as strong as its management."
good,"My current job is really not what I was hired to accomplish, as there has been 5 different Directors since I started with different visions.  I miss the opportunity to interface with patients, families, and Physicians.  I have however developed great working and professional relationships with outside Managed Care and national health insurance provider staffs, to promote appropriate discharge options for hospitalized patients in need of discharge options."
good,Large company with many opportunities yet this also was a weakness.  Limited communication between departments.
good,Extremely busy.  I learned a lot from a prior manager.  The dept I worked in was flexible.
good,"small , most patients with trachs, vents and tube feedings..  major infections and poor outlooks"
good,"I would do daily ADL's"
good,"The day normally starts with all rehab staff preparing there therapy equipment in the main rehab gym.  Each therapist would over look their case load and the techs would receive their assignments from their respective therapist.  Then everyone would hit the hospital floors treating their patients with therapeutic exercise and the likes.  As for me, I was to assist immobile patients into what is called a Barton chair or CAD chair.  I would allow the patient to sit for max of 2 hours unless they had family there and wanted to sit longer.  Also each patient received range of motion exercises on all major limbs and joints as they could tolerate.  This was a long term acute setting.  Many of the patients did not like to comply with therapy, usually due to pain or wounds.  Besides range of motion exercises and assisting patients out of bed.  I would also treat patients under therapist supervision as assigned. This normally included helping in ambulatory training and edge of bed therapeutic activity.  The hardest part of the job was having to get help to do things that required more than one person.  People would always seem too busy or disgruntled when you needed there help.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when a patient actually recognize you for trying to help them and when you can see your hard work pay off by them being discharged back to their home."
good,Its a nice place to work. They have the best theraphy team ive seen in a long time. The ED is great and very easy to work with and shes very understanding.
good,Rehabcare is a great company that would be perfect for therapists.
good,Relatively laid back environment with close knit employee and physician networking.
good,"A typical day would be to start out assessing the pts. before my shift started to see what condition they were in., I had good co-workers, they mostly performed the way they were told to care for the pts, my DON was a nice person and gave me compliments on my performance and dedication to my job. I learned that just one person that has multiple job duties can't do it alone to care for pts., it takes the whole staff to do a great job, making pts. and family happy and my supervisor happy was the best part of my job, the worst part of my job was to go in on a daily basis and have to fix problems and that should have been taken care of from the previous shift."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Every morning starts with the morning meeting, we discuss what to expect for the up and coming day. Admissions starts with a tour of the building to ensure all rooms are presentable for the arrival of a new patient. While touring the building stop by and say hello to the current residents to see how they are doing. If any questions or concerns arise take it upon myself to get them handled in a timely manner. Began working the faxes from hospitals and return any calls that have come in. ensure any new admissions are settled in may sure they have received proper meals if they arrive late. Get the necessary paperwork signed."
good,"My job each day requires me to meet many deadlines. I need to multi task throughout my day. I must meet and interview all admissions within 72 hours and meet with team to discuss goals for discharge, obtain insurance auths on a daily basis, assist in appeals process, provide weekly clinical reviews for all insurance patients. perform all ICD9 coding requirement, initiate and maintain all MCR certifications, run a weekly Medicare meeting to discuss goals and discharge plans for each patient, complete discharge eduaction with all pts."
good,You have to have strong assessment skills and be willing to work as a team.
good,Poor administrative support and limited room for advancement.
good,I love the staff and facility that I work at but there is very little contact with the parent company.
good,great employees worked well with training and patience and updates.
good,"The upper management changes about every 6-8 months and along with it personal preference for how things are done changes. Staffing ratios change constantly, and are often cut to the minimum legal staff, making it very difficult to provide quality care."
good,"Good place to work for years ago. But now not. I had a good experience, coworkers were very good."
good,"I was just fresh out of school when I started working here. All the patients are total care, and dependent on the staff. If you don't have the experience, this isn't the place to start out with. Even people with 20 years of experience find this place to be a difficult place to work at."
good,"Kindred Hospital is a great place to get a wide variety of experience. The patient load on the floor is not safe, in my judgement (typically 5-6 patients, occasionally 7). There are plenty of learning opportunities related to wound care and ventilator-dependent patients. Many of the patients are high-acuity patients. I experienced frustration around the lack of support and/or resources."
good,Wouldn't recommend staffing was a problem and schduling unorganized not a good experience unfortunely.
good,Although provided excellent customer serv. to their clients. Internal drama made it difficult to work.
good,almost always the staffing is short and you hope everything will be okay until the end of your shift or else you'll be screwed. if you have another choice go somewhere else. no support from management.
good,"If you can make sure your ready for hard work and have a strong work ethic, you will be fine  it is a heavy lifting job, and not everybody listens all the time"
good,good job but it was hard work got vary little help from staff because they had there own work to do .It did get better when I went to night shift  I had moor time to spend with my patience
good,worked under 4 different directors and learned valuable lessons for pts care and leadership. changes leadership made did not make our team feel valued.
good,Great place to make a difference in patient's lives.  CMS has added regulation that has made meeting goals extremely difficult and has left patient's with less than optimal choices and care.
good,Great place to learn and get your clinical skills under your belt. Management were not micro managers and gave me the autonomy to run my dept the way I wanted to allow me to give the best gold standard care to the patients. Money for equipment and supplies was always an issue. Not great with pay and raises. Stayed because of the love of working with the patients and changing their lives.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Learned a lot of diverse nursing skills and knowledge, especially time management and prioritizing care. Heavy patient work load with team based approach. Learned to work effectively on a team and coordinate with multiple disciplines."
good,"Is a friendly place, enjoyed working with my co workers, good environment , very clean, and quite place, but have to work fast pace, was a ok plain e of work"
good,Upper management places too much emphasis on profit and not enough on patient care. Any training we received was great in a state of the art training room. Employees rarely got the breaks we deserved.
good,I worked nights and didn't have supervisor on duty. We used a telephone system to check in and check out. As long as you worked your hours you will have no problems working for this company. No local office is a barrier in home health field when you need coverage. I was just a prn staff member that turned to 56 hours per week due to short staffing.
good,"If you love therapy--it's a great company to work for"
good,"When I worked there the house manager was almost useless as a back up person which is part of the role. They advertised private rooms but then tried to double up patients for a time including rooming a bed-bound man with an infected wound with a mobile gentleman with an uninfected wound. I had to stay late many times due to the next nurse not showing up for shift. At least twice the A/C was out for >=1 day and people with wounds were made to endure this when they could've been moved to other parts of the hospital that had A/C. A few of the doctors were allowed to malign ""all nurses"" even though I was good at my job, always appreciated by my patients and families, and received recognition for my work ethic! Also, in order for me to make it to my weekly Religious gathering on Sunday I was told since I wasn't working the one weekend a month required of all employees I had to work EVERY Saturday. I felt 2 Saturdays would've been fair but EVERY Saturday was punitive."
good,Great opportunity to work with people and increase patients quality of life. Management can be harsh and unempathetic to patient's needs as well as staff needs.
good,Working at Kindred was early in my nursing home administrator career. I learned a great deal regarding the nursing home industry while working with this company.
good,I went 3 months straight without a single break during one of my 8-hour shifts (I worked twice a week). Super understaffed and busy with a lot of turnover
good,"It was fulfilling providing quality care to the patients/residents. Current  management at that time did not back up there employees. However, the coworkers were willing to work together for the quality of care of our patients/residents."
good,During my time at the facility work was rigorous due to the age of the facility and the unwillingness to pay for what was needed. Management was good but the company was sold 4 times during my time at the facility progressively getting worse. At the end of my time at the facility everyone disliked working at the facility but it was a check.
good,Management is extremely focused on productivity above most other aspects including patient care most of the time. Co- worker culture is relaxed & friendly with good support from immediate supervision.
good,"Most enjoyable:  "
good,"this place is like any job . it has its good days and bad days"
good,"Pay rate was good but expectations were very high, also most jobs are contracted to a facility where you're  expected to maintain customer relationship with the facility all while maintaining your work productivity simultaneously."
good,They are okay as far as a large corporation goes.  Nothing extra special but not horrible either.  Individual bosses can make a difference and I'm lucky to have a good one.
good,"Kindred is a fast paced, high acuity level LTAC facility. This company forces you to quickly learn time management and organizational skills. However, given the acuity level of the patients, the staffing ratios are unsafe (i.e. 1 nurse to 6 patients). It was a great place to learn new skills."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,Extremely unorganized and mismanaged.  Rarely is there administration staff because they don't stay. Nurse to patient ratio is awful as well as cna to patient ratio.
good,Great employees.....great relationships with patients.   Therapy department work hard with mobilization towards  their patients.   Technology in facility is good at times.
good,Have been working for here for 6 months. Usually understaffed which can makes for a stressful shift. Most employees are great to work with. Management is also great.
good,"Productivity driven and virtually impossible to meet. Constant reminders given on productivity and lack positive feedback from supervisors. Numbers driven and not focused on quality patient care.  Lack of concern for employee well-being."
good,"Working at Kindred, especially nights, is fast paced and stressful.  Never boring.  RN is called upon to perform all blood sugar cks, tele strip evaluations, lab draws, assessment of pts, medication pass, treatments if necessary, and dressing changes."
good,"I worked only PRN for this company.  Hours could vary per my discretion, yet often when you got to the facility you were to work for the hours would be much more than you anticipated.  Paperwork took much longer due to poor training and use of EMR system from facility to facility."
good,Kindred did give me the opportunity to advance to a middle management role. However the pay was low and assurances that a performance based pay increases would make up the difference were hollow.
good,"Management does not have realistic expectations in regard to facility demands and patient care, focusing on productivity too much. However I enjoy my patients, co-workers as well as the flexibility of the schedule in allowing time for personal reasons."
good,I enjoyed working in a hospital . I strongly believe in great service to patients and their families. I loved building relationships with other employees.
good,"Aggressive ventilation liberation!"
good,"Short staffed frequently, new nurses hired with no leadership or mentoring, heavy patient loads, management stiff. Patient care less than standard, minimal staff support, Nurses do everything."
good,"The management worked to make the workplace as efficient as possible.  This often resulted in staff being called off to maintain the minimum staff needed based upon patient population.  As a result, the workday is busy and without much downtime."
good,I worked for 6 years with this company. . One this is they do not appreciate what they have at times.. and they are all about getting money not patient care like they say..
good,"Being a long term acute care hospital, I have seen a variety of patients from all walks of life requiring varying levels of care. I have learned how to provide and manage the care of patients with tracheotomies, on mechanical ventilation, high risk IV drug infusions, negative pressure wound therapy devices, central lines, and various stages of wounds. Most days are stressful, but I knew I could ask any one of my coworkers for assistance whenever it was needed. Personally, the hardest part of this job was dividing my time evenly among my patients. More complex patients require more time, and those who are more independent do not need my physical presence as often, however that does not mean they do not have similar psychosocial needs. I have enjoyed all of the patients and coworkers that have taught me so much - not just in the field of nursing but in life itself."
good,"Probably one of the BEST DOP's i have ever had the pleasure of working under. The upper management could have done a lot to improve employee satisfaction. The site i worked at had the lowest satisfactions score due to short staffing regularly and bare minimum compensation. Those that did stick around were real team players but the company had a hard time recruiting and maintaining GOOD employees. Previous CEO had better ties with employees and the community, making it a much better place to work."
good,"It' s a company that is not very appreciative of the loyal, dependable, and hard working employees. Wage increases are something that are not going to be given but the company has no problems with asking employees to take on more work."
good,My co-workers make this job enjoyable. The hardest part of this job is dealing with management as they treat everyone as a liability and not very respectful.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"busy"
good,"its a decent place to work, but trust me you'll be tired at the end of your 12 hour shift.  The Respiratory therapists are awesome and very helpful thought."
good,Currently  the RD is easy to work with. This is a rewarding job. The biggest down fall is finding staff members who are willing to work hard and consistently.
good,Great therapy department not sure about the rest of the staff what I do know not that impressed. I sure hope your experience is better.
good,LTAC/ Post acute care setting was very challenging and high energy. Unfortunately the compensation was not inline with the work load.
good,"At the beginning when I had started it was great. After all the problems with union strike. not much enjoyable. Overall I dd enjoy working there, great team work."
good,Great location and work spaces and highly professional teams. The work life schedule for a majority of the IT teams is not very good and project schedules are overly aggressive coupled with limited resources.
good,The overall work experience was exciting and productive but management lacked experience. Co-workers the main reason why I stayed as long as I did.
good,team work is essential to finish and provide good care for patient. hardest part of the job is too much things to accomplish with too little  time
good,"My favorite part of this job was working with people. I love making people smile and making them feel comfortable in uncomfortable atmospheres. "
good,Great co-workers! easy going facility.  They had difficulty keeping a Rehab Director on staff this made communication difficult
good,"teamwork is the most enjoyable part of the job along with making the patients get well, and the hardest part is not being able to spend enough time with my patients"
good,"The work at Kindred Hospital, Houston Medical Center campus was the most excited working area. The challenges were rewarding in that they toughened us to handle stressful situations such the daily  experience at kindred hospital. A great place to learn for new comers to the field of direct patient care. Most co-workers were very warm hearted and easy going. The hardest part was how to satisfy the family and patients most of who were very frustrated by the prognosis of their diseases. Free parking and occasional free breakfast and lunch meals."
good,great company that provides excellent care but not a great position for a true sales professional.
good,"It was a good place to learn right after school.  On a typical day, I would have anywhere from 5 to 8 patients to myself with a CNA.  I did my own assessments and passed my own medications.  I also did my own treatments."
good,I enjoyed working with the people in my department. I feel I i learned  and grew through them as well as they learned and grew through me.  I looked forward to working with these people daily.
good,"Some days are more stressful than others, however your in great company at kindred because the staff is awesome."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"You know what you are doing when you go to work everyday, the same thing basically. Co-workers are the nicest people. Its not the best job but its bearable."
good,I have tlearned to take on multiple facilites and manage them offsite.
good,"I loved what I did here, working in the medical records field. I had hands on interaction with our residents and patients, learned a lot from our doctors and nurses, and built up my knowledge for future jobs in the medical field."
good,"Professional colleagues made going to work daily very intersting, as well as various levels of patients were seen daily. Greatest challenge was being a contract company as opposed to being in house therapy."
good,"Kindred was a wonderful experience.....don't get me wrong it had its ups and downs ....but mostly ups. A typical day was never typical....lol. The patients there were very acute and usually had multiple diagnoses....many of the patients came directly from either the hospital's  icu unit  or other nearby hospital's critical care units.."
good,"My typical day at work was okay. I gained a great deal a patience at this facility: I also have a new appreciation for people with disabilities. The management well some was fair and others not so much so, but that's with any company you work in. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job I had was dealing death of our residents. I loved making the family members and residents smile."
good,"As a whole, I do like working here, but the morale and staff have really gone down hill. I do not see any advancement available for me, nor am I sure the company is staying in STL for much longer."
good,Large health care operation based in KY - primarily rehabilitation work - with many corporate requirements - success depends on local management
good,"Kindred has changed alot since I started working there almost 8 years ago. I love the staff members I work with, but honestly do not trust the current upper managers. I feel that the policies are not always followed, and that employees are treated differently for the same offences. A typical day for me now is either being the supervisor, or having a patient assignment. The typical ratio is 6 patients for each nurse. We have very sick patients, and the ratio, I feel, should be no more than 5:1. The most enjoyable part of my job is taking care of my patients and their family members. The hardest part of my job is the frustration I feel when I don't have enough time to do everything that I feel would make their day the best it could be due to the 6:1 ratio. I have learned a tremendous amount since I have been at Kindred. We have had LVAD patients, many ventilator patients, complex wounds, quad and paraplegic patients, many codes, which I have run myself frequently when there have been no Doctors in the house. I have more seniority there than only 3 other people, and I am very attached to many of my co-workers."
good,One of the highlights of my IT career. I was able to work with a strong network of peers when required and the rest of the time was left a great deal of independence.
good,Nice environment.
good,A typical day involves preparing/presenting orientation to new employees. Organizing or presenting inservice education for hospital staff.
good,"nothing more satisifying then rehabilitating the elderly so they may return home or lesser care inviorment, so them can maintain there independance."
good,"I liked working for them    But I don’t like to be micro managed "
good,When you get hurt on the job they won’t send you to the follow up doctor or to get mri or ct or send you to a specialist like the doctor recommended and they bagger you to get back to work when doctor puts you on light duty
good,I would definitely weigh my options. Kindred is not a place to work that you would look for growing. Ensure you choose a career path that allows you to grow.
good,"Great opportunity for advancement, went through many changes in leadership that resulted in often turn over . lack of teamwork at times. Great flexibility"
good,Kindred home health care is downsizing and laying off employees. It is difficult to recommend them at this time due to this. It has also been bought by Humana and benefits are unsure.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Fast pace, acute care so no day was the same as the previous. A lot to learn, some doctors was very much into teaching you which was helpful in understanding certain disease process. Management had their own priorities, nursing supervisors were helpful. Requires a lot of walking, standing, and fast pace. Can be overwhelming and stressful, especially with an admission, discharges and critically sick patients. Good team work will make all the difference."
good,"Fast paced environment, but good to start and learn your skills. It can be stressful but you will also learn quickly."
good,"The nurse:pateint ratio could be better.  It is a stressful environment and there are so many ""mandatory"" meetings to attend.  They have 2 huddles per shift to take you away from patient care.  Their expectations are high but they aren't providing the tools needed.  They are not helpful with scheduling at all.  Pay is fair.  There is good teamwork."
good,I was able to observe and learn new things.  There is an open-door policy to the nursing administration.  The best part of the job was the available overtime.
good,"Kindred was fun, just not a match for me. loved the residents and all the coworkers just didn’t really like the job for more then one reason but I would go back because the residents and my coworkers"
good,"They promised training coming in, there was none, but according to management the management above them told them ""there wasn't any time for that"""
good,About like any other LTAC. Lots of changes with administration. Inconsistency and what’s important one day isn’t the next. Part of a huge corporation with LTACS all over the country but the SA Branch in medical center seems to play by their own rules.
good,"No different than most sub acute rehab contract company. People-first was a first class operation. When they merged with RehabCare  about 5 years ago, they really went down hill & inherited a lot of the baggage RehabCare was know for. Big mistake. ""What a shame."" People-first was a highly respected organization where therapists wanted to go to work for. ""What a shame, a real shame."""
good,"Significant job demands, difficult to balance responsibilities.  Facility expectations high, difficult to manage productivity of staff as well as expectations of facility"
good,"Chronically not enough staff.    ""Running non-stop"".  Appreciated by management constantly though.  Cancelled quite often because of low census.  Food was low cost and really good.  Management was friendly."
good,"Working with Kindred has been good, the benefits are okay, but renumeration is affected by limited patient census from  time to time across facilities, leading to inconsistent pay."
good,It was very stressful and low pay. Their benefits are not good at all. If you are attending school this job would not be a good fit for you. They do not work with you for school.
good,I enjoy taken care of my patients.  We mostly have ventilator patients.  We try to help get them off the ventilator.  It is like some jobs some days are better than others.  I try to make the most out of my shift and treat my patients well.
good,Nice environment. Facility is clean and well maintained. Nurses are knowledgable and ready to help you. Bathrooms are clean. Nurses are friendly and nice
good,It was a different environment then where I previously worked so it was an adjustment but I enjoyed it. I worked at a casino before working for kindred amd it was a very different environment
good,If you like to work under pressure and in a fast paced environment this place is for you!  I have been happy working for rehabcare for ten years but am looking for something a little less stressful!
good,I was able to learn a lot and improve on my communication skills. The environment allowed me to cultivate relationships with different staff members and work as a team.
good,"you were always understaffed , the nurses never would help you in a difficult situation , the nurse would be on the phone with her friend making plans for the week end . the DON or the Administrator ,wouldnt believe the SRNA , she would always believe the nurse . Even families had saw first hand in the situations and that was sad ."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,Pretty good place to work.The staff was nice enjoyed working there. The night shift was very quiet. The hours were good and if you want to pick up hours were there.
good,"I can't exactly write a review...When i was hired it was not Kindred, the company i originally worked for was with the state and it was bought out by Kindred"
good,"My problem with the position I held was not with Kindred. The problem I had was with the nursing staff at the facility I worked at. They were incredibly uncooperative with me in confirming times for patient arrival, and often times, my colleague and I had to move beds into rooms ourselves for patients because the nursing staff was too lazy to do it themselves. I often walked past the nursing station to find them sitting and joking with each other while patients call lights were going off. I was often talked down to by the head nurses, even though they had no right to treat me the way they did."
good,"This job was very under staffed and we were all very over worked, it was hard to keep people there, the pay was not that great for the amount of work we had to do so I moved on took a break for a while and stayed home"
good,"Working at Kindred was good experience for someone new to the healthcare field, because even newcomers are given a lot of responsibilities. However, unforeseen events occur, as they tend to do in healthcare settings, the workload could become onerous."
good,Patient to nurse ratio was high. Managers would not listen to concerns most of the time. Staff helps out when needed. I did learn a lot. Patients are usually intubated and in acute conditions.
good,"working with families of patients who were on ventilators was fulfilling. in addition, supporting patients and their families as they worked through their grieving process was also what I like."
good,I liked working at Kindred Healthcare.  The only reason I left was health related.  I needed to change from night shift to dayshift but they did not have an opening for dayshift so I had to choose another option
good,"I loved working in this facility. Employees were like family to one another, helpful in every way not only in their jobs but with patients in the facility as well. I had never worked at a facility with this much harmony and have not worked in such an environment since. Highly recommend this facility."
good,This job requires flexibility and being able to travel for your 40 hour work week if not available at your home facility. Team work depends on which facility you are at.
good,"great place to work,  great shifts,12 hour shifts. friendly atmosphere.a typical day starts at 7:00 A.M. and ends at 7:30 P.M.work 3 days a week.every othewr weekend"
good,"Enjoyed my co-workers; good place to learn new skills, and expand your current skills. Nurse to patient ratio was too high; very stressful work environment."
good,"A typical day of work results in it always being fast paced. However, in being part of the healthcare industry for over twenty years, we are always adapting with change in order to delivery quality care."
good,"Great therapy team and nursing staff. Variety of diagnoses to treat. Long term care and in patient rehab facility. Knowkedgable staff members, who provide good patient care."
good,Loved working with all my departments we all had a family like environment I would have still been working if I hadn’t gotten hurt the company was very good to me and my family
good,"No nonsense approach but poor judgement by managers."
good,"This place was very nice on the inside, the look gave you a comfortable feeling.  I learn plenty here, how to shut up and bring my suggest to the table. Documentation of I/O,s vital handle care of patients bath clean. Report any changes to nurse"
good,job was not enough pay for the hours worked and the wear and tear on the vehicle. i loved the fact that i had an open schedule daily though and could make up most hours i missed
good,Worked here as a temp.  Did not have any issues.  It was a nice culture.  Enjoyed the experience that I gained while working in a hospital environment.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"It is a nice place to work however you don't have guaranteed hours. I was called out many times due to the fact that there was not enough patients, thus making it hard to make a living off of this job."
good,Valuable knowledge gained from diverse patient histories and backgrounds.  Nursing skills and communication skills improved.  overall a good starting point to a novice nurses career
good,"it is a long term care facility ,it is kindred hospital which has 13 facilities in los angeles and san bernandino in California in united states of america"
good,"low census, always cancelled from duty. that is why at the end of the day, the salary i received is not enough to sustain daily cost of living. the management if flexible of time, considerate."
good,"it is very fast paced and very stressful at times .We have very long hours and on call during the week and weekends as well as holidays. There is not a lot of downtime .I have been there almost two years ."
good,"Upper management doesn't value its employees but my local team was amazing and collaborative.  My team members supportive, knowledgable and dedicated to the patients making for a good workplace environment."
good,"The company pushes productivity over patient needs. The manager was pressured to push visits and increased visit times, even when not always appropriate."
good,This was a good PRN position. I worked there for almost 18 years. Enjoyed my co-works and I enjoyed the freedom and flexibility that  the job offered.
good,worked there for several years.. not enough staffing supervisors needs more training for their kind of job. a  good place to work for starter nurses or new graduate. lots of things to learn for complicated medical/ surgical cases.
good,"my first ""nursing"" employment, it was fantastic, would not trade that experience for nothing, my mentors were great and patient , making sure i was equipped in preforming my daily assignments accordingly"
good,Great place for a starting out dietitian. Not too fast and good people to help you learn. It's not an acute care facility it's acute long term care so you really get good at learning tube feeds and TPN.
good,"The Kindred branch that I worked for was a small and newer sect of the Kindred network. This branch was equipped with mostly entrepreneurs and inexperienced staff with a very low pay rate. High turn over due to inadequate training and continually insufficiently staffed. Our branch was highly strapped financially and unable to accommodate staffing needs a majority of the time."
good,The most important and satisfactory shifts at work that are so remarkable and exiting to me are whenever I make my patients feel better or it feels great to be part the group of healthcare staff that accomplish on the patients improvements.
good,"The staff is very easy going. The only problem is that they always have more patients than what the nurses can take care of. So, at noon, most of the nurses end up not taking lunch"
good,I personally work with a great team not including the most recent director it is a small family like feeling I would work with that team again if given the opportunity
good,"I prefer not to provide information regarding this company, other than to say was a good company to work for and I enjoyed the people I worked with every day."
good,work hours good.co worker good to work with. Everyone  comes together as a team when time in needed.no drama. If anyone ask to come work here would say yes. Cause I enjoy a lot way better then I last job
good,"Contacted by my patients daughter seeking in home care for her elderly mother."
good,"Tough job, which makes you multitask person and learn hardship. Most of the patients are terminally ill which means totally dependent, there is a staff shortage too which makes the job tough."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,When I first started i was so excited they showed me so many things that I thought would help me in assisting the patients. Once I started I realized there was no team work and the management had its favorites. I worked hard and ultimately was injured because management wanted more beds filled with patients. more than they were concerned with the care they would require. towards the end we received more and more patients that should have been sent to mental health where restraints are available compared to our facility where it was no an options.I was hit and attacked multiple times. yet management always seem to think it was not important.
good,"Poor management with no support provided to the employees. However, great support from some of the supervisors. Good team- work environment in some of units of the hospital."
good,"I work in the largest rehab contracted  facility in NE Wis. It is fast paced with high productivity standards. I am responsible  for clerical and administrative duties and assisting therapist with transfers, ambulation and cleaning the gym. I enjoy working in a professional team in setting. My favorite part in may day is when I get to interact with the patients. The most difficult part of my job is keeping up with the paperwork."
good,"expected you to do point of service documentation with every patient which is not always possible when performing manual therapy or ADL's; once again, its about the money not patient care. Medicare standards has made therapy boring."
good,"Hard to evaluate as new to facility. Hard to adjust to LTACH from other areas of nursing, but doable. CEO visible frequently through the week, Still adjusting to people."
good,"Good job, enjoyed working with this company. Learned a lot of things while employed with this company and met a lot of people. Got to see a lot of innovative ideas."
good,Good company to work for. Wealth of skills to be acquired. Very good CNO at the Dallas Central location.The management is also very good and understanding. There is good team work among employees.Most enjoyable part of the jobs is placing a smile on my patients face and team work
good,High productivity standards with underpayment unless challenged.  Good continuing education benefits.  Good PTO benefits.  Good therapy interactions.  .
good,"This company has many facilities and opportunities to work in the St. Louis, MO area, as well as nation wide. Employees are professional, hard working, flexible and experienced."
good,when I worked there 13 years ago it was a good place to work. not sure how it is now. Co workers were good to get along with and it was not cut throat as in some places. Expected high out put with little slack in the day.
good,"The staff was very nice. At UTMB I was used to a culture where the nurses and doctors worked as a team for the best care of the patient. I did not find that here. Some of the doctors were very nice, but others were disrespectful to the nurses unfortunately."
good,"I really enjoyed working with LTC as well as STC patients. "
good,I did not enjoy this job what so ever. The management team needed all new people in there because they had no idea what they were doing or how to run a place.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"The people you work with make it a good place to work. The company doesn't pay good and offer horrible health insurance. Hours are flexible. If the company offered more, would be an excellent place to work."
good,"not enough training, heavy lifting, no job moral. it was a new experience and didn't like the atmosphere. Rude co-workers..nothing follows. Management was approachable"
good,"Salary did not match the amount of work required for that role nor the ego of certain employees. However, if you enjoy being busy it was a great environment for that."
good,"My hours here were not set and I was on-call every other week, Sunday through Thursday. I would say it was stressful 80% of the time due to lack of team assistance."
good,Okay place to work. I did my clinical there. It was not a bad place to work; however the staff was a bit unfriendly for the most part. Some nurses were nice and welcoming as well.
good,"I was working at rehab care until their contract was discontinued at the SNF I was working at.  I continued to work at the same SNF under ENSIGN.  I enjoyed my co-workers, the pay was good.  The pace was busy with high productivity"
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,i enjoyed working at kindred i miss working one on one patient care but. i liked the working environment while working at the front desk meeting different people and co workers.
good,I love the patient contact in their homes but the paperwork has left me disillusioned. Helping patients in their deepest need is why I became a nurse. the hardest park of the job is making sure where they live.
good,"It was geat experience to work at Kindred, started as new nurse, I learned great clinical skills which made me a good case manager with great skills, knowledgeable"
good,"Kindred Hospital provides care and support in the most appropriate care setting for those recovering from illness or injury. Clinical care consistently that exceeds national benchmarks also addresses patient emotional needs. Kindred is unique, in that they provide care tailored to the patient's specific needs. "
good,Provided good base salary and monthly bonus opportunity. Provided ample car allowance and mileage. Changed bonus goal in the middle of the month on one occasion.
good,Good company to work for  Very devoted to caring for the sick community at all levels within the organization.  Nice office space and also could work from home at times.
good,Was a great company to work for .They anoledge all work u do .They offers above and beyond.i liked working with kindred wish they was still here just didn't pay well
good,Had a good work ethic with the manager in the area I worked. Not much training. Most of the time I had to wing it on my own but ultimately caught on. The position was not hard or difficult and it  anything  that I couldn't learn if properly trained.
good,"decent progressive company / a bit competitive  this place offers alot of inncentivesfor employees it even has a day care. The have payroll deduct, a decent discount network. minorities must be confident & firm."
good,"Management seems more concerned with making money than their patients and employees. Patient care is better at some facilities than others, do your home work."
good,the work load is unsafe and the pay is awful compared to the amount of work we have to do.  The management is terrible because their is a lack of communication.
good,Great place to work and staff works together. They had great benefits and incentives. Activities for staff and patients were fun. Enjoyed the environment!
good,"Not sure what it was like to rate this entirely because I wasn't technically employed by the company. The people who did work there got paid what I started to make when I joined a real corporate company in comparison to a hospital, you would think they would get paid more, but no."
good,"The work here is hard but rewarding. I learned a lot as a new nurse. "
good,"Fast paced and under staffed. Shifts were 12 hours, standard for medical field, but can be physically exhausting despite getting 3 days off in a row. Staff shortage made it difficult to give each patient the care they deserved."
good,"A typical day at work I arrive and do reports and count. Overall Patient Care, passing meds, doing treatments, Overall assessments on all patients. IV therapy as needed."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of the patients. There were challenges for this population of patients and I learned many skills to help manage their care which proved helpful in my nursing career.

good,Great employees to work with.  Management was ok.  Pay was horrible and no raises offered.   Nursing staff was wonderful!  I loved my coworkers and made for a fun working environment.
good,Oasis has to be in within 48hrs. The home health cases are all over Broward county. You can put many miles on your vehicle daily. They have weekly mandatory meetings you have to attend
good,"	Directed the day-to-day operations of the Case Management Department in a Long Term Acute Facility (LTAC), when needed performed active case management for populations served,"
good,I enjoyed working PRN for this company. Unfortunately the census fluctuated so much there was less need for PRN therapists.  The rehab department was enjoyable to work in.
good,My duties consist of answering phones and call lights  and which patient heart on the monitor station. I could get very busy but most of all the staff took very good care of the patient made there stay at the hospital good.
good,"Prepare food for patients, deliver food to patients, and clean. when you prepare food for patients, you need to make sure all equipment are clean and sanitized."
good,Company isn't operating in my area anymore so had to relocate. Facility remains but is run by another entity and they were fully staffed so I had to find other placement
good,Kindred was purchased by another company and many non-clinical positions were eliminated.  There was nothing that could have been done to change this and it was an administrative decision.
good,"Some of the staff when I was there was great, but management was weak, and not responsive to seemingly minor issues. It was stressful place to work as a results, always putting out fires rather than preventing the fires."
good,"Daily treatment of patients with point of service charting and communications with patient, family, and or other staff.  Multiple patients seen daily on a inpatient and or outpatient level."
good,To many gossiping people at this particular location. everyone was always spreading rumors or trying to get in your business. jealousy ran throughout the hospital.
good,I appreciate working at kindred.  Its fast-paced and the work flow is constant. The team I work with is very flexible and opened to new ideas. Communication is key.
good,This company work you until you have nothing else to give. I will say their benefits was the only reason I stay as long as I did. Nothing else job was very back breaking.
good,"Working at Kindred Healthcare - Eagle Creek was fast paced.  Lots of responsibility.  Guidelines concerning State Regulations, etc. can be quite challenging."
good,"Providing high quality of care to patients/clients with diverse medical conditions.very busy work place with little or no help from "
good,Awesome. This is a at your pace jib. It was great doing one on one with residents and families. You get a different level of patients when dealing one on one with residents. All around good job
good,"The work was challenging but you were recognized by your supervisor. You were exposed to all aspects of accounting, budgets, forecasts, projections, journal entries, A/P and so on."
good,"liked the people I worked with, close to home, like the residents and staff, fun place at times and never boring, could bring my dog to work and she could also meet the residents and staff"
good,"As a PRN OT, I have minimal access to a supervisor on the weekends because that's the position I was hired for. I was not given assistance to complete the necessary compliance paperwork that I needed a supervisor for. Was not given any warning or heads up that this was due (I have a full time job); and was notified by a text message from the supervisor that position was going to be terminated. I will not recommend anybody in that area work for this company due to lack of professionalism and communication with management roles. Manager FORGOT about my interview. I never even got a name tag."
good,"Stressful, I learned an enormous amount about different ways to communicate with people and their family members. The management was decent, no real problems there."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"I learned many skills at this facility, I had very good mentors; nurses who showed me how to be more effective and how to manage my time wisely. Overall this job thought me a lot"
good,"Kindred offered me an opportunity albeit being overqualified for the position. The culture was layed back, friendly and the encouraged engagement resulted in professional relationships.  My day started and ended with engaging  payers, clinical staff, admissions and case managers. Each day contained the analysis of benefits and associating the contractual reimbursements against the patients benefits and exemptions.  The hardest part of the job was helping contracting physicians problem solve a denial. The enjoyable part of the job was working in a ""family feeling"" environment."
good,i love doing floor care i worked all the over time i needed but was passed up for a full time position for employees who had kidds and they needed benefits  even if i been there longer worked when call and took overtimer
good,Nurses worked together well. Management was approachable 24/7. Staffing was short most of the time. Patient care was above average. There was room to grow.
good,"I liked kindred but I needed a different place of view. I also quit to move to Wynne, Arkansas.. "
good,"I've worked in many rehabcare buildings. The best part is the people I've worked with. Management is under fire constantly about productivity & saving money. Throughout my experience, my pay or my hours were cut multiple times due to medicare changes affecting our bottom line. Benefits also tend to decrease quite often (less benefits, higher pemiums). Documentation is done on ipads & start/stop times are required & reviewed."
good,"Good place to work, had the opportunity to interface with the doctors, staff and help patients when needed.  Good work environment and good staff in the department."
good,"had fun and learnt a lot while there, it was my first job as a cna and i really learnt a lot, more than what you just train for in class, the supervisors and management were friendly and they always help when you needed them"
good,"I thought I knew what I was doing as a respiratory therapist coming from a busy ER in South Florida. The way you take care of a LTAC patient versus an acute patient are like night and day. Working at Kindred has taught me to be a better therapist, both for the patient and their family."
good,Very nice environment for learning and get experience especially wood care and other patient services. Good customer services and other patients related.
good,"patients suffer from multiple organ failure, complicated wounds, and infections requiring IV antibiotics. Great place to utilize skills and stay very busy."
good,"I typically drive from home to home in the surrounding areas to provide Physical Therapy treatment to people who are still under the care of a Licensed Physician. I've learned how to accommodate the needs of patients who live below a certain level of socioeconomic status so that they are able to make the best decision in regards to health and medicine. I am able to document their concerns while giving them advice on the options they have within their means. The hardest part of my job is scheduling appointments and motivating people to participate with treatment. However, I also enjoy seeing the progress that is made by those who are compliant."
good,Working on this unit was fast pace. This unit kept you on your toes. It helped by enhancing your skills so that you will never forget them. Teamwork is a key because nobody was left hanging by themselves
good,"Fast-pace, primary care 7 to 8  dual diagnosed patient. The hardest part of the job was getting relieved on time, on a daily bases. When I worked there the insurance for a single person deductible was $2000.00."
good,"This job provided great pay and it was a great location; however, this company also relocated out of state. If they were to return, I would definitely love to work for this company again."
good,Working for this company was very stressful. You are constantly working and have barely little time to have personal time. even whren you are on the clcok they expect you to be working.
good,"Great manager.  Potential opportunites for growth and good support."
good,"The company took over many facilities in several states rapidly and were not prepared.  Staffing went from 3-4 Occupational Therapists to one occupational therapist.  Stayed on PRN to assist.  Postponed looking for a job because several times people accepted the job and quit before their first day.  When we obtained staff, I sat with the boss and asked if I would be continue to work or if I needed to look for wok.  The manager stated that I would be continued and decreased my weekly hours from 40 to 2 hours. Found work with the company  an hour away.   Frequently had issues with the area director who is no longer working there."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Working independently and everyone is a team player. There is a physician on-duty @ night time for support/emergency assistance."
good,"Good resources, flexible schedules, good opportunitiy for learning and improving clinical and managerial skills, good core values, well established company"
good,it is an ok place to work. it can be very fast paced and overwhelming at times. the level of care that the patients need is much higher than what you will find in a nursing home.
good,Loved the place I worked at along with my co-workers however management was poor. They were constantly changing things to benefit them not the staff. Some years we would be recognized at Christmas time other years nothing???
good,"this was a nice place to work but they have a few issues. They gave free lunch and they pay pretty well. Patient ratio is not bad either, much better than long term care"
good,"The setting can be depressing and the company is always trying to squeeze more from workers and trim the fat, but that is expected. There seem to be problems and confusion in upper management."
good,"While employed here, I learned many facets in nursing, such as helping RNs with patient wound care, correct dosing of medications, and leadership roles."
good,Great place to jump start your career. Providing many opportunities for learning and professional development. Coaching and supporting environment to practice.
good,I love that it's fast pace and very productive.Also benefits are fantastic! I learned many different qualities with my staff members and also enjoy my patients company.
good,"Working as a staff nurse with 1 resident after 5 enabled me to become very efficient in running codes- most pts had no place to go so they were stuck on a vent for the rest of their lives, it was a sad place to work but we did the best we could to help these patients. When I started there it was a new hospital and we made it a great place to work, as time passed we were unable to staff the hospital.  I reluctantly got into management and was unable to change the atmosphere so I went agency and started to work for Nortons Hospital."
good,"Great place to gain experience, and learn hands-on. Work with a large community of medically complex patients. Learn to multitask in a very busy environment. Management is great and supportive"
good,"I liked the job,  but I got laid off for no apparent reason and didn't get any alternate position in place of the lay off.  Left unemployemed.  Need better supervisors."
good,"I have learned a lot from this job. I enjoy working at my workplace surrounded with different culture. On a typical day, I work for 8 hours sometimes even more. I like working as a therapist. I also work on weekends and holidays if there is workload."
good,"the company overall was not the best, but we had a great rehab dept team. It was a challenge to work with ventilated patients, but we had a great team who helped me learn how to navigate around the ventilators."
good,"It was ok. I loved my co workers and I really miss my patients tgere. There was some favoritism in the rehab department, but I tried not to let it bother me."
good,It was okay to work for Kindred. Nothing special that stands out. I had a good patient load and the work was not bad at all. The food was great! Some of the supervisors need to work on their people skills.
good,Great place to work while you are in nursing school.  Offers student nurses position while they are on break.  Great place to learn long tern care facilities.
good,Great teamwork and very professoinal with awesome outcomes.  Good work sight despite being in Pine Bluff Arkansas.  Good support system and a wealth of resources
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Very intensive work environment.  Patients are very sick, and staffing ratios are not ideal for the level of patient care necessary.  Enjoyed working with the CNO that was there at the time."
good,Management are not being fair to their employee. Management need to listen to their employee.  Good benefits for the employee. Salary is fair. Workload is hard.
good,Felt like I was seeing patients that didn't always need it due to company need for profits.  Felt fraudulent at times.  Good insurance and pay.  Difficult to work for boss with the company and also with the boss of the nursing facility.
good,This is a long term acute care company. They take care of very sick patients. Most of whom are on ventilators and have severe wounds that need a variety of treatment.
good,"I did my externship at Kindred in 2009 and learned quite a bit. At the time I learned how to make iv's, tpn's and also knowledge of brand and generics. It was a great introduction to pharmacy."
good,Ok place to work at. Small and friendly Lots of overtime available . Management isn't the best. Learned a lot working there loved the 12 hr 3 day a wk schedule
good,Typical work day was centered around getting patients prepared for transition to next level of care and continued stay evaluations. Fast paced work environment with knowledgeable co-workers and management
good,The best part of that place is that they accept people without experience. Workload is heavy. No teamwork is encouraged. Lots of hostility and inequality.
good,Haven't worked here in a very very very very long time so I can't say much. Last time I worked was a home health aide for this company for afew years before I got my degree.
good,"I had the opportunity to personally impact many patient and their family members lives on a daily basis, which for me was the greatest part of my day and work experience with Kindred."
good,"Kindred in Mansfield is a very good place to work. Older employees need to learn to respect the new ones, respect is reciprocal and simply because you are a senior does not make others at your beck and call. No one is stupid; learning is a day to day learning process that requires time, so individuals needs to be given the opportunity to grow with confidence. Older staff has a very high tendency of eating their young."
good,"In and out of a number of hospitals assisting case managers and physicians with appropriate placement for patients needing SNF care, Alzheimer care, Rehab care, vent care, etc."
good,learned a lot with freindly co workers and patient care.  night work is good and manageable.   working with the staff is part of an easy enviroment with team benifits
good,As with all nursing jobs they don't seem to care for your well being or livelihood will terminate you for nothing due to budget or whatever the case may be but I love the company for the most part I give too much of myself and never feel appreciated with CNA work so its over for me.
good,Kindred House Call provides in-home medical services typically performed on a clinical office visit.  They rely on technology to perform their jobs efficiently.
good,"A typical day of work requires constant planning/adjustments made based on home health setting variables of family/patient status/coordination with other clinicians; I learned how to multi-task in an ever-changing environment and using creativity to achieve goals established based on resources available in the homes. Management was cooperative and helpful for desired growth. Co-workers were dependable and created a positive working environment. The hardest part of the job was time management due to large areas of the city that were required to be covered. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the patients on a personal/family level, due to being in their homes for every visit!"
good,"Very busy"
good,Work environment can be challenging.  Leadership could use improvement.  Salary is satisfactory.  Some co-workers were very nice. Staffing was not always sufficient which make service to residents less effective.
good,"LTACH experience, good staff and training, small hospital, questionable benefit of therapy to the patients due to extensive diagnoses, and inability of some patients to participate"
good,"Make it to work safe and seeing it takes a team a group"
good,This is a great place to work for an initial job out of school. This type of hospital setting offers a lot of experience most first-year nurses won't get.
good,I love kindred it's just not enough money by being such a small hospital. But it is a great place to get work experience. People are friendly and easy to get along with.
good,i interned in this pharmacy for several months only. Pharmacy is ok to work for. not really interacted with any guest. Inpatient type environment.
good,I've learned a lot and have had really good co-workers. I've been placed at multiple facilities and have gained a lot of skill.
good,Management is poor. Low compensation for duties given. Raises should be an embarrassment to the company. Have worked for 37 years and have never been given a raise of .09 cents!! Have received nothing but great reviews from superiors.
good,"Nurses do not help, they gripe at you all day to do stuff when they are short staffed and it is hard doing everything when there is only 2 people to the hall. Pay is decent and the hours are great. staff that has been there a while treats new staff badly. not the best place to work"
good,This website is obviously having issues. This particular section has asked me the same question 3 times for the same employer. Clearly my resume uploaded for a 3rd time is allocating fields correctly. This is mute
good,"I work with amazing therapists who are hardworking, compassionate, and very skilled at what they do. This is not always appreciated by upper management who is more concerned with productivity standards, and how things look on paper. Insurance companies make this a difficult setting to enjoy working in. Best part of the job is the great therapists and rehab manager I have the opportunity to work with. RehabCare in general, is only concerned about corporate gains."
good,"spent three years here and basically it was a blast. got replaced after three years and had to train my replacement ! Yuck, left a bad taste in my mouth"
good,I liked working at Kindred Hospital in Hollywood. It was a very good experience working and interacting with different people.
good,i never worked there as an employee but i heard its a great place to work. i know you can learn a lot from kindred hospital and when leave you can use those experience in your future career.
good,"You have to know someone to really move up in the company and if you are doing a great job in one place, you are not getting moved."
good,"This place was nice to work in but the environment was not very pleasant - had to share a very tight work space with another co-worker."
good,fun place to work met a lot of new people learned some things that i didnt know going into the job. got to work with a lot of people young and older. got to see a lot of interesting things that go on with a body.
good,"A typical day at work consistied of helping residence with daily need such as bathing,dressing,feeding and personal cares. What i learned working here is a huge amount of patience for what ever kind of situation i was in; working with the coworkers i had at the time helped me also realize the huge amount of team work that is required to make a facility like this one work; its no us agains all of the nurses or the system itself."
good,My career at Kindred would have to of been the hardest job I ever worked.  I worked on the floor with some wonderful nurses.
good,Its a challenging cooking experience that makes the difference in patience care. Y are told to keep several areas of the hospital stocked with items but not much time to do it. Stress level keeps high daily. People take word for word what you say to use against you. Keeping to yourself a must. Keep private your outside life.
good,Culture is the most important thing at Indeed. Great environment to work. Food and games are provided on a monthly basis. All types of extra curricular events and benefits.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,its always challenging to work in a long term care faculity. Any place you go has issues with staffing. I enjoyed the people i was working with. Building had a family feeling to it. Very hard but rewarding job
good,"good company to work for but the pay could be better. I work with a great group of therapists."
good,Communication problems within the company due to what seems to be an overall disorganization. Employees are left feeling like they don't matter except for the bottom line.
good,"I read tickets of residents, put labels on menus, dip up cottage cheese/yogurt/applesauce, pour juices, wash pots and pans, roll silverware"
good,Kindred Bayberry is a great place to start as a new graduate nurse.  I have gained many new skills and have gained the more knowledge and confidence in my nursing abilities. I have learned so much and feel I am ready to start in an acute care setting.
good,"I had a great experience working here, but towards the end we were very under staffed. Good coworkers, good residents, but too stressful."
good,"good location, close to Chicago, friendly staff but next to impossible to achieve prescribed minutes with aged patients."
good,It is a good company to work for if you enjoy the health care field. I would go back if given the opportunity and I needed a job.
good,"A wonderful company to work for, the benefits were fair. I learn a lot from my team members while working at Kindred Health Care."
good,i have been their for about ten years i have learn a lot from many of the nurses i worked with they took their time to educated me on lot of things
good,"Residents were nice easy to talk to,out going,organize. Co-workers were helpful,Family members were a joy to work with"
good,Enjoyed the patients and staff but do the all the medical insurance changes not stable. One day working next day maybe not due to new insurance laws and affects patient care and staffing.
good,"As with any place of employment or anything in life actually, there is always room for improvement. There is often times not enough staff or resources to do the job that is needed/expected. However, there are those times when things go according to plan and you actually get to see the patient improve well enough to return home to family. That in and of itself is worth the frustrations every single time."
good,"Rewarding and learned a lot from my DON. Co workers are hard working and friendly. Sometimes long hours, meet deadlines when asked to do a project."
good,"Assignment of 4-6 patients, complete or assisted nursing care, including but not limited to; admission, transfer, discharge, physical examination."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.

good,"Oversee staff caring for residents, ensuring staff are caring out physician orders."
good,"As previous management team were all let go on a Friday, I was recruited to start the initial Monday.  As there were no previous managers available for transition questions, it was somewhat difficult to adapt, learn and change processes to be fully successful."
good,"Providing occasional PRN assistance did not afford many opportunities for growth or development.  Many co-workers have had very negative things to say about this company including their productivity requirements, unethical practices, and bullying tactics."
good,"Productive and fun working environment"
good,I learn a lot at this job. Staff is honest open and communicate well.
good,"For the most part, a typical day consists of helping patients with therapy goals and some secretarial work."
good,"Overall, the work environment was somewhat hostile. It was not comfortable for me. I loved my residents, but my co-workers were not too respectable."
good,"great team players, work icu. great employer, value your opinion"
good,"Patient focused in the rehab hospital division.  Good programs for specific diagnoses.  Pleasant and cooperative.  Did most updates and education online.  Great coworkers.  Otherwise, just trying to fill in this space so I can get my resume loaded!!"
good,Learned many things in the field that will come handy in the future.  Great group of people who know the meaning of teamwork.
good,Small facility with both Short term rehab and LTC.  Worked with varied diagnosis to ensure highest level of function.
good,I gave 110% daily keeping up to date with Federal and state regulations maintaining  a great working relationship with hospitals and the community. Public presentations and educational meetings to educate about our facility. I worked daily with financial and personal information to help the patients and family with the present and future situations.
good,"I basically enjoyed my job and the staff I worked with, and for me."
good,"flexible job"
good,It was a great job and the people I worked with were professional.
good,"In this role, I have the opportunity to manage scheduling for the nursing teams for multiple facilities.  Everyday is different and challenging...although stressful.  I work with 2 groups of people that are committed to take care of the patients and who are great team players.  Oftentimes I feel blessed to have such great relationships within the DFW area."
good,"I only work 8 hours a day generally no overtime which I like. Majority of the people here are really nice to work with. However, the company needs to work on their benefits as employees are starting to leave for better benefit packages."
good,Good place to work. Don't really see too much of management because I work third shift.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,Kindred is a very good teaching long term hospital. Great learning experience.
good,"very busy, a lot of responsibilities, heavy patient loads, and very sick patients. The reward was watching the very sick patients improve. Hardest part of the job was watching the very sick patients deteriorate"
good,"A typical day @ Kindred consisted of bedside patient care for acute patients, many of which were on ventilators.  I provided primary care to about 4 patients.  This was my first experience with a patient on a ventilator.  The management staff and my co-workers were very helpful.  The hardest part of this job was being at a different location each time I worked and learning the lay-out of the unit.  The most enjoyable part was the overall experience and the pay."
good,"A typical day at work would begin in a morning meeting to staff the daily operations of the facility.  I would assist the Social Services Director in anything that he needed.  Attend care conferences, work with community partners in all aspects of discharge planning for the residents who were leaving the facility to go home.  Management was excellent and so were my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job was documenting in the MDS system.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the patients and their families and working as team."
good,Working for over two years as a Therapy Aide/ Rehab Technician for Kindred Healthcare has taught me useful skills that will benefit me in future positions in the healthcare field. I am thankful for this opportunity and would recommend this position to anyone who is interested in the Rehab field.
good,"Good place to work, co workers cool. Management needs more training. And needs to improve in kitchen equipment."
good,"I enjoy the different types and care levels of all my patients from orthopedics to tracheostomy care, all levels of surgical/medical needs. The challenge is very rewarding when my patients are able to be discharged back home knowing I assisted in providing quality of care."
good,"Great communication between PTs, OTs and the assistants in providing quality care to patients and education to family members as well as other staff."
good,"As part of the Rehabcare team, I was responsible for scheduling, payroll, directing team meetings, reporting progress to SNF staff members, communicate with physicians and nurses on regular basis to optimize care for each patient in Rehab, manage Medicare minutes, give tours of facility for potential residents and family members. This was a very schedule oriented position and required being well organized to keep department productive and positive for patients and all who visited."
good,"Decent company, but the therapy was contracted out to Rehabcare. Was not really part of the hospital."
good,"Being organized is an necessary trait, the rest falls into place."
good,Very busy hospital every day is a new experience with different patients. Management could be better my co-workers are great and believe in team work the hardest part of my job is trying to please the patients the enjoyable part is taking good care of patients knowing that i have helped someone to the best of my ability.
good,Fun work place great staff great management very enjoyable
good,"Worked with the elderly and preformed such things as ADL’s, meal pass, daily activities, assisting nurses and rehab staff, light housekeeping. I enjoyed putting smiles on the residents faces, and gave them something to look forward to. The hardest part of my job would have to be seeing the residents get sick, and pass away."
good,I have learned much from working here at Kindred with telemetry monitoring and ACLS certification. I have learned it's not always easy to staff when census is full which is hard part of job. Not easy asking nurses to do more overtime and keep the overtime to a minimum. Another hard part of this job is that thre is no pharmacy after 11pm to which it is my job then to get meds from nightlocker and insure no reactions to meds. I do enjoy working the floor with the staff when needed and being able to talk with patients and families..seeing a patient actually go home or walk out of this facility is rewarding.
good,"learn a lot how to manage long-term ventilator patients."
good,Job satisfaction depends on which location you are placed/working at.
good,"A lot of the management is unexperienced and unfair, but there are times that they really do work with their employees to fix problems. It is always rewarding taking care of your patients but sometimes it is frustrating when you run into financial problems that affect patient care."
good,This facility is expanding very fast. It's finding it's value and spot through the healthcare facilities. There are lots of skills and experiences that I learned there. It's a diverse work place and I had the chance to work with people from all around and that was very much fun. The hardest part of job was the deadline but most of the time we could manage and finished it on time and passing the shift to the other co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with patients.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,Kindred Healthcare is one of the top healthcare providers in the industry always exceeding the expectation by going above and beyond.
good,"I had to work with the elderly, and I got to meet new people. I'm a little shy around new people, so maybe this was a good job to get me out of that."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that I get to take part in our LEADERSHIP rounding requirement for quality improvement. I get to ""round"" on the patients asking them how their stay is and getting to know the patients and their families. That allows me to be able to take part in our ""success"" stories."
good,I enjoy working with patients on a daily basis and meeting new people.
good,"Drawing blood and processing specimens. "
good,"My introduction to hospital administration began as an Executive Fellow in the Kindred Healthcare, Inc. Executive Fellowship Program. This is a prestigious program, whose goal is to recruit talented individuals who have an interest in long-term healthcare; subsequently, provide those individuals with the knowledge, training, and diverse hands-on experience necessary to excel as a hospital CEO.  After a year of successful completion, I have gained skills and experiences which supplement my career path."
good,Was a good place to work.  Great rehab team.  Great Medical Directors.
good,I worked at the Kindred rehabilitation hospital for one summer.
good,co worker are great patients are nice. most enjoyable is sending patient home .
good,This company has been very beneficial to my nursing career providing a variety of opportunities over past 7years.  I have had the benefit of working with outstanding doctors and employees.  Different employees have been at this hospital for 16-44 years.
good,I really care for the residents I work with. They really make the job worth while.
good,"Company is ok to work for, it is busy. I learnd wound care assistant, management is ok. Olderworkers in the compnay makes it hard b/c you will have more work so they have less"
good,It was a ok job the pay was ok for the most part everybody got along good thats what maid you want to come to work
good,"A great place to learn new things; A great place to meet new people, and most of all a great place to give great patient care."
good,"I have very busy fast paced days."
good,"Prepared New Hire orientation, maintained employee training, updated information in ADP, set up interviews, update and post internal postings, and assisted with updating employee information in Taleo Talent Management system."
good,"long days, and office staff was not the greatest. I was always had to work every weekend when i was told from the start that i wouldnt have to work every weekend they were suppose to rotate"
good,"A typical day at work is taking on a patient assignment of 11-17 patients.  I perform their vital signs, assessments as needed, blood sugar checks, administration of medications, perform their treatments, and do written charting. I have learned to multi-task with large patient assignments.  The LPNs and RNs are very knowledgable and we work well as a team amoung all shifts.  Management is a bit unorganized compared to the hospital healthcare setting I am use to.  The hardest part of the job has been no organized orientation into either of my LPN/RN roles.  I have had to learn by experience and co-workers.  Most enjoyable part of my job is making a difference in the residents life and seeing them get stronger and get to leave the facility."
good,very busy place to work. meet a lot of different walks of life 
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"no comment  "
good,Your always on the move. You learn to work well with other.  Your co-worker are kind and willing to help.
good,"Great facility and pleasant atomospere. Managment is the weakesst point but we have a strong team of occupational, physical and speech therapists. Great benefits and flexible schedule."
good,its hard and busy but im happy because i learned how to be a hard worker and to help my co-worker in the daily basis.
good,"A typical day at work for me was staying on top of my duties, making sure my patients clean and bathed. I learned that a positive attitude is very important I had to put a time on some of my task like making beds and the hardest part of my job was not taking their problems home with me. The most enjoyable part of my job was that nobody died that day."
good,Did everything in the kitchen and catering. Kitchen work is hard and enjoyable.
good,"a typical day was fine I learn the value of family,management was great as well as co workers hardest part was seeing the patients that were very sick most enjoyable was when the paitents left for home and commented on how good a place it was"
good,"peoplefirst was the original, has been rehab care for a few months and many changes made, people first was more focused on people i feel"
good,great co- workers true team players really enjoy working here
good,I enjoyed working here as a baylor CNA.
good,"Kindred Healthcare manages and operates many hospitals and long term care facilities. It is partly the reason why the building level Maintenance Supervisor reports to up to three different individuals. Each of the three corporate level people may have different priorities and expectations. End result, stress!"
good,"A typical day at this job entailed planning, coordinating and running four group therapy sessions per day for a group of 10-15 survivors of traumatic brain injuries. The time periods between these group sessions was occupied with individual meetings and follow-up therapy with the residents of this facility. This job has taught me a lot of patience and appreciation for the limitations and challenges of traumatic brain injury victims. I learned a great deal about the increased need for smooth management and organization in such a fast paced environment where the residents are so dependent upon the facility's staff members. The hardest part of the job was accepting that there were firm limitations in the residents' abilities that often caused behavioral difficulties if the residents felt overly challenged, recognizing these limits before meeting opposition in a group of victims with diverse limitations became a daily challenge that needed to be recognized and appreciated in order to effectively administer counseling and treatment to traumatic brain injury survivors. This challenge soon became the most enjoyable aspect of the position, as successfully meeting this challenge and witnessing the patients' corresponding improvement was extremely rewarding."
good,A typical day at work is working with sometimes 6 ventilator total care individuals. Some time my CNA has 12 of these patient and I have assist the CNA with the patients. I have to administer precribed treatments as MD orders. I have to constantly monitor the patients when the vents alarm and anwer the phones. I have to address any questions or concerns that family members may have and report to the primary or specialist any changes in the patients status. The hardest part of my job accepting that there is nothing else I can do in my power to sustain the lives of some of my patients. The most enjoyable thing is working with my co-workers.
good,"Was a new grad on the nights shift. The patient's acquity is high but patient load was managable. It's a LTAC, now called Vibra."
good,"Job functions include direct patient care, interraction with physicians, interdisciplinary team meetings, billing and data validation,"
good,"Sourced for new hires and referrals, posted new job opportunities. Phone interviews & in-person interviews. New hire paperwork. All administrative responsibilities & clerical duties."
good,I enjoyed working there. I was able to use Respiratory protocols.
good,The company as a whole really focus on patient care. Management however is very slow at bringing pertant information about changes in policy out to those that need it and many un upper management are very weary in loosing their positions to others that they will take credit for others work to secure their position even if it leads to hard and good workers being let go.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.

good,"I enjoy what I do, Co-Workers are great and can be a fun place at times."
good,"I work at Kindred in Las Vegas for a few years now, sure the pay is good, but your work load is to much. They work you into the ground. 70% of the staff have not been there for a year. If you want the money and hard work then this is for you but be careful your nursing lic. is at risk. Staff is lazy and on cell phones all the time. Honestly I am looking for something eles. Patient wise, look up the facility you can see state was called alot on them fo all kinds of things. I would not ever have family there."
good,"One of Louisville's top places to work. Great opportunity if you are a nurse, docter or therapist."
good,very busy place where your on the go all day long no time to rest all day .
good,I enjoyed this job because of the patients I worked with. Very rewarding job to work so closely with patients
good,"I love working here and don't see myself ever quitting. However, there are some things that do stand to be changed."
good,Kindred was a good starting point and learning experience as a nurse in the ICU but I felt like I wanted to reach out and learn other things and develop a better skill set and overall Learn new and different types of nursing that’s
good,"A great place to work but not diversed.  The administration is culturely clueless and only understand the cultulre in which they are apart of. The administration is totally one sided and the ifeld staff is as well, with a few exceptions.  They promote, ""their kind""."
good,"This is multitasking job duties for home health services, answering incoming patient's calls, payrolls, billing, scheduling and monitoring all clinicians visits throughout the day."
good,Bad CEO. No culture or logic exist in the company. Very tight with the budget. No rewards for employees for there hard work.  We have good nursing staff and in other departments as well.
good,Throughout the years ive  constantly been challenged and inspired. I have learned that the Patient Care team is composed of a variety of disciplines and personalities - but they all have the common goal of doing what's right for our patients.
good,"This is a very old hospital, with a great of outdated materials for the patients; for example beds, IV poles, bedside tables, etc.. There is not enough money in the budget to update this equipment."
good,Upper management needs to come down into 'the trenches' once in a while. They forget how it was when they were working the floors and with patients. Also management needs to take worker safety more seriously. Too many accidents occurring.
good,"It`s a ok job, No team work. the management could be better. Could have better benefits, And higher pay. the patience are very heavy, and a lot of lifting, 12hr. shifts. every patient in the hospital have to be bath every day. when census is low they will call you and cancel you on your work day and you end up having to use your paid time off to make up on your check so that you can  have a full check. At the long care nursing, they do have a activity director where they do some fun activity and have entertainment."
good,Enjoyed working with my coworkers and in the department. Management was consideration and caring. The work was challenging and rewarding. I felt needed and respected.
good,"As a Patient Care Technician , i mostly took care of patients that had trouble moving breathing or need help with their daily living skills, either helped them prepare their day with there daily motion exercises. Also assisted with bathing."
good,Work culture felt like a family away from home however management   failed to recognize work-life balance.  There was work overload and mismanagement of staff.
good,This is a great company to work for and collaborate with professionals. Great way to advance clinically and professionally. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a stable caseload.
good,I did have to travel a little bit to go work. I was also able to bring my child at times if I couldn't get a babysitter at hand. Overall the company is good at making goals and meeting them. They also try their best to keep a .well managed workplace
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Overall my experience with working at kindred was a wonderful experience. I love working and taking care of all my patients, and I became close to them as well as the staff. I've learned so much working there, the good team work from my colleagues. The typical day is smooth and relaxing and I had a lot of help when I need it. The management became a lot better through out time. The workplace culture is a nice and stable environment, the hardest part of the job is the death of the patients. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing care and comfort to all the patients and to see the smile on their faces means a lot to me."
good,Good management.nice respectful staff.food cafeteria.nice area to work in quiet for most part.a little benefits not much pay for the area your working in
good,"I really enjoyed working with the full time staff, but it would be difficult from time to time getting full time hours. Management was patient and willing to work with me to maximize my opportunities working both outpatient and inpatient."
good,Due to new government regulations census is low. Lots of flexing or cancelation too many employees  for the pickins. Health benefits are expensive and upper management don't seem to care. You are just a number.
good,Provides a good treatment space with strong resources for further skill development. The company is tightly managed with high productivity expectations.
good,"Facility provided DME, appropriate weights, resistance bands and other therapy equipment needed to complete the job. Management did not communicate well with clinicians which made it hard to come up with patient discharge planning."
good,Rehab care is fast paced and multitasking is an asset.  Management varies from facility to facility. It is enjoyable to get to know and help the people improve.  Working as a team is fun.
good,"New Management Kindred that work with they are Friendly and, they are giving Award yearly to those Employees whom deserve it. The Most enjoyable at Kindred most staff from the Higher level down to the lower level are Professional and friendly."
good,Kindred is a very stressful company.  The Law Department is a very stressful position within the company.  Most employees there are long time employees with the company.  It makes it difficult to become a team member there because of that.
good,"Had a good team of conscientious and effective health care team members"
good,"Work was on call as needed"
good,"Scheduling therapists, checking Medicare part A's and B's, running reports, filing, helping with patients, audits, meetings, trouble shooting devices and more were ALL typical of any given day. I learned a lot about medicare and by watching and assisting the amazing therapists daily. "
good,"High productivity requirement, no guarantee of hours at facilities.Managment overworked which leave them unable to manage work culture. Good pay and benefits in comparison with other companies. healthcare has suffered over the past year so at least with this company, it will be around for a long time due to the strong financial support. There is no room for advancement really as a clinician standpoint."
good,Overview : It is very diverse.  Each Kindred facility is different.Many of the ICU have no CNA's average load in ICU is 3 patients and med-Surg is 6. IMU is 4-5  if you the facility has an IMU  Must remember these are chronic patients and Kindred is a long term care facility that is for Profit.  It's not a bad place to work if you are open minded and have realistic expectations.
good,Great place to work but management is poor and unknowledgeable. The education department is lacking and thinned out. Management needs to properly screen who they hire as nurses to take care of these extremely sick patients.
good,"RehabCare essentially works as a staffing agency providing therapists to customers. There is good "
good,This was a good place to work.  my leaving was due to senses being low and would be sent home or told not to come in.  Needed to work full time hours and it was not available enough when i was hired.
good,"Very unorganized, good people, pay was average, just mostly unorganized, went through 3 DNS in 3 months, the state was in several time in the 3 months I worked there"
good,"it is what you make it, come in with open mind and a warm heart for helping ppl understanding for all walks of life and mental situations sometimes ppl just want to know u care and don't mind listen to there stories"
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"30 bed Psych unit in a medical hospital"
good,Learned quite a bit in my time with the company when I was a new grad. I wish it had been more focused on patient care than focused on revenue and RUG categories.
good,Easy workflow but not enough tools to enhance productivity. A lot of the equipment is outdated or needing repair. Poor Staffing vs work load balance.Good benefits and training opportunities.
good,Work was hard so was the hours but gained experience in the field meeting different patients people friendly good working environment a good atmosphere.
good,"Working in large buildings gave me more teammates to enjoy and learn from. The team was fun and supportive, always willing to guide and help the newer therapists."
good,"I benefited from the opportunity to learn from a variety of peers during my employment there.  I gained significant knowledge and experience along the way and met some terrific therapists and nurses, as well.  I gained a lot of insight into the business from my opportunity as program director."
good,"Lots of autonomy and more geared towards experienced therapists. Little mentorship and training and support for new therapists, but loved the team camaraderie. Focussed on productivity standards and the bottom line. They hire new grads or assistants to manage rehab departments who are inexperienced and lack clinical skills and management experience."
good,Kindred is a great facility to begin experience for student's leading towards a career as a therapist. The therapists are very knowledgeable and will do their best to help you succeed in your endeavors.
good,It had its days. sometimes the management was rough. the main boss did not listen to anyones needs. patients were treated with disrespet. emlyees were very lazy
good,"As a medical professional, a therapist you will encounter difficulties and challenges that are associated with the wavering emotions family and patients go through. The rewarding aspect is the courage to be creative, and innovative in developing solutions individualized and associated with each unique patient, and seeing their progress evolve, with your assistance and care provided by a team."
good,My experience with Kindred has been positive - great company with a lot of room for advancement.  Excellent continuum of care provided to patients and families.
good,Work is Hard so Teamwork and Cooperation with the Nursing team is essential to be able to finish the shift. There is always something new to learn due to the different cases and type of patient we handle.
good,"Great co-workers, I enjoy coming to work great company to work for."
good,Good place to work but there was a lot of communication issues. Great people to work with and the residents were wonderful. Had a lot of opportunity to meet good families and people within the community.
good,"I left when the facility was sold so I cannot speak to how it is now. As a Kindred, staffing was poor with mandated OT a few times a month."
good,"1st job out of nursing school, learned a lot.  Very challenging with 6-8 pt on a daily basis.  At times difficult to staff.  Learn how to think outside of the box here really quick."
good,It was a good job not the best. The company had a lot of good qualitie but a lot of cons. I have been with the job for years and have seen many different changes good and bad. Just want to getting another opportunity to work for another company.
good,Great place to work with great people.  Very challenging work.  Newly acquired skills on a sub-acute setting.  Enjoyed the luxury of working on a 12 hour shift 3 days a week.  Very short commute from home to work.  Very helpful staff and management regarding difficult matters pertaining to patient management.
good,large building that was understaffed due to location. Very busy therapy department with challenging productivity expectations. Management supportive and available as needed for questions/problems. Excellent nursing staff at facility.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"I enjoyed working here.  The people are nice, the management is good.  I had fun while I was here"
good,Kindred healthcare has allowed me to learn and grow as an RN. I have had the ability to sharpen my skills and been very fortunate to have many new teachers to show me the ropes. I have learned alot while employed at kindred.
good,"this was a layer back environment with an easy workload. when it gets slow you may have your hours cut, and because they only operate with two therapist per shift you may be cut often if it stays slow."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking the vital signs, do ADLs , converse with my patients, then do my flow sheets."
good,"This is a tough place to work because the population is so delicate. "
good,there was a real sense of family between staff and patients  Are drs were approachable and valued the staff
good,"filing and follow up of Medicaid accounts, posting charges"
good,Coworkers and Management are helping and motivating. People are more patient oriented and we work as a team.
good,"A typical day at work for me was pretty steady, scheduling employees, (temps or floaters), to their areas, daily 9:30 am meetings, do daily rounds, and schedule to do daily rounds in the mental ward twice a day."
good,"Typical day at work is when I come in which is third shift, I have morning rounds. Also whatever is left after morning rounds I do which is usually recollects that couldn't get done by other phlebs. The hardest part about this job is the shift 2am til 10pm. This is my first time working this shift and its becoming very hard for me to adjust to it due to me being a single parent of a young baby. But this is the only shift the lab has. Co-workers sometimes help but its a little short staffed so we all do the best we can do. Management is very understanding and helpful. Ive learned a lot about critically ill patients and the best part of this job is that it helps me to become a better phlebotomist because it gives me a challenge."
good,"General Medical Secretary duties- assisted medical staff with daily  needs, Assisted family members with concerns, nourishments, kept nourishment area and clinical area clean."
good,"very busy and stressful constant issues with patients, but enjoyable"
good,"Overall working for Kindred was fun as long as we all worked together, of course with any job there is un-organization that sometimes has to be generally ignored. But the company as  whole is a good one."
good,"I currently work the third shift. I have a good experience with Kindred. The work includes patient care, medication administration. IV Care and administration of IV medication with flushes. 24hr. checks on all physicians orders. management of LPN's and CNA's. I have enjoyed and will miss my co-workers. The management team is good but need to hold employees more accountable for their job performance. The hardest part of my job is following nurses who are not motivated to perform their job to the best of their ability. I have no problem helping complete tasks for co-workers but when they don't do their jobs because they know you have to finish what is not completed is very frustrating. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to make a difference in so many lives. we become a part of their family while we have the opportunity to care for the patients whether it is a short stay or end of life, I consider it an honor to help and care for patients."
good,"Specializes in long term acute pt care for ventilator weaning, wound care, IV antibiotic therapy, physical Therapy."
good,Kindred is a demanding and quick pace job. It gives nurse the opportunity to grow and gain further knowledge within the nursing career. Reading labs and understanding what to do for that patient. Wound care daily. PICC line and port access IVs. Many of the co-works work well together. The hardest part is not have a physician in house with acute patients. What is most enjoyable is joy patients give when they receive care and giving the patients that joy.
good,The residents here are good people. You can learn alot from them. It is a go go type of job.
good,Because of the new work environment you are now required to multitask. That gives you an opportunity to learn other jobs and appreciate what others were dealing with. It was a family atmosphere so everyone was encouraging and supportive.
good,"Very busy and fast pace job. I learned how to use different ventilation equipment. Management was alright, a lot shifting positions in management, turn over rate was high. Co workers were fine. Hardest part was patients not getting better in their treatment; the mist enjoyable part of the job is to see patients go home."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"I enjoyed the work that I performed at Kindred, was a busy job, three twelve hour shifts per week which allowed for flexible scheduling. The hardest part of my job was the one and a half hour commute through downtown Pittsburgh. The best part was an all daylight position and the pay was higher than most although there was a lack of uniformity when it came to governing the rules and regulations. Management deficiency."
good,"Typical day consists of caring for five to six patients. Medication administration for patients assigned to that day. Manage new orders to include blood, urine, and/or fecal specimens."
good,"Helping clients needing help or companionship, bathing, eating, dressing.Doing activities as well as exercise with clients, medication reminders ,as well as shopping with the clients or for the clients"
good,"Felt like part of a family, enjoyed ample opportunities for continuing education, supervisors were attentive. Working there holds a special place in my heart."
good,This is good to work at they usually dont listen to employees questions they help you resolve problems and sometimes the resolve them but we have to go through union to solve them I went perdiem there because I got better pay somewhere else  I would have worked full time but it would have been very difficult
good,"When I started working at Kindred, everything was great. I was able to build my experience in a very short time. The Team work was excellent and everyone was satisfied."
good,Its ok i just need more pay and more hours Prn Has no benefits even though we Are there when ever they need us to fill in for some one At Any time we dont even get a Christmas bonus no Sighn of Appreciation which i feel is not Right because SOMETIMES we may fill in And work  full time hours  just until they hire someone  else And no one even Ask the prn 's if they would  like the position thats coming up...but it is what its is but its a nice place to work.
good,Very bad management and poor patient care. No call no show? You will not be written up! Poorly trained nurses. Many errors are made. Kindred offers no training. The only have  doctors by facetime at night!
good,"If you do not have prior accounts receivable experience, this job will be difficult as they only provide systems training.  You are expected to learn process as needed.  Communication and directives are given passive aggressively rather than directly (I.e., sups and managers talking over your head about what you should rather than addressing you)"
good,It was ok place to work it was close to my house nice staff nice clients they supplied gloves an did training paid I have nothing bad to say about them
good,Pay competitive close to home and freeway.Turn over is high always have to get used to changes. Management in duel roles. Needs more consistency in management teams.
good,"Family working environment. Know your patients and their families better, because of the length of stay. Flexible scheduling at work.  Physical and Respiratory therapy and wound care team wonderful at their jobs. Nursing staff dedicated."
good,A great home health company to work for if your passion is providing care for people at home. The only draw back is RN case manager documentation interferes with work life balance and much of that is at home after hours.
good,"Fast paced, Good support from immediate supervisor. Good team of colleagues. However, administration was not in-touch with day to day operations, often making the expectations of productive delivery of patient care unreasonable."
good,Rehab director who trained myself was a phenomenal person and hard worker. The administration above her was never present and high demanding. Higher administration did not appreciate the value of it's own employees.
good,"I worked for Kindred for 13 years.  It was a fantastic company for the first 10 years that I worked for them.  They provided plenty of avenues for career advancement and growth opportunity, as well as tuition reimbursement for certain careers.  In the last 3-4 years, Kindred decided to get out of the skilled nursing/assisted living business and has slowly closed or sold all of their facilities."
good,"While the company is fine, the current management at my location is underwhelming to say the least. I enjoy my job, but find it difficult to have any help from management."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,Staff is friendly and helpful. There's good communication with Management. You have to be able to handle autonomy especially during night shift and be helpful with stocking lab room with proper medical equipment.
good,"Love working here. However, benefits aren't great and job security is minimal at best. Everyone is like family. The employees are the best thing about this company."
good,Stressful due to lack of staffing. Competitive wages. Staff members are caring and compassionate. Residents seemed happy. Would consider working there full there again.
good,"34-38 patients on floor,usually recieved 1-4 admission after 7pm , Fast paced ,over half of staff inexperienced. Would recieved patients that would not be stable as floor pts, some coming from great distances"
good,Workday can be very fast-paced and hectic with 10-17 patients on schedule depending on staffing.  Great environment to gain experience with medically complex patients with very compromised pulmonary systems and wounds.
good,"My overall experience with Kindred is poor due to the staff. Not administrative but the supervisor are so rude and disrespectful. I avoid gossip and drama but employees have a tendency of treating one another  inappropriately. It's a fast paced place and it's just not for everybody. Employees there have anxiety issues, lack of knowledge, and can make or break your day due to their stress levels. You have to have patience and know when to not speak.  The hospital is great, the employees have poor character. People have favorites and if you end up on the unfavorable side you'll just suddenly make a mistake that will leave you jobless. People fight over positions and favor is greatly awarded. Mind you I am an employee and I've seen this done to others. Only some things has happened to me like the disrespect. If you stay to yourself you can survive."
good,"Great pay, work schedule and co-workers!  Poor job with employee reviews/feedback.  Little room for growth potential/raises.  High amount of nepotism and micromanagement!"
good,"working here you will feel valued and are rewarded for hard work. The leadership is very involved and concerned with employee satisfaction. A great place to work, but the care assignments are heavy."
good,"Fast paced, high equity, poor staffing ratios.  Orientation process was fair.  Some nurses require longer orientations but are forced to take full patient assignments, not safe patient care."
good,"Company was OK, There are always some managers that are not at their best that require coaching. People are friendly but there is red tape around approaching the business."
good,This is a great unit to work as far as variety of patient conditions and experience in different skills to learn and use.  It is very fast paced and busy.  Time management is key to a good day.  The other nurses are great to work with and the CNA's are amazing.
good,It was always busy and always on your feet. Took care of patients and get morning reports from the nurse. The work culture was very team work ethic. Co workers were amazing and I learned a lot.
good,"PRN employee, patients were very pleasant and appreciative of assistance.  Good teamwork and pleasant employee interactions. Enjoyed this job immensely."
good,"I thank Kindred Foothill for providing me an opportunity right after I graduated with my Bachelors degree in Social Work. As I part ways with Kindred, I am very eager to seek more work and expand my knowledge and work ethics else where."
good,"The typical day at work is that of most acute care settings, only this is a long term acute care hospital. The patients are medically complicated, many dialysis patients with low blood pressures, kidney transplant failures, cardiac rhythm changes and so on. Patients that are on ventilators, know your settings.. Should you wean the patient today? In this setting, you need to decide to learn, be open to suggestions. The respiratory therapists are stars at Kindred Hospital Denver, ask them questions, they support learning. Ask co-workers, they are very supportive, it is a learning culture and well supported. The physical labor is exhausting, the patients are often difficult to work with because they have been in the hospital so long. Therefore, asking them to be compliant is asking a lot of them. Average stay is 6 weeks, plus the time spent at the acute care hospital (they have been in the hospital for over a month!!). So, it is stressful situation for the patient, which increases stress on the staff."
good,Employees in St Louis Support Center worked closely and well with each other.  Benefits package was not as healthy as other companies in the St Louis region.
good,"Loved the Staff and working with the management team, however there is not a lot of option for advancement and the yearly pay increases do not match the effort given"
good,Work with experienced therapists who truly care about the patients and their coworkers. Flexible hours and days if needed. Have a variety of equipment to utilize to assist with getting patients more independent!
good,"Kindred Healthcare offers great opportunity to nurses may they may be new or seasoned nurse.  It is a complex place to work with. Ventilator here and there which is like a typical day. Pain management is a challenge. "
good,"Job experience in SNF steady and has good hours.  Case load can increase and decrease.  Certain patient expectations for therapy tolerance and ""minutes needed per day"" for reimbursement can be difficult at times."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Rehab Care is somewhat fast paced due to productivity standards.  The therapists were great to work with and always willing to help and assist with any questions or concerns I had regarding treatment.  Management when available was ok.  They did answer questions, concerns, and very knowledgeable regarding insurance and billing issues.  Hardest part of job not knowing how many patients will have to be see due to admissions.  I learned a lot about billing, notes, and using modalities."
good,"I loved taking care of pt""s. Being a nurse you learn something new all the time. management is alright. The co-workers is great. to work with.You make the job as you want it to be."
good,"This is an LTAC located in Pasadena, TX.  Over the last 10 years, they have grown at a rapid pace. They have grown so fast in fact, that they have left their culture behind.  We first started out taking care of a max of 6 patients and by the time I left, the maximum allowable patient load was 8 patients.  It is very difficult to do anything ""extra"" for a patient when the staff is spread so thin.  Everyone was so stressed out here and it was very difficult to find assistance when I needed it, sometimes the CNAs would have 19 patients to balance the whole shift.  There were many times that I only drank coffee the entire shift in fear of missing something. Most shifts there was only time to assess the patient, administer medications and document. Every time that these concerns were brought to management, they were very understanding and assured us that things would change.  The management was honest, things did change.  Over the two years that I worked for Kindred, the census grew, the staff dwindled, and the patient complaints mounted. With all of the negativity surrounding Kindred, there was a silver lining...I got to see some patients get better and go back to their normal lives due in part to my interventions."
good,"Kindred is a good company to work for, but at times the staffing makes it hard to work. Most days are enjoyable and it's nice to meet new people and help them."
good,"I started each day in a managers meeting going over any resident's issues or staffing concerns that needed to be addressed. I was responsible for the Activities and volunteer workers, scheduled monthly calendars, field trips, special events and ordered all activity supplies. I was responsible for completing the Activity assessments and progress notes on all 132 patients. I attended the care plan meetings and assisted in the developing the resident's Interdisciplinary Care Plan. I led activity groups and did 1:1 Activity   treatments with Residents as needed."
good,"Fast paced environment, was never bored or lacking things to accomplish.  Supportive oversight was a plus"
good,"Kindred requires a special kind of nurses, the ones Florence Nightingale had in mind as she was designing the nursing profession."
good,This was an average place to work I enjoyed my co-workers greatly
good,"My time working for this company gave me insight into the challenges of long term care.  I had amazing residents who inspired me daily to deliver to them the most optimistic and engaging programs.  I found, however, a system which required much more work on a company level as there were many issues within the facility which ultimately affected my residents.  This is where I learned my biggest challenge as an advocate for those who can not do for themselves.  While I won many battles on their behalf, those which I could not were heartbreaking and I feel we failed those we served on more than one occasion.  "
good,"Overall this is a great company to work for and I thoroughly have enjoyed it; however, I am seeking professional growth which can not be offered by this company at this time. I currently recruit clinical and management positions for 8 facilities. I love what I do and have learned a lot. I am ready to apply my learned skills to an organization that offers growth. "
good,I enjoyed working at Kindred.  The management teams were very dedicated and great to work with
good,"Overall satisfied with the company - I think a lot of the downfalls were out of their control, and decisions that are made tend to be for the ""greater good""."
good,I didnt feel they had thier employees backs. They sided with facility on alot of things.
good,I loved working with Kindred they have excellent benefits and very family oriented
good,Enjoyed being out of the building and engaging with patients and physicians and Case Managers at the other hospitals. Did not care for the marketing part or the travel to outlying rural areas.
good,typical day on my feet all day
good,I love the job. The benefits are expensive and they don't cover alot.
good,"A typical day at work includes evaluating and providing therapy to patients in a SNF with cognitive, communication and swallowing disorders. I have learned how to vary my therapy techniques according to the individual patient. My job requires me to think outside of the box and to consider the individuals background and interests. I work with many Occupational and Physical therapists who are around my age. We work well as a team and collaborate daily about our patients' progress. The hardest part of my job is not being able to spend more time with a patient who may need it based on the type of insurance they have. I enjoy my flexible work schedule and being creative in how I carry out my treatment sessions."
good,A typical day at work for me includes tucking in and saying good night to the residents. Checking on them every 2 hours. I also pass ice and laundry basins. Then when morning comes I have selected early risers who get up and shower. Next I document the care I perform. Then when day shift comes in a provide a verbal report and head out.
good,"The co-department managers were great besides the maintenance manager. He had the attitude that he could have and should have been doing the Administrators job. He spoke down to women and blacks. The nursing staff did what they needed to and did it well... meaning they worked their butts off. However, as a department manager you do not get support from your Director boss which is the EX/Administrator. The dietary staff at this location is very immature, messy and they lie. The Administrator will always have their back. However, this location could be great if everyone work together and care to care about what they are doing!"
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,three CCO's in 4 years and the new one still not a fit...sometimes you feel that a man may lend a different perspective and open more doors of communication since every Kindred seems to be run by women at the local level. The CCO was out of touch and everyone was shy of going to her with any comments or ideas....Most long time employees will tell newbies that it was so much better back in the days and most were leaving or looking elsewhere... worked at 3 different Kindred Hospitals...first one was the charm...all others failed on most counts with most problems originating with leadership .
good,"You arrive to work at 6:45 either am or pm, yes, we work 12 hr shifts. You are assigned either as telemetry monitor or floor nurse. Once you know who are assigned to, you then have the obligation to do the narcotic count for the shift, distribute the keys, find the nurse who cared for your patients the previous shift and obtain report. From there, you do a room by room survey of your patients, review the previous shifts labs, attend to any pending issues and give report to the CNA or CNAs working with you for the shift."
good,"At Kindred , i felt the autonomy using all my talent , skills,rendering the best care any patient and family can have during the difficult time of their lives , i 've had the help from the other departments .A typical day at work that i remember , was always so busy, that i did not feel the 12 hrs shift . The hardest part was given a sad news to a significant other. My co-workes were always there to help me that made it enjoyable."
good,"A typical work day included patient evaluations, progress notes, discharges and treatments as well as the typical patient documentation and coordinating with supervisors PT/OTs and PT/OT assistants."
good,"Very busy hospital with many issues and very little training.  You have to be 100% self sufficient to succeed. Management really cares, but cooperate is still trying to make it a good place to work."
good,"If you are looking to work with your older loved ones."
good,I have worked at many RehabCare facilities in multiple cities. Each one has differed than the last. What has not differed is the level of compassion and care provided by the therapists. One of the best advantages of this company is the potential for growth. both evaluating therapists and assistants are eligible for promotions to further their career and grow their skills.
good,"Kindred was being utilized as a hospital network central location when I worked there as a contract worker.  We filled the bulk of the medications, but did not do any IV meds.  Those were outsourced at the time.  It was a very busy hospital, but had very approachable and easy to get along with employees.  I enjoyed it."
good,"Overall I would give them a C rating in comparison to other medical facilities I have worked for. Pay is poor compared to other places and work conditions are not great. They do not believe in efficiently maintaining the facility, and have a "" thats good enough attitude"" . . Have to say I was mot very impressed by the place."
good,"Very ill patients requiring high acuity and mostly total care.  Very stressful environment and very high turnover of staff.  But, it is also a place where you can practice all your nursing skills."
good,"I worked with a large number of employees and we all got along very well. However, the DON at the time treated people unfairly. She was very unprofessional when it came to speaking to staff.  If she were not the DON I probably would still be there"
good,"I enjoyed working for Kindred, although it was somewhat stressful. I loved working with the people/patients/physicians. The place was small enough that it had a family feel to it."
good,RehabCare Corporation was my first job when i graduated from college. It was a very fun and educated company to work at.  I chose to leave to secure a job closer to my hometown.
good,"Its a decent place to work, but they lack intermediate job positions for growth. Centralization has limited most any non-clinical entry position. Further, any continued advancement is very limited."
good,"The work flow fluctuates on a week to week basis. Management is very laid back, kind of go with the flow personality. Peers were great teammates, worked well together and always willing to help each other out. I enjoyed doing my job and working with my peers and the residents. I did not enjoy the past six years the company has been on a pay freeze and would not give anyone a raise, which makes you feel unappreciated as a dedicated, loyal employee of many years.e"
good,"I loved working for RehabCare, although the transfer that was in place didn't go through doesn't mean that I wouldn't go back to this company in a heartbeat. Moving up the ladder here with RehabCare was easy for those who would work hard."
good,I love being able to use my nursing skills at Kindred and to be learning constantly. I enjoy my coworkers and they are very helpful when needed. I love providing care for my patients and helping them on their way to recovery. The hardest part of the job is the nurse/patient ratio due to the high acuity level of the patients. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know my patients and helping them through a difficult experience.
good,It can be better and more careing the facility really nice its the staff they need to work on overall I enjoyed the residents and they ae vey nice its a nice area
good,"I loved working at Kindred, however it is hard work and low pay. I enjoyed working with the very sick patients, but nurse to patient ratio is very hig"
good,One department: many hats worn.  Position focus is a fair.  You will be involved in other departmental issues. Good benefits and potential for greater compensation. 401K grew fast.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,Did well with keeping staff informed of any changes within the company. Had a very hands-on interdisciplinary approach to therapy. Took matters seriously when it comes to patient care.
good,"Through my months at Kindred Nursing and Rehabilitation, I learned what it means to have time management skills by giving sufficient care to each individual. Becoming a CNA is one of the most difficult yet rewarding job. The challenging part of working there is the lack of cooperation with the co-workers. The rewarding part of it all is the interaction between the patients and myself."
good,Stay pretty busy with IV's & treatments plus administering meds. Received a lot of trach experience. Also a lot of wound experience.
good,"Concerned about the supervision of rehab aides. Fun environment  to work, supportive staff from hospital management and nursing staff, hardest part of job low census, most enjoyable part of the job my patients"
good,"The only complaint I have about this company is that I was a contractor.  when I got a raise from 16-23/hour, I was let go early on the contract.  No reason given other than they no longer needed me."
good,"Typical day at work sending and receiving emails, reconciling accounts, review charts, record payroll hours and tracking documents."
good,"Very, very busy, time management is a must learn at Kindred Hospital. my co-workers are excellent, help you when you are in need of help, they are like family. When i lose a patient is the hardest part of the job. Seeing the patients get better with a big smile on there faces."
good,Work/Home life must balance more in positive direction for best personal health.
good,It's just like any other therapy company. The patients are pleasant and the group i work with is great
good,"very busy place to work."
good,"I was the Rehab manager so initially when I got to work I planned the minutes for the day, checked RUG levels, e-mails and checked for any new orders.  I treated anywhere from 6-11 patients per day in addition to attending any medicare meetings, talking with nursing staff and patients families.  I also made out the daily schedule for each therapist to ensure that all patients were seen each day for the correct amount of time.  I completed the billing on a weekly basis."
good,I mostly enjoyed working with the different types of patients. Learning of the different functions of the body. How it can repair it's self.
good,"A typical day is filled with working steady. Being on time. Setting your own timeline by the regulations to complete your tasks in a timely manner.  Enjoying and taking good care of the residents. I also enjoy working with the other staff members, they  are great!"
good,Love the girls I work with we are a team ..Listen to report get residents ready for there day ..Is not knowing when your shift is over if your resident will be there in the morning..I love to see my residentlooking and smelling good and knowing u made them smile
good,I enjoy the staff who have been here with me for all these years.
good,"● Refill cafe with cups, sugars, and creamers. Prepare desserts for dinner and next day's lunch, restock nourishment fridges, gather and store beverages for dinner line. Call each patient's diet orders to chef, place meal on trays and in carts, then deliver carts to each floor"
good,"LTAC with most patients having a prolonged stay. Quite a bit of wound care, decubits ulcer care, rehab for knee and hip surgeries. Most patients on IV antibotics, most patients stable. Great co-workers and managment."
good,Great place to get incredible learning experiences. Experience with working with all fields from Dr.s to lap techs to x-ray
good,there are too many aspects to this position to list but Kindred gave me the opportunity to learn and do many things in many different ways in concerns to material management of a medical facility. They have given me the opportunity to take the skills they have tought me to help other medical facilities be better.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Sadly, this company’s incredibly compassionate mission has been mishandled by corporate.  "
good,"Kindred Hospital will give new graduate nurses a start, but it is a very demanding position due to regular staffing shortages. If you enjoy wound care you will definitely love an LTAC setting!"
good,"Very intense work environment.   As a relatively new CNA, I was looking to learn.  This place provided a great environment for that. The patients are critically ill and I was exposed to patients on ventilators, frequent codes,   Feeding tubes, NG tube, sterile procedures, picc lines  and pretty much every medical  deficit one can think of. Because the patients are on average longer-term, caring for the same patient over time allows you to experience his or her improvement.   It also enableds you to see what happens when a patient does not improve, a harsh but necessary reality.   Death was very common, and difficult to get used to.   To find something positive in that-  even as a new CNA, I gained a lot of experience being assigned to the code team. It gave me a real life experience doing CPR on multiple occasions, something a lot of techs and even RNs do not get to experience.   I left this job purely due to the difficulties the schedule posed on my family.   As an environment in which to learn and grow as a care provider, I can’t imagine much better. They definitely place trust in their employees to handle things.  Most of the management staff was approachable, and my fellow employees were almost all helpful and supportive of one another. The work culture was generally a positive one.   Almost everyone understood that each person working in that building had a tough job.  I do want to thank the management and staff at Kindred Central Tampa for the support they provided."
good,The Division works hard to meet goals and respects each other.  The C suite is not able to really learn or understand things outside of the hospital world.
good,"I worked with a great group of Nurses, CNAs, Doctors, and respiratory therapists. We worked well as a team. We made sure all patients were very well taken care of and that they were as comfortable as possible. We made sure all paperwork and patient daily/hourly assessments were completed in a timely matter"
good,I was given a great deal of leeway in creating projects as well as implementing them. It was interesting because my job didn't exist prior to my employment and I was simply given a list of desired outcomes and how to reach them was entirely up to me. This kind of work environment was a good match for my personality and work style. I left this job when the department decided to change the focus of the position and I did not have the necessary background. An RN I had been working with did have this kind of background and I recommended him to take over my position.  I left the company on good terms. The only negative I have is a belief that administration too often failed to uphold decisions made by the nursing department. Without their help it was difficult to hold the nursing staff accountable to uphold the stated standards of the hospital.
good,"Kindred when I first started was very demanding, and there are some things that need some work. One of my most frustrations was when they have a after hours support group, and they allow one division to by pass that support to go to the on call phone disturbing my sleep for something basic. To be fair they are like so close to be a full time after hours, but make restrictions a few divisions to utilize the after hours group. That being said any time I needed to make a phone call, day off, or come in late for a reason they for the most part worked with me and let me do it. They do care about their employees, but there financial issues are making roadblocks to fully support their staff."
good,"No PTO for contract employees. Was no allowed to work from home when I had a fever of 103 for 3 days had to come into work because of no PTO. Was able to work from home when the weather was bad the next week though. (twice) "
good,"transitional hospital has a huge parking spaces for workers and visitors, very convenient in and out of the hospital, and free breakfast for nurses when I used to work there."
good,It was a good place to work at. they paid for some of my classes while I was working there. There is not much room for advancement. Good and affordable food for employees.
good,"typical day at work was getting to my clients home and showering , dressing him basically getting him ready for the day. I learned how to value every ability that I was gifted with and to enjoy every day of my life. The hardest part of this job was listening to others judge my clients without knowing who they really were and what have they gone through to be this way. The most enjoyable part of this job was doing every day activities with my clients and learning new things about them.  Management had no type of communication with us the workers."
good,"Kindred is an ok place to work. Anywhere you go, you will have co workers that are willing to help and those that are not. You just have to make the best of it."
good,"Meeting every morning...Time management "
good,I assist all therapist with daily activites that are performed by residents that are on therpy. Also provide patients with assitance on and off exercise equipment. Finally provide filing duties within the facility.
good,It is always enjoyable to help the patients get what they need. When they can't do them selves
good,"Kindred hospital was a great place wit wonderful people to work with, I enjoyed working with the patients, coworkers house supervisors, the hardest was my job schedule, I used to work night it wasn't easy but I love my job. The most enjoyable part of it was my sweet coworkers."
good,"Nice amenities, small town environment.Leadership concerns."
good,"I assist in the management of the rehabilitation department. I meet with families touring the facility and sometimes administer tours myself and explain how our skill nursing facility unit works. I do all of the clerical work for the departments such as filing,copying, chart audits, billing and family liaison. My co workers are great to work with. They all are different and bring their own personalities to our department to create a great team."
good,Fast paced nursing unit with pleasant co-workers and professional management team.
good,"It's is a good place to work!! They have many opportunities and great team work!! Management has recently been dropping the ball in several areas, but the awsomeness of the employees makes up for it!!"
good,"I have enjoyed my Eleven Years at Rehabcare. Currently, our building sold and we are all moving to different areas. I will miss the team but I am looking forward to new learning experiences."
good,"It is not easy being in the healthcare business but you have to have a heart for it.  If you have that, the work comes easy.  CNA work is the hardest work and I do feel we do not get paid enough with the work we do but again I do this because I love caring for people."
good,Taking care of individuals in a fast paced environment.  It was a great learning employment opportunity.  Great for individuals to gain experience with all medical issues
good,The shifts are very busy and time goes by very quickly.  I have learned how to manage handling many tasks at once.  I enjoy the team that I work with the most.
good,"I  have been  working  for this company for over four years. The staff is very friendly and appreciative of each members of the healthcare team, I would  definitely recommend this company to all my friends and family members. The workers truly care for the patients whom they  served"
good,Despised  Atlanta location. Didn't receive an orientation. Patient to nurse ratios were crazy for the type of patients there. No phlebotomy. Unclean. Unorganized. Not enough pay for the abuse .Didn't  work there long enough to really have an experience with the ceo.
good,"A typical day at work starts with the same goal for myself, my team members and my patients and that is returning the patient to their prior functioning level or their highest functional level under the circumstances for overall increased independence and quality of life.  What I've learned is that this is not always easy, as not all patients are trusting.  It can be very challenging at times to engage patients in the therapy process.  Being able to provide each of my patients with their own individual ""just right challenge"" while incorporating their needs and what they enjoy on a daily basis to progress them in their independence with their activities of daily living is the hardest part of the job and requires one to be quite creative at times.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know each patient and being able to see them progress daily and being able to do things they couldn't before they came to me.  It's most rewarding in that not only do my patients learn from me, but I learn from each and every one of them as well.  Something different each time with the most valuable thing having learned being to never give up!"
good,"Obtained a well rounded experience at this facility, developed as a nurse manager which prepared me to seek opportunities for a more challenging role with greater responsibility and clinical leadership."
good,Case management became more about computer applications as opposed to overseeing cases on a personal level. I'm a strong patient advocate. Those are my greatest achievements.
good,I loved working at Kindred because it was more like a hospital and hands on.You did things that nurses would do except pass meds.You took residents to xrays and any other places in the hospital they needed to go.
good,This place is great for new grads because you will learn a lot. However you will be mentally and physically drained. The pay is not good. I recommend to work here for one year and find employment elsewhere.
good,This was a great place to work at. It also taught me some valuable lessons.
good,"Long Term Acute Care Hospital specializing in vent rehabilitation and wound care.  Providing quality care to medically complex patients and supporting the family dynamic during the end of life process. "
good,"Hardest part ofthe job is when the census is low and the nurses are cut short of their normal hours, leaving the working nurses with a very heavy load of work each shift."
good,Enjoy working with the elderly. each patient has their own way of performing. some patient do not want to be bothered in getting better or given any type of treatment. the coworkers i work with are all knowledgeable and work together as a team. it is rewarding when the patient or family member appreciates the treatment that is given to their family memeber.
good,Not paid enough for the hard work that is demanded. No place for advancement and no raises or bonuses. No paid vacation or pto....u get paid what u work and thats it.
good,"I love my job when it comes to caring for others. However, when your being worked short staffed it can be overwhelming.  As an AIDE you grow attached to your patients, and build relationships with them. Hopefully, one day I'm able to advance in a new career at this job."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,The work atmosphere was very fun and an almost family like atmosphere. The only drawback was the constant changes in management. I believe in my five years working there I might have had four managers which can become stressful adjusting to different managing styles. I do not believe the company is still open.
good,"excellent place for a new nurse to learn multiple skills and to refine skills, chances to learn lots of different skills and use those skills frequently."
good,"Busy on a daily basis constantly changing my clients, running errands, assisting with baths."
good,I work the night shift and had a newborn so I was desperatley looking for a new job when a better position opened up within the hospital and I was moved to manage it which is where i'm at now. The hardest part about the job was obtaining signatures for each patient admitted to the hospital or locating a family member who is authorized to do so.
good,"I feel not being treated fairly. By management I worked. There’s no leadership,  no ethics, honesty business. No recognition for those whose giving their best working individual."
good,"During the 16 years that I did this job it changed owners at least five times.  With each new owner there where many changes, including management, technology, job duties, co-workers, etc.  This made the job very high stress and challenging."
good,"This was a very fast paced, under staffed job placement hospital. I currently still work for the company as well as have relatives employed with the company."
good,The management was very tight on budget and I was never sure when the lay off was coming.
good,"Management was okay, co-workers were fantastic. The best part of the job was the residents they always had funny stories to tell and they made the job fun."
good,"A typical day at work for me is to make beds, clean bathrooms, remove trash, sweep and mop floors."
good,"My department had numerous turnovers in management which created various work expectations and confusion.  The original CEO, when I started, was very good, but left and others were in her place.  I had 5 different Directors in my department during my time there, some very good and some not so good."
good,This company really tries to make an effort from the big wigs but it rarely makes it down to the no bodies in the company. Corporate spends all the money on programs like metamorephois instead of raising salaries. getting paid 12$/hr to run an entire clinic. I think not.
good,In my opinion It’s about the residents. That was my reason for  being there this long. If you love to help others this the place to  be working. They need   Loving   caring people.
good,"Nutrition support for in long term acute care hospital patients. Nutrition assessment and care planning for patient conditions including mechanically assisted ventilation, tube feeding, IV nutrition, on site dialysis, wound care and transition care within these conditions."
good,"Exhausting work, LNA's run constantly answering bells, patient care, always short staffed and management knows that. On a good day, one LNA had 8 patients to care for. On a bad day, 15 patients to one or two LNA's."
good,There were multiple times over the course of employment (3 years) that I felt that my RT license could be in jeopardy.  RT Manager would not stick up for RT.
good,"My typical day started at 6:00am. and ended at 3:00pm.  I start by putting on coffee,cleaning and setting up the cateria.  Next I prepare, deliver, and retrieve patients breakfast plates. etc.  The only part i didn't like was that i had to work 8 hour with no break. I didnt recieve a break until 2:30pm. It was really hard on the body. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people."

good,All Kindred facilities offer high quality care. I was proud to be a part of it.

good,Nice company to work for on a lower management level. Texas was newly acquired and corporate offices were in KY and Northeast. The company tried to operate as they do in northern states and were lacking in Texas regulations and operating procedures. Education and experience from upper management will make the Texas facilities much more successful.
good,"My job was to evaluate the performance of facilities in my districts requiring me to fly to various locations each week.

good,The company upper management needs to keep an eye on middle management since some (most?) don t perform their jobs...or maybe they are over worked.. The lower management was great.

good,"This was my first full time job as a COTA. I learned a lot here. I believe 100% this place and its employees have had a positive impact on the type of therapist I have become and will become. My colleagues were extremely understanding and helpful to me when I first got out of school, always answering questions and helping me find continuing education courses or EBP articles or journals. I highly recommend this place if you are starting out. Just make sure you negotiate for a higher pay upon entering because the likelihood of anyone getting a raise later is slim to none."
good,"I worked as a RN, and Kindred is one of the places that requires hard labor in addition to typical nursing skills. It is not an easy place to work for, it is not for softies. It is a hard core nursing job!"

good,"serve dinner, clean dishes, play an activity with the residents, get residents ready for bed, give out medications before and during dinner, and again before bed, also showered residents if needed and cleaned the rooms and did laundry. management changed halfway through my time working there and the new RD didn't really know what she was doing, we knew more than she did. she fired people because she wanted a new set off staff so she wouldn't feel compared to the old one. played favorites. co workers were amazing except a few, i and other staff reported abuse and neglect and nothing happened and the once that we reported got promoted but still abused and neglected a bed bound resident they had there."

My orientation was about a month in a half, which was very nice. They made sure I felt comfortable on the floor before I was on my own. Everyone is very willing to help when your in need."
good,"Good place to learn and grow!"
good,"Work was always fast paced and busy. I learned about balance between, residents, management and co-workers and trying to help everyone as efficiently as possible. which was also the hardest part of the job - keeping that balance and time management in check. "
good,love working for the Kindred... Learned a lot of new skills. A place of growth in this company educationally
good,My typical day at work consist of caring for residents and making sure their families are happy with their care.
good,"I only worked summer hours when I was in school. They required 12 hour shifts, and on-call."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,Good to work here with the co workers. Day starts with the patient assignments and a whole team of three person and we are work together to give best care to our patient.
good,"The facility I worked for which was Quincy Rehab is a great place, enjoyed my co-workers and the residents. Benefits were ok, nursing staff great!"
good,"My Night started by punchibg in @ 1900; then checking to see how the day went; which meant getting report on what needs to been done and also handling the task that I'massign at night."
good,"Always starts with a good morning and then a plan of what the day involves.  I am able to organize order of patient assessments.  Communicating with patient and their bedside nurse to work with their pain control, and other therapies so there is no conflict and I can complete all my tasks in a timely manner.  The hardest part of the job is when different options conflict and the communication does not occur at the best times.  The best part is when the communication has a solution with all people involved having a good experience.  I am happy to say that is most of the time."
good,"I learned alot working there. I have learne about mechanical ventilation in Kindred, management was easy to work with."
good,Great exposure to individuals with severe chronic mental illness.
good,"job satisfaction achieved,"
good,Great company to learn accounting from the ground up.  There are a lot of accountants that don't truly know how to properly and efficiently perform a period close.  This was the place to learn it.
good,"I've worked at this facility for 9 years now in 2 different roles.  In my present position at DCM, I've learned a lot from my CEO & District DCM. The leadership/administration at this facility is wonderful.  I enjoy my job but am looking to move on to the next step in my career."
good,The rehab department is great and my coworkers phenomenal.
good,Working with patients and families to provide quality outcomes.
good,"Kindred Chicago North was a wonderful place to to work. The knowledge that spread between the interdisciplinary team was unlike I have experienced in other hospitals. I learned so much at this facility, I was able to grow in both my clinical knowledge and management skills. The support of my co-workers drove us to provide the best patient care possible. I pride myself on positive feedback from families. The administration spent more time in the office than on the nursing units and in the end I believe that is why many clinicians do not spend the entirety of their career at this facility. The most enjoyable part of my job has two parts; working so closely with physicians who support current evidenced based nutrition practices and managing the kitchen staff. I feel so privileged to have been on both sides of the nutrition and food service hospital operation. I truly have a sense of being involved with upper management and hourly workers. Needless to say, I have a passion for helping others (patients and employees alike) and I was able to do that well at Kindred"
good,Valuable experience as a student clinician. Therapy department was very professional and helpful.
good,"Assessing and caring for patients in the long term acute unit and the rehabilitation unit.  I enjoyed working with all the patients, very accepting in allowing me to care for them.  I learned so very much about tracheostomy care and really enjoyed working with the wound care team."
good,"30 bed facility with various diagnosis. I conduct bedside dysphagia, cognition and voice evaluations. Perform therapy per plan of care"
good,I was a security officer so my job was to secure the premises. I would often have to help nurses take bodies to the morgue and fill out the proper paper work which resulted in the release of the bodies to the funeral homes as families planned.
good,I loved working with the therapy staff and the team approach used for all the patients. It was nice to have some flexibility with the therapy schedule and management offered great support to the therapy staff members.
good,"its always a pleasure to work for these companys the staff is very helpfull and freindly. i have learned how to deal with others, and how to manage my day productivelly"
good,"Great co-workers, enjoyable job. A typical day at work includes caring for residents."
good,"Responsible for admitting, billing and collections.  When I arrived the hospital had serious cash flow.  This hospital was named Vencor at that time. The accounts are catastrophic as patients are all on ventelators.  Due to the high balances the payors made collections very difficult.  I was able to make contacts with adjusters who handled high balance accounts and that enabled us to get claims paid.  By year end we were at goal and the corporation gave us bonuses at twice the rate they normally paid."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"I enjoy working for this company. I happen to work in a facility that has fast level of turn over, however our therapy team work well together which make our job less stressful."
good,"Hospital system growing, expanding, improving. High rate of turnover in all areas of management. Small hospital setting enjoyable. Coworkers are friendly. Company is for-profit and all departments are involved in protecting the financial status of the hospital system."
good,"Worked first on the SNF side as a regional director overseeing 12 skilled nursing facilities marketing & sales departments. Responsible for increasing census, developing business & marketing plans."

good,Traveled to different SNF and open and closed them. Learned alot about the field in this job.
good,"high quality long-term care to medically complex, acutely ill patients"
good,"nice place to work."
good,"Kindred is a very nice facility, filled with a wonderful staff of friendly, caring professionals. Although it is a great place to learn and develop your skills, if you are not part or full time, the hours are a bit low, always changing depending on the census and new employees that are hired. The hardest part of the job is losing learning opportunites to new staff and low, non dependable hours. For me, I cannot receive benefits as I am prn. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with such great people and learning new things. "
good,A typical day at work for me was being the right hand of the Rehab Manager and to help out the therapists and the duties of an Administrative Assistant.  
good,This is a very good company to work for which focuses on team work.
good,"Kindred is a great place to work.  Facility offers great education experiences and schooling for nurses.  Limited time I have been employed I have learned an extended amount regarding ventilators and wound care.  Management has an open door policy and are fairly easy to talk to. Co-workers are great team players, everyone (for the most part) helps out with one another. Hardest part of the job is the challenging cases that we get.  Even though we have challenging cases, it is enjoyable because learning is an everyday occurrence.  "
good,Daily treatments with patients under supervision of a PT. Great rehab team to work with.
good,They keep you busy. Professional and flexible. Benefits are not very good.
good,Kindred executives provide clear vision and strategy.
good,"Schedule contract employees to fill time off, add therapist time into Smart System, add in billable time into accounting system, working in a hospital's Acute Rehab Unit, assitant to the Exectutive Director of Physical Therapy Department. Prepare paperwork for weekly billing of patients account for payment through Medicare & Commerical insurances. Enter patients infomation into hospitals EMR system. Order supplies for Therapist to complete their job performance."
good,Caring for a variety of patients from short-term care and long-term care allows you to develop strong nurse-patient relationships with both residents and family members. Short-term care keeps you on your toes with the constant turnover and assessment of new patients with varying degrees of illness.
good,Work on leading edge technologies that allow for faster and more productive access to healthcare information to improve patient care.
good,"A typical workday for me was to come in and start any print projects left from the day before. When the US Mail arrived I would help in getting all of that sorted as well. We would make two mail deliveries per day, and I covered a floor at our building and a floor at our 4th sreet office. At one point I was also the meeting coordinator for the entire building, which consisted of setting up projectors and laptops in various meeting rooms, as well as keeping a schedule of who requested what where. I was also one of three people who regularly conducted new hire orientation on Mondays. This consisted of preparing orientation packets, and conducting a powerpoint presentation and tour of the building."
good,Enjoyed working at Kindred Hospital Atlanta with great coworkers
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Rehabcare was an awesome to work for until the company was bought out by Kindred Healthcare. At that point, the benefits started being taken away or decreased."
good,"Enjoyed working at this company because it allowed me to work remote. Company was acquired by Kindred Healthcare, so position was eliminated."
good,"caring for long term acute care patients, heavy patient load, but rewarding end results"
good,Informative and active busy working environment. Management very positive and worked towards company goals.
good,Kindred is a nice place to work and there are wonderful people there
good,"Very versatile,fast paced enviroment.I enjoyed working with my co-workers and meeting the challenges of nursing in todays society."
good,I learned alot as a new grad and as a new Program Manager. Great support.
good,"Case Management System (CMS) is a web based application which provides various solutions to the problems faced by the Health Care service providers. It has capabilities of managing patient records, claim management, scheduling and much more. The system was previously developed in Cold Fusion MX, which was migrated to ASP.Net and certain new features were added to the system."
good,The patients and staff are like family. The hours are flexible. Morale events are enjoyed by patients and staff members.
good,Mission statement is what sold me on the company
good,Very satisfied with RehabCare. Currently interested in supplementing current caseload to achieve full time hours.
good,"Depending on the position you are in depends on what you do. As Central Supply Manager, I was responsible for stocking, ordering, billing and shipping and receiving. When working the floor as a CNA you did everything a CNA would do. Management was awesome. There was always someone you could go and talk to if there was a problem. Co-workers are really helpful and everyone works as a team. I think that hardest part that I had to do was working in Central supply and making sure everything got done that needed to be done but I always got it done. The mostt enjoyable part of my job was the patient interaction."
good,"performing duties of rehabilitation therapy and daily living activities for adult population with sever deficits in self care(vents, trakes, and multiple lines). Patients here are extremely ill, often on mechanical ventilators, IVs and many other complex medical technologies. Be able to read and understand lab work, pulse oximetry and physicians and nurse’s notes."
good,"This was my first experience working a for-profit healthcare establishment. As the Material Manager, my salary was exempt. In my last eight months there, I worked an average of 60 hours per week with only one storeroom person, who was limitged to 37.5 hours per week."
good,Daily patient assessments and psotive interaction with clients and family members. I learned to use all roles as a social worker. It was a great learning experiences.
good,Committed to not only thier patients and residents but to their employees as well.
good,Great place to work only down side is they were bought out and are closing the helpdesk
good,"I enjoyed working at this company for the most part. There was good team camaraderie and that helped us be successful. The company was unwilling to invest in the technology my team supported though, and eventually decided to move away from that technology."
good,"I loved the job, I loved my position being able to help others, but the company did not want to pay, reward the employees, nor the residents. It was just a place I was able to say I put my all into helping others through all kinds of scenarios."
good,"Co workers great, good benefits. Difficult to schedle time off if needed for outside appointments. Manager was helpful, easy to work with. Patient caseload could be overwhelming if not highly orginized."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,A typical day at work varies dependent upon facility placement. Management including rehab director was helpful and present daily. Area and regional directors were not easy to get in touch with.
good,At the corporate office. Benefits are there but health insurance is petty expensive unless you opt for a ridiculously high deductible. Micro management in my department can get frustrating. Generous time off and a wide range of other benefits. Overall I'd recommend.
good,Company is compassionate about the mission and believes patients and family come first. The benefits are better than most. Corporate changes bringing accountability.
good,Caseloads were very high and little time was provided for documentation which meant all therapist would stay late; off the clock completing documentation
good,good place to work. would still be staying if they were to stay in business. everyone works together and helps out. good place to work. hardest part is short staffed.
good,Kindred Hospital has proudly leaped from a two star hospital to a four star hospital in a two year time frame which in my opinion speaks to the entire interdisciplinary team!
good,Kindred  was a good place to work patients and employees get along very well love the fact that it was scratch cooking what made it even more fun love the hours it was definitely a healthy environment
good,Company had good insurance with medical and dental and vision covered well. Paid time off was good. Facility is good to work at with contract company there.
good,"I enjoyed working with the therapists in my building immensely. When the hiring supervisor left the company and was replaced by a new supervisor the dynamic changed quite a bit. My co workers were amazing and are still great friends of mine to this day, but my supervisor used and abused my position and took advantage of my willingness to be helpful. When this was addressed with upper management she had a ""talking to"" and that was it, the behavior continued, so I left."
good,Small hospital with high census most days.  Part of a corp. with limited spending. Most employees are very dedicated to the quality care of the patients.
good,"They was a good company too work for.The hours was long ,but working with a group of people made the time go bye fast .The patients keep you busy and making the day go bye fast .Meeting different people was a good  Experience,too all of us . Kindred maked sure we was ok ."
good,I started out in laundry and moved to floor technician and then move to maintenance. I was able to take care of the whole building except the dietary area.
good,"good work life balance, a lot of great employees and hard workers, always changes which can be good and bad at times. Alot of opportunity for career advancement within the large organization"
good,"I feel comfortable working for a company that is ethical, keeps up with the changes in the industry to protect individuals license, and provides staff with education and supports staff."
good,Good opportunities within company. Does require long hours and flexibility to thrive.  Can be very stressful.  Management not always organized or good at communicating.
good,"Doing portables, going to ICU, OR and routine x-rays."
good,I enjoyed working for Kindred Healthcare. I worked for them for many years and they always treated me good and paid me fairly. Vacation and PTO were generous. It was a very diverse culture with a lot of benefits.
good,Arriving at work on time to get report or if it was my turn to count narcotic. Then recieve report gather my supplies to preform my tasks for the evening. At 2000 start administering medication and preforming glucose scan. Assisting the cna with pt care. After administering medication documentation time. The job had to may chiefs and not enough indians. New night manager watched people like a hawlk but was diplamatci and would listen to both sides of the story. Work culture rn's need to be made to get up and hepl with the care of there pt's. Hardest part of thr job not enough help. Rewarding part making a differance is someones life.
good,"Although Kindred is a good working environment, their benefits and PTO aren't all that great. Also, this is really not a place to advance your career. It is good learning environment for new nurses, but not a place for them to stay"
good,"great manager makes workday easier, hardest part of job is that the facility is huge, a lot of walking... documentation/billing is on IPAD and can be frustrating at times"
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Kindred staff does not micro manage care givers. Attendants deal only with indivudals that they provide care for, however, staff is available upon request to assist with any problem or issues. Took on this assignment as an extra income and grew to enjoy the task."
good,"No matter where you work, you are going to have some bad days, I have to say that after working there for over 3 years, the bad days are the exception not the norm.  Managers do have your back there, at least in the RT dept. I loved working there and plan to go back at some point, the only thing I wish they would change is the amount of PTO you get there, I feel it is way to low."

good,"Working from home and start at 07:00 AM with a Team meeting (conference)."
good,Great workplace for PRN employees!! However for full time employees the area coverage is too many miles to drive each day. Entirely way too much wear and tear on your care and not feasible.   The territories are too large and need to be minimized.
good,"A non-profit organization which provides end of life care for hospice patient's and their families.  The company collaborates with physician, families, social worker, nurse aide, chaplain and volunteer's to provide dignity, respect and compassion to each patient and family member we serve.  We have a morning conference call each morning to communicate the needs of our patient's to all staff member's.  We end the call with a pray from the chaplain which provide's spiritual support for our team and our patient's which I love.  Management communicate's with staff cost effective ways to save money for company but the company always does what is best for the patient and family first.  We have weekly meetings to discuss plan of care with our team to provide the best care and to identify continuous needs of patient and their family members. The new hire orientation process needs improvement but overall Kindred Hospice is a great place to work."
good,I worked out of a nursing home location that was phasing out Rehabcare. It was a friendly environment and the staff of both companies were nice. I was mainly in charge of gathering the information needed to finalize billing and documentation. Along with assisting the therapists.
good,"Nice people very laid back, but if your looking for a challenge this isn't the place. Great for starting in nursing carer, retiring, or in school....."
good,"The folks I worked with there were great. But, it seems mgt does not understand how important Tech Support is to the production abilities of the employees. They need new direction."
good,Headwinds in the industry have been hard for all players in the industry. The company at large has a decent culture though. Sometimes I wish there was a little more going on or that I was given more responsibility at times.
good,"This was a great experience as I was trained and licensed in Deep Physical Agent Modalities as a treatment modality for patients. I also received training in Urinary Incontinence and bladder treatment, and was able to provide assistive technology and wheelchair positioning"
good,Management appeared to be more interested in personal life and working away from the office than to get to know patients and staff.  Very young but interested in moving up the corporate ladder.  Leaving techs to do scheduling and bulk of the work in the office.
good,Kindred is a large organization and with the proper people in place and the proper attitude you will feel supported and in control of your facility. I had only positive interactions with most corporate level staff and the majority of the staff showed they truly enjoyed what they were doing.
good,"Good place to work. Most people are friendly and good work home balance. Some WFH opportunities in some departments but not all.  Many contractors, some with the company for 10 + years."
good,"Typical day involved working with physicians, therapists, nursing staff to provide best level of patient care possible.  Majority of time spent transcribing written physicians orders, scripts, labs, etc into the computer system for pharmacists and nurses retrieval for Cardiac & ICU."
good,"Kindred has great potential to direct the progress of Long-term Care medicine. With facilities in all major areas of care, Kindred could establish itself as one of the healthcare industries most complete offer. I'd like to see more employee engagement employed to inspire workers on the medical floor."
good,This company is encompassed with highly skilled nursing staff. The staffing is not feasible but could be easily critiqued through a more open approach.
good,"I have worked for Kindred for 15 years.  I have learned how to work with different personalities cohesively.  I have learned that everyone management style is different but I can easily train them to my way.  LOL  I have had during my tenor here at Kindred 10 CEOs that I have supported and all of the are different.  Some are extremely self sufficient, some extremely dependent and I loved every moment."
good,"As a administrative professional with years of experience in a fast pace environment, and also friendly, being able to adapt to a diverse working office healthcare environment, great place work and to know  others"
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Report from night shift, check orders, review labs, assess patients, pass meds. do wound care, documentation,meds. lunch.,meds. draw labs. speak with MDs. meds. documentation, give report to next shift"
good,Patients and patient care was the most rewarding part of my day. Exactly why I went into this field.
good,"Knowledge of basic nursing practices, ability to instruct and assist patients under stressful circumstances, Strong interpersonal and organizational, good time management, great attention to detail, computer proficient, answering multi-phone calls, assist with outgoing/ingoing mail."
good,"I learned something new everyday that I worked at Kindred hospital. I love my job as a nurse. Management could have been more supportive and trust worthy, but on the floor the work environment was wonderful. Nurses and patient care techs was awesome. Teamwork on the floor was outstanding. I enjoyed most being able to come into work and take care of my patients and know that I have made a difference in someones life."
good,"I mostly enjoyed my position here and felt I did a good job, above average. I gave it more than 100%. I had to take a leave for health reasons. When it looked like I would be out longer, I asked management to replace me. My replacement was actually already assisting us in the MDS office. What I did not like was doing my own work and having to take call. When nurses or CNAs called in, if I was on call, I had to go in and work the floor. Unfortunately, my bones and joints were not in very good shape to be turning, twisting, staying on my feet for hours. It was not administration's fault. It is a small facility and all of the administrative nursing staff had to take call. Actually, the administrator probably worked the floor more than any of us and she tried very hard not to have me come in. Unfortunately, she was not a nurse, so she could not replace me on the med cart. I will always think very highly of her."
good,"I love taking of the patients dietary needs and preparing meals for the families that visit them.  When the patient census decrease, my hours decrease.  This is unsettling because I am a single mother of two teenage boys.  The hardest part of the job is when "
good,A great place to work with lots of opportunity to learn in a healthcare setting.
good,Kindred is a nice place to work out. There a few employees and we have a chef on site. Everyone works together. It is very organized
good,Overall a Good Company. Diversified patient care setting. Extensive Medicare/Medicaid patients varying co-morbidities.
good,I was in charge of scheduling and entering in time at the end of each day. I was to make sure the therapist had the correct amount of time for each patient and make sure they met their quote at the end of each week. I helped the therapist with the patients at time. I also sometimes had to sit a room with the fall risk patients. The coworkers were nice and the hardest part would have to be dealing with the negative people.
good,"deliver all new medications and supplies requested during closing time,"
good,"-Worked on a locked neuro-behavioral unit with adults coping with Traumatic Brain Injuries, Mental Illness and Huntington’s Disease, and on a geriatric unit with elderly adults struggling with dementia. Caseload of 58 total clients."
good,Able to work with an interdisciplinary medical team to provide excellent patient care and support for families.
good,Helping the nurses out with supplies and making sure the patients get what they need.
good,"nice environment, good people, great equipment to make patient's recovery easier"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Kindred Hospital. This hospital was a long term rehabilition hospital. Patients stay averaging 1-3 months, sometimes more. I had a chance to meet and work with a lot of interesting people. Both co-workers and patients."
good,Kindred Hospital corporate was recently purchased by an investment group.  They are restructuring the company and closing several of the facilities at this time.  My Hospital will be closed on 3/15/20.
good,"Great managers along with great leadership.  Pay is low for Downtown Seattle. Flexible hours with chosen days off, were a plus. Located next to all lines of public transportation along with an Orca card to use."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,I was very happy working for the company and thought I could trust all staff.  Turns out trusting people is a mistake. What could have been handled with a simple write up ended up in leaving the company.
good,application of the nursing process when delivering care to patients along the life cycle. great learning environment. comprehensive learning opportunities.
good,"Enjoyed working for this company. But we all know it's really about the Skilled nursing facility itself and their management. Fortunately I worked in a five star posh, upscale nursing facility so customer satisfaction was paramount. Rehab care worked hard to keep that contract intact, and since management was fairly ethical, rehab care was too. I have no complaints."
good,"Very nice place to work.  Administration (CEO, DON) changed quite a bit, so was hard getting used to the Upper Management style.  Corporate at times didn't seem to care."
good,"I had a nice time at kindred, but my last 3 months have been overwhelmingly stressful. I worry about the patients, I have difficulty with how tasks are carried out and at times have to work longer than normal hours to get my job done. The pay is below industry standard for the area and leadership pats themselves on the back for money saved on staffing and productivity but at what cost? They have difficulty maintaining true talent as those employees leave for better pay.  Nursing has at times not shown true critical thinking which worries me about how care is given. Leadership has meetings to develop performance improvement plans but staff has trouble complying and then the PI falls through. Executive leadership pushes but rarely worries about the ones working at the bedside."
good,They are a great employer with competitive salary. Very flexible shifts. My only complaint is there’s not  much availability for growth in my department.
good,Nice and relaxed place to work. Work life balance. Not enough hours in a week. This company usually have a low census. If your a fulltime aide you spend more time in the office than the field. Not so much of the nurses.
good,Great environment to hone your skills and to increase knowledge. I started in St. Pete then traveled to the Tampa and Ocala locations. I worked Nights. I kept falling off the payroll due to low census.
good,Kindred Hospital offered a great experience to work along side the number 1 team in the state of Florida.  Coming from big pharma I had the opportunity to receive excellent sales training.  My knowledge Clinically defiantly grew.
good,i have been with rehabcare for almost 7 years. I have a great team iI supervise.  my direct supervisor is extremely supportive & ethical. i do think education & training could be better.
good,home health opportunity that was positive but not a perfect fit for me - i had appropriate support and learned alot about practicing and intervention in home based treatments
good,"Management has been very helpful and cooperative. They take on new grads and teach you well. However, with the new company take over things have changed a lot. The benefits are really poor not recommend if you have children."
good,"My position as a PRN therapist is good when the unit is busy.  Most staff is friendly and helpful and some not.  Have to take everything with a grain of salt, get the job done and  help the patients."
good,Worked there for 6 years with a great staff. I had a great experience at Kindred by working with patients with many different health concerns I developed many skills.
good,"I really like working at Kindred Hosp. I am skilled worker, and very good at my on hand patient care  I know how to groom them so they are comfortable and feel comfortable.   I take their vitals , give bathes and monitor any unusuall changes that the patient may experience good or bad and report it to the nurse in charge"
good,Nice place to work. Friendly atmosphere. Knowledgeable therapists who are very helpful. A clean hospital setting inside and out. A cafeteria for the employees with low prices and sometimes free.
good,"Kindred has the most flexible schedule. I do my own schedule. Kindred always approve my vacation time. Most of my coworkers are easy to work with, specially when it comes to switching schedule."
good,"I loved working here, it was a really great company and employees and Patients were very friendly and easy to work with. We did seem to always be a little short staffed though so that part was a little hard."
good,"Uncomfortable with this, I do not understand why this is necessary. The only thing I am comfortable in stating is that I could not have had a better boss."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Great fellow employees, I loved working here for 18 years but our department is closing.  Would like to stay with Kindred but options are limited.  My boss is awesome"
good,"We provided care to patients with major medical issues. The staff was very helpful, especially management. Unfortunately the ratio of nurses to patients was high most of the time which made for a very long shift."
good,"The staff worked well together during the duration of my employment. The nurses were knowledgeable and skilled and always very helpful to me. We worked cohesively to assure great patient care. Nurses RN’ and LPN’s ,, Doctors, wound team, Pt, Ot,  and the Respiratory Therapist were great! I enjoyed my 8yrs of employment there."
good,rally liked the job. there was a lot to learn and it gave me valuable experience. the staff I worked with on nights were great. they had a dr that stayed AT NIGHT.  the pt were acute but they were there more than a few days which is nice
good,"I have worked for Kindred Healthcare for 15 years, but it is time to move on.  I have enjoyed my time here and getting to know so many wonderful people."
good,"I have enjoyed being a sonographer at Kindred and helping others in their time of need. You have to be compassionate, kind and caring in order to do the best job for your patients."
good,"The pay and the PTO and benefits are decent. The atmosphere is laid back. I go to work, do my job and go home. The work life balance is nice, they offer different shifts in the Financial Service Unit. Enjoy working there."
good,"I very much enjoy the rewards for helping people, but it's sad when management or nurses accuse you for somethings that are not true.  They try to get away with doing as little as possible, some of them are not team players!"
good,"Still employed, great staff, fun environment, ok benefits,  nice facility, caring staff, nice pay, long hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,I worked at this company for 7 years and during that time the entire management team changed at least 3 times. It is a very fast paced job but i found most coworkers to have a team player attitude so it made the heavy work load not seem so heavy.
good,Great place to work.  Unfortunately the company lost the contract with the facility in which I was employed.  Continued to work PRN with the company in various other facilities.
good,Typical health care work setting with direct supervision and impact from corporate policies. can be competitive due to pressure on meeting numbers. good co workers with good intentions to provide good quality care to patients. hardest part of job is knowing that when the numbers go down it is expected to be directly proportional with increase in pressure from upper management is surely to follow.
good,The nurse supervisors and nurse managers give us respect.  This facility takes in the most critically ill patients and has a high level of technical expertise in dealing with these types of patients.
good,"Good place to work overall, refereshing that there are many male RNs to influence care culture, MDs can be nice or not. Patients are very ill and staffing was difficult. Weekends were always a challenge"
good,"Management wasn't always thorough, office got a state audit & turned things around to a well-run company. Flexible scheduling, awesome team of workers."
good,"Enjoyed working here .  Made a lot of great work friends, everyone was very supportive.  Liked to promote from within.  Benefits were good and so was compensation"
good,"Kindred Healthcare takes care of their employees and is always looking for extra benefits to offer.  Large company with opportunities in each business line."
good,The opportunity to work with different therapist and able to learn different therapy techniques and methods that were effective in working with the patients.
good,"The place is clean, nice to work at, good people. Everything is fine. Bla bla bla bla, Just apply and see if you like it. Ok gotta go tired of writing reviews just because I have to."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"As a former cna worker for Kindred Healthcare. It is a productive place to work,  but  its not enough cna staff to cover all shifts. You become over worked."
good,"Due to changes in the sub-acute therapy world more cuts are being made companies are getting scared causing more cut backs. Rehab care is fine they are usually in contracted building, But are ok to work for."
good,Working for RehabCare has given me good experience but there is very little room to advance in the corporate environment. I worked in the office in Clayton and remotely and have enjoyed both.
good,The Kindred Hospital I worked for was a very busy facility. Great co-workers. Departments pitched in and helped one another. Strong support system compared to other hospitals I've worked for in the past.
good,"Loved the job, love working with people, scheduling can be difficult at times. it is hard to get consistant hours. The people you work with are great for the most part."
good,"Work closely with DOR- Director of Rehab. Prepare reports for DOR, and therapist schedule. Transport patients to and from therapy. Attends managers meetings. Assist therapist with patients, complete unfinished clerical task."
good,"In was a PRN MT(ASCP), while working concurrently at Edmond Hospital, while at Kindred. It's a long term acute care hospital, working with the most difficult patients that are too sick to go home, but can't afford to stay in an acute care hospital ! Often, they had multiple disease processes working against them at all odds !! I thoroughly loved giving these patients the best of my ability, from running their tests, to drawing their blood when the nurse's couldn't, to interacting with all staff as a member of the team of total healthcare providence !!!"
good,"It,s ok but the hours be long until someone else gets hired and the then start cutting your hours. An then you go to losing money falling short on your bills because you got in to the job thinking you could make a career. Out of this but stability and constancy and those are two things they lack."
good,Job is fast paced and very detailed. Always busy. Interaction with the residents is a plus. Training can be improved but overall a great company
good,Nice place to work. On a normal day I would come in with a positive attitude and get my assigned cleaning duties done before my shift ends.
good,"The good with the bad - would recommend to those already familiar with healthcare - nothing too exciting or extremes in any direction."
good,"i like working there for many reasons"
good,"Wonderful coworkers who are truly compassionate towards patients and their needs; sometimes difficult to reconcile the healthcare and the business parts of the job, but usually able to make sure patients needs are met while meeting budgetary goals."
good,Co-workers are some of the best. Team made coming to work fun. Supportive staff throughout the building. Focus on what is best for the patient.
good,The company did not have much invested in this building as it did in other better performers in the area. The rehab manager was great but they were unable to sustain a steady caseload. Also during this time rehab aids were billable further reducing the PTA and PT hours.
good,I enjoyed my colleagues. Now under some change. One of the highest paying places to work. Not very flexible in scheduling. It is not self-schedule. Management is generally supportive.
good,It was easy to get along with Co-workers and managers and supervisors all the way up to the CEO were very involved and cooperative. Relaxed environment.
good,Been great opportunity and learning curve. Kindred has been a great move. I recommend to anyone looking for employment.
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"A busy work place not only responsible for the daily case management issues but also act as a buffer with other issues on the floor as part of my leadership responsibilities. Management are supportive . Have good relationship with other department."
good,"This hospital pays well. The staff is nice, easy to work with. Flexible with hours.  No issues with management, do your job and you'll be fine."
good,"Worked there for 4 years. CCF is the lowest paid for nurses. You gain tons of experience but it is a physicians hospital,, . The doctors are arrogant and mean. They do not lay off bedside nurses which is good a little more job security than most hospitals, but you do have to be fit or pay higher premiums for insurance.. Best advice.. get experience then get out"
good,A typical day of work consist of long hours and a great staff . Its a very good place to work . I myself especially enjoying to work with co - workers due to unity & manageable to work with different patients .
good,"I work as a PRN/on call tech. It's an rehab care hospital.. I don't work with any co-workers. I work alone, the job is fine looking for something full-time."
good,"Good supportive staff if you have any questions.  They are available and accessible through email or phone.  Fun work environment, promotes teamwork, organization, and effective communication."
good,a typical day is working independantly cleaning rooms for nursing home patients. You meet great people who are either the patients or your coworkers. Everyone sticks together to get the job done. hardest part was making sure the patients had a safe and clean environment at all times. but i would do it again.
good,"This is an ok place to work."
good,"Management are very cooperative, there is team work and a very friendly environment.  I am very satisfied with this company, they just need to improve on employee benefits, especially health insurance and paid time off."
good,"Busy LTC facilty with room for advancement for employees. Open staff/management relationships. Good teamwork. I learned to include the long term care aspect of pt care. They did however have a high staff turn over rate resulting in consistant pt care difficult and an over load for the staff present. I enjoyed our residents greatly, they depend and trust us as caregivers and become attached to us as we do them! They were the most enjoyable part of this job by far."
good,"Working with respirators taught by respiratory department."
good,Was a great match for a young family.  Very flexible and fast paced work day never dragged!
good,"cool place to work , everyone get along a small family, party and talk to each other. everyone is a team player"
good,Wonderful work environment and great staff. Learned a great deal from co-workers. Management was supportive.
good,"High paced, skill oriented, results driven company."
good,"incharge of the daily activities of an admission coordinator of a Medical facility.  Constant communication with physicians, hospital case managers, and  insurance companies.  Authorization and eligibility of possible admissions to facility which meant authorizations via the internet and or via the phone.  Mentoring of staff and management of staff frequently.  hardest part of job was initially seeing the new admits to process admit paperwork.  Most enjoyable was meeting the new patients and visiting with the other patients in the facility.  Constant compliance with medicare guidelines"
good,"Nice surroundings, alot to learn. management pwople are nice and very helpful, i would reccomend to my friend."
good,"Overall was a good place to work. Through my years there, was a good bit of employee turnover that made the environment deteriorate towards the end. Got a job offer that allowed me to further my career."
good,"Every morning the management team met to review nursing reports from the previous night.  From there, management team met with the Administrator to report any pertinent information from the previous night.  When patient's were admitted to the nursing home, as a Social Services Specialist, I have 72 hours to complete a Psychosocial assessment. If there were any patients who were being discharged that day, a week prior, I obtained discharged information from the physician and a discharge plan was established.  Durable Medical equipment was ordered and delivered to the patient while in the nursing home.  Also, I would conduct home visits to ensure there was a safe discharge.  I enjoyed working with the Administrator and the management team.  The hardest part of my job was when some family members were seeking to exploit my patient; therefore, Adult Protective Services had to be contacted."
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,A fun and a family friendly environment to work. Learned a lot about team work and collaborative work.
good,"I have worked at Kindred for several years.  Left in 2008 after a layoff and returned in 2012.  Kindred is currently going through changes and my position is not as stable as it once was.  I am seeking an opportunity to work for a company in Louisville, KY who has the patient's best interest at heart.  I love my job and what I do and feel I make a difference every day and want to continue that same legacy."
good,"I really have enjoyed my time here in this company, but what is happening is not any ones fault. It has just been a bad turn of events. I am thankful for the experience because I have learned so much that I can take with everywhere I go."
good,"Co-workers are hard working people always most times doing what "
good,"I work from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am"
good,"I love my patients, ability to share my work, abilities, experience with students and my current PT/PTA the 3 of us make a great rehab team.  Hardest part of my job is being told I am a dime a dozen and then be treated like such.  I have 13 years experience as a COTA/L I have management experience and a BS in healthcare management but currently get treated as if I do not even have a degree at all."
good,Worked their on a off for seven yrs. Loved all the amazing experinces and all the technology that we got to witness. We had the pleasure of getting the sickest people that had no hope and bringing them back and rehabbing them and watching them come off thew vent and start removinf tubes and help feed this people and see them get stronger and walk out of their was some of the best moments in my lifes. I watched miracles while working there. I worked with what I think was some amazing nurses that I believe were there for all the right reasons. I didn't think management cared about the pts or the staff. They never came out of there office which I think was sad they didn't get to experience what we got to see on the floor working side by side. 
good,You work really hard. When you get to work the day flies by. You are so busy. You have about half the nursing staff that will help you with anything then the other half will not help with anything and it is frustrating. The office staff monday through friday will come up and help answer lights and pass the lunch trays and help any way they can. I hope they know how much that helps us out and allows us more time taking care of our patients. Over all it is a good place to be.
good,"The job is pretty straightforward and each day is the same. Each position has its own process from start to finish. When I get in I organize the meal tickets for each resident, then I make desserts, set up the dining area, take residents orders, serve them, and clean up. I do enjoy serving the residents and I do interact with them throughout dinner to make their experience more enjoyable. The job is rewarding in that sense; however, sometimes I work with incompetent associates and managers which can slow my progress down. But I have learned how to adapt to such impediments and work around them to ensure I leave on time (staying after hours is looked down upon). Overall, I find this job better than the previous jobs I have held in terms of stimulation and pay."
good,I enjoy working with co-workers & management is fair. Hardest part is playing the Medicaire game while trying to keep pts welfare as priority.
good,"Nurse aide work, hard physical work, good company, high turn over."
good,"This was a hard job. The patients were very unstable, on life support and needed intensive care. I would pass medications, treat wounds, report to doctors, document and confer with respiratory therapists. Most of the people I worked with were nice and helpful. There were many opportunities for learning new things. The staff educator was wonderful. The hardest part of this job was feeling overwhelmed. Too many things to do and not enough time to do them."
good,"My typical day at work would consist of greeting family members, vendors, answering 10 phone system, transfering calls, filing, etc."
good,"good co-workers, teamplayers"
good,Great experience getting comfotable with ventilators. The hospital is set up different than any other facility. The environment on the unit I worked was really set up to provide optimal care of the patients. The skilled nursing facility provided experience in dealing with multiple human resource/staffing dynamic situations and will test the individuals ability to think and work outside the box in nursing.
good,"Normal hours/lunch/work environment. Some people are harder workers than others, but that's any job."
good,"I was 'family' with everyone on my home floor. We all worked together. It was very busy, but I liked working there. I may go back."
good,"Gain lots of experienced in monitoring patient attatched to telemetry,and ventilator"
good,Great hospital sales experience.  Work environment could use improvement.  Compensation is fair.  Some opportunity for growth but limited by building.
good,Excellent respiratory care team with a wonderful manager who always took care of his staff.  Had very flexible hours and great diversity among our team.  Kindred was a great place to work and am saddened by the closing of March 17th

good,I have worked for the company for a long time. My role has some flexibility. Good benefits with several options to choose from. Overall great place to work.
good,"Nice place to work but need better benefits and pay. Hours are okay, but we need more patients. Work culture is okay. Most enjoyable part of job is meeting patients and families."
good,"Sponsoring hospital not cooperative,"
good,"Kindred requires a strong work ethic for success, but pays fairly and offers good training.  The job offers some flexibility, but there are at least 2 conference calls a day."
good,Reaching out to the customer for payment was an experience. Most Nursing homes are waiting on their payment to come from Medicare or Medicaid.  The position call fpr patients and a lot of following up withe the customer.
good,"Good place to work but upper management need to inform team members of changes sooner.  Work environment was great "
good,"You get out to meet people in their own homes and know who you are seeing and what to expect from the client.  Only thing negative is that"
good,"When you know that your work is helping better the quality of life for people that have had difficulties due to age, mental illness, or disability, it is very easy to enjoy your job. The pay isn't the incentive for this job, nor the benefits, but it was about helping others for me."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Kindred as the other staff valued my opinion as a young professional. Other healthcare facilities did not seem to have that culture.
good,Overall had a good experience with this company in the greater San Diego area. Loved my DORs . Hourly pay for this location could be better to keep up with cost of living.
good,"Good Company however, benefits need to be revamped"
good,ADO provided environment of autonomy with critical decision making for program.  Many opportunities were provided for training and collaboration with peers.
good,Kindred was a nice place to work. i have learned a lot new things when i was there that  i will carry with me throught my work and career. the atmosphere was very relax and easy going.
good,Under the tuition reimbursement program I attended job related classes at a local community college. I was included in decision making meetings that involved my department.
good,Rehabilitation hospital was incredible! Patient outcomes were optimal! Thrived on great teamwork.  State of the art eksoskeleton in therapy gym.  So very very clean.
good,I enjoy working at Kindred Healthcare and I enjoy daily interactions with clients and their families. I enjoy the variety of therapeutic tools provided and paid time off.

good,I Love working at Kindreds; especially working with all the residents that stayed and the ones that came to stay for short-term. I learned a whole lot when working at Kindreds.
good,I liked where I worked and loved what I did.  But the manager wasn't being fair to me.  I liked to work hard I did what was asked at work.  made sure tray were done for the next day the morning staff.
good,"Had a good mentorship when first started working for Kindred.  They didn't let you work alone until you felt comfortable,  Some days were busier than others, but if you needed a hand you could always call for help."
good,need management to hold people accountable on their responsibilities. need experienced and well versed management that people can depend on as well as director.
good,Kindred was a good company who really looked out for their employees. They provided me the knowledge and flexibility to learn the SNF industry and advance my career.
good,Everyday at kindred is busy and exciting because of what I do and the people that I work with. I have learned so much while employed here. The culture is very diversified and I have met some interesting people. The hardest part of the job is having to cancel my staff when the census is low due to  the budget. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the staff and the patients.
good,"Mostly I do on call generally Monday through Friday 4:30pm to 8am , work basically every Saturday and Sunday."
good,Good place to work so far that I thought. Great administration and a good group of employers. They provide quality communication and timely pay checks.
good,This is a good company to work for. For the most part you are not micro managed. Over the years here I have obtained more billing skills to add to the list of skills I already have.
good,"The Material Management Department at which I worked in is a very dedicated facility within Kindred Chicago Central Hospital. The Material Management Department staff and hospital adminstrative personell shares a unified support for the patients, staff, and the community."
good,That was not a bad place to work. You found the right tools that you wanted to work. The pay was not too bad. But still it was not sufficient for living.
good,Hardest job I have ever had but enjoyed every moment of it. It is an extremely mentally taxing job with a lot of reward. I loved most of the staff that I worked with and would recommend it to others.
good,Pretty decent when it comes to residents and therapist interaction. understanding staff. but techs should make a little more as they are not only assisting the staff but helping run the rehab center with the managers.
good,a typical day and life at Kindred was steady. every one is family orientated with staff and patient. best thing about working was a team supported. every one worked hard.
good,I am grateful of the experience that I was provided at Rehabcare company; the most enjoyable part of my job was helping my patients achieve their goals.
good,Great working environment in a new building design to promote a working together atmosphere. The management style is layed back but expectations are high.
good,Kindred is a great place to obtain clinical skills. The environment is friendly and I find the staff to be helpful. Works well with family and school life.
good,"I work with a great team of therapist across disciplines.  We all share an office, so consultation occurs frequently, with opportunities to teach to and learn from each other."
good,"Conduct IV rounds and prepare IV medications, prepare and dispense inpatient medications, maintain inventory by purchasing and handling backorders. System is old fashioned."
good,"Great employees at this facility, fun place to work with great team collaboration. I was new in the rehab setting so the OT were very helpful in my continued learning."

good,"Good place to work. Benefits are good and management is great! The corporate office is in OR, and they are very out of touch with what goes in in other states."
good,"So much things to learn, everyday is busy, everybody is helpful and working hard, some days are good and some are not but whatever it is I go home with contentment."
good,Typical large rehab company.  Continuing education through online programming encouraged with room for advancement.  Must protect yourself as management can not always be trusted.
good,"Clean the building of designated places within my shift."
good,"Love my job, my supervisor is great and all Kindred is my dream job. The company is going through restructure and they are secretly laying people off."
good,Strong history of great care at long term care facility. Good community name and reputation. Strong administrative team centered on patient care. Community centered.
good,Outstanding work environment- very easy to talk to management!!! I also really appreciated the strong team of recruiters we had- very willing to step in and help out at any time! Im only leaving because my division is being sold!
good,I loved what I did at Kindred. I loved getting to know my patients and fellow co-workers and the bonds we created. It was definitely a fantastic place for me to start out as a nurse and getting the handle on how to become a great nurse. It was long hours but I enjoyed every moment of it.
good,"No different than any other therapy company.  Up your productivity, be happy and go home. I have nothing to complain about and yet nothing to keep me here either."
good,Great place to work. Everyone was nice and very helpful especially since this was my first nursing job. It was also great that if you wanted extra money they allowed you to pick up extra shifts at your facility or at another campus.
good,Kindred Medical Center located in Houston offers a great challenged to every nurses and other allied medical workers with all the various patients with different cases especially in the transplant floor. It is known to be one of the best LTAC that delivers quality care to every patient. Management are making sure workers are given up to date trainings and continuing education to keep up with the latest trends in terms of management and new medications. Environment are very friendly and homey whicb gives a positive vibes to all the ptients.
good,Its fun working with people who have respect on you no matter what culture you are. work is not always fun anywhere you go stress is always part of it.  The most exciting part of the job is when your getting salary increase you feel fulfilled and happy as well when we celebrating each everyone's birthday with potluck tradition.
good,"Working for this company for 9 years. This is my family away from home, we help each other, everyone is friendly!!I would recommend this place if you like working on a fast pace facility."

good,Working as a Clinical Liaison for Kindred Hospital was a great overall experience.  It gave me the opportunity to understand healthcare from a perspective I hadn't know to that point.

good,"Rehabcare offers employees good benefits, resources, support and has opportunities for advancement.my bosses have been supportive in trying to keep me busy , while helping to support me in managing my caseload. we had clinical support and a lot of opportunities for education.Keeping up with daily documentation, while keeping to productivity requirements was the most challenging. staffing in rural VT was also challenging."
good,"Working at Kindred, is exciting there is always something new going on. We have the ability to learn and experience something new on a daily basis, there is new a dull moment. I've learned that team work plays a huge role with how things function."
good,"I loved being part of the Kindred Family. As a lifelong learner, I was able to experience and learn about different roles within the company. Kindred provided an environment for learning and developing professionals. Kindred recently announced the sale of their nursing center division, but will forever be in the hearts of all who provided care and were cared for within and by the Kindred family."
good,The company is a great company to work for.  The people are very nice and are extremely fun to hang out with.  I really enjoyed my time there but I was an Intern and wanted to pursue others options.

good,"Kindred is a great place to work. Management is awesome they treat you as a family. They recognize the hard work you do. The hard part of the job is like any other job time management (hard to balance time and work). Very demanding job, on the road all day. Emotional toll"
good,"I enjoyed Med surg ,learning & assisting with wound -trach-Vent care  other than working extremely too short it was nice the patients suffer when you work short and it's not fair because your third to give them the best care while their going through this difficult time"

good,"It's great place to work, amazing people, nice nursing staff, this facility has treating patients greatly, they are really care about their patients. CEO so friendly, we are working as a team, but as a monitor tech not really like it coz will work just answering phones, it's not worth. But good to start and gain experience..."
good,I do not wish to participate with this review questionnaire at this time . I worked for this company years ago and do not know how to respond to these questions
good,"It was fine until I started to pick up sitter cases, then their little cliques get upset and want to take your sitter cases from you, and it's allowed."
good,"I learned a lot while I was there. Overall it was ok and the staff was friendly and very helpful. I loved the residents, they were the reason I kept coming to work!"
good,The Kindred Corp is a solid place to work.  Boss comes in early and is very much involved in the day to day operations.  Best part of the job was getting to know co-workers.  Wages are fair for market conditions.
good,"Management was great, they were fair, honest, professional, courteous, and caring. A typical day at work was getting report and greeting coworkers, doing a quick visual assessment, vital signs and finger sticks at this time. make sure patient doesn't have any needs. serve breakfast, and pass daily morning meds. wound care was done at this time, cleaning, packing, wet to dry or whatever the  order may say needs to be done. make sure patient is medicated before wound care is to begin. After treatments are completed, some patients go to therapy. during this time sheets are changed and rooms are cleaned. rounds are done every hour. try to meet patients needs and goals. I learned a lot at this hospital about wounds and the topical medications that are used. I learned how to apply a wound vac, how to measure, clean, pack, and wrap wounds, the most enjoyable part of this job was to see patients come in with wounds that you could insert a whole fist into, and leaving with the wound completely closed with a scar about the size of a penny. this place was amazing at healing wounds. I used to call it the magical hospital, because the amazing staff that worked together, including the kitchen staff, worked magic and healed the patients. The hardest part of this job was the long work hours. The most enjoyable part of this job was the enjoyment I felt when a patient was going home completely healed."
good,I learned the casmba system that Rehabcare uses. I love working next to the therapist and see how they work with their patients
good,A typical day at Kindred Hospital for a nurse includes working with an exceptional team of medical and nursing personnel to help patients in multiple-system failures to wean off of life support mechanisms so that they can progress to rehabilitation programs and return to a normal life.
good,"Working here has been rewarding in learning new skills and providing quality care to patients and families. The facility is very clean and I was provided with adequate supplies. Team nursing is implemented which includes 1 RN, 1 LPN, 1 CNA for max of 10 patients per team."
good,"Rehabcare like a lot of companies have become to focused on productivity and not the PT. Placing all pt in ultra high category to get the most money. Not listening to therapist recommendation of what category is proper at times. Hiring to many therapist then cutting hours. "
good,"Tightly coupled organization, mornings begin with at minimum three meetings to review daily census, potential discharges and admissions from marketing team. Labor management is crucial and watched closely because census drives the amount of labor that can be on hand to care for patients. In this type of setting, the low number of available beds means that a change in one or two patients impacts the labor totals needed for the day. Daily discussions of patient progress and barriers to the current plan of care occur to identify potential avoidable occurences that preclude optimal throughput of patients. The hardest part of the job and most fulfilling is working with the patients and their families. Many patients have been hospitalized for over a month when they arrive as such, they are not always happy and we must work with them through the grief that they are suffering, which can be a huge challenge. More often than not, we are able to win their trust and we end up with a significant amount of success stories."
good,"There are always pros and cons to any nursing home. I did enjoy being employed there, staff was always friendly to me and the residents that stayed there. Always thought management could do a little better with some things. But overall I learned things there and made a lot of memories with my dear residents."
good,Sometimes it can be overwhelming but the work is rewarding and the therapist are respected.  The management is awesome and the friendly staff are a plus.
good,This facility has opportunities for advancement and has great benefits if needed. The company really cares about its staff. They give you plenty of trach and vent care experience.They also offer plenty of continuing education
good,A typical day starts out reviewing and printing calendars for VP's.  Working on planning events for up to 350 people. The hardest part being weeding out the duplicate responses so as to not over book an event.  The most enjoyable part of the day is feeling accomplished at the end of the day.

I enjoy my co-workers and that they enjoy working with their patients.  It keeps the environment positive for everyone everyday.  I find the hardest part of my job is the micro managed time  to see each patient and complete documentation in a timely manner.

Implementing activities and exercises appropriate for the patient and their current status in therapy. Co-workers were friendly slighty stressed at times trying to keep up with productivity demands.

The hardest part of the job was the attachment to the resident who leave or die and as with any other job varying change to adapt to.

good,An organize management structure My co-workers there are very helpful.
good,"I loved my job very much, I loved working with patients, I kept busy and my manager was very involved with everyone and we had open door policy. It's a great job, but the actual building part with nursing and all, was just totally unorganized and I felt that some nurses and CNAs just did not care at all about patients or their job. And the switch over from our old rehab company to the new one, was just a complete mess and we kind of felt stepped on. But overall it was great."
good,"A typical day at work, is to always be prepared for any challenge, I've learned that be a nurse is very rewarding.My management team has an open door policy always ready to listen and help. My co-workers are the best you can ask for to go through any situation on any given day.The hardest part of my job is losing a patient who you knew fought so hard, but the most enjoyable part of my job is hearing our patients talk after so long and be successfully weaned off the ventilator."

good,Management was tight lipped about many changes that had they been more open about them would have let those changes take effect more smoothly. Employees where often recognized for their contributions to help Kindred succeed both as individuals and collectively.

good,Cool Work Environment. Family oriented. Just wished they paid a little more. Management was great. Coworkers are very helpful. They do a lot of things for the employees to show appreciation.
good,Good work atmosphere. In recent years there was a decline in in-house training. Days went by quickly. The most enjoyable part was having good co-workers to share ideas.

good,"No job security in Contract therapy,"

good,"work could be intense at times, but enjoyed coworkers and management, felt like family did work long hours to meet expectations with increased UR obligations"
good,I took care of very ill people. The management was not all about their employees which I always think they should be. Employees are what makes the company. The hardest part of my job is seeing young healthy people so sick. The most enjoyable part of my job is at the end of the day I know I made a difference in someone else's life.
good,"I have worked for this twice and enjoy my stay even more this time.  My manger is very understanding and helpful, I also see many opportunities. I has been a very clean and safe environment to wrok in."

good,Great company to work for. Enjoyed the way everyone worked together. Management was helpful. Very busy with little time to get bored. Would recommend to anyone.
good,I would love to work for Kindred again. I had some personal things I needed to take care of and I could not do this at the time being part of Kindred.
good,"I enjoyed working with the residents and enjoyed my job very much. I loved the other employees and management. The job can be fast paste at times, but good. A lot of the employees became more like family and the atmosphere was pretty positive for the most part."
good,"This was a new venture for the hospital to have an inpatient rehab unit as well as a transitional longterm care unit at the same time.  It was challenging working with physicians that wanted to stay in command of their patients transferred to the rehab unit.  The family physicians did not have ""buy in"" for the rehab concepts so there was constant struggle between patients, physicians and medical directors as to what the care should be.  AND, the hospital was a union facility and therefore, struggles with staffing was always a stumbling block. But here once again I have to remind myself that this was 17 years ago....who knows what to expect now."
good,"Best of Rehab companies in SNFs - most supportive of employees, nicest facilities, and overall best environment and benefits. Ability to transfer State to State sue to national coverage."
good,"Learned so much here, was never pushed beyond extreme limits, management trusted you to do your job and always showed their appreciation. Great place to work."
good,"I worked in a few RehabCare buildings; staff is generally kind and helpful, and willing to collaborate on patient needs. Nursing staff varies from building to building."
good,I overall enjoy Kindred and my Kindred family. Great coworkers and a great place to work. Pay is competitive but the benefits are very weak. I would recommend working here.

good,Worked with talented professionals who supported one another in a collective framework. Very rewarding experience and career satisfaction. Opportunities for mentoring students.

good,I enjoyed working for Kindred as I learned a lot about Sales and Marketing. There were no outstanding issues and I would recommend working there. I thank Kindred.
good,Todo era perfecto asta que nos isieron contrac staff i la nueva empresa quito todos nuestros beneficios
good,"Other discipline staff not always cooperative to PRN staff, limited hours, lower pay than comparable facilities, building in fair condition outside of therapy space but is improving"
good,"Kindred provides great support when it comes to keeping up with the policies and procedures of medicare, medical and HMO billing as well as ways to get your job done. They have good benefits."
good,The director of rehab care was very flexible with scheduling due to having a large network of PRN therapists. This was beneficial in allowing full time therapists to take time off as needed.
good,Kindred Healthcare provided a competitive and dynamic medical service environment  that embraced a sales culture in later years where I was able to achieve success and advance my career.
good,Small facility that is a staple in the community.  Nursing staff are dedicated to quality patient care.  Staff always comes together and pitches in to provide the best care for patients.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Kindred, however, at the time, I wasn't prepared for the level of illness of the patients. Death was inevitable for many of the patients. Unfortunately, some of the coworkers were quite petty."
good,"pay decrease for going prn. management sometimes helpful. If you can work independently, this would be a good place to work. Most supervisors do not help you on floor, but rather have you ask someone else working on the floor. Patient care isn't always a priority with some supervisors."
good,Had fun working for this company they were real great and easy to work with great hours n days. Although when I worked for them one of our supervisor was unfair at time but not always
good,"I have worked at many different facilities within this particular healthcare system, and they all have the same mission; Quality Patient  Care. "
good,"Enjoyed working at Kindred for almost 10 years. The culture of the organization was weak, not much emphasis put on this. Management was good and benefits were excellent."
good,Great job opportunity providing for multiple learning experiences with great staff.  Worked with a variety of health cases allowing for skills training and competency.
good,"Rehabcare is pretty focused on productivity and high RUG rates, but then everyone is at this point. The benefits were decent but the pay will not blow your socks off."
good,Patient care was priority. Very busy.  Patient load was extreme.  Staff worked efficiently and well together. Great learning experiences.  Wound team was excellent.
good,"spent many years a Kindred doing many different things. They typically promote from within, so lot of room for advancement. good benefits, management was great. overall a great experience"

good,"Daily schedule varies based on facility census and therapy caseload, management typically helpful with staffing and everyday as well as rare issues, therapy staff is more like a family instead of coworkers, hardest part of the job- maintaining productivity standards, most enjoyable part of the job- patient care."
good,"M-F 8-4:30. Answer phones, emails, collect reports, compile reports to roll up to corporate, data entry, create templates, gather statistics, transcribe meeting minutes, arrange travel, hotel, large group meetings, accounts, and much more office related items. Hardest part of the job is when the company reorganizes and you have to take on more responsibilities. Most enjoyable was working with a great team at the office. Always willing to help each other whenever possible."
good,"Place a hairnet beard guard properly, ready my station for today's menu. I learned that the residents look forward to seeing you daily. Management is very strong and helpful. For the most part we seem to be one  content family, with a bump every now and then.I would have to say leaving you honestly want to stay and talk with them, they are such a fountain of historical knowledge. Watching them go H O M E waving bye a hug or kiss or two, but knowing their road to recovery has begun ,you've had a small part in their journey."
good,this is a long term acute care hospital and I  am in this field about  10 years in USA. I would like to serve similar type patients for future jobs.
good,"* Good communication between Dietary team members and I is essential for a positive working relationship."
good,I work for 14 years with RehabCare and had the opportunity for advancement the materials for that advancement  The staff I worked with over all were the best.  I resigned my position because I felt pressured to do more that was ethically possible.
good,"During my internship for Kindred Nursing and Rehabilitation, most days were tiring, but seemed to go by rather quickly. Co-workers are highly enjoyable, and have good work ethic and are very skilled as a team. Management excels at organization and patient care."
good,"As a rehab director within a contracted rehab company, expectations are always high to maintain productivity and other quantitative metrics.  Upper management are supportive and seek ways to help in advancement."
good,Rehab care had very good technology for employees compared to other companies. My co-workers were very diverse  and knowledgeable which I enjoyed . The company did not at that time offer much as far as educational benefits.
good,"enjoy working with the people there "
good,I knew I wanted to get into the medical field. I applied for this job and they hired me. I didn't have any experience in the medical field and I wanted to get in the door. They gave me that opportunity and also taught me many things during the time I was there.
good,The most enjoyable part of work in my past field was the ability to provide leadership to my Executive Directors. Meaning that if there was an areas of concerns that they were not able to find resourceful information. Questions ranging from HR concerns all the way to State and Federal guidelines. Being able to attend many resourceful meeting and attend a lot of leadership classes allowed me the ability to translation obtain information that is benefit to all especially to those who aren't aware. Not being able to help with answers or resources was one of the most challenging situations that I would have a difficult time managing.
good,My work was in the patience's home. I would plan my working hours when I get there then I would start working. I usually start with the most important first. On the days that my patient had a doctor's appointment I would help him get ready as soon as I get there and leave shortly after.
good,Great place to work. Very fast paced and lots of activity. Team work is a priority. It is an excellent place to learn and gain experience especially for new graduates.

good,It was a good place to work. I'm glad that I got the experience needed. The most enjoyable part f my job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.
good,"I start my day doing a facility walk through, collecting work orders and talking with residents, their families and staff. The hardest thing I find about my job is being pulled in 15 directions and keeping them happy till I get everything taken care of. "
good,Kindred requires everything you have all the time. The patients are very ill and brittle. We run from the minute we hit the floor to the minute we leave.
good,Were very flexible with schedule. Able to work around appointments and school as long as work was completed and patients seen.
good,"typical day at work - busy "

good,Loved working with my patients but productivity reports were a drag. Overall it is a good experience.
good,The facility was great but the company's places regarding electronic start and stop treatment times are insane.
good,"As Director of Nursing, the responsibility can be overwhelming.  The team developed with Kindred ensured that the residents were getting the best care possible.  The most difficult part of the job was having to be available 24 hours a day.  The most enjoyable part of the job was empowering the staff to further themselves in their careers."
good,"Worked 7a-7p, usually over worked. Skilled nurse usually always had 8-10 patients on critical unit with IV therapy & Vents with multiple medications or tube feedings not allowing enough time for care needed for each patient. Management did not seem up on floor issues. Co-workers were helpful to each other. Trying to find enough time to help each patient. Going home after a long day knowing you had done the best you could."
good,Regular patient flow.  Busy days that make go by quickly.  Super nice staff and most are willing to help.  Lots of training for employees.  Not a physician on staff at all times so nurses do majority of codes.  Most patients are there for 4-6 weeks so there is not a high turn over of patients.
good,They provided the introduction to hospital pharmacy work.  They were very helpful in teaching a recently student the knowledge needed to do the work.
good,Good place to get hands on experience. Inexpereinced management though.

good,Many good nurses employed that truly care about the residents that live there.  Supportive management team
good,"Kindred Healthcare, Inc. is a healthcare services company that through its subsidiaries operates hospitals and nursing centers across the United States. The project was a web based Health care application. The system connected a group of doctors and gave them a forum to interact, both at the personal and public level, where they could discuss diseases and treatments, receive and offer advice, improve their knowledge levels and even access a remote database. Additionally, this enabled team members to securely access and print time-sensitive materials anywhere in our enterprise or over the Web regardless of file format."
good,"Typical early morning at kindred Hospital is actually fun.  Each morning when I leave I feel that I have helped these really sick people by explaining the procedure of AM routine blood draws and if some patients are very anxious about blood draws, I take my time to explain to patients to focus on their breathing an step by step what I will be doing,"
good,"I was a part-time employee.  I only worked on the weekends, I never had much contact with management, but I enjoyed the other lab personnel."
good,"I worked the night shift from 1900 to 0730.   A typical day would start off with a 10 to 15 minute staff meeting for the night nurses to review how the day went and to iron out any problems or concerns,  Next I would get my patient list and get report. Than I would do a quick introduction to let my patients  know I would be there nurse for the night.  Next I would check each  patient's chart for orders and labs.  When this was complete I would check my meds to make sure they were in the patient's box.  Many times a few were missing so I would fill out a missing med form and take them to the pharmacy before they left for the night.  Around 2000 I would do my head to toe assessment and check all my I.V lines and sites for patency and dates.  Around 2045 I would start passing my med and checking blood sugars . During this time I would also assist my CNA with position changes and any bedside care that was needed. At about 2200 I  would do my charting  and acuity. This would take me to 2330 or 2400. When this was completed I would do my wound dressing changes, GT dressing changes and PICC line dressing changes.  At 0130 till 0200 I would normally have lunch.   For the remainder of the night I would monitor my patients and respond to ventilator alarms and do any care that was needed to correct the problem.  In the early morning I would change all my bottled feedings and prepare for report."
good,This was a great company to work for. The assistance and encouragement was available when needed except at times. The turnover of Administrator was the biggest challenge. I would make rounds every day sometimes multiple times to ensure work was being completed. I had reports to accomplish and meetings to attend. I was able to build on my organizational skills and prioritize items. The most difficult part of the job was having to tell someone the position was not working out for either of us. The most enjoyable part would be working with the staff and learning more about Long Term Care functions.
good,"I love my job. I love what I do. In every work place there are pro and cons, however, the pros far out way the cons.I learn quite a lot on a daily basic., but there are days you just want to go home.When  a  patient has expire and you look into that family's face is very hard.You try to comfort family members the best you can, but you know no matter what you say can't take their pain and lost away.this is hard.However, giving service with a smile or take a break to see how your coworkers are doing  or have a laugh is fun and keeps me grounded."
good,I have a Nursing Director who is worthy of the respect of her team and take pride in the fact that consumer satisfaction and preservation of rights are the goal of all.

good,Kindred offers Excellent computer resources and training available for CEU's. Trick is to find the time for it. We had an excellent team and had fun doing our jobs. Only difficulty is keeping Rehab Managers. Lack of adequate supervision and support from Regional Managers. A little too late and too little response.
good,"Company with excellent resources including tests and training on line. Option to receive higher pay if you opt out of insurance and paid time off. I worked with an exceptional team of OT, PT, COTA, PTA and SLP professionals. We went above and beyond the call of daily duty and made a fun program for our patients."

good,"My experience working with the elderly was hard at first, but once i got the training and help I needed, things seem to go according to plan. The job itself it's not hard, but you do deal with a lot of family dynamics and some disfunctional side to it. You are not always going to get cooperation from family memebers because they think you are trying to take away their assets or things of importance. I like working with the elderly because you really learn alot about their experiences through life. They make you laugh and cry as well. I have a caring nature about the elderly. I look at them as my grandparents. They can be sweet sometimes and other times they have their bad moments as well. I love working with my staff. We are such a great team in getting things done for the elderly as well as the business functions. I thought working with children for such along was a great experience for me, but it turns out that working with the elderly has been challenging and rewarding as well. I love coming to work and seeing the elderly residents that i deal with on a day to day basis. They really keep me on my toes and I love the caring nature that most of them have for me.I have been with this company for seven years and I enjoy every aspect of it. There is never a dull moment here."
good,The experience was very enlightening and aided my growth both personally and professionally. I was able to learn about management as a team leader and co-worker.

To make sure that when the kitchen closes at night they have food in their fridges for a late night snack. I'm pouring all their drinks, giving them ice cream and desserts. Besides being a diet aide i have also done cooking and dish washing. It has given me a lot a talents and i have over come some hurdles i didn't think i could.

good,"Good management team, especially DON & ADON.  Some of the CNAs are great, others make your work very difficult (ask them to help you, while they are playing on their phone and you get a response similar to a toddler tantrum, and if they do finally help you they are rude & miserable to both you and the patient, so you learn not to even ask)."

This  company is pro education and confirms its expectations on a regular basis.... no punches pulled here.  Great work life balance. I would recommend friends or family to work here.
good,"A typical day at work involves seeing new patients, evaluating, and continuing therapy for patients with a variety of debilitating conditions.

good,I worked night shift at Kindred hospital and it was quite the experience of working in the ICU unit. The patient's beds were located very close to the monitor technician station. We shared a small desk with the nurses and physicians. We were expected to watch the monitors as well as the patients and the patients rhythm. Which was difficult because we were to concentrate on the monitors.

good,the job can be stressfull only because our patient are very sick kindred is a long term acute care hospital with that being said our patient has coded one or more times before they came to us.

There was a lot of work to do but overall, there was a lot of support as well.  As in any facility, some people were meant to be there and others were not.  The hardest part of my particular job was getting everything done in a timely manner while making sure I had time for residents and family members who needed to spend time with me.  The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the residents and being of service to them.  Our management team was a lot of fun as well.  I left this job after exhausting FMLA to care for my mother in Tucson, AZ until she passed.  I resigned so the facility could hire another social worker in order to have a full time social worker which is so badly needed, since I did not know how long I would be gone."

good,"Management was good!  The team work was great!  I would be assigned to care for certain Residents.  On most days I would have to same Residents to care for.  But there would of course be times when I would need to fill in for another Co-worker.  A typical day of work would be going from room to room of our Clients and assisting them with their daily needs.  These would include assisting them out of bed,  showering/bathing,  appropriate clothing,  shaving,  serving them their breakfast,  going on outings,  doing activities and or games.

good,"I've worked for this company as per diem therapist. Competitive per diem hourly pay rate (no benefits). They recognize your hard work; will likely even offer you a full time position if you do good work.

good,"My day begins at a steady run and I run the entire 12 hours of my shift. Which I like it makes my day fly by in a flash.  We are a very busy med/surg unit.  I do head to toe assessments on 6 patients along with all their medications and any wound care needs they may have.  I attend their care conferences with their family members, the patient, dietary, administration, case manager to plot their progress or deterioration prior to being discharged to home, hospice, rehab or ECF.  The patient's and their families are the best part of my day, I truly enjoy taking care of others who need help.  The hardest part of my job is working with others who do not have the same work ethic that I do, some of them come to work to get a paycheck and they don't care about the patient's or taking good care of them.  Our management is very good at their jobs except weeding out the bad apples in a timely manner, they do eventually take care of them but it seems like it takes an eternity creating a poor atmosphere to work in everyday.  I want to work somewhere I will truly feel appreciated and look forward to going to work everyday."

I learned so much working here. I didn't know a lot about health care coming into this job and I have found my calling in this field. My manager has really guided me and given me a lot of responsibility and it's made me realize that I really love the culture of health care, even the behind-the-scenes desk jobs."
good,Small long term care hospital - good pharmacy department for the most part.  I only work one day per week so it is hard to comment on all aspects of the hospital and the pharmacy department.

Unfortunately the site where I was located was not getting enough admissions over the past year and my position had to be eliminated. However if there are any changes in the near future I would go back in a heartbeat."

Kindred's goal is to wean the patient from the vent and provide therapy in all areas of daily living, ranging from physical and occupational therapy to speech therapy as well.

good,"As a CNA i always had to work alone or short-staffed. 90 percent of the CNAs working are in nursing school and are babies when it comes to working their shifts. Making excuses for not coming in because they had a final or a test and management would let them call in all the time. Nice for them but sucks when youre the only one showing up for a shift, most nurses help, but many wont even care if you are alone as a CNA. Management is really laid-back but that is bad in my eyes because they are so lenient a lot of people get away with a bunch of stuff. Overall i liked working here, good benefits, nice people, friendly staff. they just over-work the good employees. Potential for over-time is great because so many people call in but it gets tiresome after a while."

My immediate supervisor was competent and effective, and ensured that every member of our department worked as a valuable asset to our team. My co-workers were mostly easy to get along with, and for the most part, a very enjoyable group of people to work with. The hardest part of the job was the daily service of meals, which had to be accomplished correctly, effectively, neatly, on time, and completed in a timely manner. The most enjoyable aspect of my employment was the constant learning, I learned something new every day."

I learned how to summarize the main point of my patients care with out leaving out any main details. Working for Kindred was great,, I got to learn new skills that I hadn't learned before. Management was great about improving their employees and being fair all across the board. When I had first began ; the hardest part of my job was trying to give my patients my full attention and give them my 100%. Although I had learned to manage my 11 patients not all days were the same and some required extra time. Which leads me to how awesome it felt to be rewarded by my patients - being thanked and told how awesome I was too them made all the other things not matter. I knew I used all of my best strategies and worked hard and proficient to do my job to to the best of my ability, and my patients had recognized that."

Management most felt had double standards for some and not others. Most of my co workers were great to work with on the unit. The hardest part of the job was after eight pm this is when the doors automatically locked and oftentimes this would interrupt with patient care. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I had done something to make someone else's life comfortable, enjoyable and happier. I made an impact in snd on their lives."
good,"My typical day is very fast paced, making sure patients get what theyre diets ask, and washing dishes. I have learned that if you give a patient something theyre not supposed to have, it can mess their stomachs up and make them stay longer than needed, You have to be extremely careful of what diet gets this and what diet recieves that. My manager is a very nice man, he always helps with problems and handles things as best as he can. The hardest part of my job is washing dishes basically all day in a little room. The most enjoyable part about my job is knowing you gave a patient the right things for their diet and knowing you can save a life by doing this. It makes my day amazing knowing I can save lives in this way."

My first year I worked with medical surgical and cardiac patients. I introduced team work to my team mates and encouraged them to do the same and also encourage new staff. I was offered a position to the ICU unit which I accepted. Presently I work in the ICU Unit, but was also offered a position as Supervisor/ Charge nurse in May 2018 which I accepted.

I record the amount of min. the therapists provide to the patient on a daily basis according to the Medicare standards, provide my director with updated information for the patient's chart, type discharge summaries using information from EMR.  I assist in making up charts and breaking down charts, perform an inspection of the unit on a monthly basis along with reviewing chart audits on each and every patient.  I enjoy performing the many tasks each day even if it is only for a few hours."
good,"Data entry at its finest. New system just rolled out to ease the up and downs of invoice processing. Management has a hard time making decisions in AP department because VP has final call and doesn't always agree. VP works well with you to figure out solutions, but ultimately makes final call."
good,This is a great place to work to gain experience and move forward with your career. I find that this is not the place I will work forever but I'm glad I came.
good,"A typical day at work is spent in the field developing business for doctors, hospitals, home health facilities, hospice facilities, rehabilitation facilities associated with Kindred.  The learning experience at Kindred has been rewarding and allowed me the skills that I can use in the future.  Management on certain levels is great however, my current role there is no opportunity for growth.  I have had two positions with the company but it was more of  lateral move. There is quite a bit of windshield time, because of the size of my territory.  I consider it wasted time when I could develop small markets and move forward to other markets in the territory.  However, my territory encompasses a wide range of Houston from the Woodlands to Galveston and all in between.  I have no direct co-workers however, I work with at least 60 plus Kindred representatives in these particular areas. The other Kindred employees are pleasant to work with and allows me the opportunity to learn other aspects of business development.  The challenges of the job is the inability to grow the business incrementally.  This would allow a more successful territory.  I have don't well with the relationships I built in the past and redeveloped.   Sales and marketing and the ability to directly communicate with the customer and establish relationships is key.  Its rewarding to know that I am in a field that fulfills the need of others. I have a plethora of experience in the sales and marketing field in healthcare and know that I am making a difference."

good,Currently enjoy my employment but looking to return to Ohio in the next 6-8 weeks. I enjoy the home care work. The office staff are great. Management is wonderful. The position just requires alot of documentation which cannot all be done in the patient's home. So it has a negative impact on home life.

good,"Kindred is a final step hospital. Or long term acute care facility. Patients are 95 percent coma induced,  so imagine studies are very limited. Requires for the tech to become creative in the way to capture requested studies."
good,"I enjoyed working for them, they let you work while you took the home care course at the same time.  only down fall is there was no guarantee of hours and there were too many emails from the scheduling department always changing shifts."

good,Kindred is a great place to work! I learned alot during the time I was employed there.
good,"Atypical day consists of treating approx. 10-12 patients in a SNF for a variety medical diagnosis.  I enjoy working with the geriatric population, and have done so for several years.  You must be talented in areas of communication, as well as a team player to make it successfully in this environment."
good,"Sorry they sold off the facility I worked for, I learned a great deal and had lots of good experience."
good,"Everything was excellent beside the mangement at the faucilty in Roanoke Rapids. I loved my job and was taken out of work by doctor and they wouldnt let me return to work. Said I quit when i did not. Some employees got away with leaving on the clock, calling out sick every week, get to work and disappear for hours,"
good,Management was always available to discuss issues and concerns. Case load was reasonable and equipment was always available with good team of therapists working together

good,"I love Kindred Hospital and all the staff there. We meet people at their worst, their family member are very sick when they come to us. Kindred is a place I would want my family member to be at if they were on a ventilator or needed wound care. We treated the patients and family members as if they we one of our family members."
good,"I have worked as a rehab therapist at several Kindred Care/Rehab Care facilities over the past two years and in general they have been really nice facilities with excellent staff.  Management varies per facility and depends on how much of the for profit ""Kool-aide"" the manager has drunk.  In general, I was never bothered about performance or productivity, with one glaring exception."
good,I learned a lot at this job and it was mostly due to having such an amazing supervisor. She really taught me a lot about what it takes to be a great SLP. I got a lot of opportunity to grow.
good,"As long as you are willing to do the grind Kindred is for you, but some don't want to do the dirty work and just coast.  I used to work in a nursing rehab center and the load here is much more intense.  Once you get the hang of the job though it is easier.  The people you work with are like your second family,  they will be with you thick or thin."
good,Great mgmt and wonderful coworkers...family type atmosphere and genuine care and concern of each resident! All staff had the residents interest and everyone worked as part of a team.  The hardest part of the job was seeing the passing of previous patients. I’ve taken great pride in putting a smile on a face or making a resident laugh! My motto is treat others the way I would want to be treated!
good,"Company takes care of employees and contractors equally, very good company to work,friendly environment, good management, work life balance, very good job culture"
good,Collaborative environment to work in. very attentive to needs of residents good choice of benefits. executive director did not attend to big workplace issues

good,A typical day begins around 8am. During the day I have the pleasure of working with therapist and patients. Watching patients admitted to the unit in a wheelchair and leave walking is a blessing.
good,It is a nice company to work for with a very nice facility patients along with staff get to enjoy. The staff is very friendly and most try to be helpful. The job does keep you busy and most times you don't have as much help as you need but we all try to manage. One of the most hardest things about the job besides not having enough help is losing one of the patients you get so use to seeing and caring for on a day to day basis.
good,Diverse culture.  Employees work together as a group to better care for patients  Chance to advance.  Would recommend as an excellency place to work.
good,"I worked at the medical center downtown. I worked for Kindred hospital, I was a clinical liason, I would go to other hospitals...acute hospitals and patients that needed extra help and needed to stay in a  LTAC facility, I would read their charts and see if I could get them improved by working with their insurance companies. I learned compassion for the elderly and that no matter what you should always try your best to help others. My co-workers were amazing and I loved being able to learn from them, the way they learned from me. The hardest part of my job and one of the main reasons why I left is because insurance companies would not accept them to go into a LTAC and instead wanted them to go home and not get adequate care they needed. When I was able to get a patient into Kindred hospital and gaining their trust. Plus, being able to see how much they would change physically in a month or more."

good,Most of the clients you work with are very sweet and management tries not to over load you with clients and they try to work with your schedule if something comes up.
good,I worked for Kindred Hospice and overall liked my job.  I had a census of 8-12 patients and traveled to Muncie on occasion.  My manager was tough on me.  She did not have the Hospice spirit in my opinion. I think our Director was very good and supported us in the field. I did not like traveling to Muncie.
good,Kindred Place is a retirement community.  I worked as a receptionist until I was promoted to Payroll/Benefits coordinator and Billing and Accounts receivable Specialist.  There is such an enjoyable work environment here.  However it is a small company with lack of advancement.  I would like to use the many skills I've acquired here to further my career.

And the orientation process was everything I was expecting it to be. It was the most informational orientation i've had since I was hired to work for Advocate Healthcare Systems, earlier in my career when LPN were utilized in Acute Care Hospitals. I was very pleased with the introduction process, the background checks and etc. It gave me hope that there are still companies out here that care about who they hire and the safety of the residents and patients they care for."

good,"A typical night at work is as follows; family is usually leaving. The patients are ready to rest. We get to meet most of the families and get to know the patient a bit better. The things that are to be done for the next day, such as getting patients ready for procedures are done. Consent forms get signed; those patients that are going to dialyze in the morning are weighed. Baths are provided for those requesing it. Antibiotics are administered as they are due. The hardest part of the job is making sure lab work is confirmed and collected and the ""now"" orders are carried out. The most significant part is making sure our patients are safe. The most enjoyable part is when the nursing team works well with each other as we carry out our nursing duties. At the end of the shift we report to the supervisor any pertinent issue."

I have basically gained most of my skills at Kindred and every day I seem to learn more and more and it's an exciting place to work. I work with team players and we all have each others back in time of need. The hardest part of the job is the long hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job is providing assistance to patients and family members and seeing the smiles on their faces. The management team is all right with me, they don't mind lending a hand and answering appropriate questions in the time of need. "
good,This position has taught me the importance of communication and the need for access control in facilities.
good,I found out how important proper management becomes for the care of patients to be up to par. When I first stated at Kindred all management positions were just filled or needed filled. Once the positions were filled and everyone was working as a team the work environment changed for the better. The quality of care increased drastically and it became what I had more expected to see when I graduated nursing school and became an RN. I recently moved away and can not wait to begin work again!
good,My time with Kindred has been outstanding. Love the people and the company. But Management has changed and my life has also changed personally. I need to be closer to my family in the San Diego area. It is a must. Tired of traveling every week. Time to relocate.

Had many times where patients who were very compromised and very acute became critical quickly and the teams rallied, including the resp dept and many were saved, due to the quick actions of the nursing teams.

Kindred Chattanooga is a fantastic place to work. The work load is not ""too much,"" the atmosphere is inclusive, the management is good, and mostly in touch. Like most places...upper management tends to forget that there are departments crucial to patient care other than nursing."

In some cases we may walk with the patient or help them exercise.  I have learned how to properly care for a patient that is in need of both strengthening and self care.  My manager and coworkers are very helpful with on the job learning and skills training.  I have had difficulty at times with slowing down and resting after each encounter,  bearing in mind that time can give an opportunity to see things more clearly.
