rating,review
bad,"Management is there to "" help improve your work"" but dont want to know what the issues are. Management lies and covers for each other. It doesn't matter how hard you work, its all about who you know. If you are not in line with the gossip and the bullying you will never make it. "
bad,"Work days are stressful. You're ""graded"" on your work. Work will get rejected and returned to you. They track the amount of errors you have and it hurts you in the long run. (accounting.)"
bad,"Many female employees experienced harassment.  Once reported to HR, those employees became a target and still experienced harassment. There are over 70 lawsuits against Pulte."
bad,An awesome team who always worked to win and meet or exceed goals. We worked hard through the tough years and kept it going through the good years 2008 and 2011.
bad,"quickly hiring young inexperienced candidates who are hurried through training and placed on sales floor.  High rate of turn over due to poorly managed teams.  lured with incentives if various metrics are in-line but can often be difficult to meet all simultaneously.  "
bad,"There was a huge amount of turnover. Literally, every time I went to the copier there were people there I'd never seen before.  Horrible management, huge layoffs, highly stressful. A sinking ship."
bad,There is no rhyme or reason to what you are doing as a purchasing agent.  You are usually looking for vendors at the lowest cost.  But at Pulte your job is to be the vendors friends.
bad,"It is very obvious that these ratings are written by the company so let me inform you about the ugly truth: "
bad,"This firm keeps you on the edge of high pressure, and high performance, but seriously low pay.  The Walmart of the builder world, headquartered in Denver.  I would use only as last resort.  Management keeps you in the dark, while workers don't have much time to socialize.  Your are limited to your germy, dust filled cubicle."
bad,"The purchasing coordinator position could have been better if they had a better structure and people knew what they were doing. The structure in the department was like a elementary school. The manager was the principal, the senior coordinators were the teachers and the purchasing coordinators are the students. I am sure they will have a high turn over rate. It's really not a purchasing job it's data entry and they like to give ""errors"". The productivity scale is backwards and nobody was making the numbers that management put in place. And really no advancement in the department you would have to go to a different department. I would not recommend to apply to this position and only good thing I would say about it is its a good location. Other than that I don't miss it at all."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. Management style is basically the more inept you are the faster you will rise as long as you smile & act like a robot. Work hard , do a good job ? You will be consistently reprimanded for not doing better. If you have any sort of an opinion or personality or if you are the slightest bit logical don't even bother applying. "
bad,"I’m very disappointed in the management. They ask for more than a person has time to give. They get a zero on work life balance. This could be a great company to work for, but upper management is driven by bonuses. This is a big problem and home quality suffers. I would never buy a Pulte home."
bad,"This is a good company for beginners right after college. But as far as advancement it is slime to none."
bad,"They are land builders only location,location, they do not care anything about the buyers, they care only about pushing up the price so high, to deliver profits to share holders. The product is build code only. They charge for every single option, and there floor plans are poorly designed."
bad,"A terrible place to work for. They lied about the job description and try to treat people like kids. I have never worked at a place where they give you ""errors"" and count them against you. Most of the co-workers were nice but some are weird."
bad,Pulte pays well but expects much more than the 45 hours that they'll pay you for. If you take a job here then be ready to give up your evenings and weekends just so you can try to keep up. This company makes a truckload of money by saddling their field staff with a soul-crushing workload. It used to be a lot more fun around here.
bad,"Poor company to work for. Terrible management that is unprofessional and aggressive. As the Field Manager, you do not have the power to hire or fire trades.  You are expected to make them show up on time and produce quality work."
bad,"I have been working at Pulte Mortgage full-time (More than 5 years)"
bad,"Company does not care about employees. DO NOT Work for these people. Poor contracting by purchasing department leads to poor work ultimately to be blamed on you, and only the customer really suffers."
bad,"Worked for company for 12+ years through a very difficult market fluctuation only to be treated like nothing more than a number. Company cares more about closings than customers and certainly a great deal more than employees. Employees are nothing more than replaceable parts to this company. Be ready to put work first, family is to be put way on the back burner."
bad,"STAY AWAY FROM NPS/NFS. Employees are under paid for services provided. You are constantly treated like a child and management lacks skill set. If you are incompetent but smile you have a really good chance of being promoted although the promotion percentage is so small, you will need to use a microscope to view it. The organization feels like working in a manufacturing plant with exception of having AC. The organization lose staff members monthly due to high volume of work with relatively low pay. This organization  will not enhance your skills. The positions are mainly administrative and does not require someone with a degree to perform the tasks. And NPS gives out errors. Yes errors. This company is pathetic."
bad,"Worked for them 10 yrs and always thought they were a great company, but their management left little for desire. They let people go that were good workers for no reasons and they seemed to keep more of the ones that liked to tattle on other people. It became very uneasy to work there. You always felt like you were doing something wrong and would get in trouble. People started quiting. I am sorry to say when they lost me, they lost a great employee, but I was just another figure that could be easily dismissed."
bad,"Very obvious that senior level management had no interest in getting to know what the people in the trenches were doing, and what they brought to the table. Very slanted towards people with finance backgrounds, regardless of their skill set, they seem to be the ones that advanced time after time. Recognition to those that were doing the work was generally overlooked, and ultimately those people were passed over for some person that was far less qualified, but was a strong player in a game of intercompany politics."
bad,"Job Culture is an ironically hypocritical term abused in this society we've crafted and it is NOT just for the customers you serve, but the management in which you work under."
bad,"No work life balance, management is very unorganized and does not understand the amount of work on every desk. High turn over rate. Has opportunity for improvement."
bad,when they got thier management in place they went dow hill
bad,"worse place to work..people mill..high rate of turn over average employee is six months.  No employee loyalty from the employer."
bad,"They spend month training you on corporate history but completely drop the ball,  training on Job expectation. Over Load on constant changes. Management team that are Bullies and unhelpful in clarifying goals and expectations. Low moral among the Field Managers and horrible vendor support and compliance. Constant Turn over every year of 60-80% of Field Managers."
bad,"Cut-throat non-collaborative working environment. Clicks, and not fair with transactions. Cannot trust management or you teammates. You will have to work 7 days per week and they do not value family or work life balance."
bad,"scheduling, coordinating and maintaining customer files and database, and inbound and outbound calls"
bad,my first taste at a very political system.learned a lot.was micro managed from the division head-weekly.
bad,Be ready every day for working your butt off and you don’t get a pat on the back they just want more everyday. You will never be able to keep up with the pace. Just be prepared to get yelled at and things flying around inside the job trailers.
bad,"The management is terrible, it's all about the numbers and no care in the world about the people or customer!  There are better places to work.  There is no work life balance at Pulte!"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of working non-stop with a lunch hour.  Most loan processors loose their vacation time because there is ""never"" a good time to take off.  Management leaves at 5pm. Loan Processors are always working OT. If your a Loan Consultant, no matter how good you are, you are secure. Loan Processors are a dime a dozen there that is why there is a fabulous training facility.  Turn over is very high"
bad,My bosses expectation where unrealistic and unattainable. The amount of task given are unrealistic. The vendors run the show and never show up. You will continuously write them up and they will never be wrong. Vendors are unresponsive and its always your fault.
bad,There is no work life balance for most employees.  There is very little opportunity for advancement or goals set to better opportunities for advancement.  There has been a shift in how the company operates and treats its employees and is not a good shift.  Too many cliques and many employees with 15+ years are leaving for better opportunities with other companies.
bad,"The people at Pulte are great! The workload was heavy and required working nights and weekends to get it all done. They refused to hire help for the workload to keep costs low, which led to high turnover."
bad,"Very bad training, supervisor took a week to respond to emails and phone calls. Supervisor constantly yelling at me for no reason and with no way to change my behavior. Everyone is in a clique like in high school."
bad,"Reduction in force.  Company is not concerned about Customer Service.  Only concern was to reduce overhead, slash Customer Service and to align with building and selling homes.  Not concerned with after the sale."
bad,"This company is ok to work for if you are looking to enter the world of home development/construction. However, they have downsized in the past and have recently downsized the very same department over lowering the budget my one stupid percent."
bad,"Typical day at work  starts early to open the job site or community.  "
bad,"Review summary and Pros/Cons say it all. Stressful often, as expectations and deliverables change often and at the blink of an eye with no forewarning.  Shady business practices occasionally and definitely 'good ole boys' club, where its about who you know and who's A-list you're on."
bad,"Everyone is willing to help each other in order to get the jobs done. The team leads were easy to work with, and did a great job of providing the tools necessary to get the job done."
bad,"Very high volume loan processing center.  Did not care for their work ethics in trying to get customers several mortgages on top of ones they already had in order to obtain a Pulte home.  Most of the applicants were either foreign or elderly.  Work crew was great, some of the hardest working people I ever had the pleasure to work with.  Processing center closed in Charlotte luckily"
bad,"High volume call center environment. High stress, high focus on customer service vs. profitability, retention."
bad,Pulte was bought out by Centex.  I enjoyed working at Pulte Homes in the email marketing department. 
bad,"Prior to relocating to Atlanta, the culture was focused on an employee first mentality. Many new faces, especially in leadership have lost that vision and made working at Pulte just a job. There's too much gossip, backstabbing and if you speak your mind in certain departments regarding concerns, polish up your resume because you won't be there much longer. If you aren't part of the ""in crowd"", you'll be pushed out eventually."
bad,"Pulte Mortgage LLC was a decent company to work for I truly had my sights on retiring from there.  The work load was fast pace and each day brought new challenges which made things exciting (never a dull day).  "
bad,"As long as you get in line and stay line, Pulte takes care of you. Have a dissenting voice? An opinion? A better way to do things? Don't bother bringing it up, because if you do, you'll end up on the list of folks to be shown the door (even if your performance is exemplary). "
bad,"If you like to have quota and time management under your belt, then this is a great place to work.  If your new to the accounting fields then this is the place to start. However, the manager of finance is trying to make the company a better to work at.  But the turnover is high and the hours are long and micromanagement has never been my style.   So I would say keep looking."
bad,Management is willing to stretch people thin in order to reap temporary financial gains.  Turnover breached 35% for the field manager position in the early part of 2017
bad,Pulte paid well but you earned every penny of that money. Better than 50% of the clients that you had to deal with were extremely high maintenance and had expectations that far exceeded the warranty coverage.
bad,They are not willing to change and the technology they use is far too complex for there needs.  Most of the organization runs under a strict rule by senior staff.
bad,The company took advantage of employees.  I would not recommend anyone to work there.  
bad,"I enjoyed my time at Pulte NE, it was a very good experience , great comradie with team players and constantly obtaining my sales goal."
good,"Sweat shop mentality "
good,The VP of Construction is the one person here that seems to really care. The rest of management seems disconnected. The culture went from good to bad with the obvious turmoil at the highest levels of the company.
good,The company is returns driven and often enough it forgets to value its employees.  Open Communication is an issue.  It does not have enough transparency and messages are not tricked down timely or at all.
good,Long work days and even when you were off you were on call. Learned to management how to work in a pressure cooker atmosphere. Hardest part of job was how to deal with the stress
good,"Job description provided during hiring process did not equal to the work completed daily. Once they consolidate the work load and mold it to not be so complicated the job would have been very simple to complete. However, they have dissolved this department of the company as of August 2016."
good,My typical day started a 8 am and finished working in the office at 5 pm.  The I would spend 4 to 6 hours in my home office finishing up daily activities and preparing for the next days work load.
good,Never again  would I waste my time working for a company that over staffs temporary people.
good,"overall this company tried taking care of you, if you would have a problem they would try to fix it, i learned allot from this job, and i would say it was pretty fun"
good,"Was a great place at first but they have uncontrollable turnover 98% of the people that were here when I started are now gone. They are not re-hiring experienced project managers, due to this many of us are working several communities with no support from upper management Would be great if we had support and more people worked there to help lighten the load.  Also the CM that is currently there is great but everyone above him only cares about numbers and not how the customer experience and it took almost a year for our parent division to finally decide to train the field staff after watching all of us struggle for the last year."
good,"Everyone does everything the same way.  Stay in your lane, do not step out do not pass GO.  You're individual contribution is not valued.  Come in do your work, don't ask questions and you'll have a long career of data processing."
good,"Pultegroup can be a wonderful place to work culturally, diversity, work etc. They have special events and perks that are great for the team and they did impliment team building events in which I appreciated."
good,"This is a fantastic company to work for, with many superb managers. BUT.....Do not get stuck at the Frisco job site. The lead manager is VERY difficult to work for."
good,"The compensation matched the stress level - higher than the industry average. My coworkers were friendly, however there was a disconnect with senior management."
good,"Before leaving the company, I had a baby and it was really hard to disconnect from work and go home without the change that I would have to log on remotely to do work. They do not compensate very well compared to other companies in the area and they expect a lot out of their employees anyway."
good,"Overall Pulte Homes is a great company to work for, from the corporate stand point. Unfortunately there are consistently too many leadership changes and attempts to change in several directions simultaneously. There is an overall lack in experience in the latest core management team that have drained moral. There has been a staff turnover rate in the past couple of years that would have never been previously acceptable."
good,This company has a very high turn over in staffing. Its hard to stay focus on the day to day logistics do to the every lasting revolving turn over since I got here.
good,"Overall the company is good, but the accounting department is overworked. Work life balance is non-existed if you want to do well in the company. Good employees are given more than a person can handle, and low performing employees are left alone with no consequence."
good,"If you are new to home sales a company like Pulte Homes is a great place to start. However, with there being a cap to the amount of annuall income a consultant can make. This may not be a good fit for more experienced consultants."
good,Pulte was a fun and energetic place to work. It has been a long time since I worked there. The market started to decline but it has come back a bit and I have heard good things about it.
good,"Exciting fast paced sales community, with disconnect or lack of communication between departments. Confusion with products and systems, creating an over all poor customer experience. Pinpointed issues and areas for improvement were never addressed."
good,"A lot of hardwork needed to be successful, the work/life balance is very minimal because of all the take home work you are expected to do with no pay."
good,This is a great place to work as long as the market is hot.  If the market starts going south start looking for another company they give you no warning.
good,Provided opportunity to work alone to present company products and programs in varied locations and to different prospect demographics.
good,Pulte is a good company but with the 4 hour daily commute it was hard to have a good work/life balance.
good,I work in the IT department for this company. Most of my co-workers awesome and fun loving people.
good,Good overall experience. They provided good benefits and compensation. Clean workplace with possible work from home options. The employees were fun to work with.
good,A typical day of work would consist of me arriving to my job site adhering to a calendar schedule to meet home owners and address concerns if any. Walk the neighborhood and continue appoints as needed. I was able to gain better time management skills as well as advanced problem solving skills when it comes to customer service. The most enjoyable part about my previous job was the interaction between home owners.
good,"Very stressful.  Chaotic everyday.  Other than that, I have nothing else to write.  Not sure why I'm being forced to write this review.  There is some rapport among coworkers as well."
good,"worked with new home buyers on loan programs and loan approval, negotiated rates, updated and provided mortgage documents to borrowers. I learned all programs such as USDA, FHA, VA, conventional, first and seconds, and jumbo loans. "
good,"	Planned, budgeted, and managed construction projects up to $100 million"
good,I also built townhomes for pulte. the work place was fun and the homes went up without issues. The company seemed to try to get the homes built with maximum efficiency.
good,"Like most other places, there are things that are great about this position and things that could be improved. Work life balance can be difficult depending on the time of year and how well trained other members of the team are. Management loves to micromanage and treat you as if you're not an adult a lot of the time."
good,"Pros: Great benefits, overall good work-life balance, teaches you home building industry very quickly"
good,The people I worked with were great.  They made it fun to come to work.  The job was crazy busy which I like.  Sometimes challenging which I also like.  I had a lot of responsibility but not much authority.
good,"Very busy and fun place to work! Great atmosphere to learn about the home building industry. You learn something new every single day. Also, there a great group of people to work with."
good,"I was a intern a long time ago for the summer so I was only there a couple months, but everyone was helpful and willing to teach which was appreciated"
good,"Heavy demand on your time and would often require you to work without compensation.  They management team likes using statement that make the outside world believe that they empower the front line employee to do the assigned job without approval.  This is very untrue, the management team belittles people and demeans them unto believing there are worthless, and could not find employment elsewhere."
good,"Typical days are long and productive"
good,"Flexible schedule, can buy extra vacation, relaxed environment. Overall, Pulte is a good place to work, but sometimes I felt like I was living in the movie office space."
good,A typical day was the input of purchasing data for all locations.  Periodically we would have to contact Purchasing Managers for verification on certain items.
good,Great company with beautiful homes. I enjoyed working for this company but I moved to Houston to further my career. Would recommend this position to someone who is looking for part time employment.
good,This division has closed it's doors. I have no idea how the others are to work for.
good,Centralized operations for a new home builder.  Typical day at the office was processing and preparing loans for closing for a nationwide home builder.
good,"I have worked at PulteGroup, Inc for over a decade; I have enjoyed the culture and the opportunities for growth.   However, all 300+ home office employees learned of the company's plans to relocate to Georgia by virtue of the evening newscast which is a stunning revelation of the changes that have occurred since the company founder retired."
good,My co-workers were fun to work around and upper management was fair.
good,I daily matched invoices with PO's fixed all issues and then printed checks and after the controller and forman signed off on them I mailed them out.
good,"Good place, good benefits, and good people. If they would of never laid me off, I probably would of been working there still."
good,Typical production construction company before the boom. Nothing more to tell
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Pulte Homes was learning how the home building industry operates and working with so many fabulous and hard-working people.
good,"PulteGroup is the nation’s sole multi-brand homebuilding company capable of serving homeowners through three distinct brands, which include Centex for first-time homebuyers: Pulte Homes for consumers in the move-up market; and Del Webb for active adults age 55 or better."
good,Driven by the dollar and results. Not a lot of culture and care for employees when puch come to shove.
good,"Great experience for just out of college, people. Better for men than woman. Good ole boy mentality. Good pay, great benefits. Poor management and too much emphasis on jd powers and fortune 200"
good,Typical corporate job.  Upper management only cares about the numbers and bottom line.  As long as you are exceeding your goals and numbers you'll be fine.
good,The best part of working for Pulte is the people. The people are the ones who make the culture. The work can be fast paced but the people are amazing.
good,"Pulte used to have a very good family culture where the employees and their ideas were valued.  However, in 2015 it became like most corporations - only concerned with the revenue and wall street.  Massive layoffs are the norm.  If you are part of the field and tied directly to sales or a regional office and not HQ - you will have a much better experience."
good,"My current position requires daily interaction with internal and external resources to maintain project schedule, drafting and design standards, and budget compliance. I also provide software support for the option management CAD systems for all zone based resources. "
good,"Pulte strives in meeting customer needs and satisfaction, definitely takes pride in what they stand for. The company motto is without a doubt aligned with the services and products they offer and delivery."
good,"Making sure all documents were up to date"
good,"There are many employees in IT that have been here a really long time (10+ years) and they are not open to new technologies, new ideas, or input from new employees who have a lot of experience.  Management is trying to change this culture but it is slow."
good,"As a construction manager and sales consultant for Pulte Homes/Del Webb, I gained a solid understanding of construction processes and fundamental real estate supply and demand economics. These experiences helped me better understand and anticipate consumer behaviors and communicate market trends and analysis to senior management."
good,"Good starting place for entry level people. Being a public company, the process is in place for someone to learn. The machine runs smoothly, but several ""processes"" in place that can't be challenged."
good,"Started with the company at an entry level position, and had a nice career with opportunities for advancement for several years with quality staff surrounding me.  Good work life balance throughout and provided a healthy resume and some of the best training in the marketplace.  Change in local management in recent years changed company culture for the worse though and veteran staff began to leave the organization to work for competitors and related fields.  Partnership philosophy amongst the company and its subcontractors provided above average quality and pride for years, but that action plan was replaced with an unsustainable push for gross profit margin, with quality and customer service taking a back seat.  Still retain the friendship and contact with many former associates."
good,"Dealing with 8-23 service request that are generated per day due to warranty on demand. We pod schedule for trades and CSM's from Santa Fe to Los Luna's Monday through Friday 8-4."
good,I worked hard and earned many promotions.  My time there ended only because of life changing events.
good,"Competitive salary and benefits package.  Work culture was positive and honorable.  management was available to speak with."
good,long  days  lots of work in housing boom work slowed down in bad economy
good,"The lead Field managers and Construction managers are grate to work for, however the higher ups keep you in a constant threat of termination, creating a toxic workplace"
good,This is a great company to work for if you are willing to spend the rest of your life at work. Turn over is high and management shows a lack of concern overworking employees.
good,"High stress; heavy workload, little life balance and not a lot of job satisfaction due to unrealistic demands........................................."
good,very interesting company to work for. some of my co-workers are nice. I learned a lot from other co-workers to do my job. 
good,This was a good company but the leadership was not very focused.  They set up a national shared services in Michigan only to move it a few years later to Atlanta.
good,Great people that you work with.  Upper management can be unrealistic especially during the new growth in number of homes closed vs. staffing.
good,Pulte was a great place to work I enjoyed the opportunity to work with builder and grow in the Home building business. I simply left to take another Job closer to home
good,I’m a good and hard working person get alone with everyone but also takes my job very serious I enjoy to always learn new things and ways to better improve my work.
good,Treat their employees great and a great way to make money but it is not easy to move up quickly. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the perks of working for the company. They have a serious need to improve their operations environmentally.
good,I feel this was a great place to work..  I had plenty of advancements is pay and positions.  Now I am just typing to fill this box as fast as I can  blah.
good,Great Company! Management was poor and the pay was low. I would have loved to stay and work there but management was lacking.  For the amount of work we did and what we had to know iI wish pay was better. You do learn a lot though!
good,"The operations in Atlanta offered full support and a wonderful training opportunity.  You always knew where to go to find the right answer to any question you had.  The upper management team was brilliant and knew their ""stuff"".  Having confidence in your company and product made working in the new home building industry a wonderful experience."
good,"All in all, I enjoyed my time at Pulte.  I was with them just before the housing market crashed.  They allowed too many investors to purchase homes and had many empty homes."
good,"I liked the freedom to work at your own pace at this job, the offices were new and nice and the staff was nice an helpful and easy to get along with. I would work here again."
good,"Pulte is a great organization to work for.  They provide health insurance, and incentives for those who qualify.  They provide additional perks from time to time.  Work hours are flexible."
good,its a really great company to work for It  is a career  path for a young ambitious individual please feel free to apply for the company on their website
good,"This company is a very large company that also keeps the ""family"" culture going. The management is very professional and they compensate very well. The company is always willing to teach and train new employees."
good,I started out as a receptionist for Pulte Group and advanced within a year to an Assistant Escrow Officer for the Title Company. I really enjoyed working for Pulte Group.
good,"Checking and responding to emails.  Walking the houses to make sure its clean and tidy.  Meeting with prospective clients about purchasing a new home."
good,Pulte Homes is a dynamic employer where responsibilities are in constant motion.  Company culture is one of the company's strengths.    Due to the size of the organization systems and software are behind current technology and antiquated due to the lack of ability to change.  Workload expectations are borderline unrealistic at a 50-60 hour week.
good,Good exposure to all lines of business at a Real Estate firm in working in the Finance department as an intern for the VP of Finance for the company.
good,"The company merged with another company and laidoff several Michigan employees in 2009.  Before the merge, Pulte was a great place to work.  I worked there for 10+ years and I enjoyed my employment there under the President of the Michigan Division."
good,PulteHomes created a positive work environment.  Upper Management had an open door policy and I had the  ability to share knowledge among my peers at PulteGroup.
good,"A typical day is showing up to the model early to make sure everything looks great. Meet and great everyone that comesthrough the door. Walk through the model twith the customer, answering questions. I always suggest doing a quick price quote on their first visit. I find it speeds up the buying process. Management was always willing to step in and help when help was needed. I love building communities and seeing families happy and proud of their new home."
good,Pulte Group is very structured organization.  They have many processes in place to monitor construction cycle times and budget overages.  It is a great professional organization to work for.
good,"warranty work was great to do , i always meant someone new and people with different  backgrounds which was cool, as long as you knew what you where doing and completed your work it was a good day"
good,"Management empowers employees.  Given the opportunity to manage your work load and stretch with new responsibilities.  Once proven as an employee, I was allowed to change disciplines and grow in a new direction within the company.  The company hires great employees and seeks to create a positive environment and foster their growth for long term retention.  Some positions and employees are faced with tough work/life balance.  Unfortunately, some managers will take advantage of this and overload those employees.  Benefits and comp are competitive and in many areas superior to competitors."
good,Gave great time to management personal and business life. Did not provide adequate training nor support. No office life was a plus but little understanding responsibilities with no support was a great issue. Very reactive to share holders and upper management issues with little regard to their employees.
good,"Myself (and my team) worked diligently, passionately nearly 7 days a week as our company was very large and we were required to travel both nationally and internationally."
good,My experience with Pulte has been pleasant. Sure it has its demands but the days balance out well and go by extremely fast. Definitely a fast paced environment full of unique challenges.
good,"Communication within the company can be lacking. Workload can be heavy, however management is aware and tries to keep you engaged. Overall, feedback on your work can be lacking."
good,I was contract to hire. Worked with a really great team and learn much information while working with this company. Some days were stress but great team to back you when you need assistance.
good,I worked an 8 hour day as a customer relations manager.  Some days were stressful working with difficult home owners.  I enjoyed working with my peers but management was ego driven which was the hardest part to deal with.  I enjoyed building relationships with the home owners and seeing their satisfaction with their homes.
good,"Room for advancement due to turnover, will promote if upper management thinks you are ready. Good company to work for as long as you get your work done."
good,The people you work with day to day are great but management would say one thing and do something completely different. The hardest part of the job was telling the homeowners you could not help them.
good,"The Del Webb experience was superior to the Pulte experience (Del Webb was purchased by Pulte during my tenure) However, much of the cultural environment transferred well enough.  We were a highly effective, cohesive team that developed a lot of land in Lincoln, Roseville and Reno."
good,"Safe environment, friendly co-workers and management! Most enjoyable part is work at your own pace."
good,"Get all the sub-/trade contractors started on theri home repairs."
good,The management for the most part just left you alone to do your job.  Only got involved when you needed them to
good,This was a great place to work. I learned a lot coming right out of school. All the benefits of working for a large corporation with a small local team that made it feel like a small company.
good,Typical day includes chasing trades to complete work. Schedule adherance. The hardest part of the job is meeting closing expectations and trying to schedule the trades.
good,Excellent company to work for with great competitive benefits. It is a high stress area with things always striving to be better. The workplace culture is good as well.
good,I made lots of money and had lots of fun meeting so many different people. You'll work hard and long hours but the rewards will come in big ways. Good place to work.
good,"Unfortunately, my experience with Pulte was limited as the business I worked for was sold. In my short journey in Pulte, I had the opportunity to know some great people."
good,"I loved my job!  Great company, great culture - very consumer oriented.  One of the few national home builders that were able to stay solvent during the market crash due to their vision of consumer satisfaction."
good,Pulte Mortgage has been in the business of financing the American Dream for more than 40 years. Re-imagining how the business can improve is a daily theme.
good,"In order to be successful you must be extremely organized and be able to  handle multiple tasks at the same tie. You must also be able to communicate well with customers, co-workers and all the different trades that you work with."
good,"Great work environment, the employer is greatly involved with the well being of their employees.  They sponsor an event each month for continued moral in the office."
good,"I work with a very fun and caring team, we are always ready to put our best foot forward and accomplish our tasks.  Management is very supportive.  I love every opportunity to learn and grow"
good,"It is a great company, with great people. The company just relocated their office to Atlanta."
good,"Good knowledgeable people, caring about the business and each other.  Ability to work from home if needed, as soon as job is done. Free lunches four days a week, free fruits and snacks. But decision to move the headquarters to Atlanta forces most of the people out, and it's not likely that culture will stay the same in new place."
good,Since I already had a background in construction this was not such a shock when I went to work for Pulte Homes. I enjoyed working with everyone and would say the biggest challenge was staying on schedule with the contractors and the city inspections since all these new homes had a due date. Since I thrived on challenges it just made the job more enjoyable. I learned a lot about scheduling and staying on top of anything needed to reach the goal.
good,Seems to be a lot of turnover not only in Management but other departments as well.
good,Great culture. Got laid off due to housing downturn. I would have liked to have worked there for longer.
good,Good company to work for. Pleasant working environment as well as co-workers. Good pay and benefits. Must be careful in times of recession because it can lead to downsizing.
good,"Since it is a mortgage company, they do a lot of laying people off based on how many mortgages they sign. If that number is low they let people go which is stressful. I loved working there at first and the workload was well balanced. Now it is understaffed and they want us to produce the same results."
good,"good place to work. Competitive pay. I truly enjoy working here because it encompasses everything that I enjoy about construction, flexibility, accountability and management."
good,"The team I built over my tenure was dynamite!  Well trained, motivated, highly efficient, results-oriented and ability to command 12-30% over the market pricing and YOY growth of 26% from 2016 to 2017!  The culture we built was infectious and the legacy I was able to leave was as a 'Positive Solution Seeker!'"
good,"Very ""work hard, play hard"" atmosphere. Very much a community feel that was fostered by upper management. Voluntary activities that were well attended by all employees"
good,this is redundant. It was 12 years ago. I don't want to answer these questions any longer. I was an area manager for for pulte mortgage. I assisted in the financing of pulte homes
good,"Pulte has a lot of good opportunities, however, in my case, the manager got complacent with duties and did not want to resolve issues, nor does the manager know job duties and kept piling tasks and adding duties, creating stress and friction."
good,There is a good team in place and most people seem to care.  Everyone works towards the same goal and that is satisfying the customer
good,"A fast-paced high pressure work environment, typical of large national homebuilders, where the hard working field staff I was involved with always met tough deadlines no matter what the obstacles. When the housing market was favorable it was a good company to work for."
good,Fun environment but contracts are termed too early. I loved the atmosphere but my contract ended after 6 months of employment.  At the time there was a lot of turn-over and limited training as well.  I have heard it has enhanced those pieces of the company. I would have loved to have worked full-time with Pulte's team here in Colorado.
good,Pulte Homes is a great company to work for especially if you are an entry level construction management employee. They really look out for their employees and families too.
good,"Management is open to new, creative ways of doing business as long as the information is fact based, data driven or improves business operations."
good,"when starting every body says hi or good morning, your tasks are already assigned, I sat in my own work station, I had team members that were assigned to answered my questions and to report to them. I got a lot of team work experience there; very professional management, co-workers were so approachable; meeting deadlines was the most difficult part when worked with multiple projects; working in red lines was fun as well as starting new projects based on existing plans."
good,"Learned a lot, excellent company with good tools and training.  Fairly demanding."
good,"I would get my paper work for all the orders of the week. They skilled me in how to drive a fork lift, how to take orders."
good,Learn to operate various heavy equipment and different type of commercial truck..
good,"Unfortunately, there is not typical day in this company. Anything can change, but the constant is to find a way to save the deal with Pulte Mortgage while making sure that the closing occurs as scheduled."
good,I excelled in developing relationships with field vendors to improve job performance from each vendor. It was tough to keep up with the fast pace of line building. The main reward for my family was the large paycheck! I was sorry to see the housing market decline.
good,Scanned and filed documents. Uploaded files into live link. Researched and coded vendor invoices.
good,The company is the largest builder in the nation. They took care of there employees. I had to leave because I was traveling to far.
good,Great company to work for! Fair compensation for amount of work. Great people....little chance for advancement.
good,"Sales leadership is great and works hard to help consultants reach their goals.  Much of the success of the agent depends on neighborhood but, then again, what are the 3 most important things in real estate?  Location, location, location."
good,"It is an exciting company with a lot to do and being able to make plenty of connections in the job , it is nice to work in a nice environment with nice people."
good,"Great place to work could have paid more, but got laid off."
good,I interned here for 6 months and had a blast learning and being exposed to how the corporate work life was. There is not much to know besides the fact they were a great environment for interns and ensured you understood how the work life is.
good,The best part of my job was meet the home owners and taking care of their needs as home owners. I was able to learn a lot about the way a home is constructed. Very kind place to work.
good,Good place to work but not so good when publicly owned and cuts are made without regard to the needs of the customer. Was a fun and collaborative environment.
good,Pulte offers way too many house plans and options. They have a very cumbersome pricing worksheets that was never correct. I think over the years and multiple employees the sheets have errors.
good,"A good place to work. Fair Practices. Great Management. Good Pay and Benefits. Unfortunately, Pulte Homes has relocated to Georgia. Would definitely recommend a friend for employment."
good,Great place to work unfortunately was laid off due to lack of work in my dept at the time but if i could go back to work here i would return have tried in the past but was not rehired still not sure why as i met all my previous benchmarks but nevertheless it was a nice place to work.
good,"The culture was always fun and collaborative. My boss made working there  fun and challenging. There was always continuous improvement actions taking place, and it wasn't forced  upon you because you were always allowed to challenge the current processes."
good,Pulte is a great place to get training in construction management. I don't know how it's changed since merging with Centax. After 6 years of building houses I was promoted to Project Manager. Good place
good,"People make the difference at Pulte.  They are the best people, but there systems are home grown systems.  It takes a while to get up to speed with their systems."
good,Managers definitely preached work hard play hard.  There were many opportunities for advancement if you wanted it...equally as many opportunities to have a fun time with co-workers.  This fostered growth and collaboration among individual members in each department as well as across multiple departments.
good,My day at work started with receiving mortgage loans to prepare for dispersing.  Assisted loan counselors with ordering credit reports and appraisals.  I also worked as relief receptionist when needed.
good,I enjoyed building relationships with first time home buyers and some of those customers are still my friends to this day. Unfortunately I was not afforded much of a work life balance but it was worth the sacrifice to watch someone open the door to their brand new home.
good,"- My co-workers were great"
good,"This is a great company to work for, they are highly regarded in the home building industry.   They are without question an equal opportunity employer where one could make a really good career for him/herself."
good,"Able to provide ideas to turn a negative envorement into a positive one.  Caos with the home foundations, I was able to save Pulte some money in providing great customer service."
good,"I love this company! They really value their customers and do alot of things to show appreciation. Great culture, and work flow is nice. Fast paced and keeps your mind moving. It was actually a job that you dont dread going to. Everyone is helpful and most dont mind working as a team. Self paced and not micro-managed which was lovely!"
good,"Sadden to hear the news about the corporate headquarters moving to Atlanta, GA."
good,I entered the building business w/Pulte Homes. They did an amazing job of training and making our jobs fun.
good,"I was a Superintendent of a large home building project. My position was to take the home from foundation to the closing process. Scheduling sub-contractors to complete each process of the building of the home. Controlling budget making sure each house stayed on time and under budget. Then working with the city to ensure that all building codes were meant and receiving a certificate of occupancy for the new homeowners to move in. Worked closely with the Sales, and Customer Service departments."
good,Good learning opportunity
good,"Large national company wth many benefits, i.e., advancement potential on national level; management accessible; cohesiveness in staff; stocked kitchen enabled staff to gather and get to know others. Accomplishments rewarded."
good,"This company is fun, professional, and always willing to help. There is a lot of room for promotion. Diverse, and has a nice atmosphere. If you’re looking for new, and exciting place to work. Try PulteGroup!"
good,"Great foundation company, room for growth and next level depends on your customer scores. It was great working with this company, benefits are amazing most of the employees are rooted and been there for a fair amount of time. Pulte Homes is an amazing organization to work for."
good,"High volume, large work load. Must be able to work closely in a team environment. Largely customer service based with an ability to deal with difficult buyers."
good,"Depends on your co-workers and supervision that you deal with on a daily basis.  Homeowners can be extremely tough to deal with, because they expect a custom home and not a production home."
good,"At Pulte you carry a large caseload.  Sometimes is difficult managing homeowner repairs with so many different subcontractors.  Reward is many company outings, trainings"
good,"I enjoy meeting prospective buyers. Very relaxed environment. Good company and good construction of homes they build."
good,Its a very large organization building in over 40 states.  They provided the tools and training you needed to succeed.  Sales is very competitive and rewarding
good,"They have crazy flexible hours and a fun work environment. As long as you get your work done, and put in 80 hours for two weeks, they don't really care when you work to an extent. They have team builders every quarter. But since it's so nice to work there, no one ever leaves. There are people that have been there for 20+ years. It's hard to move up the ladder."
good,"Good place to work. Great culture, work/life balance is mostly good. Employees are able to grow and relocate with the company. Compensation is okay and a great bonus"
good,Overall a great company with great friends.  Would reccomend anyone getting into this field to take a chance and sign on.  They took great care of my best friend who died while working for the company.
good,"repair construction equipment as needed. learned how to work on nail guns, power trowels, plate compactors, jumping jacks, air compressors and generators. hardest part about job was working in the heat."
good,"Fun place to work. Staff and PMs are great to work with, never a dull moment."
good,Lots of hours really didn't care for this company bosses we're mean watching over my shoulders like a hawk. All in all didn't like this job and wouldn't go back
good,"I worked for Pulte Homes twice, both times were very rewarding and enjoyable. I worked for them a total of 18 & a half years. both times that I was layed off were due to a Housing downturn. I would work for them again if given the chance."
good,"Co-workers work well as a team."
good,"This has been a great place to work. The management helps out with projects when the department experiences high volume workloads. Helpful co-workers, great collaboration."
good,"The best personnel."
good,"• Reduced overhead costs by an average of 5 % by holding vendors, and subcontractors to strict compliances"
good,"At Pulte Group, my typical day as an intern would be managing malware and phishing emails coming in the network daily. I would contact customers, regarding the email they received. I also got insight on how the Infrastructure Team works and what they do. I really enjoyed my time there. When I got there everyone was so welcoming and made me feel like at home."
good,Pulte is without a doubt an industry leader. It's been a pleasure working here and the culture is top notch.The innovation and drive to change the industry sets Pulte apart from other builders. As the consumer inspired organization truly does look to the consumers for feedback daily.
good,"Having major lay offs at the moment, but an overall great company to work for. Continuously trying to improve the employee to become a great individual."
good,"The company itself can be amazing!! The individuals within the company are dysfunctional, The company has a lot of favoritism and separation by departments and cliques within each department. A ton of politics, gossiping and backstabbing when I was there. I was not involved but it was extremely hard to turn a blind eye to mistreatment of others. "
good,"I loved working at Pulte Mortgage, it's an excellent company with a great record for doing the right thing for its employees. The culture is extremely laid back and coworkers are encouraged to listen and collaborate rather than compete."
good,This is a great company to work with the managers that I had to work with help make me a better person.  Sharing different points of view and helping with books to read to help me grow.
good,Chain of command was lacking and sometimes you had to make your own underwriting decisions since supr not available. If supr did not like your decision you could be written up. Overall office environment was very satisfactory and ample time given for lunch and breaks. Sometimes we even had to work overtime if alot of new homes were purchased
good,Great place to learn the business.  Easy to be proud of the quality of the construction.  Best land locations.  Best new home guarantee.  Best geographic diversification.
good,"A real feeling of community, autonomy and personal development while producing fantastic results in our operations.  Great software to use, wonderful training, and real camaraderie.  A true sense of team and partnership."
good,Fun place to work where they create activities to allow you to bond with other departments in the company.  Would still work for this company had they not relocated out of state.
good,I really enjoy working for PulteGroup. It is a great working environment and the people are awesome! I would recommend people to work for this company.
good,"Loved this job, thought I would be there til retirement and then the housing market went down. Great benefits and incentives."

good,Company made me feel a part of the team.  We were in it for the team not individual.
good,"Conferred with the underwriters to resolve problems with mortgage applications."
good,I enjoy working for Pulte Homes great atmosphere and great people.
good,Good company for right out of college kids....not enough money for seasoned sales agents due to no inventory. Training was good and benefits were nice...no budget to market though..and let people go for little or NO reason due to budget cuts...always struggling to keep your job and high stress level.
good,"Great place to work even though its very clicky. They build great homes, ones that I would be proud to say I help build."
good,"Very family oriented company. Wide array of opportunities for professional advancement. Management is top notch, specifically in the procurement department."
good,"Great company, great place to work.  Fosters a team atmosphere.  Everyone works hard and seems enthused about delivering a quality work product.  Can be stressful at times, but the rewards are worth the stress."
good,"I would have never have learned all that I know about land development, construction, or how to sell luxury homes if it had not been for the training offered by Pulte Group!"
good,"This was my very first job. Typical tasks changed throughout time as the market changed and housing needs shifted. Great overview of customer service, data entry, membership services, and receptionist tasks day after day."
good,"Learned a lot in the field, great people to work with. Nice bonus when houses were built on time  Many hats in that position, always busy."
good,Pulte provides a great working culture that you are compensated for well - when the market decreases then so does the ability to provide more jobs
good,"Although this was a temporary position, it was a wonderful experience. I was able to see what homebuyers are interested in when looking for a home as well as the types of information to ask about. The Sales Consultants were very friendly and professional; they always informed me of changes or other information I needed to know."
good,Working at Pulte in multiple divisions was rewarding and had met my expectations in every way.  I enjoyed meeting future homeowners and getting to know their wants and needs.  It gave me great pleasure finding family homes that they would build new memories in.
good,"Good place to work, lot of the people were good at their jobs however the turnover was high and in turn created a sense of pressure and challenge for the teams. It's a diverse place bringing good positive environment and a pleasant place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working there,everyday was a learning experience.My supervisor new the job that I was performing and had realistic expectations.There  were day of extreme heat ,but that is Las Vegas."
good,"Great working environment. Lots of good people and management that really does care. Only downside is lack of potential movement within the company. Not to many levels of management, which can be good, but creates a “road block” scenario in many instances."
good,el ambiente de trabajo era muy agradable y se hacia el trabajo mas liviano por que nos damos la mano todos esto hace un equipo fuerte y asi mismo  mas ligero.
good,"Very results driven company and all based on profit margin. They are all about having engaged employees."
good,"It was a place I worked at, it was Pulte.  Fun fun fun please let me move on. why do I have to do this to applie for a job?"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Pulte Homes, never a dull moment.  The company promoted team work and team building, great benefits and family comes first."
good,Extremely talent group of individuals but there is low advancement and difficult for pay increase. It is a nation wide company so they have great programs and resources at your disposal.
good,Provided career advancement opportunities and strongly involved in employee learning and training. I loved the flexible hours and work from home options available here.
good,"The workplace culture is amazing with great leadership. Your input is valued even in a company of this size.  They encourage you to learn all about the other departments including marketing, land, sales and purchasing."
good,"Opening and closing.  Making coffee, monitoring the clubhouse, pool area, and gym.  Preparing tickets for events.  Answering questions for residents and possible new residents.  Copying and faxing.  Answering the phone.  Helping manager with whatever is asked."
good,I enjoyed working at this place. I worked there for over a year through a temp agency. There was not going permanent with this company but it was fun while it lasted.
good,Pulte has many skilled and articulate employees who are willing to go the extra mile to please the new home buyer and make their home buying/building a fantastic experience.
good,"Company really cares about its employees.  Even while working hard (80 hours+ a week), the environment was fun and focused.  They believe in paying for performance.  I just happened to join at the peak of the housing market.  They treated me very well."
good,"Constantly busy"
good,"PulteGroup to this day remains one of the stalwarts in the Homebuilding industry.  Bill Pulte's vision of value, price/value relationships, innovative floor plans, customer service processes, delivering first rate customer service experience, resulting in ""Customers For Life"" is, to this day, one of the many strengths of Pulte."

good,A typical day at work started with receiving loans to process for home buyers. I learned to work as a team player and leader in order to ensure that work was done in a timely manner to meet deadlines. Co-workers were pleasant and very easy to get along with. The hardest part of this job for me was learning a very complex phone system as relief Receptionist that I eventually mastered. The most enjoyable part was cross training that allowed me to learn other aspects of the job.
good,Coordinate and schedule sub-contractors to complete residential home construction. I learned that you cannot control exactly how you want certain parts of a project to go and need to coordinate with others. Management could have been more supportive in regards to some areas. All co-workers worked well together. Hardest part of the job was getting sub-contractors to meet quality expectations and project schedules. Most enjoyable was being able run the project as I felt would best work for the overall output.
good,"Great architecture, great locations. The product is outstanding!! Customer-driven company with friendly team culture and strong management.  Company is positioned for success and has many new communities in the works. Great opportunity to make money! Only downside is working every weekend. Left due to move/relo. Loved working here!"

good,"Greatest group of people I've ever worked with, a great culture promoted from management on down. I learned how to manage people, and how to be flexible when things aren't perfect so the task gets accomplished, but yet at the same time search for better ways to do things. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I worked with, the hardest part of this job was leaving."

good,"I loved my job and working with Pulte homes.  I enjoyed meeting the potential clients, assisting them with any questions, showing them homes, and assisting the sales manager and sales consultants. This was a dream come true job."
good,"I've been with Pulte for a few years as a new home sales consultant. Here in Florida, even an average sales consultant will make six figures. I believe it is one of the best kept secrets that most people don't realize is such a high-paying job... being a new home consultant for a national builder. Pulte has been a great company to work for. They do offer promotion from within. It's very rewarding to help people at such an important moment in their lives, making such a big financial decision as to buy a home. Every day is different, and there are plenty of challenges to work through...  never boring! This job is challenging, fun, stressful, satisfying, wonderful, grueling sometimes, & its one is the best jobs out there. Pulte provides full insurance, 401K with match, life insurance, Vision, Dental, every other benefit that a large company like this does. When you're in the sales department, however, you do not receive paid vacation. That said, the income makes up for a year of paid vacations."
good,Great training program but turn and burn company with LO’s. Pulte group works hard to train but not to retain employees. They overhire and cut jobs when over employeed

good,A progressive company with a splendid visionary leadership core. Direct manager was brilliant and honest. Providing support without removing responsibility was a core value. Autonomy was excellent.
good,"My days consisted of computers, all day, every day. I worked on updating people's software and fixing any application problems they may have had. My managers were so patient with me, and walked me through any issues I came across. They offered guidance whenever I needed it and it was an absolute delight to work there. I loved every single day I was there. My co-workers were so kind and never minded having a casual conversation when they ran into me. The hardest part of the job were the people who were short handed on patience. It made doing the job difficult, because we were feeding off each other's frustration. Other than that, I loved that place and the people."
good,I don’t care to leave one.I have nothing bad to say about the about pulte group. It is a great organization and a fortune 500 company. We build a great house and I would own one myself. Best production build a home on the market.

good,"Great place to work.  Great benefits. Flexible schedule.  Can work remotely at times.  Relocation available."
good,Pulte was a  great place to work. Lots of room for advancement and personal growth. Fun activities and events for all employees. Training and career advancement opportunities were always available. The reduction in workforce and closure of branches ultimately meant the loss of jobs in the 2008 housing crash.
good,I would work for them again locally.  Enjoyed the people I worked with.  Had fun interfacing with customers and clients.  Nice office to work in and close to home.
good,"Strong leadership, smart growth plan and excellent corporate culture that extends out to all geographic regions the company operates in. Commitment to employees, customers and the product is second to none."
