bad,"CEO complete destroyed morale.  He makes decisions that effect negatively for the employees in the company.  Merit raises are not based on your work performance, but are given across the board in very small amounts."
bad,They will not pay you any money unless you fit within their private requirements.  I can not recommend this company to any one expecting to advance. (unless you fit the criteria)  There is nothing more I can say.
bad,High stress union environment tons of management change. Management doesn't follow through. They will over work you and make promises that they do not follow through with. Tons of turnover in management.
bad,I've worked for this company for 2 years and they have been a complete waste of my time. Management and employees are under motivated and lazy.
bad,"Mueller is a big pain!! Their pay is horrible, they have low security, and management absolutely are the worst!! They have only one good lead, but the others need to be given the boot!! They lie all the time and their Employee of the Month program is an absolute crock and bogus; they say that everyone has a chance to be Employee of the Month but it’s not true"
bad,Number of employees does not increase as the work volume increases. The benefits package is just basic. Only a few full time permanent employees are able to take advantage of tuition reimbursement. The opportunities for advancement are rare.
bad,"Hectic work day"
bad,Not a company for advancement. Management has a Serious power trip with no communication skills and even worse people skills. If you enjoy working for 10.00 an hour and like getting yelled at and treated like ——than this is the place for you. The plant manager is a fair and knowledgeable leader. But that’s where it stops.
bad,Excellent place to work if you need insurance. vacation is offered after so many years. Not a lot of room for advancement and the pay isn't great. i would recommend working here
good,majority of the workers have low morale due to the lack of appreciation and comprehension from management
good,"I was given a great opportunity by this company. The job was great, the pay was not so good. They were relaxed and co-workers were friendly. The only bad thin I can say is that the team manager was never at the office. other then that I have nothing bad to say."

good,Mueller is a great place to learn and grow your career.  It is well managed and forward thinking.  The team building environment allows for excellent learning opportunities and continuous growth.
good,"The job needs some structure. The training is not up to part. The accounts are thrown on you without the proper training. It is a nice company to work for however, if the pay was good and training, it will be a lot better."
good,"Most days were laid back and allowing the employee to function without much supervision. Each employee is responsible for his/ her own job duties to get done. Very few opportunities for advancement. If you are looking for long term employment with very little opportunity for advancement, this is a great place to work."
good,Overall a good place to work wish I could have retired from there I got laid off in November 15th they said  there converting over to copper might get called back if that happens
good,"The company was good overall.  The work was steady, and they were good at keeping up with technology.  Their one big issue was pay.  They did not pay well, and were shocked at what other pay."
good,"It was a very welcoming environment for new employees, was able to advance in a timely fashion.  Employees and management were on the same team.  Employer and managers, gave recognition to hard workers and encouragement to the not so hard workers."
good,Need more pay. Great at multitasking and problem solving. There's always work to do especially in a warehouse. Glad I'm adaptive and attentive to forklift experience.
good,I enjoyed working at Mueller Industries but became bored due to lack of work.  At times it was stressful and other times it was relaxing.  The people in the customer service department were nice and very helpful when I first started there.
good,el ambiente de trabajo favorable en tiempo de frio muy agradable en tiempo de calor es insoportable un punto a favor es la cercanía de mi casa solo que el trabajo se ha echo monótono.
good,Management doesn't really respond to the wants of the employees. I have no real kicks against this organization. I spent 30 years there and if my job had not ended I would still be there.
good,I punched holes in aluminum and steel.  Folded aluminunum for medical carts.  I acquired another position with a different company.
good,Me gustaba el Horario que Tenia la empresa ya que era un Horario fijo que me permitia estudiar por las noches

good,There is a lot of hard work involved but they have really great job security and great benefits. The work environment can get really hot during the summer months.
good,Great place to work until our plant caught fire and burned down. I stayed busy but I like being the guy people ask for help.
good,I just loved this job. Everything about it was amazing. The staff helped me feel part of the team my first day. The shifts were good and the overall experience working with Mueller was great.
good,It has been a relaxed work environment that lends to diverse experiences with supporting various job roles.  The most enjoyable part of the job has been helping employees with their IT needs as I enjoy helping people.
good,"Work started early and the work load was heavy."
good,"A typical day for me included: checking on operators and solving any issues they had come up, updating management on the status of my projects, and solving any other problems that have occurred. Management was excellent and always worked with me. Hardest part of the job was making do with the resources that were available in order to complete tasks. Most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to learn new things."
good,"I work 8 to 12 hours a day ."
