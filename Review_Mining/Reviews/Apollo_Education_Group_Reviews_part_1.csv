rating,review
bad,Had to leave because even the owner didn't care that my supervisor was talking bad about me to the clients... she didn't like anyone complaining about her company or too employees
bad,learning experience at the job. Very competitive at times and stressful. had to keep yours numbers up daily no room for errors. Stressful at times. flexible hours. allowed overtime when needed.
bad,"Apollo is a great place to meet lots of people and the people there are funny but that about the only positive I would say working there. The hours are long, you start around 10am and probably don’t get home till 23:00 the earliest. They want you to work everyday single day. You don’t get any benefits like holiday pay or sick pay. You work on commission, a lot of people ended up working all day just to earn nothing. The job itself is boring so you spend your day walking round knocking on people’s door to convince them to sign up for a charity. The staff turnover is ridiculous they is always people coming and going, hardly anyone has worked there longer than a year. So I’m summary I would definitely not recommend working here unless you are an amazing con man."
bad,I loved my job there. It gave me a chance to create a life for me and my son. I am a single mother and worked there for over a year. Something is going on at the top of this organization. I was laid off randomly along with 100 other representatives with no warning. Would have been a great place to stay.
bad,"I had 6 managers over the 3+ years I worked there.  The business model started to break down due to issues with compliance, regulators and public opinion."
bad,Was a Good Job but when the owner died and the kid took over he started liquidating. From that point on it seamed everyone had a target on there back just waiting for when they would be laid off
bad,No promotional growth and the pay is low. You will change managers or teams every season. No stability and no one knows whats going on until the last minute.
bad,"I loved working at UOP but the senior leaders screwed it up and the place became completely political.  People were keeping their jobs not because they were good but because they had an ""in"" with someone.  Senior management especially at VP levels let some of the best employees go because they preferred people who didn't challenge them"
bad,"I worked here for over 5 years during it's most prominent time. It was caught doing something bad, did very little to make up for it, and lost it's positive vibe somewhere along the way. The co-workers I had were great, however, they were all leaving for better opportunities and benefits. Even those who did not set out for a real career, eventually found their path thanks to the educational benefits. However, those benefits were not enough to keep the talent in house. I would fear for my job while watching my colleagues leave, whether they wanted to or not. Education is ultimately what you make of it and I did learn a great deal from Apollo because I always constantly sought more knowledge, and it was there for the taking."
bad,"Apollo Education Group is the laughing stock of secondary education. I worked their for 12 years and they didn't even recognize the Master's degree that I got from them. They are all about the bottom line, student learning does not matter."
bad,"Too much empire building.  Very political.  Does not look out for employees in any of these areas:  education, welfare, benefits, career progression, or input.  Minimal trust in leadership.  If not part of the ""good old boy"" network, you have no place in the company."
bad,"Read the news, you can see all of our jobs are in jeopardy. I work in operations which is the red headed step child of the company. We do all the work the students need us to do and get none of the credit. If you've been with the company for awhile then you make decent money however they make it very difficult to receive any type of raise or promotion in our area. Now is not the time to be applying for this company."
bad,"I enjoyed my work with this company the first 2 years, but the management changed and it became one of micro management.  I was glad to leave this company."
bad,"When I first began at University of Phoenix there was all this talk about moving up the ladder quickly and efficiently.. they have now made it almost impossible to move up and even worse, there have been 3 sets of lay offs in the past 3 years!"
bad,"You would be hard pressed to find an organization with more challenges, out of touch management and margined selling assets.  Cpompany is in long need of drinking it's own coffee."
bad,"Great intentions to do good things but absolutely no leadership at the top and no clear definition of a go to market strategy.  Product offering was lacking and the execution after the sale fell dramatically short.  The reason I came to this company was because I heard it was a great place to work.  Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case and needless to say I was very disappointed."
bad,Short-term driven leadership.  Executive leaders focus on themselves and ignore reports.  Politics thick.
bad,"Across all roles. Cannot and does not work. Even education support staff, video/multimedia support staff have to attempt to function in an Agile framework. That simply is broken. Senior management have read the wrong magazine article then based the entire university's policies upon it. At the time of writing, the company is hoping on attrition rather than lay-offs so life is feagile. If you are a developer then it might work for you but otherwise, unless you can drink the bitter Koolade of Agile to the point where is is a cult membership then forget it."
bad,I enjoyed working with apollo I wish I could have all good never had any problems at all with them they enjoyed them very much stayed with them I dont have any more
bad,Job security is questionable.Yearly reviews are slanted.Favortism is rampant. After the sell off anxiety is at a very high level.
bad,"The company overpays staff because of prior compensation structure. Due to the declining business, it maintains a horrible culture to work in but many employees say they feel forced to stay because the pay is just too good to walk away from."
bad,Too many changes to projects. Upper management and senior management don't know what is happening on the floor. Vision keeps changing because of which priorities change frequently and teams are not able to deliver.
bad,"Also known as the University of Phoenix.  This was a great job initially, but over time it became a horrible place to work.  Work/Life Balance dwindled, upper level management made poor decisions about campus openings, which led to major layoffs and campus closures later on.  Said that numbers didn't count toward performance, but fired and laid off people for numbers.  This company is a joke.  Buyer Beware"
bad,Three layoff rounds in less than a year.  Avoid.  There is a good amount of autonomy working out of the home but no job security as it turned out.
bad,Cleaning in timely manners hard working paying attention to details learning quickly and organized.
bad,Assist students with their finance options for school and continued support throughout their program through phone and email contact with some face to face contact. Assist internal customers. I have learned different financial aid policies as well as other finance policies for attending school. I have learned what not do to in leadership positions. My co-workers are all very much team players and want to assist each other to make sure the students are taken care of. The hardest part of my job is working with leadership that is not interested in improving the job satisfaction and does not take responsibility for the lack of satisfaction across the company.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when students I have been working with for a long time call me to tell me they are almost done and are so excited to be able to improve their career with the degree they just completed.
bad,The company suffered from very poor management The company failed and we were all outsourced to a different company that treated us much better. I cannot recommend this company.
bad,The compliance manager that I worked for was a bit of a micro manager who frequently contradicted her own decisions. This made for a tense office environment. She was not very popular with most of the floor. She was not a reflection of the majority of the managers.
bad,"A job at UOPX is not just a job-- it is more of a cause. Helping students achieve their education and progress their careers is a fantastic and noble cause worth coming to work for every day. The people at UOPX are also great with a fabulous 'family-like' culture. The biggest challenge is executive management and the never-ending, knee-jerk strategy changes."
bad,"Reviewing patient accounts, submitting claims, and taking appropriate follow-up action as"
bad,I can't say bad about Apollo Group but since start to my last day the company has gone downhill and hasn't recovered. People are constantly worried about their job and management is incompetent. However salary and benefits were the best part of the job.
bad,"They have a good idea as far as their training product, but management isn't the best and the pay is pretty low."
bad,"People come and go so quickly there... Organization strategy is incomplete, progress measures are not clearly established, the right people are not held accountable, strategic communication is poor and when the desired results are not achieved they fire the employees lower down the food chain so problems remain unsolved."
bad,This organization is experiencing a tremendous amount of change.  Individuals that are adaptable and willing to relocate can do well.  Constant restructuring makes the stability of employment very stressful for all employees.  Culture varies based on college.
bad,With enrollment down and a less than stellar release of the flagship website in 2014 the company continues to cut operation expenses and headcount. New government regulations and a plethora of  competition begs the questions; where is the bottom? Hopefully one day enrollment will even out and the non-US based business are able to fill the gap.
bad,Political and financial environment make it difficult to engage.  I did work with many people who are talented and smart.  I would wait to see if the organization is sold to investors before onboarding with AEG.
bad,The company has been shrinking for many years now; it's not currently a place for growth or advancement. The benefits have always been and continue to be good.
good,school is very good staff is also good but weak point is mangement.
good,"My Work day would start off with a morning meeting at 8am. We would then be assigned to a car and would drive up to 2 hours away from the hotel. We would then be dropped off in a neighborhood by 11 and would be picked back up around 2, We would then be dropped back off into another neighborhood for another 2 hours. We would have a third neighborhood to be dropped off in for another 2 to 3 hours. We would then start our drive home at about 930- 10 pm."
good,The job changes so much it's hard to keep up with what exactly you are suppose to do. There is no promotional growth at all and the company continues to go through so much scrutiny that unless you want to do the same job for a min for 10 years then don't even bother.  The salary is low considering it's education and they don't pay based on education or experience. There are folks in management positions that are just now getting their degrees.
good,"Heavy phones,faculty and staff interaction. I worked with various levels of staff from Top Executives to students. I learned to multi-task and incorporate managerial skills. The staff was very welcoming and comforting."
good,This is a small company that has a difficult time keeping organized.  I have learned to a better electrician and have improved my problem solving skills.
good,"Culture is horrible"
good,I worked for Apollo for about 5 months. In that time I never knew how long my contract was. There was to no communication with management. If your recruiter knew there was a contact that was going to end and they could find you something perm they won't. To top it off my recruiter said I was considered for a better job and he would help me and lied. All in All it's All about management not the workers.
good,"Good technology - bad management, no clear long time or ongoing vision.  Goals shift too often.  "
good,Vision is constantly changing. There is layoffs and SME's leaving very often. There is no differentiating factor anymore now that they are going on blackboard.
good,You have to know what you are going to teach your students and create worksheets for them before each day starts. Management is okay you have to be in the same academic page with the students teacher.
good,"Very stressful work environment.  Employees worked as a team and were always available to help other team members.  While employed at Apollo I had 4 managers.  2 of the managers were very supportive, available and team oriented.  2 of the managers were micromanagers and not readily available to assist team members."
good,SNL at DePaul University is a great place to work as an adjunct professor.  It is helpful if you learn how their system works.  I am most rewarded by helping students.
good,Became proficient with remote technology as well as teaching students in need of college education. Learned how to employ my proficiency with organization and classroom management to maximize student learning experience. The need to conduct ongoing scholarly research helped me to ensure I was up to date with current health care events.
good,"Although it's a great work-life balance, the is not any stability. Schedules change frequently, constant layoffs or rumors of layoffs, and their is no room for growth or advancement."
good,"This was my first job in Canada. I did the night shift for several months. It was a typical job of a warehouse labour. "
good,"Typical day at work would be to start by checking to see what tasks there are to do before moving on to making sure my section is clean and correctly merchandised."
good,"Started 7:00 in the morning till 17:00.I learned to gland and termenate and install instruments and JB's,pulling of cables and cable sizes.Management was good untill I went to another site on sasol.Got along well with other workers and worked very well with them.The hardest part of the job was to pull big cables.When you finish a cable and it is perfect to know you accomplished something good at what you are good at,that's something I enjoyed."
good,"If you like sales, and can push a product no matter what, you might like it. "
good,"A lot of changes in 19 years, not a great place to be anymore.  Started small, IT grew rapidly with Online.  University enrollment is suffering due to competion.  Overall management is not making good decisions."
good,I don't have any words to say about Apollo Education Group Inc. and about my daily work. I managed teams that produced solutions for the business.
good,"Overall, University of Phoenix is not a bad place to work at all. The benefits are outstanding, the people you meet are amazing, and the hours and location are great as well. Unfortunately over the last few years there have been absolutely ZERO opportunities for advancement and with more and more campus closures occurring, it doesn't appear that will change any time soon. I appreciate everything UOPX did for me and am so happy to have been a part of this organization for so long."
good,Apollo Education Group is positioned globally to deliver education and connect education to careers.
good,I worked here 2 years and I had 4 managers. Good company working hard to maintain market share in midst of growing number of new competitors offering similar products and services related to academic degrees and professional certifications.
good,"It was once a good Company to work for, with management caring about employees and their needs. Over the past couple of years, there were many changes in Management and the work environment was strained and stressful for all concerned."
good,Great organization historically with the right intentions but management is lacking over the years and there is absolutely no work life balance or internal suppport for employees.
good,"Apollo has made a number of changes in their executive leadership over the last two years -- which unfortunately has resulted in moving away from a student-centric work model. Now it revolves around capital gains, and acquiring escalating sources of profit. "
good,FTD is a good organisation to start your career with. I started as a Fresher and promoted to senior engineer with in 5 years. Salary hike are low but work life balance is good with this company.
good,Agency work is work but not ideal for security. The work itself was what I enjoy and would seek the same type of environment in the future
good,"I work with a fantastic team always willing to support one another; not many people can enjoy success without a strong and dedicated team.  Continuous leadership and sales training has allowed me to become a more trusted coach and valued partner to my clients.  I have learned that many sales individuals focus too much on what they are selling instead of listening and understanding their clients goals.  Understanding client goals allows the sales person to find the best solution that will have the greatest impact on increasing revenue, decreasing expenses or both.  The hardest part of the job can be navigating all the internal channels to ensure timely delivery of contracts, marketing materials, etc.  Communicating with your team, making sure expectations and deadlines are known and not being afraid to roll up your sleeves when needed all help put the best solution in front of the client. "
good,not much to say here. apparently i need to write this review extensively enough to continue creating a profile so i will type as many words as needed.
good,"This is just an audit case I did, not a real work. If you are interested in this case as understand the whole audit process, try it. It is also helpful for preparing CPA."
good,The organization seems to have a hard time deciding whether it is a business that trades in education or an educational institution that operates for profit.  I prefer the former but it was mostly the latter while I was there.
good,"I have had a generally positive experience so far being at Apollo Education Group. I like the people I work with, I like my team a lot. The team and upper management is very supportive."
good,"When I left was a supervisor for one of the operations centers. Typical day would be monitoring alerts board, preparing reports and spreadsheet for up and down times."
good,The people that were there are great. But the company has been in decline for years. IT's hard to say that they will be around in the next decade. I do recommend working there still.
good,"A great work experience. Learned a lot for future positions. "
good,"The company has great people working there, but executive leadership looks at the wrong areas to make financial cuts.  Instead of  looking to reduce their technology footprint through consolidation of applications, servers, etc., they always reduce financials through headcount reduction."
good,The people working at the University are wonderful people to work with. The people made it a great place to work even through the most difficult times of change.
good,"it is a good job good management good work environment "
good,"I started working at the peak of the company's success.  Was laid off prior to company merging with another education corporation, forecast may be getting better."
good,I worked Mon. Through Fri. 40 hrs. per week. The job consisted of me reviewing the financial status of my assigned students. I would organize my day based on highest priority student concerns to lowest. I would reach out to students as well as receive incoming calls and emails. It was my job to guide students with how to pay for their education. Assisting them with Title IV Financial Aid Applications as well as helping them to apply for both internal and external scholarships was a priority. If students were paying out-of-pocket for classes it was my job to make payment arrangements as well as collect payments both current and past due. I also had the responsibility of contacting the academic counselor to build schedules for current students as well as delete class schedules for those students that were past due. The best part of the job was helping students to be successful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntled students that were unable to continue their education due to finances. I enjoyed being part of a team and building close working relationships with my peers as well as upper management.
good,"I have learned so much working for this organization. I have been afforded the opportunity to grow as a professional and as a student, and I couldn't be happier."
good,"I worked for Apollo for 6 and half years. My position was eliminated in the latest round of layoffs. In my time there I earned an MBA without having to take out any student loans and received valuable project management work experience in the process. "
good,Enjoyed working with students but no opportunity for professional growth. Managers/Directors not very supportive and lacks professionalism where its most needed. Very low salaries.
good,"Fast paced, high performing workplace; Matrixed organization; great environment for learning and development; The best part of working here has been the relationships made within HR and the business partners we work with."
good,Tracking past due accounts.  Collection calls to insurance companies.  Submission of insurance bills and claims.  I learned how to communicate with insurance companies and negotiate successfully so that all parties are satisfied.
good,"Good place to work. Nice work-life balance."
good,"For many years Apollo Education Group was an environment of open communications, opportunity and growth.   This has changed."
good,"the jobs provided was temporary."
good,"Lots of flexibility, good benefits, and great team of co-workers.  Hardest part was not having more say on what clients we could engage with (very tight restrictions)."
good,The Apollo Group (University of Phoenix) grew so fast that the development of the employees couldn't keep up.
good,"Received and logged client paper documents."
good,The work place has a pleasant ambiance and gives a sense of satisfaction in providing better knowledge to the students.
good,"A typical day at work was going in early and setting up for the rest of the employee. When they got there I would take one employee with me and tell them what my boss told me to tell them then I would pull product to set displays and planograms. I did what my boss told me too. I filled out all the paperwork for him. and the hardest job was taking anchors out and moving the aisles and putting anchors back in, I also enjoyed that the most."
good,Great resources for employee development. My team was one of the hardest working teams that I've ever had the pleasure of working with. I enjoyed my interaction with my team and they were always ready and eager to learn more.
good,Apollo will attract talent to help enhance branding initiatives and contribute to the vision of the organization and subsidiaries. There is a considerable amount of investment in training and compliance standards. Leadership coaches to competencies and MBOs. 
good,"A typical day at work includes placing and receiving calls to potential students, enlightening them on our core values and programs, that lead to enrolling and supporting them from enrollment to graduation. Management is always willing to educate and help advisors.  Co-workers make our work environment family-like.  The hardest part of the job is watching students fall short of their goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching students graduate and knowing you had a helping hand in the process!"
good,challenging and satisfying
good,"It had good food, and a friendly environment. Unfortunately they closed the business."
good,pretty easy but needed more of a challenge...enjoyed the co-workers
good,"This is a great place to work if you want a job and not a career.  The benefits are amazing, but there is little to no chance of advancement.  The culture is afraid of quarterly reductions in workforce which causes uncertainty with future with company."
good,As with any merchandising company. work slows or stops at periods. More contact from managers would be nice. Good for a person who can afford lots of time off.
good,"Loved working from home and with corporate clients, but the instability of executive leadership meant that each fiscal year there were many directional changes, resulting in no consistent growth/development year over year."
good,"Apollo Education Group was a great financial opportunity to help me support myself, financially, while I put myself through Law School. I had great managers through my time of employment to let me have the chance to attend evening classes. "
good,"The company has an amazing culture. The leaders truly care about the employees and work to create a engaging environment. The company offers competitive pay, benefits, and flexibility. However, the business continues to decline, which leads to a lack of promotional opportunities."
good,"Too many management turnovers but the environment was nice to work in. Very nice, up-to-date data centers. Great teams. Very mission driven. Was able to dive into emerging technologies with the lab we had configured. Good benefits."
good,"It's an okay job for the being. You're doing inbound and outbound calling us multiple systems, the job is very repetitive. You're constantly calling the same leads."
good,"A solid company complicated by issues of being a large corporation - lack of clear communication, fragmented teams, etc."
good,"at first this was a great place to work.  They care about students and are a very innovative company,but its just taking them too long to figure our what their strategy is and they have too many reorgs and layoffs."
good,Good ... There is good job training and security .. But very stressful in work ..salary is left camparing to work load .....overall nice for all facility given by apollo group. Thanks
good,"Apollo is een goed bedrijf met leuke collega's,maar ik ben daar op uitzendbasis aan het werk en een contract zit er voorlopig niet in."
good,Great people but private company keeps being sold and resold and new owners are downsizing the company.  Have been both part time and full time faculty only to have each position change requirements after being hired.
good,"The first 10-15 years were lots of fun BUT, afterwards it was hit or miss. While my immediate management structure was great, the company as a whole took a plunge and eventually was sold off. Executive leadership struck out too many times."
good,"Apollo Education is a great place to work, I learnt a lot, smart and talented people, and business really understands the online education space, compliance and regulations."
good,"Smart people, some sub par leadership, and not the best culture."
good,Good Management & Flexible work hrs.
good,The job at apollo the people are fun but alot of drama.my manager once again showed favoritism hauling ge appliances up flights of steps alone all of this in unfinished apartment buildi gs and unfinished houses with construction workers therw qhile we worked having to walk under ladders
good,"University  of Phoenix is an excellent place to work when young and pursuing education. Recent  changes in leadership have its culture trending positively, though it still has some ways to go. The education benefits are excellent for undergraduate degrees and the work is largely rewarding."
good,Apollo has been a great company to work for. I have been apart of their family for over 8 years. The company has had its ups and downs but I have learned a lot. I was able to go back to school and I have been able to move up. The work place has always been uplifting even during hard times.
good,"I had to work for seven hours a day , I worked as a salesperson."
good,"Working at Apollo Group was a great opportunity for me to advance my research and website skills, learn new visualization software programs and work with some very smart people focused on developing educational online tools. Unfortunatley, the sales and marketing department were too aggressively recruiting students."
good,"My work day usually starts early in the morning and ends late afternoon. I am a professional electrician and I deal with various work related to this occupation. Every day in my work is in the various commands. Every day at work I learn patience, perfection, and a high standard of work done.Quite often it works independently. Example the contract.In this case, it organizes the work, reading plans and shall apply to the specifications contained therein. In my opinion the hardest part of the job is always the end of it all in, then, must be completed and maintained in a high standard. But at the end when everything works as it should and you can see how much work it has been inserted it gives me satisfaction .."
good,"Strong leadership and great middle management"
good,part time job as a cleaner while working learned how to clean area quicker but in high standarts
good,Busy working environment with constant coverage of multiple projects involving app development on multiple on-premise and cloud platforms to data centers hardware maintenance and refreshes
good,"A typical day comprised of normal daily activities;  monitoring phone calls and emails for quality, meeting with team members, attending meetings. Things were quick to change and needed immediate implementation with little to no ramp up time."
good,"not bad. ok. "
good,they had promised me that this job was a traveling sales career. Except when i got there i had no money and the company had paid for my ticket to get there. as it turned out it was a pyramid scheme that would not pay for my ticket back from Virginia to California.
good,Job is simple with duties almost becoming monotonous. No job growth or advancement however and annual raises are a 2.5% market value. No bonuses for degrees or continuing your education.
good,The company was in a lot of transition so processes were difficult to keep track of.  Even during that time the people made it a great place to work.  I would work there again once everything is ironed out
good,This question can not be answered at this time.  I am no longer with Apollo. There is not much more to say about Apollo. The company needs a few improvements on how to treat its employees.
good,Great work and life balance. Willing to work with your schedule. Upper management is unaware of the day in and day out procedures and set expectations too high.
good,I received my certificate to drive a forklift. Management was very helpful. The experience with working with paint was a very great experience.
good,Apollo Education Group is one of the world's largest private education providers.  AEG is recognized as a pioneer and leader in training & talent development.
good,"It is a good experience. fun to work. good company.Coworker are very helpful,advising me.I like to communicate with patients."
good,"Good working environment"
good,"Great company to work for, tough times in leadership right now as they reinvent what higher education looks like."
good,AEG group is a culture of dynamic professionals who strive for competitive advantage and excellence.  The constant re- positioning to make stock holders and the BOD happy makes for a stressful workplace where job security is not existant
good,i worked at different locations and learnt many skills during the time i was with this company.
good,1. It was a International BPO sector and it was great to work with the company.
good,"it is a cool jobs for starters your days are pretty much the same"
good,"I had an amazing career of 15 years with Apollo and sadly left on my own terms after having survived 4 lay-offs in 2 years. In it's prime this company offered amazing opportunities for driven, creative employees."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company; however, the job security is not at what it should be.  I worked here for numerous years and it was a good environment."
good,I enjoyed my work there but it was a temporary contract position. Training and co-workers were very helpful and willing to assist.
good,Very nice people and flexible.  I wish I could be there longer.  They are very accommodating.  Management team is very professional.
good,"	Working in a team dynamic with minimal supervision to effectively interact with coworkers and professionals ethically"
good,"Working 10 hours a day"
good,I loved working with the student. Helping the people advance their lives was wonderful.
good,replacing exsisting kitchens and bathrooms to council residents
good,"die Mitarbeiterinnen sind sehr nett. Arbeitsplatz ist sehr sauber, aber ich hatte damals einer Schicht Leiter, der hattet bisschen Rassismus Gefühle sozusagen"
good,"They're a good company to work for, work is on a needs basis though so work isn't always guaranteed. the pay is also ok. There's not much more to say other than get the work while you can and make a good impression."
good,"I would run and work reports on a daily basis.  I also answered questions for campus representatives, management, and team members.  I would effectively research all needed information and provide an answer to the submitter.   I would also quality check work of co-workers on a weekly basis."
good,"This past position at the University of Phoenix for me, was eventful and in the beginning interesting and quite fun at times.  In later years the decisions by some cost many their jobs and great working environment."
good,"No day is typical, but what is consistent is managing resources for supporting Infrastructure Projects, supporting Release Teams and resolving High Priority Incidents."
good,"great people who were fun and easy to get along with,long hours when it was the peak season,"
good,"Overall, an excellent place to work.  Outstanding training in education compliance with regional accreditation, FERPA, employee relations.  Highly versed in data analytics."
good,"My typical day was a 10 hour shift, four days a week.  I was responsible for answering calls both internal and external.  I also made sure that all voice messages and emails were returned within a timely manner."
good,University of Phoenix has provided a great work environment to build skills and get an education. Most employees are pleasant. Advancement at any level is difficult because you have to play politics and work performance doesn't have much to do with it. They play games and create jobs that you will apply for and then they cancel the job after the final round of interviews. It has happened to me five times in the last year. Other than those things it is a pretty good place to work.
good,"Company has been through some hard times / tough changes recently and is trying to recover and be more like they used to be."
good,Good company work for with lots lovely people good team work and great hours which helps with your social side of life to with ok salary. And has good pension scheme. Over the years I have learnt to make world class life saving equipment which I'm very proud of and on the way been given the chance to learn new skills. Company is always looking to improve in many ways keeping up with the market etc but never forgetting there bread and butter.
good,Excellent corporate values - always changing not stagnant- Can be hard to get information on employment opportunities.  A large corporation trying to do the right things
good,"Come into the office and get to my cubical where I log into my phone and computer systems.  Plan on making plenty of outbound dials to potential and current students in an effort to enroll, retain, and support however necessary.  Take some incoming calls of potential student that presently expressed interest in a degree of some sort, speak with them to discover what, why, and how this next step of their life is necessary, and be the expert on the other line that helps them get from A to B while making each decision based on the facts and what's likely best for them.  Hopefully at the end of each day I felt like I just didn't have enough time to get everything done, and that there was always someone calling and needing to be called keeping me busy and causing me to feel satisfied and necessary to the organization and the students lives I was helping."
good,"For profit education has been under heave scrutiny. As a consequence Apollo Education Group is constantly under the gun. The change is constant.
