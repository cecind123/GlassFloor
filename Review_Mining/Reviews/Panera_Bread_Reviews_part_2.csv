rating,review
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread doesn't differ much from any other fast food restaurant. The pay is alright, the discounts are alright, everything is average about the place."
good,The commpany cares about the quality of food that they serve.  change up the menu several times a year.  Customers seem to like the food and are repeat customers.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Panera Bread. On your feet most of the day, stepping into all positions as needed. Great culture - staff became my family."
good,Working at panera is not really my sensory. Although it was great pay for a teenager in high school. Panera came with many benefits. I most likely wouldn't work at panera again.
good,"The management and coworkers at the SLW location are outstanding. Working is always an adventure and it's great to meet new faces. Employee benefits are okay, 50% off on $10 or less and free sodas, coffees, and teas. Small break time (30mins). Worst part of working there is not enough hours and always hiring 10+ people almost monthly."
good,"Panera has been the best restaurant that I have worked at. Overall, management is lenient and there is opportunity for advancement. As a manager, I have developed long lasting relationships with my employees."
good,Enjoy working for Panera very much. When the store is staffed it is fun and exciting to work. When understaffed it is a nightmare. You can promote within which is a very nice thing.
good,Love the job and hours but the immaturity level is astounding. Never in my life have i seen so much gossip that rotates within a 24 hour period. Say something about someone today the person will find out before the shift is over. Other then that it is a great place to management but not worth being a regular associate.
good,Unfortunately not employed in a market with stable district managers.  No one was given opportunities to grow due to the fact no one stuck around long enough to get to know all the employees.
good,"During my undergraduate education, Panera was a place I could return for employment whether part time or full time. I worked there under many managers, all of whom were well qualified and very helpful. They cared about their employees. The corporate interests were less employee-centric, though."
good,Very good place to start off strong. Good wage good food and good people. Though they are strict they do not shy away from kindness and being open to listening to each other.
good,"for the most part, our crew made the work fun.  when on the road you have the freedom of not being under a constant supervision.  The only issue is having to your personal vehicles, lots of ware and tear on the cars."
good,"A typical day at work was long, and tiring, but not bad overall. I learned something new everyday, and the management was great. The workplace environment, and culture was great at well. The hardest part of the job was when duties were revolved around time management such as closing. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with fellow coworkers."
good,They are very helpful with new workers. It's an easy job to pick up and never felt like I couldn't do something. Only issue was with a few management choices but all and all good place.
good,Panera Bread is a very fast paced work environment. There are always customers in any Panera Bread you visit. The work environment is fun and is filled with learning opportunities.
good,"A typical day at Pioneer Gift shop. Was clocking in and start getting my cashiers in. then doing some of the inventory there."
good,"In general, working at Panera is a good place to start if you have no prior experience. The environment is relatively relaxed with an easy dress code to follow and simple tasks. As an employee you get discounts on food, other benefits vary on position. They are very flexible with schedules and thoroughly train their employees. A pretty okay place to work at for teens and students."
good,I loved working at Panera! A typical day at work would include me cleaning the area while it was slow and preparing meals during a rush. The crew was friendly and helpful as well as the management. The most challenging part of the job would be making meals in the time limit of 3 minutes when it was busy. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers!
good,"The work environment is different depending on what cafe you go to but the one on Sunset, WI actually became my family over time. The only really downfall is back of the house was a bit tight and hard to fit threw when other people are trying to get past."
good,penera bread is a quick and fast work place. you have to be able to memories the menu and other parts of the job. there's no time to be just standing around.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,As my first job Panera was a good experience. I learned a lot in the couple months I worked there. My communications and people skills have gotten a lot better since working there. The part I enjoyed the most was meeting my co workers they were amazing and made my job fun even when it was stressful at times.
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread because it was family oriented, I didn't feel like I was at work (even though I was), and I enjoyed getting up every morning to go start my day there. A typical day at Panera Bread started off with prepping for the day in the morning shift, being occupied, and having fun. The hardest part about the job is disliking it and the most enjoyable part about working at Panera Bread is the staff."
good,"As far as food service goes it's not a bad place to work. They have competitive pay, which is honestly the only reason I'm still there. They promote from within most of the time so there is opportunity for advancement if you're looking for that."
good,Overall I enjoyed working here. Coworkers are like family though that does make management difficult because there were favorites. Work is usuallly light hearted but very prodictive.
good,"Provided training, direction, and encouragement to new associates to execute company standards, production lists, and goals. Would recommend friends to Panera."
good,"Panera is a great place to learn new skills and build your work ethics. The overall goal of Panera is an admiral one. They are very customer oriented, and are very focused on creating the prefect oasis."
good,Panera Bread was my first job that I ever had. I attained the job when I turned 16 years old and it has been my job past high school graduation into the summer. Great work environment/experience!
good,"Flexible schedule  "
good,Great place to work with flexible hours. Positions changed daily as to where you'd be working and each day was never boring. Great people and co workers.
good,"With this company you definitely get the chance to advance and try out different skills such as social abilities in the dining room, or working with dishes and even being a line cook."
good,"I worked on the line, making sandwiches, salads, soups, consolidating, etc. The job is pretty much what you would expect in this line of work. You make people's food orders all day, prep food, clean up, stock for the next shift. It is a really easy job but some people get stressed out when we get busy, you just have to keep moving forward and focus on one item at a time really."
good,"it’s a great job for anybody who who like to see all types of people, there’s a wide variety of foods for everyone to enjoy. And also the discount is great"
good,"If you've seen other reviews, you'll know that this place will work you to the bone. The people are mostly good, but some of the bakers are a bit uppity."
good,"Peaceful, organized, proper training provided and nice management. I enjoyed working there full time/part time and liked the atmosphere especially a good teamwork."
good,"Teamwork attitude"
good,"Panera Bread is a very good place of business. "
good,I enjoy working at Panera Bread. I love that I only have to work 45 hours a week and have a great management staff that are on the same page. The only thing I don't like is that right now non of the associates or managers are getting raises. A yearly raise of 5% is out of the question and non of the associates are getting raises.
good,"Pays well, concept is a little hard to buy into as cheesy as they can be, sometimes they take things too seriously. At the end of the day they sell bread, salads and sandwiches. Not that hard!."
good,"I started at Panera as FT employee until I got a FT job in the job field I went to school for. Panera is a great company to work for, I just wish they could've kept me closer to home or at least given me a raise to travel so far, or else I would not have left."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I like it but I got tired of working in a food place wanted something different I also wanted weekends with my kids. Its a great place to work co workers bosses people are really nice. I really like my boss. If you need time off ask for it in advance they are real good about letting you off.
good,Panera Bread is a great place to work. I wouldn't work here if you don't like long hours or working in the food service as the days can be quite long.
good,Panera is an incredible place to work the team work is incredible the environment is wonderful and the customers are even better i would love to have that opportunity again
good,"The job was very fast-paced, and often stressful. Our store was very busy, and often times to many people being stressed. The staff were great, but the job was not very enjoyable."
good,I love working here . Just more Benefits would be nice.  The environment and managers are nice and get things done . It’s a nice place to build potential
good,Great first job. Pays minimum wage but has the opportunity for a lot of hours. Fun staff and flexible schedule. Would recommend to a friend if job was needed.
good,"The company has been very good to me and others, though the workload can get a bit hectic at times, but never did I feel stretched to thin or that the expectations of me were unrealistic.  That said it is still the food service industry and in that regard it can be very demanding both physically and mentally.  "
good,"I very much enjoyed working at Panera for my first job I do not regret, but they limited me in career advancement, and gave me very little hours. I have bonded with many of co workers, but I no longer think Panera is the place for me. However, I do recommend it to anyone who is looking forward to working there. Very great working environment."
good,"The flexibility given for hours really helps when it comes to trying to go to school and work. It reminded me a lot fo Starbucks when it comes to company values and mission. "
good,"Panera was my first job, and I enjoy it! Workdays are always kept interesting and quick-paced (sometimes uncomfortably so), and coworkers are very fun to be around (some bad apples, but you'll have that everywhere you look). I've made solid friends here that I hope to keep for a long time. "
good,"My experience at Panera was really good. Management was always working right alongside all of us, they actually earn respect instead of demanding it. Working in the cafe can be hard work, but the people there make Panera a happy place to be."
good,"Working for Panera Bread is very different from a lot of other 'fast food' or 'cafe style' food businesses. It is a little of both combining the fast paced work environment and rigorous time-management of a fast food place with the warm, welcoming, and relaxed attitude of a cafe. Working days can be extremely fun sometimes because typically everyone has a good time telling each other jokes, doing favors, and being optimistic. I say typically because sometimes these traits a little hit or miss. Because it is a kind of 'first-time work experience' job you sometimes have to work with individuals that don't really care about the establishment or the duties of their job. This is rarely seen in management but it can still put a damper on the mood if not everyone is on board with Panera's Cultural Values or Concept Essences. But if ever you find yourself working with a team that you really get along with, there is very little to complain about. Teamwork, positive energy, great discounts on food, what more could you ask for?"
good,"This job was the first job that taught me how to establish a good work ethic. I learned how to multitask and teach others the steps that are needed in order to get the job done, and done right."
good,Panera was a very fun place to work. It was a great time as long as you were focused and got your work done. Most of the management was good but there was one manager who was awful.
good,Working at panera wasn’t bad. The place I worked at was just very unorganized and I didn’t have a stable work schedule which I did not enjoy. It was fast paced.
good,"Trial By Fire soft of work experience--if you can do it, you will have to at this job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera bread, however it was a fast paced and stressful place to work at. I had the pleasure to have some wonderful coworkers and incredible managers which made working quite enjoyable."
good,"The environment is nice to work, but it can sometimes feel overwhelming since they always seem understaffed. The job felt repetitive which made it hard to enjoy the work. It's the typical workplace that gets busy several times during the day."
good,"Panera is a good company to work for. They provide you with the uniform, which is the hate. The other parts of the uniform you have to buy yourself. The pay is fair, a tad over minimum wage."
good,"The people put in charge, are a stickler for the details, was a fast paced place to learn quickly. Constantly moving around, Friendly group of coworkers. A lot of work and hustle."
good,"Overall i enjoyed working at Panera bread the two years i was there. i started as an associate and eventually got promoted to shift supervisor. All of the classes i needed were provided. Management was overall good, a lot of favoritism though, and most people i worked with spoke spanish. Almost everyday on shift i would have to have someone be able to translate to me what other employees were saying. the GM was also never there so if we had issues we would generally have to solve them ourselves."
good,"The pay is fair, there is advancement opportunities you just have to be in good standing with all the higher ups, management could be better, time off is good, including paid vacation and paid time off, plus unpaid time off, regular over time. The benefits are also pretty good. Overall I would recommend this company, just be ready to work, like any other job."
good,Panera is a great place to work if you don’t like to sit around. The store has plenty of tasks to do so there is no waiting around. Everyone is very nice and respectful towards each other. Panera is a great job and you must be able to multitask and be willing to do whatever is needed.
good,I worked at panera bread in new york in 2012 it was a nice environment and the management was very nice. I relocated that is the only reason i left working with that company
good,I worked part-time here. A typical day will begin by greeting customers. Taking their orders on Point Of sales. Up sale of merchandise. I train new team members about companies system and supported any questions they might have. I enjoyed being apart this team.
good,I highly recommend working here if you are just starting out your working life. Panera trains you in the basics or customer service and helps those have experience for jobs in the future
good,"Its what you make of it, make it work for your life and your schedule"
good,"Great place to work at as a student, whether in high school or in college because they cooperated with you with the time-consuming. Its nothing difficult just have to memorize the way the food served and arranged places."
good,"I had so much fun opening this store. I met so many new people who im actually still friends with till this day. At first my manager and i didnt  get along and we clashed often. But then we got a new one and we got along just great. Shes actually still in contact. It was a great experience. I enjoyed delivery for them. Although i wished they wouldve got their delivery van sooner so i wouldnt have to use my car, and unfortunately i also got a ticket delivery. They didnt have a sign or pass to give me, this was still in beta. besides that i had a great time there, i wish i hadnt left because it was convient to go there after class. But it was closer to home, was not worth it. Anyways, ive gotten a few friends in panera and they have also enjoyed it. So i would say its a pretty cool place to work."
good,I was pregnant the entire time I worked for them and always sick. They were so understanding and kind about it. Worked with me when it came to doctors appointments and calling in sick. They adjusted my shift so I could nap half way through so I could continue to work at 8 months pregnant. I would still work there if it paid more.
good,Team environment. Quickly paced work that requires more of you than just your specific roll. Ability to deal with guests while smiling while serving $2000 worth of food in one hour.
good,Panera is a great restaurant that serves great food. It’s a good place to work if you believe in that type of restaurant and how they run it and make their food. The work environment is super positive and relaxed. I was well received and taken care of at Panera!
good,"Good place to get a start as a manager. Streamlined, great training as an MIT. Good work/life balance. Compensation is adequate and benefits a plus, donating food each day is nice."
good,Typical day could require lots of movement at a fast pace.  The menu changes four times a year.  I don't really know what else to say but it's a job to get you through.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"like any job it all depends on the staff and management "
good,"The job was fine and the people were great, never had a problem with anyone there, but the work you will have to do is kind of backbreaking, on top of the late hours if you close the pay didn't match the work."
good,Good place to work just wasn't a good place for me I like hard labor jobs and making food just wasn't right for me but it was a good first job for when I was in high school
good,"They always gave good hours and a great food discount."
good,I enjoyed working here as a student in college and would do it again if I retire and don't work in accounting. Fun employees and great customers. Very well run company.
good,Panera bread has great food as well as great customer service. I really like their cookies. Panera also had very flexible hour and very easy to work with bosses.
good,decent first job for those looking for the customer service industry. and the promotions are available to those working hard. Its a good company to work for
good,Company has quality food and gives excellent customer service.  Good management and supervisors.  High quality customers.  Store has good location and good reputation.
good,The management team had good intentions but they could work on their listening skills. The environment was very relaxed and friendly and my co-workers were great also.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of hard work and a lot of walking around. However, it rarely got boring or tedious, as my coworkers were interesting and fun people. The hardest part of the job was closing, but the most enjoyable part was the experience."
good,"High energy, fast paced. "
good,I like working over night. It is mostly you and another person baking bread over night. Management is good. The hardest part of my job is not always having everything you need to back.
good,"I like working here because the employees and customers make you feel like family they're all friendly. I also like that your schedule is pretty much how you want it, that helps alot when you have school age children."
good,I lived working here the people were great and we had fun at night.. I defiantly would reccomend working here.. Good good too.. Remebering how to make them all were difficult.
good,Panera Bread Company is pleasant place to work and actually has good food! Meeting new people and learning new job skills contributed to making it a good experience.
good,"Management was great, I had a good team, the best part of the job was seeing the customers enjoy their food and the associates enjoy the job. I learned many things throughout the course of working at Panera, such as time management, leadership skills, and management skills and roles."
good,"Panera Bread holds their restaurant to high standards. Managers make sure everything is super clean and follows regulations, which can be annoying to work on, but lets you know they care about quality."
good,"A typical day when I worked for Panera was talking with customers, and cleaning tables. My mangers were professional. Workplace was a relaxing environment."
good,"Pay is very low, I think standard with fast-food wages. My supervisors were very nice and appreciated their employees. A lot is dictated by the fact that it's a chain company. Customer service experience was not too bad. Hours vary, not 9-5."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day at work is presaging orders at the catering hub, not a lot of different things to do. She thing everyday so it's pretty consistent in that aspect."
good,I always recommend panera to my friends if they're looking for a job. The people that come in majority of the time are nice. Just stay on your responsibilities.
good,I loved it at Panera. My coworkers and managers all acted as a family helping each other when needed. I learned about basic sandwich and salad making.
good,"everyone is welcoming , the customers and the staff i really enjoy working there .A culture of caring. Management really cares about associates. Appreciation is readily shown. Panera is filled with friendly and outgoing people who make you feel welcome. I feel like I am accepted the way I am. Also, plenty opportunities for promotion if you really want a career in food service."
good,"Anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours of set up and then once those doors unlock it is usually busy nonstop. I've worked my way up to an associate to a certified trainer to almost a shift manager. My favorite part of the day is when we actually have the correct amount of employees so we're not struggling picking up the slack from whomever called out. Managment for the most part is good, there are things that need to be worked on and enforced but that's most likely everywhere. Overall this workplace is pretty decent for a middle class restaurant."
good,"A typical day at work is fun and inviting. Everyone says good morning to you when you enter and goodbye to you when you exit. "
good,A typical day at Panera Bread was very busy.  I learned alot from the trainers and managers there.  The management team was very organized and good at communicating.  The workplace culture was very organized.  Every employee played their role and the proper training and resources were available to you.
good,"i prepped food for the customers, was responsible for keeping the dishes clean, was responsible for trash disposal, worked cashier for a small period of time"
good,"Like any job, the people you work with can make or break your overall working experience.  The employees at Panera Bread welcome you and their fun loving personalities make going to work enjoyable."
good,"Very busy environment, have to be able to work efficiently and quick. The staff works together very well. Always kept busy and on your feet. Was a very fun and happy work environment."
good,"Something always needs to be done working here, as people frequent Panera so often. Everything can always be re-stocked & cleaned up a bit more. Be kind to other employees upon getting hired and make new friends. They become your work family and it makes working here feel like the enjoyable community service it truly is rather than just another job. Everyone who works at Panera is nice. Managers may go through training fast upon getting hired. Don't worry, just listen with undivided attention and ask questions whenever you need to. They will always help you happily and you will know exactly how to do your job correctly by doing so. The most enjoyable part of the job is honestly the employees who become your family and making customers smile.... also I really enjoyed taking out the trash because I'll use any excuse to go outside.. like HAVE you SEEN the sky? Felt the sun in your face? MMM GET THAT VITAMIN D WHILE YOU CAN. For real though. LMAO. Panera is really fun to work at. A lot of young people work there and everyone is always cracking jokes back & forth just having fun while getting the job done! Just please make sure you discuss pay rate during your interview near the end so that you are FAIRLY compensated. Ask for $10 at least, they will compensate you ONLY if you ask. Luckily I was, however I know that most of the others who did not discuss pay rate were paid significantly less to the point where I'd say the wages were unfair for the work. Also, you get to bring home the bread + pastries  literally every so often when people don't pick up the donations. They normally"
good,Working for Panera Bread Catering was a wonderful experience. Everyone knew their place and worked hard to make every order perfect and customer happy.
good,"fast pasted job, lost of fun conversations with customers each day. Problems to solve. The food and the quality of food was impressive for a fast causal rest."
good,"The workflow at Panera is up beat, but is very exciting. Your are very appreciated there, and all make sure you know it. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to learn other positions."
good,"barista, cashiering, font line and baking duties as well as opening and closing of the restaurant. Also shipping organization skills and inventory on restock day"
good,Productive all day. Don't mind work in the freezer and the oven to put load and unload food. Nice team-building and good customer service and relations too.
good,Be willing to work stressful hours during the lunch rush. I learned how to work efficient but fast at Panera. Panera Bread is a welcoming environment and allows the opportunity for growth.
good,"I enjoyed working for Panera Bread.  The fast paced environment was something that kept me interested.  I was trained to work several different positions, and worked those throughout my days at Panera. I would suggest to anyone to apply and work for Panera. great company."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"If you're looking for a career in a face paced environment then Panera is for you. I loved my time there, yes days were stressful, but that is every job. The customers were usually always pleasant and so was the staff. The Ohio management teams are one of the best I had the pleasure of working for. THEY CARE. Keep that in mind."
good,To be my first job it was easy to adapt to and simple work any one with good work ethic can do it. Everyone is one your side. And the food is clean and tasty

good,"If you're looking for a job to gain experience on working on a team and helping customers in a fast paced environment, panera bread is the place to learn."
good,Nice job . When I first started working there I thought it was hard but now that I been there for almost 7 months I dont really think the job is hard.
good,"Consistent employment, job security, fair management. "
good,"This was a job i had in highschool"
good,"You had your bad customers and your good, and trust me, your good out shined your entire day. My manager was amazing, but in the ending of my employment, we were given a new manager who was the complete opposite of our old one; very stern and business like."
good,it was cool everyone was friendly and i was constaly busy i had no problems with this job at all I'm also trying to fill out enough character because this has gotten in the way of me finding a job
good,"Panera was fast paced environment, however when business became slow they lost a lot of workers and cut hours. This made them unreliable. However the environment was very calming."
good,Handles incoming calls or inquiries from prospective customers or clients 
good,"A typical day of being a manger as explained to me in the beginning was ""managing people"" ""you're not here to be the best sandwich maker or killer cashier... we have associates for that"" well, that ideology last during training and training only. I was locked in position almost everyday all day. Which would be fine if that's what I was hired for. I was hired to train and develop people into trainers, then shift leaders, then managers. I will admit it is NOT boring, and has great people across the board with open and easy communication, great pay, flexible with hours."
good,"Good people "
good,"work was always a fun place showing up to. I dreading going into work until i finally got there and saw everyone i knew and loved. panera has taught me a lot of social skills believe it or not having to deal with all those customers thinking everything is your fault and handling it calmly. The managers were super laid back but also made sure everyone was doing there job which is a great mix of both. The hardest part about the job was the lack of employees we had which made it difficult during rush hours or when someone desperately needed the day off work.I love going to panera however, the environment was beyond friendly as long with the people. They never failed to put a smile on my face. At the end of the day dont get me wrong i wanted to get out but i couldn't wait to see my family again tomorrow."
good,"Panera bread is a good place to work. You get a 30% discount with any meal, the workers are friendly (at my store anyway). Panera is definitely a good first or temporary job. A lot of the team are under 21, then a decent bit are older than that. It’s a good place to work if you’re relocating due to college And what not. Over all, it’s a solid and enjoyable first job."
good,"I have worked for Panera Bread for 4-5 years by now, and I can say that there is a lot that people can either love or hate about it. For the most part by stories and testimonials from my peers, Panera is a good option for a first job, and I'd agree. Environment is calm, tasks done on a daily basis are pretty simple. Not much is asked of you but to actually pay attention and work."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Come in the night before and prepair and bagels and freash breads and pastries for the following opening morning. making sure that all gold star standards are met.
good,"Working here for me was my first job, while I was still in high school and I was able to not only stay with the company for many of years. I was working for the company threw two different states and multiple positions with in the company in a fairly quick amount of time."
good,"was a good place to work for just got very stressful at times We sometimes ran out of items needed for a typical day, the most enjoyable part was the people that I got to work with, I loved my co-workers."
good,"Customer service and cashier experience may be helpful to work in this environment. Knowledge of restaurants menu needed, including pasteriies and drinks."
good,"The only complaint I would ever have about Panera is that I was working for 8$ an hour even while training people (trainers get 9$ an hour minimum). But other than that, the people who worked there, including the managers, and the customers are such amazing characters. When they say ""Panera Warmth"" that is exactly what they mean. Panera is warm, inviting, and somewhere I will always be able to call home."
good,Panera is a great company to work for. You can guarantee you will climb the ladder if you work hard and help out when you’re needed. I recommend it!!!
good,"At my location, the peak hours are sometimes unpredictable so that can be stressful when we're unprepared. But that's the rush that I really liked. It allowed me a time to shine by being fast and accurate with the rest of my team."
good,"Panera Bread was a great company to work for; I was initially a restaurant associate, typically operating the P.O.S , preparing orders for customers, and then given the opportunity to function as an associate and associate trainer. I trained new team members in all areas of the business within my capacity; food prep per health dept standards, and customer desire, opening and closing procedures, P.O.S standards and accountability, as well as customer interaction/expectations. The most challenging aspect of the position was training and functioning as an associate during peak business times of the day."
good,"Always moving, good manegement. There was always something to do. Never stand around. I would go back and forth from the dinning room to the back and load dishes as well as maintain the flow of the restaurant by keeping up with stock, making coffee, and making tea."
good,"Team was good, franchisee was nice and seemed to care.  AD's had attitudes that made it hard to work there.  One pulled the managers into the cooler to yell at them."
good,"I nice place to work... very busy during the week requires high paced speeds. The other employees for the most part are friendly, you have some that have negative attitude but the group does not allow it to mess up the atmosphere of the work place."
good,"I work there after school, usually in evening, its usually busy during dinner time but usually its calm. Im a drive thru lead and my duties include training and helping my new coworker making sure drive thru time and accuracy stay on top. love everyone there dont feel like work."
good,I would come in and get right to work by prepping food for customers. I learned a lot about how to work in a real workplace and how to work with employees. The management was fun but they seemed to get very stressed very easy and it rubbed off on the employees. The hardest part was closing my line every single night. The employees were great and I was always laughing.
good,"This job had it's normal hangups but I enjoyed it. I only quit due to relocation. I will say you have to fight for raises and they are bad about hiring people in at a higher pay rate then what their loyal employees make. That needs fixed. They are very fair with pto, and holiday pay."
good,"I love this job , it’s easy and the culture is great. The staff is extremely friendly and the managers are cool to. It’s very fast paced though. The managers want you to be able to multi task everything . They believe in meeting expectations and exceeding expectations."
good,Panera Bread is a great location to work at. You learn about different types of bread and that can be fun. Also if you like baking and want to learn i would definitely recommend this job.
good,"Loved my coworkers. Very fun and positive workplace, Always super clean and i never had a issue with management. Hated to leave the business but i always wish them the best."
good,"I truly loved my job as well as the people I work with. Everyone is understanding, nice, and helpful to certain needs. II would really recommend this job."
good,"Working at panera was always varying hours. Trying to get time off was hard when the managers took a while for an approval. Overall, fun low key environment"
good,I liked working there but the money wasn't really there and the room for advancement sucked but for the most past it was good working environment was good
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It is an okay employer that is faced pace. Co-workers are nice to work with. Thank you for the time to do this review I do not have anything I would like to say about it
good,i only worked there for about 3 months. the people there were okay. the costumers were soo nice and respectful. i really miss the food and being a cashier.
good,"Assisted with the running of the store managing 40+ associates along with food prep and customer care. Dealt with food cost, food inventory and employee training. The hardest part of the job is when equipment breaks down and having to adjust and still keep the restaurant running but he most enjoyable is when a customer is happy and comes bake again."
good,"I had a great experience Working at Panera bread, because my co workers were very nice and helpful, they made sure I understood everything that I had to do before doing it."
good,The work environment was positive which made for a productive environment. Management made the environment calm and family oriented. I gained a wealth of customer service experience.
good,"................................................."
good,I have nothing to say. It was a good learning experience and good live long learning experience. Learned how to manage and do a lot of management related things.
good,"Our tasks as delivery drivers were to check orders for accuracy and transport them to customers in a timely fashion. Between deliveries we assisted "
good,The job is great it really gives you a good feel for your role. It also helps you advance your management career and get things together. But for me being and management for years I just needed full service experience to help certify myself with my degree.
good,"I accepted a job at Panera when I went back to college. Although I work every position, I was mainly on the line. Management can be in disarray sometimes but we are a very busy store and the schedules of employees can be hit or miss for what is needed. Sometimes your job can be slow but there is always something that can be done. However, many times you are in a fast-paced environment. Managers, other employees and definitely customers can all be quite demanding when it comes to ticket times so you have to keep pace. That is probably the most difficult part of the job, especially when you are first beginning. The staff is generally very friendly and it is a very nice company to work for but the most enjoyable part is endless yummy baked goods!"
good,It was one of those places where coworkers can either make or break the job. Its a good balance of relaxed and movement to keep the day interesting. Overall would recommend.
good,"Very friendly, great experience, great hours and pay check for the hours i did work. Was hard to keep up with school when I had this job because i would go straight to work an hour or hour in a half when i got out and wouldnt go home till 11 or 12ish. But all in all amazing place to work. If i had another chance at it i would work there and would leave."
good,"Great place to work if you like working with people everyday.  The managers are great about showing you exactly how things are to be done, and answering any questions."
good,"Typical Food Industry Job that has fast pace job environment."
good,"Panera bread is a very friendly company with lots of friendly customers. the work environment is quick paced but relaxed, and allows for friendly communication between associates."
good,i was only there to make extra money for the holidays it was a fun fasted paced environment the people are great and the foo is good i would recommend eat there
good,"Working at Panera Bread has been enjoyable for the most part. I decided to move on because as Night Baker we have to work overnight shifts, and I don't want to do those anymore. The work is very daunting at first but the trainers and managers (bts, bmm) help you create a ""timeline"". They are very flexible with days and hours (except when a lot of bakers quit or are on vacation). Even though the amount of inventory we have to bake gets to be a bit much they will come and help you or send someone to help you."
good,The discounts are pretty rad.  The environment isn't bad and the managers are typically easy to talk to.  It's a good place to work if you're going to school.
good,had fun working there learned how to bake and make fun foods. Early mornings . If your not a morning person not the job for you. Got to eat yummy foods and meet alot of people on a daily basis.
good,coffee and customer service representative taking care of dining room and back area was ok very fast paced environment dealing with customers from all around
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Though it was a temporary job the management and the staff made it a great place to work. The best thing was the ""customer first"" mentality that allowed its employees to make its customers feel very taken care of."
good,"Great experience for my second job, the managers and coworkers were very friendly and there was always a team member to back you up if you had too much going on"
good,"Quick paced environment, very balanced environment was a great learning experience , helped me gain cashier experience which has helped tremendously with my current job"
good,The hours were good along with the staff that worked very hard.  I would work 6 hour shifts and closed with complete accuracy.  I enjoyed the half price food.
good,"I walk in & immediately clock in"
good,"Panera definitely taught me a lot of things that I'll be able to apply to other jobs. It's a fast paced environment and there's never nothing to do. There's a moderate amount of cleaning involved for every position, but it's not hard work. Overall it seems like a lot at first, but once you get used to it, it's a fairly easy job."
good,Prepped items for the next day. Interacted daily with management and customers. Kept up with the cleanliness of the dining room and the store. Had good work life balance.
good,Good first job for high school or college. Overworked/underpaid if working full time. Expected to constantly pick up slack due to staff shortages to save cost. Constantly given tasks outside of job titles. Periods of high stress and expected to maintain constant speed and accuracy even when short staffed. Good coworkers helped to cope with issues involved.
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread. However the problem I faced there was lack of hours. Some days i would only work an hour and then get sent home. Love the food, and the employees."
good,"I didn't think I was mature enough to advance, but I went from associate, to trainer, to now being a Shift Manager. I could be trained to advance more, but I am in school so I haven't taken on that responsibility."
good,"Easy work, similar to most quick-service restaurants."
good,i made sammiches and salads i talked to customers and washed dishes its cool to work but fast paced and a little overwhelmaing at times it was very busy
good,"Everyone at Panera Bread, including the managers and supervisors, are very nice and accommodating. When I was being trained I felt that if I had a question I could easliy ask and be helped immediately."
good,"I loved working for Panera Bread. The only major issue I really had with Panera was the lack of advancement that was available even after working there for 5 plus years. Some times the management was a little questionable and showed favoritism, but that's honestly just human nature."
good,"Most days at Panera Bread were the same as you would expect as a customer, everything was in it's proper place and the routine became fairly simply once you got the hang of the procedure."
good,"You got to learn all about the bakery and how it works.  Work was fast paced at Breakfast and Lunchtime, but it was fun selling customers goodies for the office."
good,trabajo difícil pero muy organizado pero no muy bien pagado.
good,"Working here is chill and easy once you learn, you get paid every week. Can easily get along with other co workers. Depend on your boss can be nice and cool to be around with."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera is a very fun place to work. You make lifelong friends who become your family. The only dowside is that it can be very stressful. but overall I miss it greatly.
good,"Great culture, but the company severely underpays its staff.  The work/life balance is not great, as a manager, you rotate between working at 5am somedays and working until midnight other days"
good,"A typical day at work included waiting for a delivery to show up since they aren't always flowing in, when not delivering or anything concerning deliveries you are put to work doing something else productive (which isn't necessarily a terrible thing), or you clean. anything. The management is good for the most part, but some of the managers don't always necessarily know what they're doing & makes you wonder how they got the job. The workplace culture is great, always a good environment when you have other workers you can talk to & make friends outside of the workplace. Delivery drivers have it easy compared to the other positions as far as the workload, so not a very hard job. I would say personally the most enjoyable part of the job is the friends you make while employed."
good,Opportunity to advance in position. Easy to adapt to routine. Ability to input when needed. Clean environment. Regular training sessions. Uniform dress code.
good,"I have learned a lot from this company, How to manage a group of different individuals by using different methods.  I also learned how to manage my time."
good,Panera Bread was my first job I ever worked at. I didn't know much about the menu so I use to struggle a lot. Bit I loved the people I was working with the costumer are amazing overall great experience.
good,"While working at Panera Bread my main take-away from the business was that it encouraged individuals to take on multiple tasks at once. In addition, it required employees to work together as a team in order to successfully reach the store's goals."
good,I loved working at Panera and the pay was reasonable for a first time job. I chose to start a new job when a better opportunity presented itself and the pay was higher.
good,It's a very high speed job. Always on your feet running around making sure everything it's perfect and ready to go. I have learned so much from them .
good,"Hiring and promotions from within, always room for professional growth. "
good,Everyone is very chill and friendly at the pameras ive been to. Very friendly employees and mamagers with generally pleasant customers. I highly reccomemd it.
good,Panera Bread has a great work life balance. You do you 10-11 hours daily and once you leave you aren't bothered until your next shift. The staff is difficult at times also the managers but on the bright side you still have a work life balance.
good,"Extensive training, and they expect great things from you, just make sure to be ready to work very hard. I developed a lot of leadership skills here, and independence."
good,"Coworkers and Managers are really nice. Great work environment, and customers are awesome. It can get pretty busy, but that makes the time go by faster."
good,I've worked for Panera going on 3 years now & i have had plenty of opportunities to advance and grow with this company. It is a little hectic at times but i think that will be found at any restaurant. Panera treats their employees very well Its just a hard work like balance as a manager and a student.
good,-The thing I enjoy most about the food-service industry is that there really are no typical work days. There are always things thrown at you that weren't expected.
good,"Coming into work, prepping all the food and stuff we need for the line. If I had to train someone the whole day I would show them all the rules and how to properly prep the line."
good,"Fast pace, Learned new task everyday, management was very organized every employee knew what they had to do, and what was expected as soon as they came to work."
good,I loved my managers when working for Bread Co. The job itself could be stressful and frustrating but the coworkers made it all bearable. The only downside was that there was not a lot of options for promotions.
good,Customer service must be A plus. Very busy constantly. Management is great. It is a very strict environment and things need to be done in a timely manner.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera has a nice atmosphere, understanding of situations that happen in life and management does all they can to accommodate the needs of their employees. Working together as a team is the key to success and an over all great place to work."
good,Fast paced fun place to work. Great customers and crew. Management provided good support and guidance and flexibility with scheduling. Iwould recommend working here.
good,"nice place to work, was able to work a lot of over time until a new manager took over, new managers switched every couple of months, which did not make for good consistency"
good,Working at Panera Bread was a great experience for me it was my first job! The workers there were very polite when I started it was a good first job for me. The managers are hard workers and so are the employees.
good,"Loved working here as a baker. Really fun, learn a lot, don't have to deal with customers. Some of the management needs some work. They don't understand the process of some of the baking. They'll want 100 of a certain item but don't think about the fact that it will have to defrost/proof/bake etc and will take some time to do."
good,"Its a fine job. Now stop making me review things. you will get better reviews if you don;t make people do them, especially if people quit these jobs. there is a good chance people didnt like these jobs."
good,panera bread is a good place to work the coworkers always try to help and explain how to do your work the managers are really cool to work with and you always learn something new.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Panera Bread. However, it is very much an entry-level job with very little room for advancement. I have learned a lot about food-cost management and the intricacies of the restaurant world. The management was standard with the typical lapse in character at some times. There is often a poor separation of personal life from the work environment which effects the work habits of the associates. The hardest part is maintaining a steadfast engagement in the work environment due to the lack of diversified objectives. The most enjoyable part is the company of the fellow associates."
good,"Panera Bread is a great fast pace company to work for.  In my 11 years with the company, I have been able to create great business and personal relationships.  This company gave me the opportunity to demonstrate my leadership abilities.  I was the only BMM who supervised 20 cafes at once.  I was able to train other BMMs as well as develop bakers into Baking Training Specialists and BMMs.  The hardest part of my job was to have to be available 24 hours.  Working from home has advantages and disadvantages. I enjoy having the responsibility of affecting product quality, and cafe health as a whole.  I also enjoy developing and maintaining excellent relationship with cafe managers, training and helping people.  Panera Bread is all about team work and putting the customers first. It starts with the owners and ends with us.  Our philosophy is that everything is our job.  There is no such a thing as ""this is not my job"" attitude.  Everything is everybody's job."
good,being it was my very first job i didnt have much experience but this job was the reason i became alot more comfortable with customer service and this job was fun overall
good,"I worked by myself and cleaned both the dining room and all of the dishes. If it taught me anything, I learned to appreciate my Geology degree so much more."
good,"honestly a pretty decent company to work for. there were opportunities for pay raises (not by a lot, but something is better than nothing- right?) & there's potential to: move up/change/or work multiple, positions that better suit you. it was a comfortable (but pretty fast paced) work environment with people of all ages. the clientelle were also usually very kind"
good,"typical day for me is come to work 15 minutes early, read the bulletin board, and start my day. starting my shift included checking coffee's, before moving on to the dish bins, and other required duties. "
good,Bagels and pastry are to be on display prior to opening.  Slicing bread for the production line.  Greet customers as they arrive. Also work in the drive thru.
good,"Personally, I enjoyed working at Panera Bread. The employee discount was a plus and the food was great. It was a difficult and fast paced job at times but with a great team and management, it was always a work well done. the atmosphere was great as well as the customer-employee relationships."
good,"Its very busy location, in fact super busy but always had fun. we always made the day go easy. THE TEAM WORK IS A DREAM WORK"
good,"Assisting the baker in the mornings making sure all baked goods were made according to the daily sales sheet, money handling, making sure we had had enough people working for the day, handling customers issues, food preparation, making sure that the shift was running smooth to be able to meet daily sales."
good,"Everyday I work, I go in and greet everyone, then I clock in and proceed to my assigned position. Depending on the position I will either start cleaning or restocking products. Other associates are nice to work with and management is prompt but helpful."
good,"Enjoyed the time I was there Explain how to advancement needs work and more encouragement. Would work here again. Great work environment, and fellow employees."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to work. they provide competitive wages, with a more relaxed professional environment. Their decision to go clean, provides a newer and healthier alternative to their competitors. "
good,"Good work environment, management can be iffy sometimes, corporate level knows what's going on. Good coverage of districts and different areas for corporate coverage!"
good,"A typical day at Panera is a stead pace of customers in the morning but business picks up during lunch. I learned how to have good customer service. Also, with out teamwork its hard to run a good store."
good,Worked on the production line. Was very busy on the weekends bt management was always there to support the staff and lead the rushes. Positive attitude and good culture.
good,I read a lot of bad reviews but the panera in Newport rhode island is fun to work at a lot of employees are my age 18 give or take. I get 12/hr cause of employees shortage for summer and so does evryone getting hired. It gets busy and exhausting but it's not bad. If u closer u Assisi get free bakery stuff to take home so it makes up for the all the closing work we have to do. Customers are usually nice. It gets super busy after memorial weekend cause of Newport being a tourist spot. But so far i am enjoying the month i have worked here. Management isnt bad either i didnt know they give u random off days when i started so in second week they decided to give me an off day cause i had plans and told me to give 2 weeks notice next time.
good,"Panera was a great company to work for. They offered advancement opportunities to those willing to take them. I chose not to advance because of thoughts that I may lose focus on school. The best part of the company is the culture, they really make you feel like family."
good,if you enjoy customer service and a fast paced environment this is the job for you. Panera spec is strict and they like consistency. They have a very reputable name to the food industry.
good,"Great place to meet new & lasting friends, multiple opportunities for advancement,  paid time off, benefits, discounts on company products. i definitely recommend working here."
good,"Good company, where advancement is possible. Regional manager was awesome. they change the menu frequently and explore healthy options for all entrees. You are awarded for good work ethic"
good,Customer Service was a major part of the job. Everyday it was my goal to make sure the customer was happy when they left. I worked for Panera for about a year
good,"Always talking with customers, making sure food is prepped, and that all parts of the restaurant is up to standards "
good,"Many managers in one Panera, some of which are over the top rude. The work is great as well just about everyone who comes in. Balanced and fun work with good pay and easy raises if you earn it."
good,"You will be doing a lot of tasks, which seems like more than necessary, for small pay. The workplace is fun, most customer's will treat you with respect. An easily trained job, sometimes however, we will be understaffed with un-reasonable expectations. It's great if you need a job that is flexible to work with a hectic schedule, hours can vary and management will work with, not against your availability. It is a job that you can move up with, but it will take a long long time before you move up. The raises are not that great. The food discounts are a plus. The job will require you to move different positions and requires a fast paced learning environment. You are constantly moving, customer's have high expectations. Forgiveness and forwardness is part of the job."
good,"My daily day working there would be preparing the pastry up front and putting them where they belong making drinks at the barista station , sometimes doing cartering and packing bagel up and organizing them for the customer and taking order up in the front I would be making coffee in the back and check dinning room too make sure it clean I would do a little of everything it just depends where I was sign up too be on that day"
good,"Very quick paced and friendly. Many times there are moments were you will feel at home and will adopt the team as a family. So, there were multiple good times remember"
good,Panera bread is a good company and are professional based work environment . They try to do there best to make everyone's life a lot easier and cheaper.
good,I loved working at Panera bread. I learned that I love working with people and that I enjoy a fast paced environment. It was very easy to advance in Panera to associate trainer but you have to apply yourself. the coworkers at the Panera I have worked and were very sarcastic and rude people. they talked bad about other employees and were inconsiderate of others. I enjoyed getting to work with people and learning what it is like in a fast paced restraunt setting.
good,I really enjoyed working at Panera as a first job! The managers were very sweet and patient with me when I was being trained and my trainers were very helpful.
good,"Panera bread is an excellent company with a true mission statement they believe in.  Although there has been plenty opportunity for me and my advancement, I feel that the opportunity is beginning to run out,"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"100% clean food. Fast-paced fun environment. Clean and sanitary. Experienced management. Friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend to one interested in food industry. "
good,It has amazing employees and it is an easy outgoing job. There are many positions that can fit you. Being cross trained helps you with job hours if you need them.
good,When I worked there everyone started off working in the dining room before moving anywhere else. I Learned the menu and went to cash. Cash was better because you always had someone with you.
good,"It was enjoyable. The people overall were friendly and nice. The management was pretty good and the pay was awesome. I learned about how to cater to customers to the fullest extent and then some. An average day was generally busy and a bit stressful. But, it's still a good place to work."
good,"I worked with a great group of individuals and made a family that I could trust to work along side of. It's fast-paced, and demanding, but enjoyable. It was a great first-job to start working at."
good,"I have done cashier,cleaning dish room,dinning room.I enjoy talking to customers,helping the customers with trays of food.enjoy other employeesI work with"
good,I had a great time working there. The hours were flexible and they understood that I was in school. School and distance got in the way of me staying longer than a year.
good,"At Panera ""no jerks"" is considered a rule of thumb. This has absolutely made itself evident in my experience. Our regulars (for the most part) are very kind people who know our names as easily as we have come to know theirs. There is a sense of cohesiveness that makes working for Panera nice. My experience with management has been good. They care about the employees and do their best to accommodate the needs of the work force. One thing that I have found to be a struggle is receiving the hours you requested when hiring on. If there are already enough people doing full time positions, then you will not get full time."
good,Busy peak hours are annoying if people didn't stock properly. Being on your feet 24/7 is something you'll get used to. My panera was very friendly and family oriented.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working behind the cash register ringing up customers or in the dining room serving and busing tables. It really felt like a family, every employee knew each other. Management was amazing."
good,"Management is great and staff get along well. A typical day at work would include stocking up the line to prepare for the dinner rush, in the slow times of the day you will do general cleaning, and closing includes deep cleaning your designated area of the store."
good,Its was a great [lace to star to work with customers service. I learned about be patience and strong customer relationship. Also I knew how to work under pressure.
good,"fun and great place to work at"
good,"Panera bread was one of my first long term job holdings, I found it to be entertaining and worth the effort I put into it. There is nothing like waking up at five in the morning and drinking espresso."
good,"Panera is a good company to work for. Based on the individual General Manager, it can be challenging and fun. Good training program. Ability to move up."
good,Taking customer's orders for their meal & getting it correctly for them.  Daily balancing of my cash drawer.  Very busy fast paced job attending to guests needs & wants. There really isn't a hard part of the job just trying to make every guests experience a great one.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the great conversations & friendships you create by repeat customers.
good,"Its not hard to do any of the positions and if you are a fast learner you would probably moved up to management quickly. If you show that you want to move up fast you probably will. They take a little longer than they should with giving raises but id blame that on the GM being so busy all the time. "
good,"I learned how to work in high stress situations, while also  training new hire employees. I worked out on delivery, where I learned how to represent the company in a positive and professional manner."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Overall working for Panera was a very fun experience. I worked in the bakery section but you can sometimes come across very rude customers. Management was OK.
good,"The staff team at Panera were all very friendly and easy to cooperate with. After my on the job training was complete, I had no trouble performing up to standard. Coming into work often felt like something to look forward to, because the staff there was so friendly and talkative. It felt like working with friends."
good,Panera was a fun and fast paced environment that always kept me on my toes. Being invested in something that is constantly growing is rewarding and challenging
good,Average fast pace restaurant job. The pay is minimum wage and they will work around your schedule.  The only way to get more hours is if people aren't working.
good,The shifts that I worked were mostly nights in the dining room. Management for the most part was good. The most enjoyable part was the customers. My co-workers were also fun to work with.
good,This was a good job to get me out and working. Panera bread trained me to work for the rest of my life and the skills I learned here I can take with me to all my other jobs
good,"A typical work day would include re stocking food that we need, and preparing for the dinner rush. Everyone are nice, helpful and funny they make working their enjoyable."
good,"overall average work experience, busy atmosphere, friendly customers. management style changes depending on location. solo work environment in some locations."
good,"For me a typical day starts around 6, 6:30, or 7 a.m. and goes anywhere to 1:30 to 2 p.m. I usually start with the morning prep, bacon, croutons, saladgreens for the lunch rush. After finishing prep I take a half hour break then finish my day as dishwasher. I am occasionally called up to the front line to help make sandwiches, and or salads if busy. All managers are very friendly and helpful towards the employees.Sometimes the hardest part of the job is when there are too many people on line and we tend to get in each others way. The most enjoyable part is just the relationship with the other employees."
good,"Very modern style. Healthy options. Fresh bakery products daily. almost like a coffee shop atmosphere with food. Free Wi-Fi. Job was fun and easy. The Panera gang was the best part. Great guy running the business in Williamsport. Very family oriented, but I didn't see many options to get out of the store in reference to advancement. Getting into the corporate part looks very difficult, with a lot of travel, and constant phone calls. Iffy. Great starter job or college part time gig."
good,"Great people to work around, management is very flexible with your class schedule and is very helpful. Great coworkers and nice customers for the most part."
good,"The crew I worked with were awesome, The management team was great also, overall experience was wonderful like every job you will have bad times and good times and I am happy to say good times out weighed anything bad"
good,"First I get to work, clock in and go to my designated area which is mostly drive through and start making food when it comes on the screen. But if I work weekends I have to set up my line up which I have to get all my food set up and make sure all the dates are correct and make sure there's no bad food. Throughout the day my managers will sometimes make me do another job as in wash dishes or run food in the dinning room if we are slow. The hardest part of my job is when it gets around lunch time and there's a screen full of food and there's only me making the food with no help. The most enjoyable part about my job is working with my coworkers."
good,The crew is like a close nit family such as where one may slack the others pick up. We work well and communicate effectively to get through the lunch and dinner rush as a fully functioning unit
good,work usualy is something i look forward goign to. At panera he managers make it fun and productove for the employees to work. They try their best to make everyone happy..
good,"You are working in the food business so you will have good and bad customers, it's all how you deal with it though. It can be very fast paced, but slow at times, but you need to be productive. Management is helpful most of the time. Hardest part of the job was attending to each and every customer while also trying to answer the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job is providing guests with a good meal and see them be satisfied."
good,"Overall it was a nice place to work at only if you seek a career in the food industry, other words its a good stepping stone for anyone that is going to school. They are very flexible in their schedule"
good,Good work environment. Nice people to work with. Managment is very good and its is a pleasant place to work. Good cashier experiences
good,Panera is a great place to work for people seeking short term work or a long term career. Management is great and focused on building better workers. The schedule is also very flexible.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I worked here for 2 years. Coworkers get along like family and have fun while working. Management is decent. promotions and raises are available. Work hours vary. enjoyable job overall.
good,Panera Bread was a very nice place to work. A very good experience. Management was okay and good workers. Very clean and professional place. Learned good skills while there.
good,"Panera bread is a busy work place. what I learned is that you have to be a good multitasker, and have a good memory. the environment is very friendly and productive. there are no  hard parts of the job, every task that is asked of an employee is very simple. the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customer"
good,"An average work day would be stressful and high paced, as is normal with food service jobs, but at the end of every shift, managers would make sure to thank each and every employee for working hard. In my own experience, it was the particular store I was at, and the team I was working with. All of us were always treated well by the management, and even the franchise owners would learn everyone's names, birthdays, and keep up with their personal life. We were never treated poorly, but rather with respect that is hard to find. Even if we were having trouble at work, we would be spoken to, and asked how management could help us, rather than punished. Work was hard, but enjoyable."
good,Great places to meet new people. if you are good with interacting with different people this job is good for you. Learn how to make different foods
good,"Fast paced but fairly easy to adjust quickly. Friendly staff and management. Be prepared to be trained in various, if not all, areas in the cafe."
good,"Enjoyed the cafe, such a fun and professional environment.  The managers were absolutely amazing and the associates all worked together as a team."
good,I was able to work flexible hours because I am a full time student and they offered me decent pay with opportunity to earn raises and the workload was not to difficult.
good,fun! Good energy. Family Team work. Home feeling. Great costumers. Great place to relax and chill. Love panera bread. Great store.
good,"A year ago, I joined the team at the franchised Panera in my town when it was opening. I was an associate who, through hard work and eager learning, made it to Training manager in less than a year. The work environment was fast-paced, but the opportunities for learning and growth never died down. I enjoyed working for this company."
good,"great place to work, friendly ppl. They follow the law and create a great learning environment. They work by there standards that they advertise, they are true to what they say"
good,at the beginning of my work experience at Panera Bread the work i was required to do was very simple. Later on catering started to launch and more recently delivery. This addition of workers put scheduling into a frenzy and made doing small jobs almost impossible due to the extra choirs being added daily. I would have stayed longer if it wasn't for all these changes.
good,as long as you can follow directions and have a great attitude you will succeed here. you must have discipline they require things to be done a certain way but that is why they are successful
good,"My coworkers and managers all got along very well! Everyone was very good at being professional and productive, yet still fun and enjoyable."
good,"Environment at Panera Bread is just a great vibe to be around. The food and our clean ingredients always has our customers coming back for more. The management team is a great team to speak to in case you need to speak to them, they care about how you feel since they know you're working your hardest to make that place great. I have been at Panera Bread for four years now and every year gets better. I can truly say that Panera Bread in Greenbrier is a busy place and being on my feet constantly is one thing I know I can do. Panera Bread is a great place to work at and I'm happy I'm getting an experience to do so."
good,I really like the people that I work for and the fast-pace is nice. Costumer service is always hard but you get used to it. I would definitely recommend for a high school job.
good,Most of the people that you work with are teenagers well at least at the store im at. Its honestly fun. Most of the people that you work with know how to joke and be goofy but at the same time work. Never a dull moment.
good,Fun fast paced work place. meeting new customers is always nice. we get a 50% discount on the food there so that is good. Management is young and they are bad at scheduling workers.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Best team I've worked with so far. Great schedule, good food. Very friendly management. Learned a lot more about food prep. Hardest part was probably closing."
good,my review on Panera bread was good just not to many hours I was receiving but the experience and learning how to make smoothies was amazing
good,I mostly did dining room but sometimes they put me on the line to make food. Also met some great people that I still keep in contact with and also was taught how to waiter and bring food to the guests tables without a problem!
good,"A typical day of work would mostly consist of engaging with customers.  As a cashier and dining room consultant, I was one of the people that the customers saw when they walked into the restaurant. Whether I was tidying up the dining room or helping a customer decide on his or her meal choice, I gave them my undivided attention and treated them with both respectful and friendliness.  My co-workers were easy to work with and conducted themselves similarly.  The hardest part of my job was managing the money in the cash register.  The best part of my job was working with people."
good,"In Panera Bread, the employees are treated with respect and kindness. Despite the low salary boost opportunities, it is and environment where you can grow."
good,I work in the Production were I provide clean fresh salads and I multi-task in making fresh sandwiches. I’m working part time as I continue my studies for an Associate’s Degree in Commercial HVAC Service Technician at Delgado Community College were I’m attending in the Fall.
good,The management at the store was very nice and willing to work with associates and flexible with scheduling. Enjoyed working with coworkers as well.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced; one second there's a line out the door, and the next there's nearly no one in the restaurant. "
good,"I have been working at Panera Bread ever since my senior year of high school and all throughout out college without any issues especially in the aspect of scheduling. I was able to work while in high school and work through different scheduling every two months as I finished college. It was easy and flexible to change without any issues. The environment is fast paced, but fun at the same time. It can be stressful at times, but when you start to receive daily customers it all turns into a really nice regular routine with very nice people day in an day out. This job helped me be a lot more social with people and get out of my comfort zone which was very difficult to do back then. Customers can get feisty at times, depending on the situation, but everything always has a solution to it. Management wise, it is filled with different kinds of managers but all who care about their employees. I have worked with 13 different managers in the past 4 years, but all are enjoyable to work with. It can get a little annoying that they get changed constantly, but it always ends up helping build the store into a better place."
good,I worked every position at Panera Bread with an amazing system of managers and coworkers at my back. The people were friendly and allowed for a fast paced work environment. From opening to closing it allowed a variety of duties that never made the work day drag.
good,"I liked working in mornings, so i did stock then prep and worked the production line through lunch. I learned how to work in a high volume atmosphere at in many different areas mostly thru lunch. The management was great always there when needed.the people i worked with were awesome some new a little some new a lot but we always made it thru.training people was the hardest part of the job (at that time) .the funnest part of the job was when management told you great job everyone we had an excellent day and we accomplished this together."
good,Working at Panera was a fun and unusual experience because that was my first job. The year I work their all the employee was very appreciative of my effort to get the job done. The managers were always cool but on you to finish your work.
good,"Get to work and first things to do is greet employees, start monitoring the plant checking that everything is running in the right way. The most enjoyable part of the job is be working beside the employees, supporting and helping them until the job get done."
good,"For a ""food"" job it was very clean since we would only bake or prepare the foods; no actual cooking was done. Many different positions to work as an associate. You could move up or take more responsibility to advance towards management."
good,Great place and people. All employees and management were very friendly and helped new employees learn their roll to become outstanding team members.
good,"Good place and environment but management is always a problem."
good,a great company to work for there are great things happening with Panera bread I wish I was still working there great work place balance and great people to work with
good,"Work is fun. You get to work with many people and learn new culture. you get the chance to meet with new customers"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I worked for this company 10 years ago. I know a lot has changed, but I enjoyed the work. I would even consider working there again if I made more money"
good,I started my career with Panera and it was a great place to learn and grow. The pay was very low for the work being done. Once you have experience you should be compensated fairly.
good,While working at Panera Bread I had several responsibilities and worked well with customer service. My coworkers and I worked as a team to satisfy all of our customers. I learned a lot about how to work with others and how to handle difficult situations. The most important part of the job for me was seeing how much customers enjoyed their experience at Panera Bread.
good,"A typical workday is:"
good,"Starting working at here was an experience.  I went in knowing nothing and was embraced with open arms.  The employees and some management really step up to help their employees to learn to feel comfortable and confident in there new job.  Like all jobs there were some people who enjoyed flaunting there position over people making it difficult to work with them, but there is honestly very few. The best part of the job was the way the employees and most management pulled together to create and excellent work environment."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Panera Bread because I meant different people everyday. There bakery was always hot and fresh. The menu was good and healthy.
good,I loved working at Panera. Great co workers and management. felt like home. Baking the bread and slicing them was really fun. I loved how great the pastries tasted. It was also fun making the beverages.
good,"I worked at Panera for three years."
good,"Everyone is super nice and loveable, the money is good and everyone is always willing to help. Management actually cares about the customers and coworkers"
good,great work place nice team work among each an every one very easy an stable job assessments great costumers service great food supply
good,Take customers orders and make their food 100% accurate. Make Panera Bread an everyday oasis for the customers. Clean work station and store thoroughly and restock stations for the openers the next morning.
good,"Working for Panera has given me great customer service attitude to deliver high end product. I love seeing regular faces coming to the same store because I know we are making it right for them every time! The employees are the ones who make and keep the store running, so as a manager I like to make sure they are upholding standards and yet having at work even if times gets stressful. Hardest part of the job is making sure during peek hours customers are getting their food at the delivered time that want to provide for them."
good,"If you are willing to put in the hours, working for Covelli Enterprises will allow growth and expedite learning. I personally have grown with this company more in the year that I have been with them than I could have imagined. I have learned about food safety, human resources, how to manage a young team, and so much more. I have, however, had to work 55-60 hours a week for the last two months,as we are in need of many more qualified managers. I am only looking to leave the company due to a personal desire to return to my hometown in Cleveland, Ohio. If I were planning on staying in the area I wouldn't even think about looking for another position."
good,"Every morning everyone greeted each other and was really friendly to each other."
good,Overall pretty good.  Labor is so tight from corporate that it drives you crazy.  Never feel like you are growing the business.  Feels like you are driving it down.  Great food.  Good people.  Concept is slipping though.
good,"Panera is a fun restaurant to work in. Highly efficient systems are in place to make work easy. Managers are generally good, and coworkers are friendly."
good,"As a trainer, I had great opportunities to work with lots of different people. I learned how to work as a team in an timely fashion, and how to lead and teach others. The management was always positive and the fellow employees were a variety of people that opened my perspective of co-workers. The hardest part of the job was working a lunch shift. We were always busy, and the pressure was on to meet our goal for correct, presentable, and fast service. Tensions could get high, and team work was a necessity. Getting to provide a service to others, and being able to do it with amazing co-workers was the best part of this job."
good,During tax season it was busy. I learned how to provide better customer service and the management was good.  My co-workers were very professional and it was overall a easy job.
good,"Loved the mindset of the company and focus on customer service. Loved the hiring process, leading to a well-meshing team."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"This was my first job, which I made into a career. The management team that I was a part of had some of the most caring and unique individuals I have ever worked with. Most of the staff had this undeniable loyalty for the company and job that was awe inspiring to witness. It did get busy at times, and sometimes we would be short with each other, but at the end of the day we were family. I most especially enjoyed the unique challenge of having hordes of customers to satisfy and seemingly being able to complete the task. It was as if we were creating tiny miracles every day. At the end of my career though, we did notice a lot of new staff members in place of the familiar faces. This made it harder and harder to get the job done with the mastery we were accustomed to. I absolutely loved working for this company however and will always miss the friends I made along the way."
good,Easy work but you need to treat everyone with a smile and keep your cool. Work can get stressful just like any job. Management is all easy going and the hardest part is handling difficult customers.
good,On a typical work day I interact with many customers as i try to provide a wonderful work environment. I work side by side with my managers and coworkers to get food out to the customer accurately and swiftly. I really just enjoy seeing the smile on new and regular customers when they come into our cafe to enjoy a nice healthy meal.
good,"Everything is fine, I enjoy working with the people that I work with. Not a very challenging job. Show up and work your hardest and you will be fine."
good,supportive management with great personalities. Organized and very structured. Management is easy to communicate with and work with your busy schedule.
good,i had a good time working for Panera bread but it was a part time job and i had to stop working there do to a new baby and the fact that i needed more money.
good,it was great it was fun people are nice great pay great food excellent service the place was very clean good management it was nice it was nice it was nice it was nice it was nice it was nice
good,"It was a fun work place, very team oriented. The management was mostly fair except for some occasions. I learned how to help customers get what they needed and have an overall good experience at our store."
good,Work is usually busy. Co-workers are fun and friendly. Managers are constantly helping. The hardest part of the job is balancing all of the areas.
good,"Working for Panera Bread is a great experience. I enjoy the atmosphere of the workplace and the people that I work with. I am a college student, and my biggest concern was if Panera would be able to work with my school schedule. They exceeded my expectations by providing me with a schedule that didn't force me to overexert myself. Sometimes the busy days can get stressful because there are many time requirements and quality expectations that need to be met, but then again those requirements are what made the job exciting."
good,"Panera bread LLC – Associate Trainer  				"
good,"Team focused"
good,"A very lighthearted and enjoyable place to work. Co-workers are very friendly, the management is very professional and supportive. The work is straight forward."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread for me was good. I expected to be overwhelmed some days but it was okay knowing that I had a team to always back me up. I learned that organization, cleanliness, and hard work really does pay off. Management at the time when I was working there was actually sub par. I will say that a few managers actually did good for the company. I'm sorry but the head manager wasn't truly a good leader in my opinion. My coworkers were all interesting. Some were really vulgar and didn't even care about the customer. The job was simply to make money but I knew who was there to really do good (especially now since I just visited Panera Bread last week and things were in much better conditions). The most challenging part of the job was coping with fellow employees. Lastly, the most enjoyable part of working at Panera Bread was cleaning up and taking home food that wasn't ""fresh"" at the end of the day."
good,"Overall this is a wonderful company to work for. "
good,"Over all, my work life at Panera was solid. The downsides were few, and outweighed by the positives in many ways. My coworkers were so kind, and embraced me wholeheartedly from day one. I learned how fast I can actually run during rushes, how to work on an electronic cash register, how to properly communicate with customers, and meticulously prep food items for service. The hardest part of my job, was interacting with difficult customers(they would take out frustrations on me when it wasn't my fault), being the only one running food to guests during a rush, and not being able to reach items due to my short stature. The most enjoyable part of my job was doing food prep, making drinks, and becoming friends with our repeat customers."
good,"Fun workplace, met a lot of great people through the business.  The food was also fabulous, and we were able to get great discounts."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical work day would involve me ringing up customers, bussing tables, filling the tea containers, and also changing coffee every hour. I learned how to make and also prepare the food that we provide for customers. Management, was perfect they always gave a helping hand, didn't mind teaching, and also was very reasonable. Co-Workers were also very passionate and had nothing but positive vibes. Hardest part of the job would definitely be staying on top of the coffee's every hour while having numerous responsibilities. Most enjoyable part would be, being able to just connect with the customers, they were always very receptive."
good,I worked as a waitress at Panera Bread. I like working for this company because the work was easy. Keeping fresh coffee ready and keeping lobby clean.
good,Fast paced work environment with very little down time.  The establishment kept high standards with cleanliness.  All coworkers were very friendly with each other.
good,"A typical day at panera as a dining room associate or cashier is filled with making sure the customers are happy with their service. I learned how to speak up for myself at panera and to do my best even when no one else notices. The management is great but I would have preferred a lot more hours every week. Being a college student, I can't waste my summer away in my room. The hardest part of the job was when one manager didn't like me as much as everyone else and it made my time there difficult. The best part about panera is the employees. Everyone there is a family and there is no drama between us all."
good,"Panera is a fun place to work. You get to make awesome food for people and work with a great staff. "
good,Great job to work at. Very easy to balance life with this job. Also great management and very great co-workers. Good first job.
good,"A typical day at work would be ringing in customers orders to their requests, periodically cleaning to keep areas sanitized, and stocking supplies so that they are ready to be used when needed. Working at Panera I've learned a lot about respect and owning up to your own mistakes and taking responsibility for things. I love my management, we all get along pretty well, I feel as though our management has a very family like bond with us as employees but when the managerial roles needs to take place it definitely occurs. I get along with all my co-workers, we all treat each other with respect and we all help each other when needed. The most enjoyable part about my job is that I'm really close with all the people I work with and they always make me smile no matter what."
good,I learned that patience is key in the customer service industry. Everyone is different and needs to be addressed in different manners and tones. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing excellent customer service along side delicious food.
good,"I work about 10-11 per day including nights,weekends, and holidays."
good,everything was good from the employees to the customers down to the food. you can tell the customers appreciated great quality food very neat. I love to help the customers and greet them with a nice smie.
good,You learn a great deal about the importance of customer service. Panera values customer service which I found admirable about the company. It is a great company to work for.
good,"Panera is a fast paced environment that offers an exciting place to work. Working for Panera offers you the opportunity to learn many skills, such as multi tasking and guest management. Management at Panera is good overall. Each manager has their own personalty and way of doing things, but all have the same set of standards and goals to get everything needed done. The hardest part of the Job is the nature of the business. Often you will be working will college students and endure high turnover. The most enjoyable part is building the relationships with your regular guests."
good,I thought it was a great place to have a first job at. I learned many valuable skills that are very applicable in the real world such as dealing with customers and providing a great service to the people buying.
good,It was fast pace and fun at the same time. The team members were great but the management wasn't the best. The hardest part is the pressure they put on the employees because you could be closing for 4 hours or only 30 mins. The mangers don't always help you so depend on your co-workers a lot.
good,"Panera is super busy,lots to do and learn."
good,It gets extremely busy during lunch times. Its really fast passed and hard to train new people when you have other things going on
good,"I Prepared food for my shift, I made sandwiches, Salads, Cantering. Reviewing food standards. Trained managers in training and new associates."
good,As a preper I was assigned to weigh out all the meats as well as cut all the produce. I was also a line worker where you put together the sandwiches and salads alike.
good,Got accustom to customer service and tidiness very easily working here. The customers were always kind hearted and thankful and my fellow employees were always supportive and helpful.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I would come to work do my usual routine, set oven, proofbox, make sure to check with closing manager to see if there was an special orders for the morning, and then begin pulling product out of the cooler to begin my days task."
good,"It was very fun working for Panera Bread. You always stay active so time flies by. Management was amazing, very genuine. I loved how they advanced me quickly and appreciated my hard work. A typical day at work would be to take orders, make drinks, make food, wash dishes, make coffee, tend to the bakery, and clean. Management was amazing. Co-workers were good people. The hardest part about the job is remembering all of the ingredients in everything. The most enjoyable part about the job was having so many regulars."
good,loved being around customers that loved it. there was room to grow and training was provided. welcomes the oppurtunity to know more than one area of the company.
good,"Train bakers , do payroll, on call 24/7. i learned all aspects of the bake team and standards. the management was confusing . you had alot of people to answer to. all my bakers were great. and they respected me and counted on me. covering a shift in an emergency . the most enjoyable was the bake teams and there pride in the product they baked for our customers."
good,"great company to work"
good,"A Normal day at work is usually always busy , have to re-stock what people left un-stocked , clean what is visible to customers ,take out trash and serve food. I learned that Respect is key , Manger was on top of everything ,but also laid back. Most of my co-worker I went to highschool with but others was really nice and made me feel welcomed , hardest part of the job is serving everything within a 2 min time when we are busy. Enjoyable part is tasting the new foods we bring in & being able to put a simile on someone face by giving them a great food ."
good,"A typical work day is 9 hours. and the longest you would be in store after close is 10pm. There is someone always in the store 24hrs a day. The management was good, and coworkers where also good as we had a no jerk policy. Hardest part of job getting up at 4am but at least had a quality of life and time to do something after work. Yhe most enjoyable part of job was getting out into community and donating our left overs to homeless shelters and other churches and schools."
good,I worked there during hugh school and I loved it. I worked the bakeery area. You meet nice people and get to tyr all their new products before the public does.
good,Panera is a great company to work for. They excel in food prep and customer service always going the extra mile to give the customer exactly what they want.
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread. I always enjoyed going to work because I knew there would be food there.  My co-workers and I never needed to go out for lunch because our menu was the best there was. I really learned hoe to be patient while working here , because the guest are very particular about what they want and how they want it. Thats never a problem because they always made it work."
good,"Wonderful work environment"
good,"they have a culture called Panera warmth & we strive to treat all our guests & employees with the most respect"
good,"A typical day at work is very busy with many regulars coming in. Everything is made fresh and areas are cleaned well and set up/stocked. Co-workers here are very helpful and all about team work and for the most part we get the job done whether it be an order that was requested to be made a certain way, fixing an order that was messed up, or simply doing whatever we can to make sure the customer is satisfied and that they come back again. "
good,Panera hire the most awesome people and you always have a great team to back you up! overall a great place to start your career in food service!
good,"I would deal with customers, prepare mixed beverages, and use the point of sales system on a daily basis. When I worked in the kitchen I would  work with the other cooks as a team to prepare orders in a timely manner. I enjoyed working with my fellow staff members and my mangers were great."
good,A great experience. I learned to try different foods and how to prepare both Hot and Cold foods.
good,Not much to review.  It was a good job.  I worked there for two and a half years.  So I worked with three different store managers over that time.  But it is a fun place to work.
good,The management and co-workers always made the day go by faster because we always had fun while we were working. We always found time to be able to relax and pause during the lunch rush and be able to accurately give the customers their orders in a timely fashion.
good,This was my first job and I had a blast it was very fun environment easy to understand how everything worked never a moment you would be bored very fast pasted job.
good,"My position was in the BOH (Back of house) and I was to myself because there is only one Prep per day. Not really a difficult part of that job , justcertain things I had to prep was time consuming, I really enjoyed my time there seeing the same elderly people day by day & them being use to me as time flew by."
good,Usually a fair day at work with peak times and lunch rushes but it was not too difficult to keep up.
good,"A typical day at the Saint Louis Bread Company is not too bad in the morning its prettty steady pace and smiling faces. During the afternoon its choatic, if you're not prepared for it."
good,"Love this place environment, we started together as a family. I love the part that I can express my coordination about management all my team and make this environment friendly."
good,My typical day at work was to keep a clean dining room. Help other co-workers when needed. Management was helpful when I was backeup as well as other co-workers. The hardest part of my job was being backed up with many dishes with no assitant. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I had a consistant asssitant.
good,Was able to make pastries and bake bread for when the cafe was in need. Also assisting guests with orders.
good,Working for panera can be rewarding with oppertunities for advancement to manger prositions
good,"I have worked for Panera both in corporate and in franchise.  It was hard for me to give ratings because somethings are better in corporate such as job advancement while in franchise I have found my experience with management to be better, better as in more relaxed, there is not as much pressure but at the same time I feel that because of the lack of pressure our products are not as good."
good,"Panera Bread was a great learning environment with extremely supportive staff/management.  While working there, because I worked every night alone, I learned how to micromanage my own time, problem solve, how to self motivate, and how to effectively work completely independently."
good,"Arrive in the morning check in with some co-workers, check the dining room, then make coffees.  It was slow until lunch then it would get busy for about an hour and a half.  Then after that time it would just a few people here and there. Do the cleaning duties for the day and that would be all for the day."
good,"set up bakery , set bread wall wait on customers. slicing breads for production line"
good,"It was a good job to have because of advancement, but the bad of the job is that almost everyone gossips and it can be a cause to get you fired if the people don't like you"
good,"I worked on the production line, prepping food and serving customers. I loved working with such a family oriented organization. I loved the job because I had a lot of regulars, who knew me and I knew them and they made my job that much more enjoyable. The hardest part about the job was getting the schedule that I wanted. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything else."
good,Is a fun place to work and a great customer service. Very comfortable  location with great management. easy to get promoted if you work hard.
good,"Although I pretty much loved everyone I worked with, I couldn't do the late night hours anymore. I was about to start school and it would have been a disaster."
good,"I found Panera Bread to be a great place to work!!  I love to bake, so to be able to do that all day was wonderful!!  Management are for the most part wonderful, and willing to work with you.  I wouldn't say that there was a hard part, but during the holidays it does get a bit overwhelming!!  A nice part of the job was being able to go out into the dining room and interact with the customers, whether it was handing out samples, or demonstrating how we prepared an certain menu item."
good,"I was opening the store every morning I would have to be there at 5am everyday. I also would sometimes have to bake cookies and bread as well as pastries. it was never a dull moment there. I really liked working with my team and training new associates.  I also was doing deliveries and taking a lot of phone orders, it got overwhelming sometimes but I take the good with the bad and turn everything into a positive situation. I like to back I learned something new there every day."
good,"You clock in and check the deployment chart to see where you will be for the day. Everyone has a specific job to do, but everyone always helps one another. Panera is all about the customers it has helped me with me people and public speaking skills. The management is very helpful but sometimes looses focus on the customers because of money. All the employees work together very well. Everyone gets along and helps out when needed. Panera is generally an easy place to work at. If you decide to become a trainer like me it entitles more work, time, and effort from you. The hardest part is keeping up with your POF's and training plans. Panera is an excellent place to work with a warm and inviting staff. I made many friends and have never had a problem with anyone."
good,"Panera is a great place to work! Management is friendly and do their best to work with you. The hardest part would be moving quickly in such a small space with a handful of other employees, but on the plus side you create a bond with co workers when your working."
good,"The work is not hard, co-workers were easy to get along with and management was great."
good,"- Come into work clock in and get started. Making orders, Taking orders, Cleaning as you go, keep busy, work hard as possible, never slack off"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Days always started by coming in and prepping area for the rest of the night. I learned a lot of different skills like inventory management because i would put the truck away twice a week. Management was pretty flexible and understanding of many different things which made it easy to work there. My coworkers were usually pretty open and really included everyone that walked through those doors. The job had really good bread and awesome stuff to put on it, needless to say my favorite part about that place was the food."
good,"A day at Panera is always fun and exciting. From giving customers their best experience to gaining more knowledge about customer support, something new is always happening at Panera."
good,"* A typical day can include payroll, scheduling, shift coverage, etc."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the cuustomers.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced"
good,Panera Bread is a great company to work for. we are all a family.
good,"One of the first places I worked with food in. Learned how to work the line, met some great co-workers. couldnt ask for a better place to start off in."
good,"As a manager for Panera Bread I worked in all facets of the business, cash handling, benefits coordination, hiring, coaching, baking and food prep. The environment was built around being a team. The restaurant industry as a whole is challenging for families (the saying ""We work when everyone else plays"" was my motto for years) but I have to say Panera respected the lives of the employees and tried to give us some quality of life."
good,"A typical day at Panera starts with bakery and line set up at 4:00 a.m. From there we sever breakfast until 10:30 and 11:00 on weekends, but bagels and pastries are served all day. The busiest part of the day is always lunch. Business always picks up by 12 and its a non-stop flow of customers until about 2 in the afternoon. During those hours everyone is focused on providing great customer service at the registers, and a quality product on the food line while trying to keep ticket times under three minutes. Day-shift normally ends for most employees around 4:00, but before day-shift goes home bakery and line cooks clean and restock for night-shift crew. Night-shift is slower than day-time, but everyone is still accountable for providing excellent customer service owed to each and every single guest that walks through our doors as well as the same quality product. Just the same as day-shift night-shift is responsible for cleaning and restocking for day-shift. Since I've been working for Panera I've learned how important it is to connect with our customers. By connecting with customers we leave a lasting impression that makes them want to come back and see us again. I've also learned that a big part of customer service is a lot of times you have to work with a sense of urgency; this lets our customers know that we are there for them and we won't hesitate to assist with any needs the customer has. At my Panera I work with some amazing people it's really like a family. I'ts a good feeling knowing I can go to work and expect to have a great time while being productive everyone is"
good,I loved Panera Bread I onl left for travel reasons. Panera treats you like family and is willing to help you with anything.
good,"A typical day at Panera is usually busy especially during season which makes the time go by faster. I'm a cashier, I manage the bakery and the barista. What I learned while working at Panera is how to make drinks at the barista and keeping the bakery stocked and cleaned. The management is very helpful especially when things get busy. They always try to help us cut the line or even help the people down in the line. My coworkers are amazing people and very useful especially when we always ask each for help. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep calm when it gets busy. The most enjoyable part of my job is the food and the staff working with them makes it easier to be at work."
good,"I come in and make sure everything is stocked and ready for any rushes, help guests by taking orders, making food, making lattes, helping guests with any of their needs. My management isn't necessarily on the same page with each other. They are all great but with a GM that does not always back up the Assistant Managers it makes it hard to make sure everything is done how it was supposed to be correct. My co-workers are mostly great some don't take the job as seriously as it needs to be taken as to getting stuff done and their pace. The hardest part is just simply with my managers and the inconstancy with their expectations. I overall do enjoy my day at work."
good,My typical day is very routine. My Co-workers are fun to work with.
good,The Growth opportunity is definitely there. I grew from an Associate to a Manager within 3 years.

good,My coworkers were hilarious and so much fun to be around. The management was fun and up beat. Everyone was happy there wasn't a single night I hated my job or didn't want to go to work. This was the best job I've ever had
good,"It was extremely cozy, a place where you would feel at home.I typically walked in, went straight to the freezer, pulled food and thawed it out, then washed dishes, and took out trashes, then I would sweep and mop the cooler, then take care of the boy's bathroom, and then wash boards, ice bath soups, continue washing dishes till all of them were done and closed the store, by cleaning and taking apart and putting the dish washer back together, cleaning up the sinks, taking whatever trash out, sweep and mop the floor and take the soups to the cooler"

good,"A typical day consists of prepping the dough for the night baker, baking what is required of the cafe."
good,"Each day begins with providing excellent customer service to all my internal and external customers whether it is finding out why someone did not get paid or figuring out why hours were not added to a check or why a system problem did not work.  I print all electronic data files related to my area, and all new hire and rehire, electronic data files.  All of these must be checked off our portal, this is done twice a day.  I enter all change edf in the system as well as audit all new hire, rehire edfs. Since we do print physical checks I must ensure that all associates have direct deposit or a pay card.  All calls and emails must be answered within 24 hours.  Any direct deposits that are returned must be turned around that day or any live checks that are returned, I must get the correct address in the system and then overnight check to café.  Direct deposit forms that are emailed to the payroll must entered in the system."
good,This actually was my first job and I loved it. I def recommend  job beginners
good,love my co-workers but did not like my bosses... never had enough free breaks for me or bathroom  BUT I DID MY BEST :)

good,Working hard but still having fun at the same time. Making sure all the guest that come into the cafe have a great time.
good,"Got to work early to prepare the line/food for the day. I had never worked in food service before. I learned a lot about how food is properly taken care of, it was a very fast paced job, kept you on your toes. I loved that it was fast paced it always had me striving to be faster and better.I made a lot of friendships at this job, it was a good place to work. The hardest part of the job was that the manager started getting really pushy and unappreciative of everyones work no matter how good you were, it started lowering peoples moral"
good,"A typical day at work was showing up at 5am to open the entire store by myself. I counted the safe, counted inventory, placed the food order, and prepared the food for opening. I made sure I had the employees I needed on shift and if someone were to call out I had to get the position covered by another employee."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"minimum wage, fun to meet new people."
good,"I am an opener, so at 6 am Monday-Friday I start off helping customers and slicing bread for store use. This particular store is the busiest in the state of Minnesota. Most days there is a constant line of customers that we all try to help as quickly and efficiently as possible. We have a strong loyal regular customer base. "

good,"A typical day at work is very busy.  Panera Bread has so many customers daily.  I have learned a lot at Panera.  I have learned about customer satisfaction, effectiveness, consistency and adaptability.  I have also learned about the sense of urgency.  The management is very friendly and helpful.  They have taught me a lot.  My co-workers are great to work with and I have even met some new friends.  The hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with the difficult customers.  But at the end of the day the customer is always right and I have to go on about my day with a smile on my face.  The enjoyable part of my day is when I help a customer and they benefit from my advice or knowledge of our products.  "
good,"I loved working at Panera, but at the time, their understaffing cause me to be worked more than was manageable. their values as a company are oriented towards the customers as well as valuing a strong work ethic."
good,"I was a Baker, I bake good as orders come through the computers. Most time I get to meet the customer as they pick up their products"
good,"Serving between 60-140 customers personally a day, is always fast paced, and fun. Never the same thing, and always bringing a smile to customers. "
good,"Panera demands a lot out of its workers - in some places you can get slow periods and downtime, but in Panera you have to work fast, and work constantly. This isn't a bad thing, it was satisfying really, but it is tiring."
good,Food preparation the hardest part of the job is rush hour.Learn how to do all type of food preparation.
good,"On a typical day at Panera it would very busy especially on the weekeneds we learn how to cope with customers. Working at Paneras i learned how to make sandwitches,smoothes and lattes. I enjoy helping all different kinds of people Panera co workers are very helpful managment is very good."
good,"My review is specifically for the store I worked for in Worthington, Ohio. I enjoyed working at Panera and was happy to be able to work as often or as less as I wanted since it was a part time job in addition to my full time job."
good,"At Panera I make the salads and sandwiches. I am also responsible for customer interaction when giving them their food. My shifts are typically 6 hours long. During these shifts, I work with 1 manager and about 8 associates. There is great cooperation among the associates and the managers are great with stepping in to help whenever needed. I've learned to delegate tasks to other associates in order to get the work done in the most effective and efficient manner. The hardest part of the job is closing at the end of a busy night. The closing process is very tedious and takes a while. My favorite part of the job is being able to work with a team of people and interact with customers."
good,Growing company in bay area with room for growth. Early morning hours. You will learn all about baking breads.
good,"A good medium between fast food and restaurant. Panera takes pride in making top quality food for its customers. A person who is detail oriented would do well here, especially in food preparation."
good,Panera Bread is a young company still developint it's culture
good,I made friends quickly their and was able to move from washing dishes to being a line cook in a very short time. The food was good and I received a raise within the first month.
good,Panera Bread for the year and some change that I've worked there has been really great to me. I've met a lot of really amazing people who I know are going to prove to be lifelong friends. The regular customers are great people and overall its a fantastic experience getting to work there.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"There are different positions throughout every cafe, so on a typical day an associate clocks in, finds out what position they are in, and begin whatever task that entails. By position I mean: cashier, diningroom, line, dishwasher, prep, or whatever else. When each position fulfills their duties, things run fairly seamlessly. Before an associate leaves, they set up their station for the person coming in after them and perform their cleaning duties."
good,"My coworkers here were awesome. High energy environment. Each day I did a different postion, from being a cashier to table service which is where i would take guest their meals and clean tables and make sure everything was nice and neat. The hardest part of my job was having to get use to closing certain sections by myself in a certain time frame."
good,"As soon as i enter the facitilty i must ensure that all the dining room duties are getting completed. Start off by making sure that all coffes are remade, condoments stocked. Tables wipped down, tables bussed and floors cleaned. Make sure these guidelines are followed throught the shift. Serve food to customers and make sure all their order is completed. When working in the dining room area, i have learned to properly serve a customer and maintain a well organized place. Management is very helpful and ontop of your duties. They will pick up on any work that has been done wrong or any improper customer service. They will make sure you do not make their Cafe look bad. The co-workers will work as a team and will not hesitate to go an extra mile. However they are all young adults there and love to gossip about each other. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is keeping all customers happy."
good,"nice place cheap, and well expensive. Overall it was a fun experience"
good,"A typical day at work would include working at the cash register, greeting customers and taking their orders, as well as addressing any problems or complains they may have had. I would clean during my shift to make sure the area looked presentable, for example; mopping, sweeping, wiping down counters etc. I learned to better my customer service and how to make customers feel welcomed. All my co-workers were similar in age, and we all got along very well. It was not a hard job, it was enjoyable and for the most part laid back."
good,Panera Bread involved alot of constant moving and was quite busy. The work was difficult. I learned how to interact with customers and time management. Interactions with the co-workers was the most enjoyable part. Individuals calling off and a lack of some organization made it difficult at times.
good,"Throughout my year and months at Panera I was able to gain so much more knowledge of the business aspect of what it means to have a job. I was one of the first associate trainers hired at Panera Bread and I knew then that I loved it there. The people there are very friendly, outgoing, personable, and overall just a warm place to work. Although we can get busy at times and the stress mounted on us, we still find a way to cope with it and handle it professionally."

good,"A typical day at work will be making the food, serving, and cashiering, making sure the customers not waiting for their food for a long period of time, making sure the line is stock and ready for a big rush, making sure the store is clean and coffee is being changed on time. the management is great co-workers are friendly. hardest part about the this job is making learning all of the breads and whats the differences between them, the most enjoyable part about this job is getting new soups for the holidays and we be the first to try them."
good,"Panera was a neat place to work, and it allowed me the opportunity to work on my leadership and managerial skills. The management trusted me, so I was often put in charge of my fellow staff members. I was also able to have some of the responsibilities of the upper level staff and that was very enjoyable. Most days there were busy, but I enjoyed the fast-paced work environment."

good,"Panera Bread was a fun, fast paced job. Working with the public helped me begin to build my customer service skills."
good,"I get to work about 420am and if there is a manager there I go ahead an knock on the window so he/she or one of the bakers can open the door for me or else I wait until a manager gets there and we walk in together. First thing i do when I walk in is clock in, followed by turning on the toaster and checking the mini cooler to see how much fruit I need to get from the cooler to cut and how much orange juice I need as well. I then head to the back put my hat an apron on head toward the cooler. In the cooler I grab what I need for fruit, orange juice, apple juice, and milk. Before leaving the back I also grab a cutting board and knife. And as always a cut glove. I love being there so bright and early an getting things ready for the day. I also like when which ever Manager I open with is very Positive about the day and towards me. I put a lot of work in and have only ever been identified by one Manager and he is new. I have learned how to make espresso drinks and smoothies which is pretty relaxing. My Co-workers are great people, but to be honest love to stand around an talk and most of the time arent very helpful even when there is a line. The hardest part of my job I would have to say is dealing with the ""very elderly"" people who are just having a bad day and they want their bagel or toast toasted and on that day the toaster decides to throw one of it usual misfits an burn almost anything that goes through it. An you put it in your a second on the top and spin it around an take it out and ask them how it is they said oh no little darker. So when you put it back in the toaster you"

good,"this is my first job here in the u.s and they believed in me, and hired me and they totally treat me as the valuable worker that i am."
good,"I've been with Panera for 9 years. The hours can be tough at times, but overall a great company to work for. It's a family environment, the relationships you gain from employees and customers can go a long way. It makes it fun to go into work. I've been managing for 4 years now and it has been a great experience. The knowledge gained with Panera has been profound. If seeking a manager position, you'll have a sub-roll of either inventory, labor or training specialist. There culture values and beliefs are strong and will continue to grow as they prosper within the food sector."
good,panera bread was a hard working but fun place to work for. the customers and employees form friendships.
good,"Fun, delicious and creative work environment. Enjoyed the customers dearly"

good,"A fun and extremely fast paced place to work. Workers that show their ability to do the job accordingly have a good chance to move up to management, however, the reward factor is slim. Although the pace can be fast and never slowing, every employee is trained at multiple stations during their first few weeks, which makes it very easy to jump into any position when the time is needed."
good,"Great cultural values and concept esscense, fun place to work. Everyday oasis for guests, guest service priority."

good,"The people are warm and friendly, enjoy coming to work, and are very helpful. Quick to make you feel welcome and right at home."
good,Good company to work for definitely room for promotions and moving on to something different if u want. Great compensation for in store work and out when driving.
good,The customers are the real benefit.  Rush hours are brisk and demanding but fulfilling. Solid work ethics are often lacking in coworkers. Plenty of opportunity of you want to app;y yourself and move into management.
good,"Love working there but some of the worker are getting more hours when others are getting less, because the one that do there job well leave earlier because of work ethic and the ones that don't  get to  stay longer  so they find a way to fix hours for Management benefits and not based on work ethic."
good,Panera is a good place to work on only thing is that one week u can get the full 40 hours nexy week u only get from 20-30. It will almost never be the same hours each week. Unless manager or opener. Overall a very good place to work for.

good,"The delivery driver position is a relatively laid back gig. That's not to say there isn't work to do around the cafe, but there's a certain amount of freedom that comes with being a driver. Easily the best part of the job is getting to drive around town. When deliveries are high, the day moves along quickly. Management is fair, too. Our supervisors are friendly and respectful. It's a work culture I don't mind being in."
good,every one was friendly it was fast pace some mangers were good some lazy but overall a good place to work. a typical day was working on the line or in the beginning i set up the line .
good,Consistently busy improving and updating cafe operations to ensure customer satisfaction with the least  cafe / customer friction as possible. Family like environment within each team building each other up and improving processes to achieve deadlines and goals.
good,Panera is so fun & diverse. I love the people I worked with as well as the happy guests we attended to. We have a lot of regulars that come in on a daily basis & we all develop great relationships with them. They always decorate for the holidays & make work a fun learning experience. We had staff meetings every few months to point out areas we needed to work on as a team & to acknowledge employees that always exceed expectations. Management was great they were always so understanding open to listen to ideas.
good,"Panera bread is over all a fun place to work and a great first job, it has it rough spots but the management and General manager take care of you and treat you as a family!"

good,Panera bread corporate has a very well rounded and balanced format.  They are great at balancing your work and home life.  The only thing that affected work life at Panera was the location.  Being in New York City can tend to push the boundaries more as it’s a city with higher demands than most suburban areas
good,"The job is awesome, I do alot there, work very hard too. I just feel that the hourly wage could be more considering I work for a million dollar company...I'm pretty sure they can afford to pay us little guys more than just $10/hr and give us full benefits,  not selective benefits. There's good people that work hard everyday here."
good,Got this job while in high school and it allowed the flexibility to attend school as well as work full time. Great overall environment to work in with friendly people working and shopping their!

good,I worked at Panera Bread in California and loved working there. I learned a lot of beneficial lessons while i was employed with this company. Their food was also very tasty
good,"I learned how to truly work with a team while I was at Panera. If one thing got messed up from the register, the entire line and the rest of the staff would get messed up too. Working at Panera helped me better understand how a workplace should perform. I had great experiences working with the staff."
good,It was a very pleasant experience!!  Management was great and easy to work with. They made it a fun environment and I actually enjoyed going to work every day
good,"I absolutely loved the work environment at Panera. I learned how to make food, work drive-thru, cash register, dining room, and dish room. Everyone helped everyone while working, it was a very collaborative environment."
good,"Management was strict but it is because they want every employee to do their best. Also, the hardest time of day to be working there is during the breakfast and lunch rushes but besides that, it is a relatively easy job environment"

good,"I'm a very bubbly person so I enjoyed talking to many customers and providing thr best experience possible. I worked hard with the staff to make breakfast , lunch and dinner move thoughouly through the day."
good,"Panera, or Saint Louis Bread Company, is a company that is welcome to everyone. If there was ever a first job to have, this would be it."
good,"It's a job. Micromanaging is most alive here with AMs and the M, but overall the staff is inviting and easily relatable. Jokes are thrown around,laughs are had,  yet when the breakfast/lunch/dinner dash comes in, everyone is communicating as a team. The main negative I have is that I've been told to close the dining instead of taking deliveries. Though I was told how would assist in the dining area, I was. Ot told closing duties."
good,Great place to work everyone is on the same page awesome food awesome people.....sometimes stressful but mostly laid back management was great cared about employees
good,Average job for teens. Management is great. Job is easy coworkers are friendly. Pay is terrible. Experience is not necessary. Perfect entry level job.
good,"My responsibilities involved assisting the GM with café operations. I also was responsible for food cost.. which included truck orders, inventory management, and keeping track of bakery product numbers. "
good,"Working at panera was super fun because of the relationship between all of the coworkers and the managers, there was never a dull moment at panera bread."
good,A great place to work with good food and a good environment. The Constant management changes confused me and many other people on what policies would be carried over from the past manager. I was also promised a raise three separate times before finally getting a 0.25 raise after I had informed them I was looking for another job.
good,"i went to work today,things went smooth,i cleaned up a bit and got a huse tip!. today has been great so far the hardest part is dropping food ,now i have to clean that too."

good,I have worked at panera Bread now for almost three years and I am still happy with my job there.  It’s pretty good money working part time as a college student and they work well with my schedule.
good,you get the hours but the pay isn't great. work/life balance is ok. other co-workers are supportive.   lunch is challenging.  Sometimes I sweat so much. You wonder if its worth it.
good,"All in all I really liked work at Panera, I did learn a lot & it was fun.  The coworkers were nice & funny,  at time it would get busy but there were times where it was not.  If you know how to manage your time then you’ll be good.  The managers are nice I would recommend working there."
good,"Panera bread was my first “real” job outside of the boarding school I went to. I was hired on the spot by a very welcoming managing crew. I was hired on at a new location before they had opened it up yet so I was on a team with entirely new members. I got along super well with all the managers and they were very understanding about the fact I was in school and had a second job. They worked around my schedule while also understanding I still wanted to get as many hours in as possible. They let me move around to different positions I wanted to try out like cashier, drive through, and bakery. My only complaint is many other people were getting paid more than I was while they were less qualified and experienced (I had many things on my resume from internships and jobs within my boarding school). And it was very hard to try and move up the chain or get pay raises."
good,I enjoy working there but it’s a rather dull experience at some point the management is great but to advance is a rather rigid process with no clear path.
good,"Staff was nice in my location, very out going and friendly people. Sometimes work was slow and relaxed but during weekends and holidays it was usually busy. Down side was that call outs were easy and most of the time we were short staffed leaving usually closing shifts with little staff and doubling the work for those working, which was very stressful. Especially as a student who needed to be able to leave work on time to go home and do homework."
good,Panera was a great place to work while I was obtaining my college degree. They worked well with my hours. I was a cashier and trainer at Panera Bread so my job consisted of accepting the transactions of customers and training other employees the best way to do it. The management treated everyone with fairness and made the work environment pleasant.
good,"The culture of my cafe location is one of a family. We work together to provide our customers with the best food we can offer. We work together as a team and we succeed or fail together as a team. I have learned many valuable things from this job, and I will continue to as well. The management has always been great, and they really do a great job of leading us and providing for us. The hardest part would probably be dealing with an upset customer. I enjoy this job for the people and the environment they have built."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is an awesome company to work for.  You have to be very detail oriented and quick to learn because it gets extremely busy during peak hours.  Overall, very happy with the company."
good,Fast-paced environment with great structure to a workplace. Panera Bread will teach you how to become a really efficient worker.  Careful when planning school around this job though.
good,"Overall a great place to learn management skills if your willing to start low and work your way up."
good,I enjoyed the job and the other employees. The pay was ok but felt that the pay structure was not fair. I used my vehicle and the only compensation was a small amount per mile.
good,"I enjoyed working at panera, my co workers were extremely friendly and very helpful; the managers were great, however the hours i received were very low."
good,"Working at Panera is good when you need money and need a flexible schedule. The managers sometimes don't care but I never really expected that with the food industry,"
good,At Panera you have to be willing to work and work fast. It's enjoyable to work at Panera because it is almost always busy and goes by very quick. The customers are very nice and pleased.
good,"The job is quite possibly the best that I've had even though I have only had three jobs. Some of management staff can be a bit lazy but, the ones who are not lazy are absolutely exceptional. The employees are some of my best friends now. Including two people who I have small get togethers with now and then. The place is honestly pretty clean but there are small things that need to be taken into consideration. Some of the new hires are usually people who are just out of high school or who are currently attending it. They can be VERY lazy. For example; On their phones in front of customers, sitting in the back of the house while there is a rush of customers, eating food while their co-workers need help. I'd say the most that I had learned about this job is all the basics of working at a standard restaurant."
good,agement was poor but it was a good atmosphere. You were not recognized for your hard work or given any credit. Hired people who did not do the job correctly or efficiently and had unreliable staff that inconvenciened other workers.
good,"While working at Panera Bread, there was very little downtime, especially during the lunch hours. I spent most of my time making meals, but when I was not making meals, I was either cleaning or restocking my station. The managers were demanding, which was understandable since we had many customers each day and we were on a time crunch, but if someone was behind on making their meals, they would step in to help them catch up. I got along with most of my coworkers, but some coworkers had a bad attitude towards the job, which was very detrimental to us making the food and getting it out to the customers on time."
good,Panera is a fun place to work at & give you the hours you would like & if you want less they will give you lex if you want more they will give you more
good,"-Every day at Panera bread it was fun and productive "
good,"I liked working here. It’s best to work here as a students, they accommodate your school schedule and understand that people have lives iutside of the work place."
good,"Wasn't too hard to get the hang of things. Opportunities to learn the different shifts and roles within the workplace. Friendly environment. Could be a little hectic during busy hours, but was manageable"
good,"Nice starting job, flexible schedule, good management. Was a good place to work with a fun environment . Closing was difficult when customers would walk in last minute but overall a good job"
good,"I liked working at Bread co. my co-workers were very helpful and nice. We got a good discount and they are flexiable with hours. Aside from that, I think it can get stressful at times and overwhelming and there are days we are understaffed."
good,It’s a fast past environment that consist of identifying product accuracy with counting veeeeeery physical that place is ur gym ...your planning for different cafes without Chicago and varies other cafes out of state management make you feel at home and the benefits are great pay also well
good,"Everyday is definitely different. Although the people Panera brings to the cafe are warm and friendly. My job consists of managing shifts and making sure the aces are in their places. I organize the shift accordingly making sure the shift goes smoothly and efficiently. I've learned alot about the company and what they stand for. I really like the fact they are 100% clean with their ingredients. The company is fast pace and laid back. Enjoyable part of the job is you'll always feel at home especially with the regulars that come through, they have interest in you and your personal lives. They see you as a person and not just an employee that needs to serve them. Hardest part of the job would be maintaining a shift while being short staff."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera was very fun and as a first job I in fact enjoyed working there very much. I also appreciate the coworkers always helping me whenever I needed assistance in completing any task that I was still yet uncomfortable with or confused on how to operate. The customer factor was also a very large plus as everyone I helped or served always had a smile and would never be rude or angry.
good,"Panera creates a warm welcome to the guests that come to the cafe daily, You get to know everyone by there name, the only down side is the Cafe health scores don't provide the positive that is down in the cafe day in and day out."
good,"Our days were usually very busy. I worked anywhere from 2 to close (10). I learned how to properly close line, to the standards of Panera. I learned how to properly handle ingredients. I learned to serve and plate. I learned better communication and positivity to your customers. I was able to meet wonderful people, and have (and had) wonderful opportunities. Management was alright, they didn't tell me everything you're supposed to tell an incoming employee. The hardest part was probably getting paid. I was three weeks late on my first paycheck. So, five weeks of work when we get paid bi-weekly and no pay."
good,"Great and I like working ......................."
good,"Panera Bread can be a wonderful place to work, and management gets paid well. Like most companies, some district managers and GMs can be a pain to work with."
good,"If I hadn’t moved, I would still be working at Panera. A lot of responsibilities, but not so much that it’s stressful. I honestly looked forward to going to work."
good,"Loved my job very diversified, loved  working with my coworkers ad with my customers both outside on deliveries , fun place to work with flexible hours"
good,"There are peak hours where it can be really busy, but overall, it was a fun, fast paced work environment.  I enjoyed the culture, employees, and customers."
good,"I made lifelong friends out of managers and coworkers at Panera Bread that I still talk to. Making food quickly and to specification can be stressful, But everyone is very friendly and more than willing to help. My only complaint is that benefits could have been better."
good,"we have deployments to let us know what position is being worked that day, provide good customer service, i would try to think of lunch rush as a game, being organised but quickly as possible, fun environment if you have a good crew."
good,A great company and a great work environment. I miss the atmosphere of Panera Bread and would not hesitate to work for this company in the near future.
good,"Much of the job is spent working with coworkers, therefore there is a lot of community between the employees. Management helps the employees when help is needed, and everyone keeps up a happy attitude. A main point that Panera Bread tries to send across is a family, home-like environment and the employees try their best to make every customer feel at home."
good,"A typical day at work is a very busy day when we need to bake a lot of bread, bagels. Teamwork help each other make sure to finish your task before the end of your shift"
good,Panera bread was a great place to have a first job. They provided you with a discounted meal everytime you worked and the work environment was fast-paced yet positive. They really knew how to create a great team building environment. They also made it quite easy yet meaningful to work our way up the totem pole.
good,"It is a very quick paced job , but ultimately helps you work through situations quicker. This job helps you learn how to work with people and how to be patient."
good,"I became an associate trainer within 6 months of starting at Panera Bread. I had opportunities to train new employees in the areas I was trained. Working cashier, I provided excellent customer service and I organized and prepared daily inventory"
good,"For the most part working here was pretty good. Management was for the most part good although sometimes they weren't all that great, they would befriend employees and give them more hours. The job itself was fairly simple and easy it could get quite stressful during rushes, especially the Sunday lunch rush. Overall, working here was pretty enjoyable."
good,The management was nice. The pay was decent for fast food and it certainly beats out other food service positions. Very easy to get promoted and pay increases. Breaks and food are nice perks.
good,"A very diverse community that values their flexibility in scheduling. Most of the management is understanding and will work with you. Many locations are fast paced, which require patience but the ability to stay on your toes."
good,"Every Panera is different but the overall atmosphere is the same, family oriented and fun.  An average day for me started in the morning.  I was a baker so I had my own area but I still was very familiar and friendly with the cafe workers and all the managers.  Bakers have to keep up with the daily demands of the cafe while they are open but we also had to prepare products for the next day and prep items for the night bakers.  I loved the fast paced environment and creating items.  Don't get me wrong it can be stressful sometimes because things happen and you just have to adjust to them and get the job done.  I tell you though it is very rewarding when you do get it done!!"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera was only a temporary job for me as it helped me while attending college, but I loved working there. The discount was good and my coworkers were wonderful. They still ask me to come back to work there! And while the pay wasn’t enough for where I live, I was still making more than minimum wage."
good,when I worked here I started here I started out as a normal employee and within 2months was promoted to store opener then 2months after that promoted to shift supervisor and 3months after that was promoted to assistant manager.
good,"They provide various hours to work with your schedule.  The environment is friendly and organized. Learned how to display product, slice bread, place orders.  Wonderful customers, a lot are regulars that you start to know their name and what they are going to order."
good,Atmosphere is nice and the managers move around alot in this district. Overall they are good staff. The training is structured well overall as long as communication is on point. Pay is far better than most jobs in this field and for lower level positions.
good,Panera was the best restaurant that I have worked at. The managers cared about the workers and helped with scheduling conflicts as much as possible. My coworkers were amazing and I loved almost all of them!
good,You work log hours everyday your there but the customers and staff  make it a great place to work. Management is god but sometimes have unrealistic exceptions. The hardest part of this job is keeping up with all your admin work.
good,"Lots of pressure to hit your ""time goals"" and make sure every is friendly"
good,Panera Bread was one of my favorite places to work. My team members and management was very nice. Management was very flexible and worked with me through my high school schedule and were very understanding.
good,"i love panera and the warm feeling but i don't get many hours now that i have started , iam a cashier and i love it but i also clean tables and give the dishes to the dishwasher"
good,I had a great time working at Panera Bread.  Always something to do as we were a busy store.  Had fun with the people working on my shifts.  Management was always fair and helpful with any issues or problems.
good,"Everyone had their own roles and still flexed to help whoever was in need. Happy ""family-like"" team feeling and high customer satisfaction seen through everyday interactions and return customers."
good,I was hired without work experience. The managers were nice and patient teaching new skills that were needed for the job. The orientation you have to go through is fun.
good,"I came to Panera to find a better balance between work and my personal life... and I found it. Managers get one 3 day weekend per quarter off. Also, managers get one weekend (Saturday and Sunday) off per month. This allowed me to spend Thanksgiving AND Christmas with my family for the first time in five years. You are not restricted to late hours as the cafe is open all day (not just dinner) and has most business during lunch. The latest I have returned home from work is 11:00pm. The flip side of that is the early hour for the opening manager shift (5am where I am at). There are a lot of young associates to deal with and so there is a constant need for on the job coaching and also considerable need for hiring to maintain proper staffing. Aside from that, the company has pretty clear job duties and it is easy to train and coach those willing to learn. The manager needs to anticipate bottlenecks (inventory, staffing) and to be on top of what associates are doing constantly to ensure a successful shift. Bonuses are achievable. It is still a restaurant so the work is hard and there is always something that comes up that wasn't planned for. No worries about managing bar costs... just food costs. It is easy to move up in the company as well."
good,I really enjoyed working at Panera because my coworkers were fun and I knew we were giving high quality food to people. My managers were kind and I could tell they genuinely cared about me. At times it was pretty stressful because the restaurant can get busy and our food takes a bit to cook but overall it was a fun place to work and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a starting job! I usually had half an hour breaks which was nice if I wanted to grab a meal and relax before going back to work. Plus when I worked there I always got free food when working night shifts and I got 65% off! YUM!
good,The job is great for young adults still in or fresh out of highscool. Pay is not the best but expected as its fast food. All staff are very friendly. Never had issues with any of managment
good,I love it at Panera because there are great people and management excels at making sure we are comfortable but also doing required work. Compensation isn't as much as I would prefer.
good,"My job was pretty typical of any food service job. Face-paced, timed orders and everyone putting in their all to make sure every customer was well feed and satisfied."
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera. There was room for a lot of job growth. Panera offer a lot of job opportunities. Panera has a very happy and healthy work environment,"
good,I would work in the mornings from Monday-Thursday and on Friday and Saturday I would close. I did dishes and it was stressful during the day because you have to clean a lot of dishes and put dishes out because a lot of people would eat there. Closing was a bit more relaxing because not a lot of customers are there. The only thing stressful about it was cleaning all the utensils that your coworkers used.
good,"Working at panera can be very stressful at times, especially when the line is all the way out the door and onto the sidewalk. Nonetheless it is a good place to work and I would go back"
good,"The managers are very good at there job, the customers are not terrible.  Very rarely were we so understaffed that people were required to work more than 1 station at a time."
good,Management was very good. I work the 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. shift and it could be very difficult most days because after I got my 8:30 a.m. lunch break I did not get another break until my shift was over.
good,"I had very flexible hours, working for a fast growing company. I opened up 5 location in 9 years and 2 within my first 6 months. I had to travel 120 miles a day. I had several high volume Bakery/Cafes with multiple in the same suburbs."
good,"panera bread was my favorite company to work for, everybody i worked with had an amazing personality and was never afraid to make surer the customers always right."
good,"You have to be ready to jump. Panera has serving time standards and while you can relax, when the rush hits its all service no goofing around. You must learn to work with different people, everyones different."
good,"Fun place to work"
good,"Depending on you position there, it can become a tad stressful on days but working as a team is a huge concept at Panera. Staff and management make the location succeed or fail and as of right now this location is pretty well staffed and managed. The hardest and most enjoyable part happens to be the guests that come in. It can be hard getting unhappy customers whom don't understand all there is to know about the cafe, but it is so rewarding when a guest tells you how wonderful your cafe is or even you as a worker. This job is very up and down just like with anything but it has taught me a lot about people including myself."
good,Overall not a bad place to work but the hours are sometimes inconsistent and it can be monotonous but that is to be expected with entry level food service jobs.
good,Management was stressful and fast paced. Worked many swing shifts getting off late and turning around and opening early. Overall experience with getting to know customers and creating relationships was awesome!
good,"Overall, Panera LLC is a good company to work for. Even better to find a franchise. Could be more flexible for scheduling expectations but, such is life in retail."
good,"I had no big problems working here, I only wished they would have trained me on more so that I could have had more hours. Good thing about it was that everyone is very nice and helpful."
good,"Alot is always going on so be prepared to be on your toes at any moment. Customers always are great to talk with, no complaint with management. Very good for anyone who is just looking for a job or love food."
good,Great team to work with. Always treated with respect. Work extremely hard when I’m there. Would recommend a friend to work here. Have the best general manager.
good,Panera was a job that was easy to catch on to. Quick paced yet relaxed. Management was fair and understanding as many of the employees were high school or college students full time.
good,I came in a the bottom earned my stripes and now I'm a key associate in the store sometimes it's crazy busy and people bump heads but overall it's a good job
good,it gave you lots of room to grow and advance in the company. great training and if you do a good job you got the hours.  The most fun is the people you work with.  Typically in most panera breads the employees want to get the job done in a fun way.
good,"Overall a decent place to work if the managers are on your side. Days can be hard, but in the end, it comes down to your coworkers and how well they have your back. If they do, you'll be set for life."
good,Panera has many opportunities for advancement. Traning programs are well in place. The company invest a lot of time and money into properly training their employees.Solid company with excellent upper management.
good,"Panera Bread is a great company. They have a great philosophy and actually do what they say they want to do. Panera is headed in the right direction, being an innovator in the food industry while having a classic cafe feel."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoyed working here, a lot  of work but very easy. management was awesome professional very organized. Everyone knew what they had to do or supposed to be doing trained not left to dry"
good,"They work with you on your schedule, but they also demand excellence. You will get a good balance of learning hard work, but not getting overloaded by it. A good job for students."
good,"The people were nice, service was usually slow, and the job was relaxed. I occasionally had the difficult customer, but it was fine. I just personally did not prefer the job."
good,"If you enjoy standing on your feet for a 7 hour shift, being extremely nice to customers and strict food policies, this is the job for you. You receive a 30 minute break, and while you're on break you are unbothered and respected. Great managers and lively employees."
good,I've learned a lot during my time at Panera and it was a great first job just excited to try other things. This job has taught me a lot and I plan on taking the skills I've learned from here and applying them and hope to move up in a great company.
good,I worked for Panera for a very long time. This is the best job for students. They will always work with your schedule and you can still get promotions if you are a hard worker.
good,"With panera I have more experience and more opportunities in this country! Thank panera and all of people who take care of this company.must of the time it funny to work because all my coworkers are beautiful and funny, all the managers are nice and all of them appreciate the way I work hard for this company.thank panera"
good,Friendly staff and management who met the fast paced schedule that helped me meet customer orders. Good line of communication and good job security for delivery position.
good,I advanced throughout my years working with Panera Bread. It has been an adventure and gained so much knowledge to share with the world. I'd like to progress to a higher standard that I know is within me.
good,"Great job for 19 years old and younger. It was a lot of labor, they had me running everywhere doing three tasks at the same time and some guests weren't helpful at all."
good,"Right when you get into work theres always something clean, we always were cleaning. Panera is usually always busy too. I learned better customer service. The managers were great people. Work culture was great. The hardest part of this job was all the of the deep cleaning. most enjoyable part of this job was the people I worked with."
good,Panera is one of the best places I have worked at so far. I was able to enhance my communication skills as well as become a trainer within my first year.
good,"Good environment "
good,i absolutely love panera and the team. they are very helpful and teach you about the job. All the food is clean and they donate all the leftovers.They never waste a single pastry.
good,"Panera was my first real employer.  The pay was good, and hours were decent.  Most managers were easy to get along with, but some took some warming up to get to know them.  A meal was provided at cost, but only 30 minutes was provided to eat it.  If a break was given during a busy time, the break may be spent waiting in line for food, and then rushing to eat it in time."
good,Panera is an extremely fast paced environment with a clientele that knows what they want and how they want it. The hardest part is the customers. However the best part about working here is that people are great and you feel like they are family.
good,"The work place is pretty fast paced but is a lot of fun to work for. Although at times you have to be serious, laughing and having a good time is the one thing we all try to do no matter the situation. I absolutely love it."
good,"A typical day at work would be opening either the bakery or production line every morning and getting everything set up before we opened that day. I learned a lot and had told myself before that I would never work in a food place, but did and ended up loving it. I learned all about different types of breads, produce, salads, ""clean"" produce and much more. The management was a great crew to work with and helped me open up more and be more independent and outspoken with other coworkers. The hardest part of the job was probably moving up. I did move up from an associate to an associate trainer, but it took almost a year with a lot of hard work."
good,"Panera Bread has a Supportive work environment. With everyone getting along fun times can be had. Fun is not at the expense of work, however. When it is time to focus in on work there is no hesitation to do so."
good,"Decent job. Easy to learn. Most of the managers were cool. Some were hard to work with. It was good experience in food. I learned to prioritize duties to be the most efficient and get everything done correctly, but quickly."
good,"The management was astounding. The job itself was stressful because of customers, but you're paid well to be a cashier/ server. you can get promoted pretty easily, but the pay increase vs the workload isn't worth it unless you're a shift lead."
good,Panera Bread was a awesome experience of modern and organic flavors offered to guests with a great workplace culture of service. Panera Bread also host several products worthy of both quality and freshness
good,Overall great job to work. Great benefits plus the pay is nice. You can learn a lot about different Bread and pastries. No breaks makes the jobs little difficult because you don't stop moving
good,Great Job that works with your schedule. Depending on your location you will encounter normal issues with the culture of the job  but overall it was a good job. I only quit because I was going to college.
good,"A typical day would consist of bouncing between making food and taking orders. Running through the dining room to make sure the store looks great for the customers."
good,"Due to our location, we are usually busy and always on our toes. Management holds the team to high standards in every aspect of our cafe. The staff is usually very friendly, enjoy helping each other, and working together."
good,"If you're looking for a reliable job that pays well, I'd say this is a solid choice. Their training is enough to have someone who has never baked before to make everything that they need, they pay well, and they're accommodating about setting a schedule."
good,"Panera was my first job and I could've have chose a better place. The scheduling is extremely flexible, the work environment is great, and you're constantly busy so the day goes by fast."
good,"Good job, amazing first job, expect to work hard and enjoy the company of your coworkers. The managers are very accommodating and fair. You don't get enough raises."
good,A typical day at work includes making sure that all associates have their stations ready to serve our guest and that all product is available for service.  Doing daily walk around ensure that the restaurant stays clean and the associates and guest are happy. The hardest part of the job is stepping back and letting associates do their job and not over shadowing or doing the work myself.  I enjoying seeing the smiles on family faces and seeing hard working students being able to studying or do work with very minimal distractions.
good,"Panera was a fast paced environment that allowed for workers to specialize in a certain area of work, or allowed for growth through numerous positions"
good,"The job is fun and well paced if you can keep up and aren't too lazy. If you're not willing to learn or pick up some work to keep busy, you may find that this is not the workplace for you. managers are usually very nice and willing to help out. job is hard at first, then once you know the menu it gets easier. many employees are there for years."
good,"One of my favorite jobs I've had. You get discounts on the food, which is a plus, the employees are friendly and there is always room for growth."
good,"While working at Panera, I managed to make close ties with fellow employees, the schedule was flexible, hardest part was having to do group work by myself."
good,a typical day of work is prepping food for lunch's and working the cash and line at the same time. stocking when needed as well. management was great had no problems at all with them. the hardest part of the job would be other co-workers not doing there jobs right or were just lazy and didn't want to work. the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with everyone was very friendly.i have learned food safety and other food codes and how to keep a clean area so I can work faster and better without problems
good,"I enjoyed being able to come into work every day with a smile on my face, and serve all kinds of people. As well as be around all kinds of different bread."
good,"The work at Panera is flowing and constant but not overwhelming. The people who work there tend to be genuinely nice and caring individuals. There tends to be a difficulty with scheduling and position coverage as not everyone is trained for every position like they should be. The coworkers and the regulars are the best part of the job, whereas my management team personally went downhill recently."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Requires alot of attention. Best way to succeed is to go beyond what they ask of you. There is alot of attention to detail. My best advice is to start at the cash register and work up from there. Best way up the ladder is to get very close to customers and be a floater. Do everything and anything fpr anybody. Always follow the steps the show you comes in handy.
good,"For a first job, I enjoyed it . Nice hours, gain customer skills, it was organized. The cleanliness, professional management is what I enjoyed."
good,Customer service great trainng there suckef I had to learn on my own very busy wifi sucked needs to be cleaned a little better busy breakfast time all about bagels
good,The food service itself is either fast paced or completely dead. The management has completely changed since last working there. Management was very understanding and the co-workers acted some what professional
good,Work life balance and the competitive salary make it an ideal place to work at.  Fellow staff members are also a joy to be around and work with.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of ringing customers up and helping them decide what they would like to order. I learned how to stock and rotate items, cashier, customer service, barista, production line, dining room, and dishwashing."
good,Working here exposes you to many different cultures and how to eat healthy. How to look for food that is clean with no Gmo's. Working here was a lot of smiles but it has it downs day as well.
good,"Lunch and dinner rushes are extremely stressful due to understaffing and typically running out of certain breads/food to complete an order, but the people that work for this company are amazing. A typical day for me is from afternoon to night, which usually starts with stocking and cleaning the ""line"" (where we make food). Lunch rush is usually anywhere from around 11:30 to 3 pm, and dinner rush can last from 4:30 pm to 8 pm. Dinner is slightly more stressful since pre-closing cleaning duties do not get done on time  (or at all) the later the rush is. However, no matter how much cleaning there is to do at the end of the night, it is clear that coworkers care. Most of the time, they will stay to help you finish instead of leaving -- even if it is 11:30 at night. Overall it is a great place to work, and staying with the company has its perks (like getting a raise every 6 months)."
good,"enjoy the morning hours and the healthy menu options that we serve to our guests. "
good,"This was my very first job when I was 16 years old!"
good,I enjoy the independence of the Night Baker position.  I've learned some very rewarding time management skills. I've had a great experience with coworkers and managers.  The hardest part of the job is working the overnight hours which is why I am looking to make a change.
good,"Panera Bread, Boston Bread, LLC. provides a stable workplace environment with expected daily operations. This gives employees a regimented daily routine in which they know what to expect and are able to perform accordingly. With this, however, there is limited room for growth and development aside from the standard progression from Associate to Shift Manager to Assistant Manager, etc. With associates who look for career growth into Sales, Marketing, and Administrative positions, there seems to be a stagnant environment for such development. Wages seem to be better than average for each position within the Bakery-Cafes; however, reviews seems to be delayed and wage increases tend to be less than what should be provided for exceptional abilities, skills, and work ethic displayed by above-average associates."
good,"Delivering food to customers was nice, it's a nice feeling. I learned about organization. My co-workers were cool people to work with."
good,"Greet customers, take orders, transition breakfast to lunch and support Managers. I have learned great communications and people skills. Interaction with co-workers is pristine. Standing for 8 hours would be the hardest part of the job. Work environment is enjoyable."
good,"Panera was a fun job. I worked as a server and busser so I served the customers their food and helped them with anything they needed. I also bussed and cleaned the tables when the customers left. The managers were very friendly and enjoyable to work with. The job was very fast paced and I was on my feet for the whole shift running around the whole restaurant, but because of that the shift goes by pretty quickly."
good,"The downtown Panera Bread in State College has been a fun and fast paced look into the world of high-end fast food. Both management and other associates have been great to work with, and the compensation and experience has been good, given the college setting."
good,Coming to work everyday was a blast seeing different people and helping them know the difference between the different kinds of breads their is.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day at work consists of constant customers coming in and out the door for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The mornings consist of setting the entire cafe up for the customers that are expected to come throughout the day. The night consists of closing the cafe up, to set it back in order for the next day. The management team is busy, and always available upon employee or customer request. The associates are such a friendly group of people, always putting forth their kindest face to the customers. It's a busy and fast moving job, but there is always something to do and someone to talk to."
good,"A typical day at Panera bread was working with mostly food products and preparing food for customers. I learned social skills, how to assist the public, and  working with a team. The management at Panera bread was very helpful and insightful. My co-workers were very helpful and polite as well, although we liked to joke around a lot, we always kept our professionalism, and was respectful to customers. The hardest part of the job at Panera was balancing between school and work, and the most enjoyable part about the job was the customers and meeting new people."
good,"High energy, can be either positive or at times be difficult depending on how you yourself can respond. Variety of guests and fellow employees. Busy and fast paced job, always has you on your toes."
good,"The mornings are usually good at Panera, they could get kind of slow. During the lunch rush, it might get a little crazy, but as a team we pull though. The hardest part of the job is to know what to say to customers in certain situations. I know they are tired of hearing "" I apologize for the inconvenience"", so you have to try to say something else that makes them feel like you really do care. I've learned that at Panera your staff and your regular customers are like your family and at the end of the day, it is worth it to see that your team does a great job and makes you proud."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my job at Panera Bread. However, the food industry is not something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. A typical day at work includes activities such as: food preparation (making tea, coffee, sandwiches, salads, soups, pastries), cleaning (floors, microwaves, walls, coolers, dishes), interacting with customers (taking orders, dealing with complaints, forming a bond with the regulars, fixing any mistakes), and closing down the cafe (shutting down machines, counting the cash drawer, deck scrubbing the floors, checking expiration dates)."
good,"Panera Bread is a great job place for students looking for a job to pay for college or other expenses.  The management was very relaxed but still strict enough that things that needed done were done in a timely manner.  The only problem is that the store I worked at was not well staffed so if someone called off, the store would struggle.  Usually the same 3 to 4 people worked every night.  There is however a very very large opportunity for advancement in the company."
good,Always love meeting new people and this company is not only customer oriented but also employee oriented as well.  Professional mangers and i appreciate the professionalism.
good,I loved the people I worked with but everyone either hated the manager or was afraid of her. If you ever needed a cover there was always someone who would take it.
good,"The culture at Panera Bread is very inclusive and supportive. A good company to work for. The benefits are a good, but there could be more flexibility."
good,There is no such thing as a typical day at work. Management is good. Most co-workers are okay overall. Hardest part is the rushes and best part is talking to my friends there.
good,Panera Bread is a good place for your first part time job. It teaches you about work ethics and value. It a good environment to get used to seeing all different types of people in the world that you will no doubt encounter in any other work environment.
good,it a reliable job  just wished they paid overnight bakers more money. I work 4 ten hour days it starts at 9pm til 7am. I bake breads pastries and bagels
good,"Flexible hours, especially for college students. A calm positive environment. Management is understanding, stern, but patient. A lot of motivation to move up as a trainer to shift manager."
good,Helping customers feel at home and welcomed. Making quality food and drinks in a proper timely manner. Very friendly co-workers and management. I really enjoyed working there.
good,good place to work overall and I would recommend it to just about anyone. This is a great 1st job for everyone and is a fantastic stepping stone
good,I have been working for 3 years at Panera bread and have had a great experience. My coworkers are great. It is kind of hard to move up in the company and it can be unfair. Overall I don't have any complaints about the job.
good,Panera mangement style is hands on approach it's a good company to work.  While working at Panera your traning is very good and will allow you to build yourself professinally as a manger.
good,It is great for students but not for family. pay is lacking and hours are all over the place. they try to be flexible. I have no problem with anyone and love who I work with. wish i could get paid more to stay
good,"great company with wonderful people that are integrity based. Training is very important to this company, and will make sure your are efficient in your daily routine."
good,"As a manager at Panera Bread, I have learned how to manage a cafe in ways that would help the customers needs and in result gain profit for the company. I am part of a a team called The Pro Team and I am in charge of opening brand new cafes in our district. We bring the cafe to life and train the associates with the tools they need to succeed and provide them with warmth and integrity to carry them on once we leave. I also travel to each cafe to ensure all standards are being followed and provide a helping hand if needed. Panera has helped me grow tremendously, not only as a manager, but as a person too. Panera stands for bringing a family together, while providing a welcoming atmosphere to their employees."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I loved working at Panera because its challenging and a great place with great people.great place to learn multiple skills in customer service.
good,"I learned how to make their popular Smoothies and Iced Green Tea."
good,"A typical day at Panera, We would have a rush hour around the middle of the day. the Mangers were pretty nice they gave employees a lot of chances if they messed up, or didn't show up to work. "
good,"I was trained in every position in order to become helpful. The company is very informative of their product! The environment is very stressing to employees to do well in their job. I was expected to be the best I can, which is very helpful for you as an individual to grow. My Co-workers were great and hard working as well. I enjoyed everything about the job, no regrets of ever applying there!"
good,A typical day at work was providing guest service and making sure all our customers were happy. Management made our jobs more enjoyable and helped make our work load easier. Management did whatever they could to help us succeed. I got along and became friends with several co-workers of whom I still am in touch with today. The most enjoyable part of my day was knowing that I was able to make our customers leave happy and providing great customer service.
good,"Panera Bread is one of the many jobs that you will enjoy coming to each day. When looking for people to hire they place you with the ones you have similar characteristics with and may get along with very well. When I worked there I was surrounding by a comforting family. Just like a regular family, we also had our shares of ups and downs. Even though things don't work out the way you may want it to, everybody will benefit from a mutual solution."
good,I started working at Panera Bread when I was in high school. It is a great beginning job! With hard work I was able to advance from Associate to Team Trainer. Working for this company has given me an excellent foundation to further my professional goals.
good,I very much enjoyed working in the restaurant business and being able to gain people skills. I got to work up front with customers and even got to build bonds with customers while I would take care of the dining room. I also learned a lot by being given the opportunity to train many of Panera Bread's new employees.
good,"I worked here for about a year and I was very sad to leave due to university. Excellent management always ensures things are done on time and efficiently, would definitely recommend to a friend."
good,"Panera Bread is a wonderful company to work for. They do a lot of things for the company and have lots of room to move up in the company."
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread, fast paced, always something to do. Fun work environment, positive attitudes and influence from management and co-workers."
good,Casual style dining with a fun work environment. It taught me everything I know about customer experience and management. I had a great staff and a great boss. The hardest part of the job was the long days filled with very busy work flow. The most enjoyable part was the ability to make a customer happy.
good,"I worked the opening shift at panera, usually 5:00 AM til 2:00 PM.  Getting up that early is difficult, and providing friendly, patient service that early is even more difficult, but rewarding if you stick with it long enough.  I was well compensated for my time, which helped a great deal.  The management at my store was very well trained and patient."
good,It was a very demanding job but I like the extra push and the experiences that I gained.
good,"I've learned a lot from this job;  How to handle money and work with a diverse client base and you can operate machinery if you're at least 18 years of age. Days are slow when we are slow, and then sometimes we get a rush of people at once, usually at lunch time. You build relationships with customers, and improve customer service."
good,"Excellent company, excellent produce, loyal following and a sure winner. Great culture and opportunity for growth"
good,"This job went fast. There were so many customers and it never stopped, which was good, because then the work day sped by."
good,"A typical day would entail prepping and preparing food for families and social events. I have learned more about food safety and the preparation of it. The management was great they were always willing to jump right into work if we were over whelmed or needed a hand. This was a job where you really needed to get along with one another because you’re working very close to around 5 other people, there had to be a working rhythm. The hardest part about the job was if were short staffed there was tons to do it increased the pressure. The enjoyable part of the job was being able to feed people and have that sense that they can just come in to either relax by the fire or just enjoy the day and not be rushed."
good,"The most important part at work is customer satisfaction. Learned how to deal with different people in different, sometimes stressful situations. Management and co-workers were great and understanding, trying to do their best just like me. There is always going to be a ""customer of the day"" - which is not going to be pleased easy, I would say sometimes it can be hard, you have to forget everything in the world, but understand that customer. The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing happy people."
good,"It's a rewarding job, but one has to be able to work well with a variety of age groups because not only are there teenagers working the evening and weekend shifts, but there may be employees from an older generation whom generally work the day-time weekday shifts. Opening the store can be a struggle if one is not a morning person. It is a rewarding job in the sense that there is much to learn from both other managers whom one works with, as well as the opportunities to assist in opening other stores across the nation. Also, it is wonderful to get to know one's regular crowd of customers, giving the place a sense of home."
good,The job that I did at Panera is make food for paying customers when the order came down the line. then i would clean to make sure closing the store went smoothly. I loved working with the people that i worked with even my managers.
good,Walking in was always fun because all the girls acknowledge you and you also see what the store has changed so you are familiar with what you are working with that day. Co-workers were nice and managers were fair. I learned merchandising and new ways to explain things to customers. I also learned to be more confident in myself and were able to approach customers to talk about our new products.
good,"Love the job, hate the hours. Learned tons about baking processes. Management very friendly. Hardest part of job is sleeping during the day."
good,"Somedays are overly stressful with too many people trying to eat too much food without the space or co workers to help out. But close bonds are had, jokes are made, and over all the experience is a positive one so long as you have the right people to work with."
good,This company had several high expectations and made sure you were working the whole time you were there. They were very clean and very specific. A great place to work.
good,"enjoyable"
good,in charge of overall day to day operations of restaurant. I get to interact with customers and work with a very diverse group of people.
good,A typical day at work would be to keep restocking the pastries at the front. As well as taking the guests food order and putting it through the system and then they would pay me. Management and coworkers were good people to work with. The Panera Bread at just opened so we were all learning new things. The hardest part of the job was learning how to cook certain pastries. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning a lot of new things. 
good,I come in and open a register and being my day. I greet customers really friendly. Try to suggest certain foods to customers and try to up sale some items.
good,"A typical day working at Panera Bread in Stoughton, MA was besides clocking in and being in uniform you would look on a plannig sheet the manager would set out for the day. On the sheet are the positions each person would be in from opening positions to closing positions. It was easy to learn the rules and regulations, how the place worked and how to do everything. The managers were a huge help. They're always around to help especially if the place was busy. Working there tought me that Panera bread isn't just a place to go eat, but a place where you can get your school work done, you can go there to get away and be comfortable. The co-workers there were helpful as well. If a manager wasn't around then you could always go to one of the associates for help. They always have a smile on their faces and ready to help any customer that came their way. The hardest part of the job I would say was probably leaving. The most onjoyable plart of the job was communicating with the customers. We didn't just take orders and send them on their way. We actually had little mini conversations, but those conversations was what opened our welcome ti the customers that had them coming back. The food wasn't the only reason why the customers came back."
good,Trained new employees
good,A typical day of work consists of a great amount of customer interaction and food preparation. One learns about Panera culture and bakery operations while working. Management and coworkers are truly enjoyable people to be around. The hardest part of the job is learning how to manage in the fast paced environment of Panera without making customers feel like they are at a fast food establishment. The are many different enjoyable aspects to the job so it is hard to pick just one.
good,catering catering and more catering
good,I enjoyed working at Panera. There always was great cookies and people. I loved my co-workers because it was always fun working with them. The hardest part was trying to stay away from that cafe. free internet and refills on coffee.
good,"well on the regular typical day at work would be washing dishes, taking out trash, bus boy, clean area."
good,I have an overall good time working for the company. It ejoyed to customers I came into contact with on a day to day basis and built a rapport with them. The only dispute I had was that they realy didnt understand when I made the decision to persue school. We couldnt figure out a schedule that worked for me.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"First off the staff there great people but at sometimes some of them can get under your skin but with all jobs there are people that work with you will do that at times but not a big deal becaus you have to remember the work place is like a family and you just have to love and work with one another. Customers thats come in like your regulars, there just to awsome and thats what makes the work day so great and its a good environment for all to enjoy so if anything ill give the work area two thumbs up."
good,"I had so much fun working at Panera, but when you are an adult fun doesn’t pay the bills. The pay was very low, no matter how much experience you have. All crew members get paid the same wages just about and when you learn something new you still are paid the same wage. I believe you only get paid more when you become a shift leader, maybe an employee trainer. This job is for high schoolers, or someone looking for a little extra money."
good,The pay is good with flexible hours. Also management is very helpful with any concerns. It’s a fun and easy job to have at times. Don’t always get the hours wanted though.
good,"A great place to work. I worked there for about 8 months. Met a lot of great people. Good management, hardest part about the job would be closing at night."
good,Family oriented they care about there people flexible hours good pay no late hours always bringing in better food choices for the guest very healthy bagels are great and having bread baked on site is always fresh product
good,"Panera is a very easy and good company to work for. You can move up in the company fast and learn allot. There’s always going to be some bad anywhere you work. For my personal “bad”, it was my general manager. She lacked empathy and was not the easiest person to work with. She was very unprofessional to the management, but great with associates and customers."
good,Amazing employees to work with. I honestly haven’t seen such a clean restaurant like them. They do try to keep Everything as natural as post. You get to bond with a lot of regular customers that will make your day. Amazing for any type of learning ways that you may have.
good,"I had a great time, it supplied me with a doable, well-paying job for a teenager. You learn a lot of helpful skills, and recipes for yourself and you make some great friends along the way"
good,"Pays fairly well for assistant managers, treat pregnant women employees very well, and training program is very detailed and organized. Higher up management is very understanding in family emergencies, health issues, etc."
good,Team work is a main component of this job. A typical day at work for a cashier includes making sure every customer gets accurate and efficient service.
good,There is always a chance to grown within the company. For me looking back now; I did not think the cashier was going to become a shift manager. Something is always learned each and every day.
good,"As long as you find a good location with an excellent work environment you cannot go wrong. They even have retirement plans! Managers can be good or bad, just like all other employees. Most are good, the bad ones generally don't last. Toughest time is during lunch rush."
good,"I have been employed for 2 years now by this company. Panera exceeds standards of excellence on all levels. From quality customer service, to quality ingredients, Panera is a place that tries its hardest to be a company FOR the people. If we mess up, have some pastries on us. Out of an item, try this pastry and we'll give you a free entree next time. As an employee, the liberty I have to make a customer's day is so amazing, and I could not have asked to work in a more special place with a more special group of people. If you are in college or high school and want a super flexible job, this is the place to be! "
good,"as the title says I wish the bakers got paid accordingly for the hard work that they put in, making large quantities overnight is a delicate but rewarding task. it is our job to ensure perfect quality bakes consistently but at times the lack of motivation and pay is enough to slow down that drive."
good,"Bakers are self paced to ensure quality of breads and pastries . Overnight shift , quiet, on the shift by yourself , able to listen to music while working"
good,"The job itself was not complicated, the tasks (cashiering, food production, customer service, and cleaning) were somewhat repetitive on a day-to-day basis, but the work environment, management, and employees made the experience that much better."
good,Fun place to work an great co workers. Great with balancing home life and schooling if you are in school. Learning the job was good with great  help from co workres.
good,"Good customer service and people; the conception of giving food at the end of the day is just wonderful! Very good people to work with and sincere, thumbs up"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera Bread is a great company that treats their employees well. Working here allows you to meet great people and see different walks of life all while getting paid
good,"I applied for the position in October of 2018 on Indeed. I was very shocked that they e-mailed me right away for an interview and hired me on the spot. They work great with my college class schedule. I love the General and District Manager (including two assistant managers) there. They really care about their employees and understand when things get hard in life. They normally don't mind at all when you need time off, just let them know in advance. They truly believe that you should still enjoy your personal life while working. I've been working there for a few months and I caught on to things very easily. Now I am multi trained and now I also train new employees. Applying here was the easiest part, the hard part is dealing with rude customers. I really like my job. I hope I will love my future career after I get my degree like I do here."
good,"During a typical day at work, I would come in at around 11:00 in the morning. Since the food was already prepped, I would go to my line, usually the sandwich line, and organize it. In order to do that, I would see if I had all of the necessary ingredients for the sandwiches, and if not, I would go to the walk-in refrigerator to get them. Then, I would begin making my sandwiches. The orders for each customer would show up on a screen above my line, and I would have to follow what it said on the screen, and I would do that until my shift was over. At the end of my shift, I would reorganize and refill my line so my replacement would be ready as soon as they came in. My managers were demanding because we were often pressed for time, but they would help us out when we needed it. They were great overall. I got along with most of my coworkers, but some coworkers would have petty beef with one another, and that would undermine the culture a bit. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the customers orders during what we called ""power hour"", from around 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, which was the time of day the most customers would eat at Panera. Overall, I enjoyed working there because it kept me busy, and I liked getting to know the coworkers"
good,"At most times it is a great place to work, mixed feelings about management, but all my coworkers that I have worked alongside with have been great. It’s a good place to hangout for a bit after work to relax before going home."
good,Panera bread opened a lot of door it had many benefits and also had flexible hours. Panera was a little diverse but there would be many people that come in so it help on social with a social experience and it help you connect more with the customer.
good,"I would typically work about 8 hours per day any days of the week, depending on when I was scheduled. I learned both kitchen skills and customer service. The management was also good and willing to help when needed."
good,"A typical day at work includes opening/closing procedures. It is always busy in the morning, lunch and dinner hours. You will greet and assist over 100 customers daily all while on your feet for 5-8 hours. The work environment is friendly and relaxed, even during busy hours. You will always have a task to do and you job may vary depending on training. I learned how to prep food and drinks, wash dishes and properly clean a restaurant. The hardest part about this job are the customers and multi-tasking. The best part would be the 65% on the food."
good,Very fast service. Friendly work staff. Good working standards. Discounted purchases on food. Must be able to work fast and multi task. Be able to pass training. Must display excellent customer skills
good,"This is a great flexible job. Will schedule as many hours as needed. Get to sample new incoming foods. Easy tasks, but keeps you busy. Great environment."
good,Great first job. Managers are amazing and very flexible with scheduling if you are a student. Environment is very positive and welcoming. Be prepared to do a lot of stocking and customer service.
good,"Overall my experience at this job was great. I liked most of my coworkers, however, they continue to hire a bunch of new people and not properly train them"
good,"The work place is very collaborative and fast paced, everyone works together to get the meals out in a timely manner and maintain customer satisfaction."
good,"A typical workday can switch from fast paced to slow paced in a milisecond. I learned to deal with customer complaints and move insync with the rush.Management is a little shady, they dont ask you to stay after your work shift to help they more so demand it and ignore you when you ask for them to take your register so you could leave.The most enjoyable is the coworkers. panera hires nothing but the upmost nicest and sociable people so thats a plus .you might have a lot of hours on week then the next you only work 2 days which i dont understand."
good,Great place to work for a part time job! Flexible with school schedules and listen to their employees. Many ways you can work your way up in the company if you work hard and show you are dedicated to your job and doing it well
good,"Panera is a great company to work for, they care a lot about the health of the food they put out as well as the customers and employees. It is a very hands on job and fun learning experience. I felt very welcoming and the managers are extremely helpful all the time. Kindness is definitely a focus at Panera bread and was a great first job!"
good,"I enjoy working here. I have made couple good friends working here. There are some co workers that are intimidating and I feel like when I leave the room i feel like they are talking about me till i come back in and they get quiet and talk about something random. I'm a keep to self. Quiet person that likes to get what needs done and no drama. Other then that all the co workers are wonderful to be around. I love all the managers there! Everytime Im Working there be 1 or 2 working at same time and they jump right in and help you out as much they can. Fun and caring management. It can be very stressful sometimes when there is a line of costumers back to back. It takes while to learn everything just because there is so much to learn but it gets easy once you get the hang of it. The pay is okay. It above minimum wage. Scheduling is very flexible. They work with you what you need and very understanding. I recommend working here as a first job, going to school and something you get you starting out."
good,"I felt the best time I had while working at Panera was in the beginning. I loved who I worked with, but in time, the work became exhausting and unenjoyable."
good,"As a delivery driver, my days consist of helping out in the cafe when I'm not on delivery. This can include wiping down tables, refilling the bubblers (drinks), ,dishes, and if you're cross trained, cashier and working the line. When you're out on delivery your hourly pay goes down however tips will make up for that and depending on your location, tips will sometimes sum up to be more than what you would have made as a regular hourly associate."
good,They were very nice on working things out. They cared about their employees and were very lenient with scheduling. They had some flaws but what job doesnt. Fun and fast paced job but good to show you what the real world is.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,i strongly suggest for people to work for panera its very productive and a friendly team working environment the customers are very nice and patient and mangers and co workers work together effectively great
good,"At Panera Bread there’s so many things to do your always on your toes ready to do something else. Also there’s so many great people, not just employees but managers as well."
good,"I loved Panera as a whole, but it is an extreme amount of work and effort to maintain balance. I loved the community it has built within management, however the average associate seems disgruntled."
good,"One of the best jobs and management that i had, but it depends of every single Panera, a really good employee discount and the crew its really friendly"
good,I liked my time working a Panera Bread. I found the job rewarding with great benefits and fair pay. I particularly liked getting half off my meals when I was on duty.
good,I worked as a delivery driver downtown Grand Rapids and I loved it! It was very easy to learn and I made great tips! A super clean store and friendly employees.
good,"Depending on what shift you work, it can be pretty stressful. I worked in the dining, cleaning tables, making coffee, and other maintenance jobs. I really liked the morning shifts because people didn't come in until closer to lunch."
good,"i would take peoples orders. The management there was very good and understanding. The workplace environment was very nice, everyone there was very welcoming and willing to help me out when i  had first started out. The most enjoyable part of this job was bonding with all my co workers and the customers as well."
good,Super fun job; teaches time management and food production really well. Managers are amazing and employees are so cool to be around. Love this job so much!
good,"Great company with amazing morals. The management morals are even centered around hourly employees, making sure very employee knows their worth. Pay is higher than min wage but not quite livable on your own."
good,"It was a good first job. The starting pay isn’t bad for a teen and the better you get, the more pay. At 18 I was making 10 an hour with 40 hours a week then eventually 11 an hour. You get all the experience. Cashier, drive thru, etc. It is VERY stressful though if nothing get done correctly. The problem was the immaturity in the workplace. Management and coworkers wouldn’t get anything done and stand around and talk negatively on everyone for no good reason, which leaves the hard workers picking up slack."
good,"Slow and calm"
good,"Panera Bread was a great place to work, everyone there was incredibly friendly. It is a safe environment to work, challenging but fun. I would recommend to work there"
good,"Overall I had a great experience at Panera Bread, I only left in order to further my education in the field I want to pursue a career. I learned how to work in a fast paced environment and be on my feet all day long."
good,While at Panera you get to experience a whole bunch of different opportunities. There were many things Panera as a company has made me overcome. This job helps you learn about yourself how you learn how you adapt to situations etc. The hardest part of this job is knowing exactly what you need to do in the future to advance yourself.
good,Going into work is alway an eventful time getting greeted with head nods from customers and hellos fro co workers. Getting your task for the day half the time is different everyday but its always easy to check it and everyone is always helpful.
good,"I have worked as a delivery driver at panera for a few months now and I gotta say it is a pretty decent place to work, at least as a driver. The only job you really have is to work on the dishes, do pull thaws, and to deliver so it is really not stressful at all. Most of the time during the day when it gets really busy you see all the cooks and cashiers gettin' all stressed but it is lowkey nice because you ain't gotta do anything but take ya deliveries, and you don't really get any of the stressful part of the job. The tips are usually really nice because the food is so expensive, like yesterday i worked all day and made about 90$. You use an app called bringg which is pretty convient because it has all the delivery information for you and gives you the directions and lets the customer know when you have arrived so you don't have to call them and deal with all that complicated stuff. There is a lot of room for advancement as well, you can ask to learn any of the inshop jobs and it is also pretty easy to up your pay."
good,"I used to work for morning shift from 5am to 2pm. Of course, it is painful to wake up in the morning, but once I get off, I was able to do other stuffs that I had to focus on, such as school."
good,"I started working at Panera to have a job before grad school. When that didn't happen, I just stayed on. Panera is a good first time job for many students, and part time work is good for those in college, as well. The company provides paid training, and is good entry level work. Unfortunately my current position as daybaker is going to be ending, as they are getting rid of that position in my market. But cashiers and night bakers have access to many benefits and discounts."

good,"customer service rep "

good,Panera bread is a busy restaurant everyday and it's hard to learn everything when it's busy. You have to work hard everyday to become a great associate. I worked hard and learned fast to become one of leaders at panera bread.
good,Good food great crew lots of incentives and room for growth. Lots of details to pay attention to something to always keep you busy and past time pay could be a little higher.
good,If a person shows hard-work and dedication from the first day they are hired they have potential to grow within the business. I work at the Cerritos location and the environment is friendly.
good,Great staff and managers. Fast paced environment. Relatively easy job once you learn everything. Room for advancement and raises in you work hard to get noticed.
good,"Working at panera is great. My coworkers are funny and easy to get along with. The only problem is when it gets super busy (salad line during the summer) it can be very overwhelming and hard to get up with. Over time it gets a little better but very stressful. Besides that, very easy and good job. Great system and benefits."
good,"It's a very physically demanding job, but is also full of lots of good people.  From the moment you clock in until the moment you clock out there is never a rest period."
good,The energy there was amazing I felt at home. We always worked in teams so it was fun to go to work every day. I was pretty busy all the time so time goes by fast and eve faster when your having fun

good,"Many advancement opportunities, they were just slow about the process. Worked with your schedule and very friendly people. The company is moving in a great direction with their 100% clean foods."
good,"Good customer experience. Environment was good too. Busy a lot of the time, so it is important to be able to multitask despite where you're working for the day"
good,"Panera pays well, but the work is fast paced and stressful. The store has a hard time keeping adequate workers and we are often understaffed. Once there is a good worker, they'll work that person until they can't handle it anymore."
good,"The rules and regulations are strict, but the managers usually are lenient to make the working experience more fun. The dress code is also relaxed and inviting."
good,"unfortunately left Panera Bread's Livonia distribution center, to move back to Ohio, so that I could live another lifestyle. The work was great, the pay, the benefits, and the management were all good. The odd hours, were socially taxing, though my hobbies and interests aligned perfectly with them. The employees were pleasant, for the most part, I just didn't really fit in."
good,"I have gained a lot of knowledge working for this company. I started off as an associate then quickly moved to management. Upbeat, fast paced and multi tasking is a must!"
good,Panera Bread strives to provide excellent customer service to all clients. They aim to serve the best quality food and have a relaxing and enjoyable environment.
good,I loved working at Panera. I met so many wonderful people. The employees were amazing. They were very friendly and helpful. The environment was also great.
good,"Good work environment and atmosphere, not always nice management. It was a good first job for me and had a good starting salery at a little under $10 an hour."
good,"Panera provided me with the teamwork skills that I will need for the rest of my life. I was also able to gain a better understanding how to engage with customers and cater to their needs. The management was well organized and each of my managers was a stellar example of a leader. The most difficult part of working at Panera was how quickly each of us had to move when a lunch or dinner rush was upon us. Though at times I became stressed, I grew to be able to handle the fast paced environment."
good,"Panera was my first job. Management was great as well as the pay. My biggest issue was simply getting enough hours to work. Other than that, the people were great and I'm glad it was my first job. They trained me pretty well and I picked up on a lot of things fairly quickly."
good,"Easy job with good co workers and as well as good management. Another good part was the benefits you get as an employee. Although its a pretty good place to work, busy hours can be a pain because the place gets really crowded."
good,Panera is a great starter job and career. They work with most schedules and do their best to make things work. They offer decent starter pay and you can get promoted fairly easy as long as you are a good worker.
good,"Panera had a great atmosphere. There really wasn't any separation between shift leads, management and associates. Everyone was always willing to help out wherever needed."
good,"I love my job here but i will say the company is constantly changing the way things work and its not always for the better, the problem is you have people changing stuff who dont work in the day to day operations so they have no understanding of how things really work"
good,I really enjoyed working there. it was clean and safe and the management was great. the hardest part was the customers were rude and the best part was the other employees were great
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is usually understaffed most days; employees often find themselves having to run the cafe due to lack of management. There are usually 3-4 managers on duty during the days, usually 2 of which are stuck doing paperwork all day rather than working on the line. Fellow co-workers seem to always be close by whenever needed and willing to help. Hardest part of the job is closing down the cafe, making sure everything is spotless and ready to go for the next day; having so many tasks to do without an extra helping hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is having such close relationships with everyone you work with as well as all of the customers"
good,"I work in the Greenwood location , I have been welcomed and everyone is geniune ... They have worked with me and my schedule not really any complaints as they are very co operative. Management is great and honest, they care about there employees. You can truly be yourself and the customers are very nice especially some regulars."
good,I had good days working at Panrea bread. i learned a lot about how hey food are different from other food places. My co-workers they were cool and helpful people. The hardest part was when i first start working their when i had to do training and really talking customers order. But the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people an lerning new thins everyday.
good,"-Good job for upward mobility in management"
good,"Fast-paced workplace where customers always come first. 45 hour work week allows for ideal Work-life balance. Strong middle and upper management, providing great direction."
good,"Baking is less of traditional baking and more of shaping, proofing, and getting stuff out of the freezer to thaw. "
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with at this Panera Bread location. We also had customers that enjoyed coming into our cafe frequently because of the friendly environment we provided them. Panera is meant to be an everyday oasis for the customer, and that is what we provided."
good,"Panera bread is a great place to work in, yes it does have it's stressful moments but all you need to do is be at top of it, that's one thing learned from panera. The work environment is very friendly and the management too."
good,"A day in the life at Panera Bread is pretty easy due to the restaurants popularity, however sometimes during rush hour this place can get busy but still easy to maintain. While working here my customer service experienced has increased as well as my experience with handling food and following the established food handling procedures."
good,Panera Bread was a great experience for me and really made me expand my own expectations of myself. i learned daily throughout my time there and was never unhappy to come to work nor treated poorly. it was there where i truly gained a substantial amount of management experience and am grateful for the time i was able to call myself a proud employee of the corporation.
good,"I absolutely adore working for Panera. Their ""No Jerks"" hiring qualifier is both a great ice breaker introduction into the culture and a genuine reality. Even co-workers with hot tempers are, at their core, good and honest people. "
good,"Always busy, never really boring, always have something to do if it's not cleaning you're attending to guests, always keeping your station stocked."
good,"A typical day at work would be I would start greeting people and taking their order. I would have to complete a list of side work before my shift was over. I learned the greatness of working in customer service. I also learned, team membership and leadership. My co workers were very nice and helpful. The managers were like that as well. There honestly wasn't a hard part to this job. The most enjoyably part was seeing how happy the customers faces were when the would walk out."
good,"good company, good benefits , amazing management, people very friendly, team player the most enjoyable part is the lunch break wich is 30 minutes and I have good supervisor plus good manager, I learned a lot of skills and experience finally  Panera bread the best place I have worked until now good blas my company and all management people with employees."
good,"At Panera Bread you receive a variety of different customers. Some will be regular customers and already know what they wish to consume. The managers are helpful in terms of flexibility and means us assistance if needed. My coworkers work as a team some are a little more knowledgeable than others. They encourage you to keep smiling even if you're having a tough day. The hardest part was I found was the clean up process afterward, but eventually that became easier. I think the most enjoyable part of working at Panera Bread is meeting the variety of people and getting a glimpse of different cultures."
good,"Panera Bread offers flexible scheduling, and a friendly work environment. At the cafe I work at, there is a very close team."
good,"There are many things why I like Panera Bread. For example, Panera is very diverse, coworkers are friendly and the 65% discount on food. A typical day at work for me is showing up on time and greet my coworkers. After I do that I clock in and start doing prep. There are some days that I am on line (making sandwiches, salads, etc.) Sometimes I have an 7-8 hours shift so they put me on line and do prep or do prep and wash dishes.  I have worked at Panera Bread in Ridgedale, Minnetonka and the one in Brooklyn Center and the coworkers and very kind and friendly. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I could do pretty much anything. The only things that I don't know what to do is cashier and make drinks. Knowing a lot has helped me enjoy my job even more because I am not just in one place but rather everywhere."
good,Very fun to work here! The customers on average are alright but the management was great and I miss working with them. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers and people with odd requests right before close.
good,"Panera Bread was a great place to work. My days was always filled with excitement and joy. I enjoyed the customers that I got to interact with on a day-to-day basis, and also how the customer took grasp of the culture we was showing at Panera Bread."
good,Never is a dull day. There is always something to do and a new challenge everyday. I have learned so much about what creates a business.
good,"open store bakery 530am"
good,Great place to work for a college student. Met people my age and gained valuable work experience. Developed a servants mentality and humble work ethic.
good,"Great company to work for. If you feel that you are a great worker, then this could be for you! Fast promotions if you are truly a great worker. Really flexible on the hours you need. Great company that has the ability to help you if you get hurt and are unable to work."
good,"I've been working for Panera since November of 2013. I transferred across the country when I moved and it was a very easy process. Schedule is very flexible. The scheduling manager really does try to make everyone happy. I love the people I work with. The job can get tedious but the people are what get you through the day. Customers can be mean, but that's any customer service job. Advancement is encouraged. Half of both the managing teams I worked with started out as associates and I have watched at least 10 people move up the ladder. I highly recommend it to high school and college kids. They work with school schedules very well!"
good,Panera offers an oasis to the customers and demands that the staff are kind and friendly to their customers. A typical day of work was enjoyable. It's an easy job. Your coworkers become family. Communication with managers is vital for success.
good,"Great place to work.  My motto there is teamwork makes the dream work.  We work as a team, and we get the job done.  It is a fast pace work environment, but it makes the time pass quickly"
good,"PANERA!!! The typical day would be assisting customers with their orders, completing transactions, keeping the dining room, bathroom, drink station, and behind the counter as clean as possible. I learned to operated a touch screen cash register and I even learned how to make cookies! My co-workers were full of personality and great to work with and I can say the same about the management team as well, they were very supportive. The hardest part of the job would be if someone didn't show up for their shift I would have to cover well at least try to cover the front counter and the dining room all alone. The most enjoyable part would be the opportunities that were possible and the times where we would get new dishes and desserts!"
good,"A typical work day working at Panera Bread, was very long and busy! I learned how to make there beverages and work the register. The management was good. The hardest part was learning out everything."
good,"Fun place to work, love the employees that I worked with when I was there. Some of the management does not help out. The catering lady need to find her own team to help out with her stuff, because she put us behind every time."
good,"fast paced morning, with unbelievable culture.  At Panera Bread i grew close to customers from taking their orders, and being one  of the first people to see them on a daily basis.  I did basically an hour of food preparation, and also washed dishes during down time."
good,"Panera isn't a terrible place to work, in fact i liked it okay. I worked there momentarily because of personal issues, and I wouldn't return because of said issues. The food is great and so is the discount, but my feet always hurt and their soup in a bag is pretty gross."
good,"Panera Bread offers a lot when it comes to advancing up in the company, but to do so you have to get your hands dirty working in a fast paced environment serving food like an assembly line. I learned a lot working in the food industry and I am glad it was with Panera Bread"
good,"I had to do all bakery requirements. I learn to shape, mold and mark bread. My management wasn't so good but made the best of it. I loved my coworkers but barely got to see them because I was a baker which is independent work. The hardest part of the job was time management to get all baked goods done but I always succeed. I enjoyed the job because I got to learn new things and I also shared my ideas and opinions."
good,"Over the 8 years working for the company I worked at three different stores, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Virginia is the location of my home store. I had the pleasure of meeting a wide variety of people. Despite the fast paced environment we still managed to have fun and enjoy one another through both difficult and easy times. Working with this company helped me grow as an individual. The management I had the joy of working with were caring individuals, they were like the parents of the Panera family. Every store I left, I had a strong bond with the managers that ran it. The most difficult part of the job would have been taking leaps to try and make a customer happy but nothing you do seems to satisfy them. The biggest lesson I walked away with while working for the company would be compassion for others."
good,"I typically work Monday-Friday early morning (5AM-6AM) until early afternoon (1:30PM-2:30PM). I have learned a lot of great skills with my job, especially with being a catering coordinator. I have also had the opportunity to open three stores, one of which I currently work at. I have learned a tremendous amount about the restaurant industry, as well higher end catering industry. "
good,it was alright just not enough money to live on. I loved working by myself
good,I worked there during my first year of college and it was a pretty great  place.  Quickly became friends with almost everyone I worked with.  My only complaints are ones you'd hear from any other food service job.
good,"My personal experiences working with Panera Bread have been nothing but positive. Every person I have met within the brand has a wonderful attitude and is service focused. They demand a lot of their staff but take care of them well. A good training program and a focus on development from within creates a lot of upward mobility. These constant opportunities allow you to take from the job what you want not what your stuck with. Overall, a wonderful company to work for."
good,i learned so much from this job and manager. learned that there is always something to do everywhere. stay busy and keep customers happy. i miss working here as well. although the wages should be higher.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread is fun but busy. You get to learn a lot of things about people and you know when they are having a bad day and a good day. I always like trying to ask how there days going and trying to make them feel better. Managers are good they help you if you need help, they are always walking around talking to customers, greeting them, and just being friendly. Co-workers do the same they help you whenever you need it  if their not busy themselves. The most enjoyable thing is interacting with customers and just being around people. The job is not very hard besides when we're busy and your trying to make drinks and then there are people at your register waiting for you to help them."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,My general manager always found time to teach and guide me in her store.  The crew was always pleasant.  Completely organized.
good,"There is never a dull moment, one minute no orders next minute there are twenty orders. It is a hard job but very reward full."
good,"As a cashier, who is also trained on many other things, like I was, they begin to expect more of you. So, my typical day involved a lot of ""floating,"" which means I would often be needed in other parts of the store, and would need to switch positions regularly. No one day was the same for me. I would work as a cashier, then I would move to the back of the house to do dishes, and sometimes help on the line, preparing meals. I would often need to go out to the dining room and bus tables as well. I learned a lot about multitasking because of this, along with social skills and cash handling. The management was among the best I've experienced, as they were always available to help and listen to your concerns. My co-workers were wonderful people, and would always lend a hand, if needed. The hardest part of the job would most likely be that I didn't always know what position I was scheduled to be in for that day. I would think I was scheduled mainly as a cashier, and they would need me most in another position. Again, that is mainly because I was trained for so many different things. I enjoyed that aspect of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be my work environment. My customers, my co-workers, and my managers. I also could have unlimited coffee, which was a great benefit."
good,"After 10+ years as a server, working in a bakery cafe was definitely a unique experience. I met some interesting people, and came to know most of the regular guests by name. I had an excellent general manager named Colby Cooper, unfortunately he's no longer employed there, but he really turned the store, it's employees, and sales around in his stay there. He was an inspiration to his employees, was stern but understanding, and had no problem rolling up his sleeves and working side by side with his employees to get a job done."
good,"a typical day at work is when i clock in and whipe down some tables and buss them too. What ive learn in my job is how to serve food an bus tables. The management was ok they were mostly busy and the employees used to try to tell me what to do, which was the managers job. Some co workers was really fun to work with but others were kinda rude. The hardest part of my job was when the restaurant gets really busy ill have to serve food and bus tables at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job is when meet different kind of people."
good,Was/Is a wonderful place to work if you love to bake such as I do. A place to work on your own or as a team player.
good,it was good went through tons of managers younger co workers pretty easy for the most part
good,"good company to work for. Good environment, nice people. Learned a lot of costumer service. Manager can always work with you if you need help completing a task."
good,"As a cashier I enjoyed the work environment, management and co-workers.  Took orders and depending on where I was stationed I prepared orders (bakery side)."
good,"Its a great place to work, they are understanding. Co-workers are good, except for those few. Training was fun and easy and fast. Customers are great"
good,Management is very motivating and helpful. This company's core values is inspiring. They have a lot of good customers for the most part which is enjoyable.
good,"panera has done a lot of great things, its a great company to be a part of. Great work environment, I had fun at work."
good,Great management

good,Panera bread have great opportunites at job advancement. you can bbe promoted if you demonstrate leadership and responsiblity.
good,I loved the atmosphere and people. The management and career opportunities were great as well.
good,"I worked in the dining room and loved everything about my job. Meeting new people and regulars daily. I learned customer service/people skills, working well with others. My management not so polite. co-workers were great but one; but we always have one bad apple, right? The hardest part of my job was pleasing all the people all the time. The most enjoyable part of my job was showing up for work everyday."
good,"I learned a lot, the thing I really learned is that I wanted to move up in a company. Panera does offer this but it takes a long time."
good, Responsible for the handling of monetary transactions
good,"I like working in restaurants. it can be very stressful at times, but if you train your staff well and you have a good management in place it can be all worth it!"
good,"Panera bread was very fast pased, you need to be able to move as quick and accurate as possible too make sure all orders are right and all the food is prepped and ready before the work day begins. They are very accurate with there orders and rarely mess up."
good,"Balancing the cash register, Cleaning diner area, Greet people. Bakery"
good,I get in at 8 am and prep bread and sweets till about 4 pm. I have learned a'lot about myself working there for 6 years. The management is well management they have there good and bad days. The people i work with are good hard workers. The hardest part of my job is the busy hours between 11-2. The best part of the job is the people that make it fun to work there.
good,"It's usually really busy at Panera, as soon as you clock in you have work to do. I learned to always please the guests no matter what because they are our business. The management is awesome, better than any other job I've had before. My co-workers are even more awesome because they really do care about you and make you feel comfortable and welcomed. I think the hardest part of the job is when we have over 85 catering orders with only three people working on the line, trying to make breakfast, opening the line, making croutons, bacon, all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of my job is the staff and we all just try to have fun and care for each other."
good,"The typical day consists overseeing the day to day operations of the cafe. Making sure it is staffed correctly, product is in abundance, everyone is doing their jobs and keeping the customers happy. In doing this job I have learned a great deal about patience, because when things get a little hectic and they do; there is no room for freaking out. The management is great, they are willing to work with you when you need it and they are just all around great people. Co-workers and the staff are wonderful. The hardest part of this job was having to work all different hours when my children were younger. The most enjoyable part was just getting to see and talk to all different people."
good,"I was transfered to the Airport location 5 years ago. It was a Cafe at the time with many opportunities. I helped insuring rules and regulations as well as cost saving measures. I helped to train many other managers as they came to our locaiton. The co-workers where a lot of fun to work with as we worked as a team. The hardest part of my job at the time, would have to be saying good bye to associates and managers who choose another path. The most enjoyable part of my job would be talking with my quest, learning their names and learning a lot about them."
good,"Great work environment, lots of opportunities for advancement. Benefits and training classes. Associate trainer outings and rewards for good work ethic. Friendly management and co-workers."
good,"very nice place to work at. I can't afford to work at the job as much anymore because of school, My responsibility have got more strict now, I have to pay for a car and pay for many other things."
good,i enjoyed working here...everyone was friendly and you get to know all the regulars that come in...when you know your customers order as you see them walking in the door it makes them feel special...
good,"i liked working at panera bread, as a manager it was fun to be able to interact with everyone pretty well. You were apart of a team, and everyone was on the same page about making sure customers are satisfied at all times."
good,They look for hardworking and ask you to do your best for the company. The culture is busy and active. Good probability for advancement within the company if you're interested.
good,"Good company, very community involved, very employee diversified"
good,"Panera bread would only be batter if the amount of money payed was a bit higher because living in Boca Raton is very expensive. "
good,We do what we need to do but our managers don't get after us constantly to do it. They tall us what needs to be done and trust us to be able to handle it.
good,"The people at Panera and the atmosphere it creates is amazing, it keeps you on your toes and I have made plenty of new friends in the past few months."
good,"I enjoyed my days as a truck driver,  great place to work. good people."
good,"This was my first actual job, and ended up staying there for longer than I thoughr I would. Mainly due to the fantastic people that worked there, as well as a fun and fast paced environment that gives you many opportunities to grow."
good,I emjoyed this job the bosss were fun and kind. Some of my employees were kinda stuck up though. The drive wasn't bad and the pay i felt was okay. They didnt overwork anyone and you got your break on time everytime.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera was extremely stressful but extremely fun at the same time. At my location we would be super busy but everyone would remain positive and always have a smile on their face. It was great as a first time job and gave me a great experience.
good,"Pretty nice, Loved the managers, work was hard but the people made it much better to work at. The other Paanera was not so happy with a strict manager, yet the work was still bearable. So It all depends on the people you are working with."
good,"I worked for this company on and off for 5 years, I loved and hated it at times. When I first started I really enjoyed it, my bosses and coworkers were all great to work with. A lot of them had been there for years, starting in high school and stayed throughout their college careers. For me that really said a lot, especially in an industry where a high turnover rate is typically to be expected. There were times where the lunch rush would be hard to get through but everyone gave it 110% especially our GM and with everyone working together we got through it. I had a lot of respect for most of the managers and their work ethics. Except for one but he eventually got fired for stealing..."
good,"i loved working here. i had great management with a great team.   "
good,My typica day at work was easy I got bullied for being younger and since I was new there. Management was good hard working managers and were very friendly.
good,Busy and good discount. Fun place to work and can't be lazy. Good food makes your proud to work there. Good pay and good people to work with. Good paid vacation time.
good,Panera Bread has given me the opportunity to grow personally as well as professionally. I've been able to work my way up and been given endless opportunities to continue to grow.
good,"liked working here overall. fast paced, good team, everyone got along. sometimes wanted more hours but wouldnt deal with overtime. had very good managers."
good,Friendly and enjoyable work environment. Busy at times especially during lunch and dinner. Meeting new people and building a relation with the regular customers. Time management is a great quality to have especially for catering.
good,Working at Panera Bread is not just a job for me it was like my second home. My second family the workers there are all delightful of course we have our moments like all family's do but that never got in the way of our true connection.
good,It was mostly the people that made the workplace a fun place to be. I can believe that I was very lucky to get co workers who quickly became my friends and made it really feel like a team effort. Even my managers were blessedly amazing and always willing to help me in not only day to day work but if I had issues outside of work that affected it.
good,"Management could use some disciplined approach when it comes to the 16-19 yr. old employees. The molding of these youths can instill a better work ethic, as well as promote a higher overall employee morale, if they are not ""coddled"" so much."
good,"Everything will go smoothly as long as everyone works together and do their jobs correctly and preparations right, in a timely manner. Usually, on a typical day at work, you clock in and prepare for the next rush to come in."
good,Working at Panera Bread was a very fun time. I learned more at Panera Bread than any other job I have held. I would definitely recommend both the food and the job to others.
good,Co-workers are always ready to help each other out. Its a fun environment to work in. The managers are really down to earth and approachable. They always step in when we get busy.
good,"I work as a food prep and dishwashing associate. I am typically in the back with very little interaction with anyone, so I typically listen to music while i work."
good,"I would answer inbound calls, LIVE chat, and email at the corporate office. It was a very fast paced place to work. You must be able to multi-task. I learned a lot about the company and products. The managment was great. My manager was very professional and friendly. My coworkers were great! Very friendly and loved to have fun as long as their work was done. The workplace environment was very fast paced and fun. The hardest part of the job was sitting for long periods of time with no break in between calls. The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment of the job and the atmosphere. I would reccomend this job to someone who wants to sit down and work, have the freedom do view social media while not on the phone, and who can multi-task."
good,"Panera bread is a great entry level company for people that are looking to start their career. Panera Bread offers many advantages to its' people, and helps them."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The people I worked with honestly had the biggest impact on me with this job. The managers actually make you feel important, if you called in sick they would make sure to text you and ask how you are feeling. They asked questions to get to know you as a person, friend, and not just another coworker. The hardest part of the job was honestly closing the bakery, but it was all worth it. I loved working there"
good,"Enjoyable company to work for with a mix between fast-paced and relaxed work environment, respectable work culture, dedicated staff and management, flexible scheduling and generally straight-forward work flow, I definitely recommend Panera Bread to any high school student looking for part time or any college student looking to add to their resume in the restaurant/food/bread industry."
good,"I loved working there, but I didn't get payed enough for my service. I learned to have more patience for myself. At my workplace everyone got along well together even the managers. I would work there again."
good,Employees in Panera are all very nice and helpful to new people on the job. Working there is enjoyable and there are many varieties of options to advance your career there.
good,"Great place to work in general; would recommend the GM position in ""mid volume"" bakery-cafes for optimal ""work-life balance"". There are high expectations for all staff members which keeps a consistent drive for success."
good,"I am glad that I chose Panera to begin my career in IT.  I have been given a great opportunity to work for a company that cares about their employees and literally has a ""no jerks"" allowed policy!  "
good,the people to work with are great not a lot of stuff management is great come in do what your told and get your job done a great place to work hard to get fired if good worker
good,"Panera Bread is a constantly evolving industry leading company, who is highly involved with the community and place a very strong emphasis on quality of life."
good,"Overall was a good place to work, I enjoyed the associates that worked with me and the fellow managers knew what they were supposed to do. It was a pretty easy job for the most part, but that also had its draw backs. I didn't often learn new things, because of the job being fairly easy. The pay was a plus. I would say the only enjoyable part of the job was the people, joking around with associates and customers really livened up the day."
good,"Made many great friends working at the store I did. It was an extended family from my own that I met there. Depending on the store, work was either casual or busy during the holidays."
good,I love this company and had a great time working for them! I had to leave the company due to the fact that I had to move to Pennsylvania. If I hadn't had to move I would still be with this company!
good,Company is very good quality. I started off at 7.50 and ended at 11.50 I was offered 12.50 to stay. Its a great first job. I worked at the company for 3 years. You have a lot of opportunity to move up in the company.
good,"A typical day at Panera is usually quite busy, due to the establishment at which you work. Very positive and friendly work place, fast working pace required. Management works very well with your schedule, especially if you are a student. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep everything stocked while its extremely busy at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is going to work every day with a great group of people that treat you like family."
good,"It was a very fast paced job with good, hardworking employees. Great place to work for quick advancement. I learned a lot at Panera and would recommend to everyone."
good,"while working at panera bread, it was very relaxed and settle. unlike most food places, and clean. this is a place where highschool students would like working, it isnt so fast paced.and the food is wonderful and tasteful"
good,Enjoy working with the company. Ive been with them for several years. Very good at working with your schedule. Ive had the ability to move up in thd company progressing my compensation at the same time. Friendly people to work with and a very structured establishment. Tools for anything you are unsure of are always available.
good,"Your coworkers are your friends. Management is there to manage, they can be friendly but at the end of the day, they are in charge. Its a great company, with delicious food. Hardest part of the job was customers, and I enjoyed regulars that understood that the wait isn't our fault but the masses of patrons coming to eat."
good,"I enjoy working the morning hours. "
good,"It has been my home for several years now and has helped me grow and develop into a talented manager. That might have been the management teams, but I find it a bit too coincidental that all my teams were as good as they were. Panera has a culture and that is rare in the professional world."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The store I work at is currently very understaffed, but the managers all work very hard to try making up for it. My co-workers are the reason I work here."
good,This was my first job in the food industry. It taught me to communicate effectively with various types of people of different age groups. I learned my first sense of responsibility in this job.
good,I liked it here because there was always something to do and the system works really well. I had a lot of fun but not everyone was able to do the things I did.
good,"As long as you are willing to put in the work, you will grow in this company. The compensation when starting out is low, but as you move up its market value."
good,"Good fast fresh and different. "
good,i enjoyed working at Panera Bread. learned a lot of work ethics and patience when working there. very fast pace and the customers where always satisfied with the food so it was great
good,It is a wonderful place to work. You always stay busy which makes your shift go by quickly and management is very appreciative of your hard work.
good,The managment is great as is the staff.  The only downside to working in my soecific store was that there was not room for advancment as quickly as I would have liked.
good,"In a 3:AM start production planning for fresh dough facility. Enter all orders and format daily scheduling for production of all dough to be made in the plant for that day. Have all schedules out to mixers by 5:45AM. Depending on given day, start inventory, AP, payroll, or debit/credits for the week. Continue to watch the e-mail for the add-on's to the customer's original order and make sure the items get added. Watch the email and do other above duty, depending on the day, until 10:AM. Close production in computer and invoice all orders for that day. Separate invoices by route for the truck drivers and put in drivers mail boxes for delivery with dough transports for next morning. Finish daily duties and filing of all receiving that comes in for the day. Usually not finishing until 1-2PM."
good,"Like to make sure I am prepared at start of shift,take time to strive for the best quality of product,co-workers and management are team players and willing to help out. Very pleasant place to work"
good,"Fun environment and I loved the people I worked with. I gained busing and customer service experience, and more cash register experience, as well."
good,Panera Bread is this best place to work if your going to school and have other activities out side of work. Management will also be there for you on or off the clock. Great place to work place. If any time there's going to be a change in the company they'll also let you know  a month in advance.
good,Our team at Panera Bread in Maryland was like a second family. We always had each others backs. Panera was very customer focused and made our bakery café an everyday oasis for our customers. We took pride in the service and quality of food we were providing. The hardest part of the job was late night shifts and very few weekends off to spend with family. The best part of working there were the people. Both staff and guests. We really got to know them on a personal level and looked forward to seeing them everyday.
good,"Haven't worked for the company in years. Wasn't too bad of a workplace. If you were good at your job, you got treated as such."
good,I love working at panera but lately management has cut down people's hours unfairly. The workers and management are all friendly though.
good,Panera is a great company to work for and I have learned a lot about customer service and leadership from working there.
good,"At Panera, I would work with others to meet the needs of customers to provide a pleasant visit to the restaurant.  As well as cleaning the facility and prepping for the next day.  I enjoyed meeting new people and interacting with the many different customers.  The hardest part of the job would be to provide the customer with their meal quickly during very busy times of the day, but by working together and multitasking we were able to do it."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread was my first job and I am so grateful for the experience because I truly loved working there. Working at Panera was definitely time consuming and a lot of hard work because of the physical labor but I loved every second of it. The hardest part of the job were the long hours. I enjoyed the hours I worked, but sometimes I would work doubles (5am-10pm). The best part of the job was everything else! The management, the co-workers, the food, the environment, the customers! I was working while I was studying business management and I am thankful for Panera teaching me about real life business. I learned about accounting, the numbers, deposits, management, and I was even able to role-play as a manager. What I will take away from Panera the most, is that, I became an Associate Trainer in record time through hard work and determination."
good,"A typical day at work was taking customers' orders on the register; preparing bagels, pastries, bread, and smoothies; stocking refrigerators; and cleaning. I learned that the customers are the #1 priority in every company and how much we value customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I put a smile on a customer's face because of the excellent service I provided."
good,It was amazing to work with an amazing group of people.  They costumers we're amazing people. I'd learn something new about people everyday.
good,"Panera Bread displays a good balance for beginners in the workforce. Their management is very organizes and prepared. My co-workers usually get along and cooperate in the workforce. I've learned many things such as preparing food faster, and balancing on clean to provide efficiency and speed. The hardest part of the job was possibly the food. To remember what is what while being timed is very hard and difficult to concentrate. The other hardest parts of the job is when it is very slow. I've enjoyed doing dishes the most on my job."
good,"Panera Bread is a very strong company, both with management and within the employees. They produce only the best, and at the end of the day, I really do feel accomplished with the job I have done."
good,"I started as an associate and worked my my to assistant manager. Good company, excellent training for employees"
good,Great Co to work for they treat there people very well But if your looking for full time dont look here
good,"Typical day at work would be, to come to work with a good attitude and do everything it takes to keep your customers happy. I have learned to work your hardest and to put your all into a job so you put yourself in for an advancemrnt.I loved my co workers managent was good as well.Hardest part was to make sure my customers are happy with my service im giving them so they know to come back."
good,"Starting the day off, going to the back of the house putting on the apron. Then your off to clocking in. Go to your designated area. Co-workers and I talking about what happened so far threw out the day. Closing the store down, having to clean and prep for the morning crew is the least enjoyed task. Talking with costumers about there day is a highlight in my day."
good,"I genuinely do like working here, it’s a bit “far” from where I live but that’s not necessarily a problem. the co workers at the location I currently work at are generally nice and greet you as you come in."
good,"Panera is a culture. Those who want to work beside people with ambition to move forward will fit nicely. The experience at Panera is consuming. It takes a lot from you, but returns quite a lot of itself."
good,"All in all I’ve learned you have to be a team player in a work field like this. You’ll learn a lot during your experience. Your working with differ foods which is good it keeps you open minded about other foods and recipes. Lastly, remaining with the potential of keeping up with the pace/flow, not rushing but at a reasonable time/speed."
good,It was a great experience.I enjoyed my time working at panera bread.They had an excellent management crew.The work environment was very friendly.I would recommend this job to more.
good,"Enjoyable work environment, very friendly and customer oriented. Co-Workers made job fun and less stressful. Very easy to get acquainted with the work environment."
good,A good place to work with really flexible hours and would be a great job for first time workers. everyone in the store is really cool and laid back if u do your job
good,"Panera is a great place to work. I was in training to become a baker, and had the position of baker assistant to begin with. Everything was going good as I was learning the ropes and procedures of prepping, baking, decorating, and cleaning. "
good,"Relaxed work environment, working on , own time frame in order to prep all the necessary for the next day to run smoothly. Really enjoyed the time I spent there with my former co workers"
good,"Team meetings were nice, most of the time we were done with work on time as a team, wasn’t that stressful.. pretty easy. Everyone knew how to help each other so we could stay ahead of the rush"
good,"It had the potential to be really frustrating or really easy and chill. You need to think on your feet if your the night Baker, my position. Need to be clean and very organized!"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I really like the people everyone is really nice, it's actually like a little family and the managers are cool I genuinely wouldn't be leaving if school wasn't in the way and stuff. the workday is fast paced but not difficult when you get used to it and everyone is really helpful."
good,This is the third Panera location I've worked at. I loved how willing management was to adhere to my availability. Hours were great. I prefer a set schedule and they provided it to me. It was a little understaffed at times but it balanced with the number of customers we had.
good,"Panera Bread taught me many valuable skills that i have used at many different jobs . Such as, how to work under pressure without becoming frustrated or flusterd."
good,"Working at Panera, I learned many skills to help myself in any career, such as leadership, being responsible for myself, and trusting others. The best part about working there was the friendly co workers and managers that I had. We all got along well. Also, there was opportunity to move up within the company. One of the bad things about working there was there were no benefits for associates, only GM and AGM positions received benefits."
good,Food was not my cup of tea but the people working were all very friendly and open towards hwlping new workers out. I rarely felt left out of the loop and the evwnt the company would have were fun and entertaining.
good,"fast paced, awsome management team, on going seasonal training, learned alot about catering, most enjoyable part of my day was meeting new clients and customers"
good,There were very nice people and staff at Panara Bread. The hours were comfortable and the food options were great. The environment was clean and well maintained.
good,Now that we moved from those heavy bulky cabinets to light no hassle bakery baskets. this job is easy than ever I sometimes work 7hrs a day depending on my route but at the most I'd work 10hrs but still this is by far the easiest stuff you can do as a delivery driver not all panera fdf are doing this yet but be patient my friends they'll all be like this in the next few years easy money baby!!!
good,I really enjoyed working there. The atmosphere is very relaxed. I loved seeing all the regular customers as well as new people. I really liked the crew that I worked with. And the management team was one of the best I've ever had
good,"i absolutely loved working at panera. you get a 50% off discount for your meals ! Also everyone gets tips ! Everyone was friendly and caring. It was sometimes a stressful environment, but if things got busy, a manager would always step in to help."
good,"At times it can get stressful with customer lines out the door, however with food management and a good team, it can be a breeze. Low stress, plenty of opportunities to move up in the company as well."
good,This job was my very first job. It taught me great customer service and great baking skills. The managers were awesome. They made sure everyone felt safe and secure while also have fun while doing their job.
good,Panera was my first job and although i have had many second jobs along the way that was always a constant because its such a warm place to belong to .
good,The hardest part about working at Panera was learning stricter work ethics then I was used to at previous restaurants I have worked at. The management there cares about their customers and the employees that work there. They're advocates of clean food and employee benefits. I love working at Panera because the management lets you have opportunities learning different positions throughout the cafe. The funnest part of working there is getting used to what's expected and being able to provide more.
good,Management can get iffy but the people are great. Food is great and prepared well. Healthy clean Enviorment. I think that the cafe could sometimes use more hands but that is not the management's fault. Unfortunately there are not always available employees that meets the standardsame. I really enjoy working for a company with such healthy benefits to there style of life.
good,"I have been working at Panera Bread full-time (Less than a year)"
good,Panera creates a very flexible schedule for students. I was able to stay at my old job due to the great work the managers do with scheduling.
good,I love going to work. This was my first job. I was always at the  job I felt like I lived there. I love actually go back if I got paid more l
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera felt like family to me. Every staff member was so supportive and helpful especially when you are being trained. We all helped each other out and we worked well as a team. If any one of us had a bad day, every other staff member made sure to make their shift more enjoyable. I made a lot of lifelong friends here and still keep in contact with many of the current staff. Panera is a close-knit family and the managers are always looking to better their employees and encourage them to continue the good work. Being able to make friends with the staff and customers was by far my favorite part of working at Panera, I loved socializing with everyone and getting to know all the regular customers. I also learned a lot about myself working here. I learned I liked to relate to people and make their Panera experience better."
good,"This work experience provided me an opportunity to develop basic customer service skills.  I was able to interact with the general public, serve tables and be responsible to maintain a clean and safe work environment."
good,"My overall experience with working for Panera was great, the only thing that got in the way was my mental health issues at the time; I couldn't handle the hustle and bustle of working in a fast-service cafe. The whole staff felt like a little family, and it was always so fun coming in to work. The managers were so great and helpful, they didn't mind getting their hands dirty and actually helping us on the line or doing anything, really. The scheduling was FANTASTIC. All we had to do was ask for the ""Days-Off Book"" and put our names on the date that we wanted off, and normally it wouldn't be a problem at all. It's a great place to work for college students like me!"
good,Good upward mobility. Team members were always helpful and so was management. Definitely a good place to work. The clientele are also very decent for the restuarant business.
good,"Its a very laid back job. Panera Bread in Waco Texas is a cooperate café. we train all different types of people, which makes it interesting to work there. You get to meet a lot of people. Good benefits, loyal  associates. Its one of the busiest cafes in the hemisphere. The most enjoyable part of working their is being accepted as one of their own."
good,I love working at panera bread.  I am a trained cashier and line cook. my job is to take orders answer phones and keep the store organized  . As a cook my job is to make sure food is made properly and plated according to standards.  I learned to deal with food the proper and safer way
good,"The job is pretty straight forward and has many possibilities for advancement as long as you put the work in. The job can be stressful at time but the friends you can make from working there will save you from some of the stress. You'll be able to meet tons of people, some of who can help you later on in life."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be come in and immediately start pre-closing. Cleaning, and restocking. Managers are cool. They are very understanding when things come up and also are genuinely caring. Every co-worker has something special about them. They are all very fun to work with. The hardest part about the job is when it gets extremely crowded and we start to run out of things. Working at the Bread Company is an overall enjoyable job to work with. The customers for the most part are friendly. Most of the customers are there everyday. Its a great way to interact with new people."
good,count my draw before i start.. run the food to the customers. clean make drinks
good,The fact that Panera is a company that promotes within is very respectable to me. The rewards for dependability and a job well done is evedent from the low turnover rate amungst their employees. Paneras focus on core values and quality is evedent in their longstanding history of freindly neighrbhood hospitality.
good,"Panera was such an amazing place to work. The environment was always positive and my coworkers became my best friends. Panera is truly a place of growth,"
good,I Honestly Love And Enjoyed.   Every Moment Working As A Cashier At Panera Bread The Employes All The Way Down To The Customers Were Wonderful It Was Just To Far Out And The Pay Was Not That Great I Just Felt It Wasn't Worth All That Hassle .
good,This job gives room for advancement! Good team environment if that is what you are looking for in a job. It is a nice first job because it allows you to learn important things that will help on any job.
good,"The employees there have high energy and amazing work ethic. Fast paced, clean, dedicated. Panera was definitely one of my best jobs that I loved going to everyday"
good,So many good things came out of my delivery position . I had some good experiences a so far with my schedule and the support from my managers and shift leaders are unbelievably supportive in a rough time in my life . I recommend this position highly.
good,"Panera Bread is located in the food court section of the Menlo Park Mall. On the weekends or the holidays there is a greater volume of customers. A typical shift includes getting work assignments, greeting customers, filling orders and assisting managers with various tasks including employee training. The hardest part of my job is the holiday volume, while the most enjoyable part is interacting with both staff and customers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"it was a nice job but did get very busy and kind of tedious sometimes especially when you only had 1 15 minute break during rush times. I would work here again if it was absolutely necessary, I would prefer to work for an engineering company of course."
good,"I didn’t get enough hours to survive at Panera, but the management was excellent. In particular, the management at the location at George Mason University’s Hoffman Center was very good of all the Paneras I worked for."
good,"i loved working at and for panera, it was one of the best emplayersz that i have ever worked for in my lifetime, which is not very long seeing i am only 28 years old but i am sure that i will have better empoyers throughout my life"
good,"clock in then greet everyone, get straight to working the dish pit, id buss tables when available time to do so and i would also clean tables and keep work place tidy and neat. i would help out the next shift by preping food for following day. i learned to look out for me fellow co workers and to manage time wisely as well as work ethic"
good,"Working at Panera has all around been a great experience. It teaches you a lot about yourself, people, and customer service. Id recommend this anyone."
good,"Panera Bread was a good job. But, i didn't get many hours and i think it was just a season job. They have a clean work environment and work good with their customers."
good,"Not too bad, good pay for a starting job. nice people to work with. good, healthy food. can be hard at times but everyon worksa together as a team."
good,"Work day's at Panera Bread varied with the position i was assigned to work; certain day's i would prep various meats and vegetables for the entire restaurant according to specifications, other day's i would work in the dining room with a heavy emphasis on customer service and focusing on patrons needs, other day's still i would work behind the kitchen line making sandwiches. Panera Bread reinforced my already strong belief and practice of focusing on the customer and providing them with prompt, friendly service regardless of the situation. My favorite position and most enjoyable aspect of the job was most certainly working the dining room floor because i could focus solely on the customer and attend to their needs. I have nothing except the utmost praise for my fellow co-workers and management staff. Everyone was amicable, benevolent, helpful, willing to answer questions, overall very easy to work with"
good,Working at Panera Bread taught me a lot about working with different people.  It also taught me a lot about customer service.
good,"My cafe was a very small one, but we had a lot of fun times and everyone was friends. My work days consisted of being on the line (where the food is made), then switching over to service/dish washing, then sometimes going back to the line. It was pretty slow there, so we all basically did everything and sometimes only had two people on the out working, one on the registers and one on the line. The person on the line would also run the food out. This only happened during the hours when it was very slow, around 3-4pm. The hardest part of the job was speedily making the food, keeping every order in the three minute window. The most enjoyable part, though, was getting to get acquainted with the regulars; the people who would come in nearly every day, order the same thing, sit in the same spot, that sort of thing. I was transferred to a much busier location after my cafe was shut down, to which my health could not take the hustle and bustle. Though it wasn't for me the second time around, I would recommend Panera Bread, especially because the schedule was always so flexible."
good,Panera bread is a great company with a lot of friendly coworkers who are professional. Management is excellent and they provide excellent customer service.
good,Working here was fun the food ia very good. You get to meet everyday customers and get to leearn regulars and know exactly what they want also i learned how to bake and use big ovens it was very cool
good,I worked at Panera Bread for almost an entire year. It was truly a great place to work.
good,Love this job I quit due to finding a new job I wish I would have stayed but I picked the other job... I wish I can go back love the staff ................
good,Workplace is nice. I enjoy being with my coworkers. It's really nice. I like it. I don't know. It's really nice I guess. I don't know. It's yeah... It's nice.
good,Panera bread is a good place to eat. As far as working i think ill pass on that. I was doing a lot of work for little pay. They are not fair. They dont give many hours
good,A typical day for me was getting up at 4 so I could be there by 5 am.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,First 5 months were great I loved my job and the managers. Our GM gotten demoted and a new one came in. He was very unprofessional didn’t know how to talk to his employees. Last 2 months were the worst. They cut hours and I was down to one day a week
good,"Mg, a crew a 12 or more people... Handle cash ,Barista Etc..prepare breakfast and lunch..."
good,"panera started off as a fun job. slowly but surely, things started to go downhill. I get anywhere from 20-7 hours a week or short shifted for a 2 hours shift. managers attitudes are disgusting. and think they can speak to you any type of way."
good,"I worked here my senior year of High School. This was such a fun place to work. I cam in with the ""all about money"" mindset but I made a lot of awesome friends and great pay for the time. This job helped me save up for a car and college."
good,"The food there is a good quality rarely do you find a restaurant that you like all the foods, employees are very friendly. I really do like all the foods."
good,Not much to say management really suck!!!!they have 5 managers and nobody communicate with anybody its alot they asking workers to do comparing to what they get paid
good,"Fast paced with almost no time to deal with call outs or shortages. The team all knew how fast and furious the lunch and dinner rushes would be, but would need a lot of guidance to prepare for them."
good,"I honestly didn't like working for the company "
good,Manager was rude to me and they make me feel like a very stupid person. Also they give me less hours that I barely get enough money for my needs at all.
good,they will lead you on about how you will get crossed train but will never happen and the managers talk bad behind your back. also it has the worst hours.
good,Fun fast paced work environment kind of stressful but not a lot of room to grow and move up it’s a lot to do if you want to succeed working at Panera Bread.
good,Run non stop in cafes but have clear expectations. Focus on customer always. Always focused on product environment and service. Too many hours. Celebrated Successes.
good,im  going to be honest I spent over 3 and a half years at this company and I got less then a dollar raise. they refused to advance me even though I showed great interest and the management doesn't care about anyone.
good,They forgot to schedule me a week after I started and that made me miss out on a lot of money! The work day is Normal. Sometimes busy sometimes slow. The workers are really cool. The managers are a little weird but cool.
good,"Needs better management, stocked bagels and pastries, took orders, the people I worked with made my job so stressful sometimes,the most enjoyable part of Panera is closeing time."
good,The management at Panera was very biases and it was the equivalent of being in high school. There was a lot of drama and immaturity within the workers and management.
good,"I ran into multiple problems with management over discrimination of race and gender. After complaining, nothing changed. I stayed for only 3 months due to some vulgar racial slurs that were said to me by a manager."
good,"I liked these work places they just weren't something I'm passionate about or see myself doing for the rest of my life. typical day was really busy, sometimes slow, workplace culture was people from all back grounds, hardest part of the job was the rude managers and rude females that were employed with me. most enjoyable part was having understanding customers who made me feel good about my job."
good,"I loved the job itself. Until we changed general managers and that’s when everything went down hill. I enjoyed every manager, other then the new general manager once she came in and changed everything. She also made working with her very difficult when she deliberately read something sent in from a previous employee who had requested a transfer, and made it seem like he complained about everyone. When he said nothing about anyone who worked there."
good,"Not only did I love Panerai bread before actually working there, but I loved the people that came there who I created relationships with over months. A clean healthy eating environment with awesome choices and better lifestyle options as well as bakery items! That are delicious with all fresh ingredients in any choice made. Still go there to have a bite to eat and get a peace of mind whether I'm studying/reading a great atmosphere one of my best job, unfortunately things were difficult for me at the time having personal issues and I had to resign."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"50 hours work weeks, I have not seen a bonus for the 3 years I worked there.  If you like to sit in the office and watch your shift go down hill this is the place for you.  Don't be shy they expect you to know your stuff before going into training."
good,"Its hard to move up from a trainer or to have management follow through with complaints with other employees. District Managers just want to make younger people General Mangers (20,21,22)"
good,"Excellent team work, fast paced lots of ambiguity. Often long hours with little acknowledgement. Great job for young mangers starting out in the food management industry"
good,"cashier, barista, dining room cleaning, dishes, and other jobs as well"
good,Liked most the managers there. Most were very helpful and friendly!
good, would start at 4:00am to put the delieverys away after that start preparing my panni sandwiches for lunch then clean the kitchen
good,"The staff sucks pretty much, every one passes their duties to the next and slack around most of the time. Managers don't really know what their job consists of."
good,I’ve been working at Panera in California I would like to cross train to learn different things but I believe I can handle it but very few think I’m not vocally stabled to handle the requirements I’ve been working very hard with communicating with manager n coworkers n costumers
good,A typical day at Panera is very busy. Lots of running around and meeting customer satisfaction. Lots of multitasking and improvising. Whatever it takes to make the day run smoothly.
good,"Its a good job for a high school student, its not a full time job, The management was a bit of a mess. The General manger was wonderful, however the assistant managers fall short."
good,"When I first worked for Panera it was an amazing environment, the managers were pleasant enough. But corporate started putting down a lot of changes and when it was bought by Dunkin'  we didn't know until the public did and we weren't allowed to comment on the situation."
good,Working here was fun and stress free. The management is progressively improving and the workplace is nice. It is a great place to work with flexible hours.
good,"Managers are unorganized, they don’t push through with their word, by this I mean the managers are not consistent at all. Managers ask you to 1 thing then while you starts there is another task, Many people call out from work and never find replacements so at times we were short staffed which was harder. Managers are lazy all they do is sit in the office while employees struggle, There is only about 1 manager that didn’t sit around and actually helped but for the most part They have very good and healthy food!"
good,I have worked for this company twice and I bust my butt to do everything I can to be the best I can and still come up short on hours. They are always hiring people and instead of giving the hours to the ones already there they hire new people and give them those hours. I like working there and with the people but you can definitely not support a family on there hours and pay.
good,I loved working for panera bread. They had a great vibe however they wont let you advance and I needed more than what they were giving me. I went to culinary school and wasnt making enough to take care my family
good,"I enjoyed the laid back and calm energy of the Restaurant."
good,"Its a good place to work at and was a great first job. Can get paid very poorly for working a little harder then should. Management team is ok. Enjoyed conversating with customers, hardest task would be when someone doesnt show up to work and you have to close by yourself."
good,"Panera bread is a good company but the work schedule is terrible you don't have time to do nothing ,Manager they do their work but supervisors they just stay at the office waiting to clock out without any sense of what's going on in production floor"
good,consistently communicating with customers was the best part of this job a real day brighter.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread consist of interacting with customers and making sure they get what they ask for and leave with a smile on their faces. I learned how to cope with doing whatever it is to make the customers happy and satisfied. My co-workers were nice, not all but that didn't stop me from working with them. In the end we were all a team and they all liked me for the happy spirits that I brought with me into the workplace. I don't think there was anything hard about this job. Being that I enjoyed working there I make it my business to make anything that was complicated bearable. Working at Panera was something I was happy to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and seeing the happiness on their faces after talking to me. Also their compliments on how I dealt with them was a plus because thats what I like to do, make others happy, "
good,"its a good starter job for students,its an easy place,managment could be better,good food, you meet new people,friendly,ok benefits, its an easy work day."
good,Shortage of employees makes it soo hard but other than that it’s a great place to work. Fast pace which I like but with few employees real stressful. Thanks.
good,"I would come into a non stocked line i would stock line date everything, pull item from freezer to thaw, cook breakfast to order, bag orders,sanitize,cut bread, baker,work line salads, sandwhiches, ect."
good,Overall I had a great time working for Panera it is very fast past and you must be able to learn fast. It can get very hot in the back. They also will help you with personal goals.
good,"Ok to work for awhile"
good,"I loved my job at Panera bread and I would have stayed would it of not been for the managment. I was working 9 most of the time 10 hour days with no break offered to me and I would have to fight to get one. I wish things were ran differently there because I truly love the company, what we do, and what they stand for."
good,I've worked there for quite some time and have very many memorable experiences however I feel as though its time to move on. As much as I love the company I think it time to focus on bettering myself
good,"I enjoyed my time working for this company, just with that pay was better. I worked hard and many hours and deserved the correct pay. I definitely learned many things about myself, and improved on my people skills and patience."
good,"This was my very first job that i still now work at, at the moment i just want a higher paying job and not soo much in the food service i want to go to retail and try something new"
good,"Working there I either had nothing to do, or I was made to do everyone else's jobs while they sat around and talked and messed things up for the rest of us who are trying to work hard. There was definitely favoritism when it came to management I had asked since day one to be cross trained and within that year or so I was there I never learned anything new but five other new employees got to take a trainer class."
good,"Working at Panera was good stepping stone into other jobs. I was cross trained over everything and gave me good experience. Working at Panera was fun, the coworkers were the best part of everything. While working on the line it would become stressful during lunch as it would be so busy."
good,Overall panera likes to promote within. The people that work at panera truly is what makes work enjoyable. I would recommend this job to a young adult trying to make extra money during the summer or while going to school
good,it was my first job and I started off at $9 an hour and after two years I was making $9.25. They don't give raises often but they start high too be a fast food resturaunt.
good,Lots of opportunity to advance to different roles.  Part time job as high school student.  Not interested in advancement as I was pursuing college and possible relocation.
good,Hours suck & I see no change. I'm one of the best cashiers they have & only work 2 days a week. 10.5 & 15 hours a week.. I will take my talents elsewhere...to one of the restaurants around my location that keep trying to poach me to their establishment...very soon.
good,Not a permanent career path....It's fun but no normal adult would want to work there for a long period of time. It's more for kids and college age. Would  be a great first job...
good,"with the right management it can be a fun place. but wih poor management and understaffing, it's stressful . overall it's a pretty cool place to be. try it out and see"
good,Everyday is a new day. Seeing the regular customers come in every day brings the joy in. Everyone that works there feels like family. The management is ok.
good,"Working at Panera is very fast paced since it is a restaurant. I learned a lot about preparing food, and pairing items together. The hardest part of the job had to be completing dishes in a certain amount of time."
good,a typical day at Panera was great the co-workers are amazing it was like a family i loved waking up to go to work there. Management was some what agreeable it's just there's always one boss who just don't like you but i made do people was still great it was like a laid back place the hard part of the job was just that one boss but the most enjoyable part was know that the people and customers there where taking care of.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day at work is so extremely busy all the time. I learned a lot about being at work in a timely manner. The managers help you grow and learn more in life than just in the work place. The hardest part was dealing with customers that weren't entirely happy with the time it took to get the food out. Panera is very quick, but when it get very busy and we get behind, people get upset and complain. The best part is becoming a family with your workers."
good,"A typical day at work consists of checking for accuracy product labels, display all merchandise in it's correct place. I learned how to deal with different types of customers varying from content, to those who just love giving employees a hard time. to be completely honest, managers and co-workers can start off by being nice to you, only to fin out later they may take advantage of your work effort. They can be understanding at times, you just gotta make sure you don't trust them with your personal issues. You try really hard to get your information out of you. The hardest part of the job is having to learn something on your own because managers on co-workers may lack teaching skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is when it's a busy day. You are kept busy with taking more product out, satisfying your customers, and the adrenaline you get when the line in outside the door."
good,"very fast pace, friendly ,and good co workers. the hardest part of the job in my view was nothing"
good,"i come into work at about 9 when the store is closing. I turn on all the oven and proof boxes. then i start to do my bake i was there from 9 pm to 5 am 5 days a week. i didn't really have coworkers all bakers worked alone unless your bake was over $3,000. the hardest part of this job was being alone and getting everything done before 5 am"
good,It was a good job for me to learn what it was like getting into the work place. Easily worked out my schedual for still being in high school which was really nice. Provided the platform I needed to be able to move onto much more.
good,Working For panera bread you work alone all night you never see you boss and just a very poor run company
good,"Always give the customers what they want. Most are rude and not generous at all. Some are very disappointed in the pricing. When we get new products/ingredients, privies tend to go up. We are all about making customers happy."
good,Panera bread is like another part of my family. I have my work family and also my own family to talk to when I have a problem. Panera bread is a good company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera as a food runner and talking to the customers. But beware of working there several employees got into a actual fist fight and was thrown on the floor, they fired the girl that tried to defend herself against the boy that attacked her. The horrible foul language. After food runners were let go by Corporate we back to have lunch the place as dirty. I wont be going back to eat there."
good,Love what eking here I work 3rd shift so I don’t have to deal with people the only this I dislike is the time we are given to back and have everything ready before the store opens
good,"I do all the prep work for the next day, management is friendly and listens proactively to co-workers and customers."
good,Great atmosphere! Liked my team that I worked with. Always selling new products which promotes lots of business also with the Panera savings cards. Also liked the food before workings there.
good,"You go in everyday, looking forward to the employees. But end up being sad and upset about the management, if you want a job about panera do it! It really is a good company, but it just depends on who you are working under."
good,"average day at work consist of constantly being busy with lines of customers out the door in center city Philadelphia , making sure the dining room stays neat and clean , provide beverages as a barista, opening and closing bakery, cash out customers, answer telephones."
good,"•	Dining Room attendant "
good,I enjoyed this job and the people I worked with. Did not enjoy frequent shift-ins and last minute calls for substitute work shifts. Good training and work experience that matched my position.
good,At Panera bread you clock in take orders slice bagels and give them to customers if you are an employee you can get a discount on food and also you will get breaks when it’s your turn.
good,"panera bread is a nice corprate establishment to work for, good hours, good benifits , good hours ,good pay.good management ,bonuses,incentives ,programs"
good,Panera is a very friendly environment for any first time worker. Job is relatively easy to pick up on as long as you're able to cope with the fast pace of the breakfast and lunch rush. Most managers are nice but don't expect a manager to be the one to train you. Everyone there has been trained by a 16 year old.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Decent place to work. Easy to advance if you show promise and will pay well to do so. Hard work for some positions but they usually hire friendly employees to help the day go by.
good,Usually collaborative workplace but management needs to be more closely monitored.  Learned how to be self motivated and rely on myself. Seems that catering is on the back burner to everything else.
good,"My experience at Panera was a great experience and i would recommend the job to anyone that is willing to be a hard-worker and build rapport with our frequent visiting customers. The hardest part is closing, and it's not that hard once you create your own functioning system."
good,"I met a lot of great people , and made many friends . I did really well in my career with Bread Co. I really don't have any complaints . Great Company to work for ."
good,"The management team had some assistant managers that needed more training. The overall management team would start a meeting at the time to cash out and be unavailable for two to three hours. "
good,"I made a lot of friends there, and my manager was awesome. The food is fantastic and it isn't too fast paced but fast enough to keep you busy. Very pleasurable to work there, but it only paid minimum wage which is the reason I left."
good,"Base salaries are competitive, benefit packages are great.  I would recommend this job to anyone that enjoys working.  This is not a job for someone that is lazy."
good,Working as a team is great I just can't work weekend but I like the job I want full time. It's not hard work I just don't like getting paged every 5 mins when  I am doing other stuff. But they have a good strong team I like the people I work with
good,"I worked at one in my hometown owensboro for over a year and I loved it, it was great. Then when I started college I transfered to one here in Louisville, KY and it's not as good. It's not very organized and management isn't that great."
good,"It was a great place too work, the customers were the best there just weren't enough hrs"
good,"Slicing bagels, handling cash, sweeping and mopping, making lattes."
good,Making and serving customers. Most customers were great and the co workers were great. Enjoyed the presence of my managers well some. the hardest part was standing for 8 hours a day in a busy place. the best part was the friendships I made along the way.
good,"I enjoyed working with the public.  I got to know most of my customers by name, their families, etc."
good,i learned alot about jewlery and to manage them. Also the very many diiferent types of jewlery that we have.
good,"Overall not a bad job, but the benefits are terrible and there's not much room for advancement. Also no full time openings except for management."
good,It’s an easy place to get accustomed to and the environment was well kept as well as the staff I learned easily and I never felt lost everything was very easy to handle as well
good,This place is always busy which means you are always on your feet but overall a great place to work and build a career. The coworkers become close friends and make working even more better.
good,Working here allowed me to really connect with the customers to see what they could be interested in or possibly talk about what they don’t like so I’m sure not to recommend an entree they may not like.
good,"Great for a first job, but not for long term. Very critical steps in in order to get promoted, strict pay system as well. Glad I got to work there when I did."
good,This was a great experience for me working in customer services right out of high school. The staff was wonderful and always there for you! They were very flexible working with my school schedule!
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Why does this make me do this? this is ridiculous, I didn't wan to write an essay about this place cause it's not worth the time. Overall its ok, it's restaurant work with very little in the way of tips but the managers are nice."
good,a nice entry level minimum wage job. The company is ok to work for.  THe higher ups are a little up tight about things but as long as you know what they are it all is good.
good,"Working for Panera Was the most interesting work I ever accomplished inside or outside the Restaurant. I learned New things everday, while learning h the Business."
good,"The hours were very flexible, the rate of pay was comparable to other positions.  Enjoyed working with the other employees and enjoyed the managers as well.  One of the best jobs I have worked at."
good,Managers were always friendly and helpful. Very busy environment and always remained steady and calm. Had a great 60% off for employment meals on every shift.
good,"I just didn’t like the scheduling , I didn’t feel as if I was getting the hours I needed to support myself . But other than that the staff was very kind and it was a great learning experience"
good,"There were customers that were difficult to assist, but luckily i'm able to assist them and have them happy. Also, it was a fast paced work environment, which was challenging to deal with."
good,This is a great job for people who don't mind working overnight. I love the fact that they give bakers free meals every shift. It's the kind of job you can do while listening to podcasts and audiobooks. It's nice to go in when everyone else is leaving and be gone before the opening crew comes in.
good,"I am a great worker and i am very friendly and easy to get along with, I also enjoying working my hardest. Hardest part of my job is probably closing down the store and making sure everything is ready to go for the next day!!"
good,The hardest part of the job was closing time.  And making sure everything is how it should be for the morning crew. I always find a way to make sure I always put my best foot forward
good,"Face paced and busy during the day"
good,"Had fun learning about plenty of bread. Lots of soups. Lots of types of bread and a lot of types of soups, it was very fun. Good management and a friendly staff"
good,A typical day at work is keeping the dining room clean and putting a smile on customers face when I deliver them fresh food and it’s on time. A Simple have a great day then I’m on my way to my next delivery.
good,if it was more space to grow i would had stay but i really feel there is not must to move up to or from just want more out of life.i really  enjoy the time i was there because i got to learn what they was about
good,Working at Panera Bread is a fun experience because you get to work with customers and you get to make great friendships while making a fair wage while working hard.
good,"I had an amazing management team that was willing to work with my school schedule. Even with zero experience, everything was taught step by step so that I may completely the task just as proficiently."
good,"It's a great place with great people definitely a great place to start"
good,"I am a delivery driver, and the store I work for has the best people you could ever work with. The managers ate the best, everyone is your friend.  They really appreciate the work you do. It's a fast paced job. But fun. The customer ate great also. Lots of insensitive. Great hours and great pay."
good,"Enjoyable to work with other managers, staff members, and most of all building relationships with our customers. Depending on the cafe and team, its a great place to work"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,This is the kind of place you come to no matter the weather its always a great place to love and live and smile with the people you enjoy to be around.
good,I went to Panera bread looking for more stability and a better team environment. What I got was hardly that. Every job has its ups and downs but this store specifically. There is no “alpha” Manager which means not a single manager wants to be the bad guy. This means that all managers and staff go tip toeing around each other trying not to hurt anyone’s feelings. There has to always be at least 1 person willing to put his or her foot down and we do not have one like that.
good,"The work is straightforward. Just check orders and try to deliver them in a timely manner. It's busy during a rush, and tips can be good. It gets easier as you learn the area though."
good,"always feels like a family here, everone willing to help each other out, managers are helpful and understanding, always a fun enviroment and exciting to go to work."
good,Great job to have in high school. Learned a lot and how to actually make decent food. Great work environment and team environment. Super supportive coworkers
good,Great place to work. Most cafes are busy and make the day go by faster. Always good people to work with. Great food and always great service. Clean kitchen.
good,Good place to work nice people good managers fast paced at times must be able to move fast think quick but at the same time have good customer service
good,"Fun work environment, always busy.  The best part of this job was the face that it was so easy to pick up hours whenever you wanted to without questions."
good,"expect to multitask and cover multiple positions during any given shift, all food production is timed and must be completed in under 4 minutes order to table."
good,"Sincerely loved my job and my coworkers, however, management was an ABSOLUTE mess.  Consistently took advantage of employees, making them stay atleast an hour after their shift ended to close when many of the duties could have been done on shift if allowed... not fun to close really late and have to open early the next day!!"
good,"Fast paced and demanding position with lots of customer engagement. Cleaning, delivering, and waiting tables were the three main things required, along with checking orders and greeting customers."
good,"I loved working at Panera. The coworkers were awesome, the pay was great for a fast food place, and the customers could be a little much at times but overall they were fantastic. As long as you did your job and didn't stand around to chat and gossip, you'd never have an issue."
good,I enjoyed my time at Panera Bread. I learned so much about the company. They always had a great workplace attitude and I recommend it to anybody who seeks a job.
good,Panera is an amazing job to work at especially if its your first job. The managers care about their employees and are very friendly. The general manager was a little annoying but nothing bad to complain about.
good,Panera Bread has literally been an awesome place to work. They work around your schedule and are very understanding/caring when it comes to taking days off or family emergencies. One of the best places I’ve worked for. Very easy to move up in the company.
good,A typical day at work would be opening the store and preparing for the day. I learned how to be face to face with customers at the registers. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people everyday and having a bond with the everyday customers.
good,"A typical day at work is mostly relaxing due to the easy flow that surrounds the employees. Teamwork is definitely found here. Communication is an essential part of the job, so for those who find that difficult...don’t worry about it. The managers and other team members make it easy to communicate and have fun while working."
good,"My experience at Panera Bread has been stellar. With the exception of one minor hiccup with one employee, the rest of the crew and management are super supportive of each other. The store fosters a sense of kinship, and we all work together to meet goals."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I kept asking for my check I didn’t get it until this January they really didn’t give me hours it was really bad only the food was good the hardest place at Panera bread was the dishes it was just so many dishes they had
good,It's fast paced but you get used to it. I loved working there but the only issue I had was the biweekly pay; I was used to once a week so it was tough.
good,I feel comfortable and supported by my co workers. Everyone is nice and understanding. They are willing to accommodate. Always busy and can find something to do.
good,"As a minor working at Panera, hours can be too little or too much, and getting what you need schedule wise for a persons personal-life that works is also problematic. Although, the pay is nice and depending on what part of the store you work in, it can be very relaxing, or very stressful."
good,Working at panera bread was a great first job. Met lots of new people and learned social skills as well as many other skills.  The management is great.
good,Overall Panera Bread was a good place to work. Perfect balance between slow and fast paced and pretty easy to learn the ropes . My experience with the Panera team was good up until when I was leaving it. Seemed as if there was favoritism in the company and it was very visible.
good,I have always enjoyed panera beard and the environment the they have created. The food is much more quality than most other quick serve restaurants that i have been to.
good,"Need to get scheduling under control, its an okay place to work intresting co workers and very fast pace , good place to gain working experience not an ideal 1st job"
good,"I really can't be too specific with my review working here.  It was almost  years ago.  But I can say this, I didn't have a bad time being employed there.  I left for a better employment opportunity."
good,I absolutely enjoyed my time working at Panera. The only reason I left  Panera was due to requirements not being met by my managers in terms of my work schedule.
good,Fun place to work at but pretty busy.  The pay was awful when I started but I hope it starts at at least 12/hr now.  Trainer was the only decent position before management.
good,"Great for high school and college kids."
good,"I loved the atmosphere at Panera Bread. The customers were lovely, well most of them, as well as the employees. My managers were very understanding of any outside situation that you may run into and very forgiving for tardiness. Time off was always granted and overtime was easily accessible."
good,"Good management, always looking for new employees. Company provides lots of hours and is always looking to give shifts to employees. Adequate discounts on product"
good,Great for those who want to start working in a more upscale and organized food industry. Teaches you to work well with others but also have independence.
good,It was a good job but it was extremely overwhelming. It was super fast-paced and I couldn't keep up with what was expected of me. I got along with everyone I worked with.
good,It was nice working there. The work environment was good and the managers were helpful. They were considerate if I needed a change in my shift or days off.
good,A typical day would include opening thebakery in the orning this consited of displaying the pastries for the day and slicing the bread for the cafe. I would also be opening the register for the morning. I learned good customer service and working with a team. For the most part I worked well with different management throughout the years. The hardest part of the job was during the lunch hour when it was really busy and you had multiple task to complete. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was opening in the morning. Another enjoyable part was getting to tal to my rergular customers.
good,It was a very basic job but it ultimately served its purpose. I would recommend working here if you are looking and they are hiring. Managed well and ultimately goo work experience.
good,"Fast pace during the lunch rush then slows down until supper. Management is awesome light hearten people. The people that work there are always telling jokes and having a great time, its like a big family."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Best job ever I enjoyed my time here tremendously it was just as I expected the pay was great and the benefits great just long hours and terrible management
good,"Good experience in a fast paced food establishment,the managers work with your schedule and the co-workers are easy to get along with and all work together."
good,The company itself has a great mission and overall would be a fun place to work. The specific store I worked at however was not enjoyable because they took advantage of my work ethic and continually overworked me and went against my available times while I was in school.
good,They give me the hours i need and are flexible with my schedule. The job itself is easy and there a lot of ways to cross train.  Only downfall is the hourly wage is fairly low.
good,"On a typical day at work, it usually starts off slow but as the customs come in the day begins. At first its easy but once the customers start to use the lids, straws, and cups thats when I need to restock. "
good,This is not a job to make a living off of. Just something in the meantime. As a caterer i don't think the pay is fair because we basically are almost getting paid as mush as associates when we do a whole lot for our type of work.
good,I really enjoyed both jobs putting out the product and interacting with the guest. I liked the co workers as well as the management. we really had great team with team players.
good,Productive workplace. Fun people to work with and for. Enjoyable experience keeps you busy plenty to do and it's a fast-paced environment. I enjoy working here
good,Great place to work.  Great staff. Very flexible schedule.  There essences and values drive the company for gold standard.  Managers are great to work with.
good,"A day at work was sometimes very stressful. Helping out customers with any problems they had was the priorities during the shift. When there weren't any issues, or orders, all of us would be cleaning, and stocking the store. Mainly just having a good time. There would be good days with other employees and there would definitely be bad ones too. Drama and attitude within the store towards management and other associates wasn't unnoticed, by management and customers."
good,"Prepared food, stocked and cleaned in downtime. I learned how to work even faster paced. The management was very friendly. The hardest part of the job was lunch time rush hour. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discount on food for employees."
good,"The St. Louis Bread Co. was a great job. I had a great time working with some really great people. I helped train the staff, did ordering, inventory, and scheduling. Helped grow the store to be on of the top stores."
good,"easy job for high school aged students, enough responsibility and good pay. I learned a lot and and more prepared for future jobs. You also get a food discount which rocks."
good,The job is very hands on must learn fast in order to adapt. There are no short cuts and thing must get done in a timely manner. It can be hard if you not use to working with the public.
good,"Great place to work. 9 hour workdays for managers. We hire and fire and maintain all Panera systems and culture. We have multiple streams of income coming in each day by utilizing Rapid pick up, Delivery, Catering, and of course foot traffic."
good,"Environment always provided a great stimulus to work. As it was always bust, all employees were pushed to work at maximum efficiency in order to reach goals."
good,very fun environment I loved going to work everyday and interacting with people on the job. I met lost of new fun people and i would definitely recommend this position.
good,Panera Bread is my most recent job. Panera is a very laid back job the work is not hard at all and the pay is very decent. I worked the line here but really worked and knew the whole store. I loved working for panera
good,This is a very fun job. everyone was very nice and helpful. They really care for their employees. Perfect first job or early job in your life. It was very fun.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Loved working there. Good balance of work and personal life. Shifts varied. Plenty of help if needed. Good work environment. Not too stressful. Good pay.
good,The people you work with are like family. Management works well with your schedule. Want to help you better yourself and your career. Loved how caring this copmany was for the communtiy
good,"Working to share a good experience with the customers. "
good,"It was great! The managers, other staff, hours, pay, food, everything was outstanding! Had to leave for school and find something more stable but definitely great for a first job."
good,"They provide plenty of hours and work well as a team. It takes some time to learn about the company, but after getting over the learning curve, the work is pretty easy and the co-workers are friendly."
good,"Didn't mind doing things, Panera was a nice place for people just starting out in customer service or those in high school. Nice people management has changed since Ive been."
good,Working at Panera Bread was a great experience for me! I learned a lot there! Management is not easy but I enjoy it! Panera was my real first job and I'm glad I made the choice of working there!
good,Great place to work but the other employees were very half-as with their jobs. The customers were great and the managers were easy to talk to. The food was even better
good,Washed dishes and stacked them up to dry in an easy accessible location. Placed in an area where they were easily accessible for line cooks and bakers.
good,"I believe they could have screened their managers better , they were under staffed , so that didn't make it any better , no communication at all ,but it was very neat and nice place to work wish i was still there."
good,Panera bread is fine job for a teenager. I had a fun time there. I made $8.50 and that was great for a 16 year old so I wouldn't recommend it for an adult.
good,"Good company. Needs stricter policy on harassment in workplace. Needs stricter cleaning regime. Hire less teenagers, maybe those over 18. Management is great."
good,The diverse number of people that worked for the company was awesome. They all became family no matter wat age group. Everyday i was scheduled to work i felt like i was still in school learning new things all the time.
good,"what a great place to work at . full of great food and a large menu ."
good,"Was a great experience loved the environment positive energy always. I learn how to be more social, smile through any situation, and avoid any conflict."
good,I really enjoyed working here because it was a great way to challenge myself and others around me. I loved the people I worked with and I learned a lot through customer service.
good,"It can be fun when you're not overwhelmed. When you're on a time crunch, you really don't even have 5 minutes to to take a break. (I mean the entire shift) When I worked, it was usually like that so I basically got burnt out very quickly. But when it's not super busy, it's really enjoyable."
good,"This is a excellent company to work for. Many life long skills were learned here. This company is a leader in the fast casual segment, that is a force to be reckoned with."
good,I liked working at Panera’s but they were so low staffed it was almost like the minute I got the hang of things they sent me on my own and made me close knowing I was a Junior in High school I couldn’t keep up with work and school at the time
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The crew was friendly, the managers were easy to get along with. Great morals. It was a fast paced job which I liked and had fun with. The customers were nice as well."
good,Thank you for everything ... it was alright not that bad . The pay was bad at least to me but the staff was great . The manager were like here and there . Bye
good,"It was a great experience, I learned a lot which in turn I could use to bring to another company and further help with their demands. It was a team oriented environment which I like a lot."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Panera. I made friends quickly and I was able to learn quickly. I especially enjoyed driving for them because I was able to get some fresh air, communicate with customers and make some decent money doing it... I was able to work in almost every part of the store which was also nice. Sure it got stressful during the breakfast, lunch and dinner rushes, but we all worked together as a team and helped each other out when we needed it. The environment was very warm and friendly as well."
good,"I felt that the advancement was slow.  They are building a lot of stores but it is going slower than I thought it would.  "
good,You got to meet new people and go in and work with some fun people everyday. Greet the guest when they would come in get their order and put it in the computer and cash them out.
good,This Panera is a franchise and as a result of that the upper management personnel were deeply entrenched in their positions so there was really nowhere to go as far as advancement
good,"Panera Bread was a great company with good benefits, stock options and good management. The hardest part of the job was not getting paid fairly, and the most enjoyable part of the job was I get to travel a lot."
good,"I enjoyed working at the register at Panera. I got to interact with many people and learn how to interact with people having good days and bad days, good attitudes and bad attitudes."
good,Great people good friendly management great kids to become friends and fellow co workers with easy learning job and great people and great guest would suggest this job
good,"The company is very goal oriented and ""by the books."" Rules and expectations must be followed all the time by every employee. There is room to grow with the company by showing the right dedication. Managers in this company work long hard hours and would get called in on days off when needed."
good,I enjoyed working at Panera as well as enjoyed the people I worked with and worked for. I was provided a lot of opportunities and have been able to take the skills I learned there and apply them to other jobs as well as everyday life.
good,Work was always fast paced and never slow. This is a great college job for flexible hours and decent pay. I would work here again if i needed the time to go to college
good,I loved the rush during busy hours and constantly having something to do at all times. Everyone is friendly and the manager was very understanding with my hours.
good,As long as you keep in your place and don't try to advance you will have no problems. once you try to advance then the problems start coming left and right. The management will give you an opportunity to advance and will make it seem like they want you to advance but when you try to they will make it really hard for you to do so and postpone the advancement
good,Its a great start to future opportunities. I would definitely suggest this job for the up-and-coming new worker. Especially for the new high school graduates that are looking for a position that they can move up in.
good,"The uniform requirements were very strict, even for those who worked in the back of the restaurant. They have employees there working 24 hours a day and would require employees to work ridiculous hours."
good,not only did you have great people to work with the customers was great as well the lunch time rush could be a lot at times but the customers was so understanding and kind
good,"typical day at Panera for me was always easy going some days harder than other depending on how many customers come in that day."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread has a wonderful environment to work in, but the pay for the amount of work being done is unrealistic. I was hired to be a bakery associate not a janitor."
good,"Management was difficult, expectations are not set clearly and training was disorganized. Food standards are high and exactly as advertised. My main problem was management"
good,"A typical day at work is working with customers, employee, preparing food, cash handling, dealing with under pressure moments, handling customers complaints. Management is great because of how everyone works together as a team. Work culture is quite, peaceful, place to study. The hardest part of the job is having to close for the night I wish it never closes. The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing the customers smile and happy with there service. Also seeing everyday customers and they know you and you know what they are going to eat and write good comments on our website."
good,"Very productive and fast paced environment, an 'oasis' for customers. Managers were respectful and instilled in us good values and taught us with patience and strong will. They taught us the importance of correcting our mistakes for the good of our common goal for the benefit of others. They taught us how to have fun and how to be accurate and logical while using our human emotional side in a useful way. They taught us how we can treat other humans with respect and kindness."
good,Very friendly atmosphere. I loved my manager and was very well organized. Panera as a company pays very well for the work required. It is a very fun place to work for new employees.
good,Allows your to have a life but the low income and lead to problems with providing for a family expect over time if you can even make threw the low pay.
good,Absolutely great place to work. hardest part of the job was the morning shift for the customers because it is a lot to handle but you wille eventually get the gist of it.
good,Panera was my first job. It is a great place to work for a first time employee. They are very understanding of school schedules and are definitely always willing to work with you.
good,"bueno aprendí hacer un poco de todo como hacer jugos ,cafés ,capuchinos"
good,"When I began working at Panera I loved it. The vibe was always peaceful. The customers were always the cherry on top. Yes I had a great time in the beginning, but after a while work relations were going down hill. I began to get picked on. I always felt as if the didn't want me there."
good,"Panera Bread was my first job and it was amazing to work there. Hamra Enterprises is also a great company to work for, the owner is so nice. Panera is a great start up  job."
good,Good quality of life. Management is nice and good to work for.  The customers are great and you build good relationships with the customers.  If you are looking to move up with a company this company has opportunity.
good,"First Panera bread I ever worked in that had a drive thru and both ends were very busy when it came to breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Getting to try new foods before the customers was really fun."
good,Great flexible schedule especially when you are in school. Awesome and loyal customers who are fun and great conversations with. Great amount of discount while youre working.
good,nice place to work. friendly environment.free lunches.nice managers.but alott of work to do.management very nice.good atmosphere.helpful staff.good customer reviews.
good,Overall workdays at Panera Bread seem to go by relatively quickly. When on the job you must expect to work quickly and efficiently. While working it is also expected to greet customers and help all their needs.
good,"Great staff to work with, in addition to that the customers were always grateful and very kind !!! I would personally recommend this job to anyone looking for employment !!!"
good,"I was promoted through the ranks in this company, from an associate to a multi-market position. This company has terrific people and rewarding work in store for you."
good,Very nice company with a wide variety of benefits for its employees. The workplace culture is so welcoming and you feel a part of the family right away.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I would work for the company again. It is easy to move up and earn raises. I was also fed well. My location was a little different than others though. Everyone was trained to do everything.
good,"I got to work with the best of the best of Panera employees. I learned to be orderly, time-efficient, and hard working at this cafe. The three years flew by, but I have many fond memories of this workplace."
good,"This is a great company to work for.The food is amazing, and good for you. There is room to advance in the company and they treat their employees well."
good,"Enjoy and relax I always enjoy meet new people,Management are great to work with. And great Work place for Student and also like good to study area good food"
good,A great place to work and follow your dreams. The environment is one of a kind and one of the best. Will teach you a lot about yourself and about life.
good,Panera was my first job and i loved it. i was promoted to the trainer position. i really loved this company they are flexible and its easy to move up in the company.
good,"Great place to work, great company,team work.I like the people,the staff,guest upper managementand a great atmosphere"
good,"I used to work for corporate and things were enjoyable at the location I worked at. But once we switched to franchise, it was more about money than the actual Panera Bread goal - an oasis for everyone"
good,"Fast paced, hard working.  Customer Service focused.  Lots of opportunity to move forward with company.  Hardest part is quality of life, working weekends and holidays, long days, early hrs of operation."
good,"Productive fast paced work environment. Managers at this store are very focused on the business, not so much worried about it's employees."
good,"I started out as a cashier, but quickly learned how to work on the line and dish pit. They like having their employees trained in all areas, which gives you great experience."
good,"learning every day new thing , work directly with customers face to face its not easy thing , to know how to control your self , learn from the mistakes you done. and put them nicely to please the customer. how to up sell your product , know the product well."
good,I loved working at Panera. It was a fun energetic environment.  Everyone was so nice at both of the Panera's I worked at. It was an easy job once you got the hang to it.
good,This is a fun job. It doesn't have a lot of room to grown and they wont give anyone a chance if they make a mistake. The one I worked at needed more mature managers they would make fun of employees in front of other employees
good,I started working when we first opened. The job had it's ups and downs. If you want to work there then i say go for it. You get discounts on food and usually its a well run company.
good,"A typical day at work included working alongside kind-hearted comrades ready to help you whenever you need it. I learned how to handle social situations ranging from showing customers respect to how to handle a dissatisfied customer, as well as how to maintain a clean work area and how to work alongside others. Management was incredibly kind and helpful, with a fair mindset. My co-workers were helpful and hard-working. The hardest part of working for Panera was keeping up with a fast and busy pace in the beginning. The most enjoyable part was working with a staff that balanced professionalism and fun extremely well."
good,"high energy and fast paced. How to manage and lead by example. quality hiring, retention in restaurant is difficult at times. busy, fun atmosphere. happy"

good,Panera breads concept value and cultural essence encouraged growth in me as a person and as an individual. I was able to learn everything and anything that i set my mind to. The help from managment was an essential part
good,My typical day at work would be to open the store make sure everything is ready make sure everything is clean. I learned how to make certain stuff .my mangers were cool very understanding . My co workers were cool too very nice on helping me out on anything I needed . The hardest part of my job was grabbing stuff that was up high. The most enjoyable is that we got to keep leftovers .
good,Busy during certain hours with co-workers who work as a team. Hardest part was the busy time and the most enjoyable time was when it slowed down.
good,"I liked it because it taught me how to have good customer service skills, and how to work hard. I also liked the friendly and positive environment that I always in."
good,"The most enjoyable job, employee are the most important asset of the company, provided all great benefits, we even have a TV in the break room."

good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I learned that working at your own pace does not always get the job done. The hardest part of the job was going into the freezer and pulling for the next night.
good,"Provide helpful & friendly service to each guest, place orders, handle money transactions, make beverages, deliver bakery items to guests, perform all responsibilities patiently & efficiently during fast-pace situations.  Learned more customer service, cash handling, & barista skills, etc.  Very friendly and positive environment."
good,A see several customers who come in religiously I know them by name every time they come in. I enjoy working at Panera because my bosses work with you as much as they can and try to make things easier for you. Most enjoyable part of my day is being showed that I'm appreciated. Some nights are busier than others so our managers usually like to get us Ritas for showing that our hardwork was well appreciated.
good,Working at Panera Bread was a decent job with good wages and the work was fast paced which I enjoyed. However the hours were horrible and I often had to wake up at 430 in the morning for the opening shifts.
good,Fun time at work and ability to work at your own pace.  This place is very corporate and by the book.  Sometimes the early morning were a drag.
good,"Friendly environment, with strict rules for employee and food safety. With the easy to grasp job, but the almost non-existent promotional opportunity it is hardly a desired career path."
good,I learned alot about fresh produce and food . All of panera's food was prepared fresh each morning! It was a fun fast pace environment
good,I learned a lot about management and motivation. Taking a team of kids a lot of times and making sure they are focused to get the job done at hand. I learned about training individuals to become efficient at making food and watched many succeed under our supervision. I have a good co-management team. We are all capable of running the store and shifts by ourselves if need be. The hardest part was the stress of lunch when things got hectic and there were not enough people working. But it was all made good as soon as some one comes up to you and tells you how much they love Panera.
good,"On a typical day at Panera Bread, I change into my work uniform, which includes my hat and apron. Associates are required to check the deployment chart, which provides us with information on where we will be stationed for our shift. Throughout my shift, I engage in tasks such as working the cash register, cleaning the dining room, tending to the dishes and serving food to customers. This job has developed my teamwork and customer service skills. In addition for the everyday functions of the bakery cafe to flow, each associate must ensure to do their job with speed and efficiency. I have also learned leadership, because I have trained new workers in positions that I have mastered. The management and associates at Panera Bread are friendly, caring and contribute to the overall daily success in workplace. I do not feel that there is any part of my job that is increasingly trivial, because I have mastered the positions I have been assigned. I enjoy coming into work because I am able to engage in conversation with my co-workers, see customers who regularly attend our bakery-cafe, and serve the community."
good,I love and learned how to work in a fast and always changing company. it was fun lots of great people. loved to prep for the day and the next day. Management was ok as well.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my job at Panera, but with graduation only a year away I am looking for other opportunities that help me become more rounded. As a manager at Panera I have been put in charge of ordering products for the store and running shifts."
good,Always surrounded by friendly faces and positive attitudes.  Well-managed.  Learned how to manage my own productivity.
good,Fun environment with music at lunch. Great Sandwichs. Employees taking extra time to help customers decide what to order.
good,very a successful company to work for and learn new positions. Always a great staff and managers to learn from along with great costumers. Learning experience for everyone
good,"This is a high-energy, fast-paced store with a lot of business! Managers take very good care of you by offering a 75%discount on food while you are working! I learned to better multi-task while working because I had to train employees while doing my job also! It is a very fun environment to work in!"
good,"at work, we worked extremely hard, but I enjoyed every single moment of it all. I had the greatest manager any worker could ever ask for. he was a young man. of 23 years. and he is very hip and down to earth. I enjoyed working for him.  always gave us frree meals"
good,loved it really cool fast pace job but everyone is so nice and gets a long. Day goes by really fast and managers are really nice

good,Prepare customers meals in a professional and timely manner. Also assist other departments as needed and provide customers with excellent customer service.
good,"good job during school time or if your looking for a part time job to make some money. Management was nice, hours were decent, pay was good for being a fast food industry"
good,"Helped ring customers, cleaned front end, and worked with the most up beat fun people. The most enjoyable part was making new conversations with strangers."
good,"Very nice and energetic atmosphere, everyone who worked there was very nice and welcoming. We all were productive and got things done efficiantley without any problems. It ran like a well oiled machine the true meaning of a hardworking team"
good,"I'd start off the day by pulling soups, cleaning any dishes in the sink, and getting line prepared for the lunch rush. When lunch rush arrived, I either was online for sandwiches or on dining giving food to people."
good,"working at panera was an amazing company but i grew tired of the nighttime hours. A typical night for panera would start with the cafe staff leaving and me prepping the baker area. the night is then followed by me working alone and baking all of the dough and sweats product for the next day. I have to call the manager hotline and check in with my boss every night to tell him if i am missing any product. i am in charge of all of the ordering for the bakers, including supplies. i enjoyed working for the company a lot but have to my on."
good,"Work day's at Panera Bread varied with the position i was assigned to work; certain day's i would prep various meats and vegetables for the entire restaurant according to specifications, other day's i would work in the dining room with a heavy emphasis on customer service and focusing on patrons needs, other day's still i would work behind the kitchen line making sandwiches. Panera Bread reinforced my already strong belief and practice of focusing on the customer and providing them with prompt, friendly service regardless of the situation. My favorite position and most enjoyable aspect of the job was most certainly working the dining room floor because i could focus solely on the customer and attend to their needs. I have nothing except the utmost praise for my fellow co-workers and management staff. Everyone was amicable, benevolent, helpful, willing to answer questions, overall very easy to work with."
good,"Working with people I did not know before was a little scary at first. After getting used to them, it became one of the best experiences of my life. I made friends that impacted my life more than anything."
good,"Faced paced environment, hard working co-workers. Closing is the most difficult part of the job as well as opening shifts. Established excellent customer service skills."
good,It was joining Boudin's Bakery with Starbucks. I still enjoy the food to this day. But one cannot help notice it's a bit pricey to eat here.
good,Quick paced environment. Very clean. Good group of managers. Good location. Great food. Cozy dinning area. Bakery has excellent food
good,"A typical day as a Certified Associate Trainer for Panera Bread consists of going through the different tasks and requirements with new employees, making sure that they can perform the tasks that are required for the job, assisting customers with their needs, etc."
good,"Opportunity to grow within"
good,"management was great, staff was great, very fast paced, very friendly, customers were great, food and food quality was great, atmosphere was great."
good,Panera Bread was my first job and a very good one for starters. It taught me how to work with others and how to keep up with productivity. It also gave me the skills to work with others and not be so shy.
good,always a joy to work with the management team at this location. owners of the franchise know what kind of people to put in the power positions and always seem to fit the Panera Bread feel. such a professional fast food restaurant to work for with very high standards. learned that everyone looks at restaurants differently and you want to be that one place to stand out and make sure they always come back. company has given me the chance to move up multiple times and do different things in the company to brauden my resume and experience.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,My Managers are Bias and very rude no recognition or advancement but do meet friendly customers who appreciate hard work.
good,A place where you learn everyday the management team is awesome they hire the best possible people its a busy environment but the management team gives you all the tools you need to handle anything
good,Panera was an easy job and it was fun working in such an upbeat environment. I loved this job and would gladly go back. I would recommend this company to a friend.
good,"Management is great, atmosphere was warm and caring. Seemed like the corporate side sometimes got in the way  of how many employees were needed to run the store, but it wasn't management's fault."
good,"Very helpful staff that can answer any questions and provide a great place to study. A typical day includes checking in and out books, helping patrons with computers and navigating the library. in addition to these every day library chores you also get to work in a quiet environment with minimal distraction."
good,Panera was a great company to work for its a great place to grow and learn. I met some life long friends working for southern bread. They granted me with numerous opportunities and promotions.

good,"Had the smell of bread every day, what a great thing to wake up and walk into every morning.  Made me more hungry working there, honestly I did put on a few pounds but lost it after the fast pace they kept us going at."
good,"A typical work day would begin with stocking the store with the breads,pastries, and bagels that were baked through out the night, brewing coffees and cutting bread to prepare the bakery/cafe for opening as well as prepare orders for the day. After we have opened for business, the day would ensue with receiving customers orders and preparing customers orders. What I have learned from working at Panera is how to deal with customers one on one, how to work with a high sense of urgency during peak hours, and how to handle myself when the environment can become stressful. Management at Panera is very hands on thy help when it is needed and are good problem solvers. My co-workers are what makes coming to work everyday an experience they create a fun work environment and are helpful when help is needed. The hardest part and the most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with the customers. Its the hardest because, some customers may be having a bad day and they may release that frustration on me or co-worker even though we may have had nothing to do with their frustration to begin with. That very reasoning is what makes my job the most enjoyable I like to interact with the customer and ensure that their day gets better by greeting them with a smile and friendly hello and providing them with what I would believe to b great customer service so I can turn their day around and take away that frustration."
good,"Working at Panera Bread has been absolutely amazing. I go into work with a smile knowing I will be surrounded by wonderful co-workers and a great management team. Being at Panera has also taught me a lot about customer service and how truly vital it is. Every person who walks into our business deserves to feel welcomed and important. There are a lot of hectic times where the line wraps around the door, and although it can be very hard and trying at times, it's also fun to roll with the punches and navigate through the craziness."

The restaurant would get extremely fast paced at times of the day especially when working in the drive thru where I did for a majority of the time I was there.

The management and I were close, they taught me a lot. My co-workers and I were also close, and everyone was nice to each other and well liked.

good,I had great managers that made working there very enjoyable.

"

good,Enhanced communication skills with day to day customer interaction.
good,"I loved working for Panera Bread Company! The management team was very involved in all aspects of our store. A typical day at work involved long lines, making barista drinks, preparing bakery orders, taking orders, cleaning up the dinning room, delicious food and happy customers. The hardest part of the job was the long lines that went on for hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was having very satisfied customers, and friendly co-workers."
good,It was a pleasure being able to assist customers some daily and some occassional and know what they want to eat already.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be at times very tiring but fun, the reason why I get so tired is because if the catering department is busy I never stop to take a brake and if the regular cafe is busy I also have to help them. I am one of the people there certified in all the stations so they have me doing about everything after I am done with all my orders and deliveries. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with my co-workers, they are funny and really outgoing. When it gets busy we focus on our work but while focusing on getting the orders out we also like to make jokes and enjoy ourselfs so we don't get stressed from all the hard work we have to do. When it comes to management they are improving in that category because before we used to get new management come in and out so things were not as organized, but now everything is getting back to normal and I enjoy myself a lot more."
good,"It is great to work in team, have fun and to learn about Panera's products. Working with very nice and organized management was my pleasure!"
good,I have learned how to socialize with people. be punctual and much more thing
good,"really enjoyed what I did. I got to learn about a whole new world in the work industry that I knew nothing about. I got to meet a lot new people to work with and to work for. Management changed often with new cafes opening, so you always got to meet and learn frome new people."
good,"I supervised employees during opening and closing shifts, made food, cleaned and catered small events. I also did paperwork such as labor tracking, counts, and payroll."
good,"Typical work day punch in at 3am load up truck and hit the road. I learned pretty much a lot of the back roads in the whole state, management is great and so are my co-workers. The hardest part is working and delivering in all types of elements. The most enjoyable is the relationship you obtain with people from all walks of life in the cafes."
good,"I started working at Panera Bread in the beginning of December, and it took me two weeks to fall in love with my job. It's fast paced, but extremely fun! I get along with everyone that I work with and am happy to call them my friends. The work may be fast paced, but it's not rocket science. It's a fairly easy job, especially if you love what you're doing."
good,An excellent place to work and great people to work with. I would suggest working here to anyone.
good,"Cashed out customers, cleaned up dinning room and made sure registers were ready for next shift. Got along with everyone."
good,The managers are very relaxing to be around and are always very helpful.
good,The time that I spent working for Panera Bread was ok the pay was good and the hours were pretty flexible seeing the manager makes the schedule every week. But the favoritism and the catty drama that went on was very draining and made me not want to no longer work for this company.
good,Good company to work for. Met a lot of good people on the job as well as many interesting costumers. Very good work life balance. I was even given opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"At Panera we all have to stay focused and on tasks no matter how busy it gets  We have to stay stocked, clean, and keep our ticket times low at the same time. All to assure our customers are happy"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,A lot of people would call out and would be short on staff and it’s a mess when someone calls out because an employee will have to stay longer until one other employee can come in
good,"I loved my job at Panera. The hours were plentiful and the job, while demanding, wasn't too hard to catch on to. The only problems I had were a lack of opportunity for career advancement, as well as the fact that the company does not have offer raises, nor do they offer discounts to senior citizens or veterans or literally anybody."
good,"The management was very poor at the Panera Bread on Abercorn Savannah, Georgia. The actual job was easy. May be different now that most of the managers have been replaced."
good,"Panera is great, you just have to get your body acclimated to working all night and sleeping throughout the day."
good,I had a blast working their I got tonmeat so many new people. I learned so many things in the process. I come to use many skilled I learned their. The  management seemed to love and and the work I put out for the store. The best part is they realized on me so much because they could put me at any position at any point.
good,"The People I Would Work With Was Kind, Fun, And Would Help You With Stuff You Didn't Know. The Managers Was Nice, They Would Talk To You And Show You Respect."
good,"It was my first full time job, i worked almost 40 hours a week, got close with management staff and generally had a good time, pay was too low to consider staying"
good,Other than the communication between the management team. It was one of my favorite places to work! An amazing environment and mission that we followed by.
good,typical day at work was just really busy and slow at certain hours. did not learn anything while working there. Management was okay. the work place was really diverse
good,I like working at Panera. But I did not get enough hours or enough pay. I felt like for the amount of time I put into the company I should have gotten more money or at least more hours.
good,"Great staff, good management, great training. Personal experience individuality for me, I barely received hours only worked 10-15 weekly I would ask for more but it was never consistent. I got a raise of 25¢ after working a year and 3 months there."
good,"Job is super fun if you are willing to work hard. Flexibility is necessary because they like to move people around if help is needed in other parts of the restaurant. Just be ready to work to please the customers. Even if they are wrong or just crazy in general, you have to help them out and offer them a pastry for their time."
good,Deliveries start at 10 30 and go on until 7. i worked from 5 hours a day to 12 hours a day. When i got into a crash on the job that was the hardest part of it. But everything turned our alright in the end. Tips were nice and employees were nice. All and all a nice company to work for.
good,"I really loved working at Panera. I would have stayed longer, but school and work opportunities came up, and I just didn't have the time anymore. I still love going to eat there from time to time because I know the standards that the food is held to. The kitchen is immaculate (my coworkers and I made sure of it, multiple times a day), the food is fresh and genuinely healthy, and they are committed to reducing waste. All of the food is free of artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives, and they have options for people with dietary restrictions. Because of this quality, I rarely had to deal with a customer complaint. If a customer ever was unsatisfied, we replaced the food for free, so problems were resolved quickly and painlessly. It really made working here such a breeze! I also enjoyed packing up the leftovers at the end of the day for donation and knowing that nothing was going to waste. Some days there wouldn't be a donation scheduled and we would be encouraged to take as much home for our friends and family as we could carry. "
good,"Working here was a very interesting experience, I'm grateful for how much I learned. The management was quite fun and easy to talk to. A typical day at work included me making a bunch of sandwiches, helping customers, and making barista drinks!"
good,"Loved my coworkers but management was all over the place, favoritism upon managers and associates. If you work hard be ready to work for everybody else ."
good,I really loved Panera because of the friendly environment between the customers and the staff. They always had two or three managers present. They have professional clock-in and clock-out. What I really loved is that the training was paid.
good,"Work was always busy, mostly due to the location. Pretty much everyday is busy. The pay wasn't bad and they gave you a lot of hours. When it comes to working customer service, it wasn't a bad place."
good,This job was cool but the management was all over the place but I had a cool management when i first started but after that the next one ruled like a dictator and was all over the place I understand you have a bussiness to run but don't put the employees down we are your backbone.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread, the management was fair and understanding. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace, there was so much that needed to be done when working alone. Overall, the atmosphere was inviting and everyone treated you like family."
good,"panera will give you as many work hours you would like when the food is in season and as long as the location is busy which is great but if you are a student it probably means you are a closer which isn't the greatest thing ever but not the hardest either. they are flexible with schedules so as long as you find a balance between work, family, school (whatever be your case) you should be fine."
good,"Panera you have a lot room for improvement and promotions, the pay is not so great but everyday you do repetitive things that lead you to form routine that can make the job easier. You do get percent off the food which is always a plus. The worst part about the job is when we are short staffed so you have to work the long hours."
good,Panera is a great first job if you are in high school. They pay minimum wage and they have flexible hours. The management is the part that stinks because there are mangers that were hired that were unqualified or unfriendly and yelp reviews back that up.
good,Panera is a great place to work for your first job but I had to move on because I am done with restaurant jobs for a while. A typical day was very relaxed at times but also stressful. There were some managers that were great others I was not too fond of. The hardest part of the job was closing. The easiest job was cashier
good,I really enjoyed tbe enviroment and the people. They pride themselves on customers satisfaction and educating their employees on product and service.. Work hard and be on time.. Always take a little extra time for the customers
good,"Great place to work at if you need money in your pocket, and are a student in college or school. The managers really care about your outside schedule."
good,"During an 8 hour shift, there is not any time to sit down and take a break. The cafe is always busy and on occasion the managers don't offer to help during a rush. Customers get angry if food is not out in less than 20 seconds during a lunch/dinner rush"
good,I loved working at Panera; everyone is so friendly and it is a very laid back place to work. I feel like the management do a really fgood job on picking similar people to work for them so everyone has a good time and gets along.
good,"Great Place to work.  Great Environment. "
good,"loved this job and would recommend it to anyone."
good,"Despite it being so fast paced and and the hours being terrible, I still enjoyed my time working with the company. The customers were almost always friendly and the employees were very friendly and helpful."
good,typically good customers. Never got any bad complaints. The biggest time of day is the lunch rush. Most people from Covelli enterprises come in so the store has to be in the best shape possible.
good,Excellent basic training for a management position. Lots of opportunity towards career advancement and staff is helpful with completing timely tasks. Discount is the best part
good,"Panera is an excellent company to work for. From my experience, the fellow workers were wonderful, both on a professional and personal level. It has its slow times, but come lunch and dinner time, things can get quite hectic. It is one of the rare places that blends both a kitchen environment and a fast food one so you can get the feel of both worlds"
good,"Friendly, fun atmosphere, get team work. Support from management team and great food. Will recommend this job to start off as there first job. Company is great"
good,A typical day for me included providing the best experience for our customers and the employees/co-workers I work with. The only reason I would leave Panera is due to lack of advancement.
good,I work night shift as I am a Baker. Starting out a night with all products need is always great. If not there ways to get what we need to have. Having a good connection and communication with managers of the store and yours is always a great thing to have. Some dont but should team work is a must. The work place culture is variety and it is nice. There really not to much hard about this job. Having a nice bake is always makes my day and be organize and clean. having a routine.
good,"panera bread is good for people who like a fast paced job sometimes it would be slow(mostly sundays)"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Was a good chill place to work. The company ran smoothly and the staff were all nice. The job itself wasn't too strenuous though was pretty repetitive. Overall a good place
good,Busy. High volume and no downtime but fun. Good balance of home and work life. Decent benefits. Different kind of hours to work. Offers growth with the company.
good,"We were the only Panera with a drive-thru, in which I worked. It was a fast paced environment but provided a good income for a full-time college student during breaks. The management and staff were constantly changing. The hardest part was the unorganized schedule. The most enjoyable part was working as a team with my peers."
good,"Working at Panera Bread has definitely showed me what it takes to work in a restaurant setting. I always go into work with a huge smile, and full of energy, and ready to work. I look forward to it being busy, that way I am able to interact with a bunch of new faces, and see returning guests another time. I am always willing to help in times of need, and always kept busy. Whether it be cleaning, baking, making food, or interacting with guests, I am always on the move."
good,"Take orders, bake cookies and bagels, take deliveries, take next day orders over phone, sweep/mop, vacuum, clean bathrooms, restock, make barista drinks and smoothies"
good,Easy once you learn to bake its overnight so youll be alone knowing what to do you just have to get the job done and if help is needed management will be willing to help out if they are close by
good,"I was a busser, also washed dishes, made salads, sandwich's, consolidating orders in a timely professional manner. I maintained the barista station, Cashiered, baked pastries, Shift supervisor for other associates as well as training new employees.  I learned everything well enough to do it without any help. My management was very fun and outgoing. The hardest part of the job was when 3 associates would call out. The most enjoyable part of my job was that, I got to meet some very intelligent workers and learned some new work methods & communication skills."
good,"Every day I had regulars, other employees we were good about making it a team effort, and the management was good to work for, and there was always room to grow."
good,"It is a good restaurant, but they don't listen to when your available. I wish I could have a nice job working with animals but I'm not 18 years old. I prefer other places than Panera."
good,"During my time working with Panera Bread there was a constant change in manager. I worked for this company for three years and during that time I was many managers and employees come and go, which caused some difficulties in the operation of the store. I was trained to worked not only as a cashier, but as a barista person, bakery working, dishwasher, and I also worked the dining room were I brewed coffees every hour and made sure the establishment was clean and orderly. I liked that I had a set schedule every week I worked. I also liked being able to move around and work in different areas in the store.There was great teamwork even during our busy hours and all the employees did their best to keep each station organized and stocked. My only issue with this establishment was the fact that there was little to no room to grow or move up in your position as an employee, but taking on more responsibilities was a must."
good,"Working at Panera Bread Ottawa is a very memorable experience. It is a very fast paced enviroment. You get to meet different people everyday. Friendly managers and co-workers will treat you as part of the family. "
good,You work hard everyday always busy. Coworkers are cool. Hardest part of the job are the costumers they can be very upset. Most enjoyable part of the job are the different activities they have.
good,Every day is a fast paced and must meet customers expectations. Learned to interact with customers more and build rapport
good,"A typical day at work is very face paced, time went by very fast here."
good,The fact that this concept was available to the people brought in regular customers.  Helping them enjoy their experience as an every day oasis away from home was a key to make everyday a success.  Learned how to please each and every person no matter what they needed.  As a part of the management team it was very important to us to satisfy each and every guest as it was each and every associate.  The hardest part of the job was trying to please guest that had allergies to the product we were named for.
good,"It was a great place except for the fact that the management, Could be better at times."
good,"greeted customers,tok catering orders,and delivered,kept bakery cafe organize"
good,good place to work discounted meals flexable scheduals. management is kind of all over the place but the staff was amazing

good,Always able to stay busy working there which helps make time go by faster. Nice people to work with
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,They started me out at about 10 hours a week and now they've cut me all the way down to 2 hours a week why should I even waste my time going into work if they're going to keep cutting me all the way down to two hours a week week
good,I had a great experience and I loved working here. Managers were very helpful work environment was very friendly. Things got done and there wasn’t much problems.
good,The pay wasn't very good. But the co workers were great. Also the managers were good excpet the general manager he wasn't very friendly.      I would go back if the pay was better.
good,They are very flexible when it comes to needing time off or working around your schedule for other jobs/schooling etc. The employees are amazing. The pay isn’t bad for the work you do. A little unorganized but overall it is a very good company to work for.
good,A typical day of work includes an 8-hour shift of making food for customers' orders. Sometimes it gets really busy and it's stressful but this makes the day go by faster. The hardest part of the job would be managing the stress and making sure that orders are accurate and efficiently made.
good,"If I needed to go back I would. Co workers were great. You build genuine bonds with your coworkers. Nd the customers are great. Eccspecially your regulars. If there long enough, you will memorize the orders of the regulars."
good,"nice people and good work environment. clean and organized methods of working, easy scheduling and balance between work and life. loved working here and would work here again"
good,"this is a very understanding company to work for and there’s never a dull moment, though scheduling should be as promised and management could be better."
good,"Over the 2 year period of working at panera I truly did love working there. The employees I worked with and the managers i had really made it very easy to come to work and work through a shift because it was fun to be at work. Not only was it fun but I learned so many thins from panera like great customer service, prepping the food and moving up in the work place."
good,"Working at Panera Bread comes with mixed emotions. First I've been there for almost 1year. I haven't received a raise because the other staff members not using scoops and making drinks or food without paying for it. I was late one day was was docked hours the next week, but was never officially wrote up. The general manager was very supportive sitting a hard time "
good,"I enjoy working for Panera bread . Just like any job it has it’s ups and downs, but the customers are absolutely amazing! I’m just looking to get out of the fast food industry"
good,"Everyone is helpful and management is very supportive of work effort. Staff members always asking for more hours due to low pay scale. There is a very high standard of cleanliness with emphasis on healthy, fresh food."
good,"When I started working there I was very excited because I knew how Panera treats their staff, I absolutely loved it and I love working hard it was just too hard on my body and I couldn’t take it anymore."
good,"Very productive,  nice workplace, sweet ,caring people, loved working there,  had the awesomest mangers, just had to relocate because of some home issues,  otherwise I would still be there with them! Love my panerafamily"
good,"Panera customers ate great!!!  I have gained some great friends.  I love my coworkers, most are great as well.  We've had a change in management and things aren't as cohesive as they once were."
good,"Worked at the one in the mall of America and in the beginning it was good but I literally went through 4 managers within the year! Not good, then they cut hours drastically. After the summer season and holiday you’re basically screwed for hours unless you are a shift lead or manager."
good,"I was responsible for greeting the guests and completing their order, keeping the bakery clean/stocked, the dining room clean, and sometimes dishes too. Really was a nice, clean place to work but the location i was at had some issues with open communication and would just take an employee off schedule with no warning. Eventually had to find new work."
good,"It was a great job for me at the time. The people were friendly, and a great work environment. I did dining room, barista, cashier, and I was a dishwasher. It was hard work, but as I said it was a great work environment."
good,It started off pretty easy in the morning but would get really busy around lunchtime and dinnertime. It would be stressful and quick paced and the culture was really stressed but we all worked as team and got it down.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It was a great experience fro me to have as a first job. There was a lot that I learned about the food industry for just the few months that I had worked there.
good,Its a very nice place to work. The staff are so welcoming. My first day i got hands on training which was so unique. The customers even worked with me when i would mess up a little. They are a good team and they helped me with a lot of new things i didnt know before.
good,I learned that they didn't always have good business which there was a lot of down time but I did learn some good things from some awesome employees they had.
good,"After getting use to working the overnight shift, it was a fun, fast pace place to work.  The one I worked at had the largest pan-ups of all the other Panera's in the franchise, and was able to complete the nightly bake by myself."
good,"Working at Panera teaches you a lot of good skills you need to be a good proficient worker. They also have a lot of great opportunities to move up in their company... You just have to deal with management when you're at the bottom you might get treated a bit differently than higher ups, but once you earn your respect you get it."
good,I overall love working at panera i just want to expand my options and see what better opportunitys there is to offer out there i learned so much working here but i want to better my options
good,"panera bread was great enviornment to learn basic customer service skills, interact with customers and build a good work relationship with your fellow team members."
good,Clock in and go to your station and stock your station. Make orders and make sure your stations is clean and neat. Also learn about your product your making and safe food storage.
good,"10 Hour Bake which with bad managment wanted wanted done in 8."
good,"I enjoyed working for Panera for 4 years.  It allowed me to learn new things about myself.  It was the first real job I ever had, and I enjoyed the friendships I made along the way."
good,This company is a great starter job for anyone looking to build their job history. They give many opportunities to move up in the company and offer decent benefits to management.
good,"Panera offers many opportunities for growth and personal development    "
good,"Locations can see employee turnover become an issue and this leaves a void in workplace culture where helping the next person/shift is a natural practice.  Training could be much more effective for new hires.  "
good,we was like a family. the staff was so collaborative and professional. i loved being there. i had a great relationship with repeated customers. the food is great !
good,Constantly short staffed and stressful. Training on shift became a constant challenge. Drive thru is super slow. Dishwashing is complex. Immediate hire is a plus.
good,Fun and not a bad place to work. Learned how to come out of my shell and talk more intuitively. Most enjoyable were the job parties and creating friends and memories. Most difficult time to work is during rush hour which is lunch and dinner.
good,The place is a fun loving environment with great customers and customer service. Never a bad moment working in the company but felt like you could do more than just drive.
good,"Was great times. Sandwich-Artist and Salad prep, to preparing the food meats and produce in the back of the place. Gotta hustle those orders quick is all and it is really easy once you get the hang of it. I was less fortunate as far as the pay goes. As an adult I felt betrayed by the management for not taking me serous that I didn't want just 50 cents more than minimum wage with the little amount of hours I was scheduled. It is what it is but when someone with less responsibility and a few years younger than me is paid a dollar and a half more than me, I am sorry but I will need to pack my stuff and go. Sorry for being critical, but I know my worth to the community and I was not getting what I needed. Now maybe if I had the job out of high school with out having to pay for rent then why yes It would have been a perfect place to stay."
good,"While working at Panera I made a lot of connections with regular customers, which was really special to me. I enjoyed my General Manager, who was always helpful. I also loved having such a great responsibility, such as being a caterer."
good,"Panera was my first job and just a job to make money while in high school. I was happy to work there at first, but put in 40 hours a week most times and was loyal and hardworking for them for almost 3 years and was paid minimum wage the entire time. That's ultimately why I quit... they don't pay enough for what they expect of you. Management wasn't perfect at my locations, so it could be different elsewhere. Otherwise, they donated all of their left over baked items, and they're a respectable brand."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Working at Panera is a stable and appreciated job. It is a fast paced industry and the food is prepared in a standard fashion and our rules and sanitization is precise and the store is in pristine condition.
good,It takes a special personal and personality to work for this company. Tough skin is required. Attention too detail. One must also have a strong desire to achieve a hugh quality of customer service.
good,I loved working at Panera! I had an amazing team! My manager was amazing and I had no issues. Mh only concern about the job was low pay and my benefits were too expensive for such a low pay rate.
good,It's an easy place to work. I noticed it takes awhile for you to advance in the company. But everything else is easy. It's a very friendly atmosphere to work in.
good,"Staffing is different day to day as are hours and work load. The schedules are made through company projections which is both a negative and a positive depending on how close projections stack up for the day. It can mean a tremendously busy day with associates jumping from one position to the next or early leave when less guests are expected. However, the environment for both employees, managers, and guests is welcoming and friendly. Expect to both work hard and have a good time."
good,Learned many helpful skills for life from the job just moved from the area. Multicultural and allowed us to be interpersonal with many kids lives and watch them grow as individuals.
good,"This was my first job and I treated it as so. I was a cashier for a little before switching to a waiter. It was an interesting experience as this was my first job, but ultimately I did not want the food industry as a career option."
good,"Very busy normally run out of clean dishes and utensils. Crowded with a lot of business and customers. Coffee and their soups were popular. Always had a new item on the menu mostly season related. Famous for their fresh bread and sweet treats. Friendly employers and helpful. Change coffee hours a lot of back and forth between the floor and kitchen. Do to collecting dirty dishes and washing them. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace and the latest item, which was frequently. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. They were very sweet and thoughtful. For valentine's day two of my favorite customers brought me a box of chocolates."
good,"Great work/life balance"
good,If you are a hard working and reliable employee they will always work with you when you have things come up especially when it deals with family. I personally had this happen and am very thankful.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread consisted of a variety of dutes such as being a busser, cook, cashier and and other duties such as dish washer and handle cash drawer."
good,Everyone There Is Very Productive & Dedicated To What They Do. The Food There Is Great & The Customers Love It When You Remember Who They Are. I Feel As If Panera Is Not A Place That Carries Negative Energy.
good,"I don't mind working hard but it is not great when you don't have enough people to help with the work. When people call in on a daily bases, it makes it hard to even out the work load. It would be nice to have enough coworkers to work smoothly with but it seems impossible. We do have fun at work by joking with each other."
good,"While working at Panera i learned alot. How to make fresh clean foods, barista drinks fresh salads seasonal sandwhiches and soups all while providing excellent customer service."
good,"I work typically 5:30am-2pm. Itis a long day and super early but i do get off at a good time. I've learned to not worry to much about others ""drama"" just do your job and do your best at your job.  Most managers are very nice and respect the employees. One always is disrepectful and another has his days and gets in moods. The hardest part is getting recognition for going above and beyond your job description to better your store or your follow employees. I enjouy the people more than anything"
good,Panera bread is one off the places where they make you feel like in family.........plus food is delicious..'trucks are well maintained......and you are home everyday..
good,I work as a cashier. It's an easy job as for as cashiering you do get tips as well. They would train you for different positions if your tired of doing cashiering.
good,"Clock in ready to go in uniform, and perform infection control procedure. Stock and fill foodlines, cut breads organize and stcok utensils, garbages etc."
good,Always smile and be happy there are alot of good people arounf and it makes it more easier and fun to work. Also getting to know the everday people is always a plus! You make them feel so special.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Rush rush rush. It was a very busy restaurant that was difficult to get breaks in. Schedules varied drastically and were inconsistent because of it. It was not a happy environment most days due to the constant hustle and bustle.
good,"good work environment, relaxed but professional, usually busy most days of the work week during breakfast and lunch hours. management keeps you busy from just standing around with down time. (various tasks to help better the business) "
good,"Working at Panera it gets very hectic, especially when it gets crazy, the restaurant is packed, food takes forever to come and customers get angry. but the pay was good for it to be my first job and employees received free drinks and 60 percent off meals."
good,I love the atmosphere at Panera Bread. I just feel understaffed and being spread a little too thin at the workplace. The GM was a great manager and the employees made great relationships with the customers. The toughest part of the job is relying on employees to show up for work and for help when the job becomes overwhelming.
good,"While working at Panera Bread in Brookline, I had an amazing time. I was able to learn the Barista station where ALL the drinks are made . The salad bar , Cashier , and prep. I like a past work environment so working at Panera I always had a task to complete. I enjoyed my time while at work."
good,I love it every one is so wonderful . I miss the store so much . Just had to move on. The food is amazingggg! How could you not like it. Panera cares about the employees.
good,I worked here for over 6 years at many locations and i can definetly say that panera takes their crew just as seriously as their food. Panera Family is really family i loved this job
good,Panera is overall a great place to work and eat. I only had to leave because I found a better paying job and ii have two kids to take care of. I would have stayed if I could.
good,"In my opinion, panera was the funnest place to work for. Every employee had some type of good relationship with one of the managers, and all of the employees and people around you are reliable. You can depend on the people you work with at panera bread."
good,It was a great job and if I didn't mess up I'd probably still be working there. I love most the guest that came in and my co workers were pretty great. It's a chill environment and was a great job to start your life with.
good,"upped management needs work, they don't really know how to run a business in the employees best interest. This is important to retain good employees"
good,"Working at Panera was fun, I never dreaded coming into work because all of the coworkers were like family, and they made the days go by faster. The management truly care about their employees. The most enjoyable part of the job to me would be building a relationship with the regulars and getting to see them on a day to day basis."
good,Hands on training. Great employees as well as management. Very friendly and welcoming. Made me feel comfortable starting something new. I was sad to leave this company.
good,"High standards in quality of product, presentation, and customer service. Room for advancement no matter where you start, and staff was always friendly."
good,I love it there but not enough hours I'm looking for more hours  have to provide great customer service skills the food there is great and wonderful just wish they provide more hours
good,Each store is different but it was worth the experience. Like any retail job there was bad customers or a grumpy manager. It was a fun job that I wish I could have continued to do.
good,panera is a best restaurant cafee is good open early and close late and is a place to relaxe or you can studie not to much noises nice place i like.
good,"Everyday I was able to work with fun, hardworking individuals who understood about going that extra mile for our customers. What I loved the most about the job was the interpersonal relationships I formed over the years.The hardest part of the job was being busy without enough persons staffed."
good,best team i have ever worked with before loking for something just like this. Thats just as fun and friendly and a great work place
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,coworkers were nice to work with alot of team effort. some managers were not so proffessional so alot of turnover
good,Good company to work for definitely some ups and downs like with any job.
good,Best Custumers in the work force. Fast pace clean work inviroment. You do not go home smelling like fast food. Heathy food choices.
good,"Do my morning shift routine, I learn a lot from my customers on a daily basis they teach me things I dont normally know, Management is an up and down process some days are better then others, I love my co workers they are all wonderful people and I have never encountered any problems work with them, Dealing with customer issues I've learned no matter how hard you try to please some people you can't but I try as hard as i can to make them satified when they leave, Most enjoyable part of my job is making peoples day just by knowing their order."
good,Loved the people I worked with and even the job but at the time i was young and needed to quit to be more into my school work.
good,You have an oppourtunity to train in various positions and work in a fast paced enviorment. I worked with great managaers and made great friends but ulitmatley wasnt given the oppourtunity for advancement after finiding many ways to help the company with no recognition.
good,It was an okay place to work. Crew and Management was fun for the most part.
good,"A overall good company if u got the patience to be consistent, or good stepping stone."
good,"this was a great place to work i really did enjoy it the pay okay, and i really didn't have time for my self but i did enjoy the time i did have there"
good,"Wish I never had to leave! The management was great with everything, especially working around some issues I had with starting right away."
good,good place to work and good advancement opportunities. the training is great and theres a lot to learn. They really spend time investing in their employees!
good,"Panera is classier than most fast food restaurants so it attracts a certain type of customer. You're held to a high standard but Apart from the few impatient customers we run into, many more have smiles to share. I'm treated with respect by co-workers and customers alike. The management is reliable as well. Gaps are filled quickly and efficiently. Panera can offer you more benefits than most places due to its success."
good,"Managers come and go. "
good,I would totally recommend this job to anyone who likes to work in a fast paced place. It is a busy place that keeps you on your feet and you always have something to do.
good,"The work I do at Panera is handling food, so it can be very stressful but the is always great communication. The management is great and the hours are flexible with my schedule."
good,"There is a breakfast, lunch, and dinner rush. During these times, employees are on high alert and doing everything as fast as possible because the cafe is extremely busy. This teaches us to manage our time better so we may get things done before the rush."
good,"I have found that I am enjoying working here, and that if you want extra hours all you have to do is work hard. The pay is darn good for the work you actually do!"
good,Co-workers and the customers are fairly nice here and easy to get along with. The job is relaxed and sometimes fast paced. Very reasonable and understanding managers.
good,The job is a laid-back working environment has a lot of room to grow if you’re willing to relocate the hours of stretched out throughout the day if you’re trying to get full-time
good,"Panera was the best job I ever worked at thus far. It’s all about positivity and hard work there! Do your best, show up for your shifts, and let management know you mean business and you’ll grow in no time."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,there can be to little hours and lots of favoritism .. it had very good customer service and a supporting team .. but they can have lots of call ins and it’s not enough staff .
good,All workers were very understanding and very helpful with teaching me everything. They let me figure out my schedule and had me try new things almost every day. I loved working there.
good,"When I first got hired, there was two amazing managers out the four who had hired me. After a month of working there, the ""Big Boss"" had came for inspection basically. They had gotten fired on the spot, why? I have no idea because they were the ones who made sure that everyone and everything was moving smoothly. Once they were gone, that is when it went down hill. People who were not in charge before, automatically thought it was okay to try and tell employees what to do. And we barely had any drivers, and the location I worked at was very busy. The two actual managers honestly did whatever. So I left during a shift and never came back."
good,"This job started off great, but unfortunately once new management started arriving everything started going down hill. Dont get y wrong j lobeymy job but the managers representation on themselves really rubs off on the employees. Now that we have new management it's better"
good,"When you opened you we’re responsible for making all coffee, tea, bacon, sausage, soufflés, ect. "
good,"It was ok but I wish the coworkers were nicer. Scheduling was very fair, as were my managers. It was hard to get hours at first. I struggled to get along with my coworkers."
good,"a typical day at panera bread for a dining room person, is making coffee, serving food to customers, refilling drink machines/ bins, clearing tables, cleaning, nice poeple work for panera bread, hardiest part of the job would be cutting on hours you work, and i liked almost everything i did"
good,"Pretty good , sometimes management was bad and some employees tought they were better then others but overall I like me working there it was my very first job"
good,Panera means what the say when it comes to good quality food for health concious people. They do encourage advancement from within. They move managers without consent and very little notice
good,Good place to work at. Good management. Clean and safe workplace. Was a great learning experience. Very social work place. I recommend working there. I learned a lot about food safety.
good,"You build amazing team skills and relationships working at Panera bread, it is a super fast paced/ all hands on deck kind of job so be ready for that. I miss working for Panera but they just don't pay enough!! Definitely recommend it!"
good,"If you are in high school, this job is it. The schedule manager manovuers the whole staff and you will receive your good hours and give you enough time for homework."
good,It has its moments when things are good. But the way they run certain things could be better. I think one of the largest things that’s an issue is communication between management and associates.
good,"Absolutely loved my time at Panera. I definitely got lucky though. Most people hate working at Panera but I ended up meeting my best friends here. If it weren’t for the people, the job itself sucks."
good,I have nothing bad to say about this job. I felt I was paid what I should have been for the jobs I was doing there. Hours were absolutely great and allowed enough time for me to do my college work on top of working. I would definitely recommend!
good,Panera is a great learning environment. The shifts are easy and coworkers make the day fun. The concept of Panera is not commonly seen in the restaurant industry when it began. It is a perfect place to get a fresh pastry and catch up with friends.
good,Work speed varies greatly with the time that you are working with however if it is busy then managers will leap at the chance to help the team. All of my co-workers were great individuals who showed great potential and a great work ethic.
good,"It was an exciting experience, but my manager didn't pay me enough to work for the company anymore. The people were nice and the environment was quiet but fast paced."
good,good place to work. must be able to work in all locations wnen needed.pay could be better considering the responsibility of having to get all baking done to open store most of the time by yourself
good,The management is good and so are the people i am enjoying my time working at Panera Bread I mean it’s wonderful I’m just currently looking for a better paying job because I want to start a family soon and I would like to provide my child with Heath care and my time
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread! My coworkers and managers were all amazing and cooperated well with my needs, the reason for my leaving was due to a cut on my hours after finding out about my pregnancy and no changes after multiple complaints."
good,"I loved this job. I enjoyed how fast we had to work. With the general manager I had, he kept everything up to par. Starting with his staff, products, customer appreciation and interaction."
good,"My store had great organizational culture, and working was always fun. However, I felt like at times I was not given the tools by my management team to succeed at my job."
good,"As a manager can be very stressful due to callouts and busy environment. However, this is expected in the industry. Overall, compare to other jobs in the industry I believe this is one of the better quality when it comes to hours work and compensation."
good,"Great discounts on food and good tips for my position, but I am seeking a different line of work because everyone I work with is quite a bit younger than me, including management.  I have also been monetarily capped in my position.  This is a great job for kids."
good,I really like my job at Panera but working nights no longer fits into my family life style as my family needs changed so has my schedule i need to be more available in the evenings and some days off
good,"It was a good first time job, they were good with my availability. Learned customer service starting here and helped me grow as a person. Oasis place got along with both manager and staff."
good,Panera Bread is a fast-paced working environment and required good communication and team-work skills. Each area in the cafe communicated with every other area. The hardest part of the job is getting a rush and making people satisfied at the same time.
good,"Great managers that will help you out in cafe and want to see you succeed. Friendly staff and workers, plus the regulars are pretty awesome and really make your day."
good,Fun and exciting place to work. Fast paced environment that is different everyday. You meet new people everyday and make friends.              Long hours but it is worth it
good,"Great job environment. Learn a lot about teamwork and individual abilities. Would recommend working here for everyone, mainly for a temporary workplace."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working for this company.  I would recommend this company to anyone who wants to work in a cafe/bakery.  The management really take their time with employees, and try to promote from within whenever they can."
good,"I’ve been working at Panera for just over 2 years, it’s a great place to work, has its ups and downs, but overall I enjoy it. I enjoy every manager I work with and every associate i work with. Hours are flexible and shifts are both long and short. but I make a decent amount of money."
good,I was young it was fun. I ran 4 different store while i was there over the years. hours were long but it was fun. I worked for a franchise so a little different
good,"Panera is nice part time job for someone who want to work there way up the cooperates ladder. the food is fresh and clean and co-workers become like family, and customers become familiar faces."
good,"I had worked at Panera Bread for almost two years, while I worked there I had a very close relationship with all of my coworkers, I considered my fellow employees as a second family. However the downside was with my location was that the management was not the best however the people I worked with and regular customers that makes up for that."
good,It was really fun and you get free meals so I loved it. It was really fast paced and you had to make sure you got the order correct otherwise people would come back and be grumpy. Otherwise it was really easy and fun!
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Was supposed to be a college job and I was afforded the opportunity to work my way up the company to a GM position. Great structured company. Work/life balance can be tough since the hours are typically very random.
good,This was a very wonderful company to work for. They are extremely supportive of employees and willing to help you with getting shoes and the necessary training if you should choose to move up in the company. they are thorough in training and ensuring that you get every aspect of the job duties well mastered before moving you into another area.
good,"Days were fairly easygoing. I enjoyed the customer service I learned and exceeded. Management was really lenient and I never had any issues. Everyone was always helpful and attentive. The hardest part had to be during holidays, but it was also my favorite. Working in a fast paced environment and pleasing customers was my favorite part of the job."
good,"It was nice working at Panera Bread, nice coworkers, nice guests and very clean atmosphere. Management is fine and shift hours are good, if you need more you are most likely always able to get more hours."
good,"Fast paced. High volume. Great training programs.  Corporate support. Daily & weekly café focus. Monthly crew meetings. Communication between managers & crew."
good,"A typical day at work here consist of making sure your area is stocked and cleaned. Also, making sure you greet and help every customer in a welcoming manner. I learned how to bake the bagels, set up the bakery display, and the different varieties of bread. The management at the Panera i worked at was great! Them being very understanding and helpful really made my day at work better. The culture is calming and interesting. At the end of the night Panera donates all the left over bread and pastries to church/helping foundations. The hardest part of the job is dealing with grumpy senior citizens and also working at a very fast pace during a rush. The most enjoyable part is being able to taste the new incoming foods and drinks."
good,It was my first job that I kept all through college. It is going to really be awful at times. There will be the best and the worst managers but its worth it. I have met some of my closest friends there and I am so happy I had the job.
good,"no comment about saint louis bread  Thank you"
good,never go to the Panera bread in Hudson the general manger called me the n word and the district manger covered it up.  Go to any other Panera great place to work. Very high paced and for the most part always loved my job. We learned a lot great experience .
good,"Good workplace good people I left due to lack of hours. I felt at home there everybody was so understandable to all types of situations, never reall had problems adjusting but I had problems with the hours that was offered to me"
good,"Panera bread is a great place to work. You don't get any real benefits or paid time off but you do get 65% off their food which is always a plus since everyone seems to love Panera! However, it is a quick paced environment because it will go from having not a single customer in the store, to 15 in line and out the front door so be ready to prepare yourself for that!"
good,"As a training manager I was in charge of making sure all associates training were welcomed to the company with a company class, I was in charge of completing their packets and assigning them to their trainer and updating their training matrix. Also was in charge of daily operations in the store and handling customer complaints."
good,"Working at Panera was like being around family all day, until they switched all the managers. I learned a lot working there, and advanced very quickly."
good,"Panera Bread is a great company to work for with great ethics, standards and morals. It can be stressful with the amount of multitasking and collaborating with multiple egos while maintaining positive attitude in front of the house. Good groceries and great manager."
good,I would come into work first thing in the morning and the managers told us about what they expected for the day and the things we needed to get done. managers were really easy going and nice. The GM went out of his way to make me feel like i was at home and it was a nice feeling.
good,"Panera's food is amazing to begin with, the staff is always friendly and i love that the main focus is the customers experience. I love my coworkers, everyone helps out everyone and it's always just a genuine, happy environment."
good,"Since working at Panera Bread I have learned alot of important skills that I have been able to use to further my career. A typical day consists of preparing the bakery for the rest of the work day, taking orders, and training new employees"
good,Panera has helped with my time management and is making me a better baker. I love working nights and for Panera. My manager makes coming to work lovely. She is the best
good,"Early mornings, fast paced. Team leads were very nice. A very busy place. Management was great! The hardest part of the jib was getting up early. Most enjoyable part of the job was that everybody cleaned their area for the net shift!"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Good job and great coworkers. The environment is fast paced and customer service is a must especially at Panera. You have to work hard to do well at this job.
good,"This was such a great place to work. It was a fun environment, the managers were great and I made a lot of friends out of this job. It paid above minimum wage. They were super flexible with my hours because I was attending college at the time. I know it was stressful on the lines, but I worked the dining room and it was pretty easy."
good,"A typical day at work would include coming in and prepping the store to open, set up all the pastries, prep the sandwiches, fill the bagels and then you would be ready for the morning rush. That started at about 8 and went until at least 10. Endless bagel dozens, coffee drinks and pastries being served. Then about 11:30 hits lunch and the line is out the door again until about 3. Dinner rush isn't as bad as breakfast and lunch but dinner rush brings in the huge families that don't know what they want. Throughout your shift if you were cashier you would have to go out to the dining room to clean it up and bring dirty dishes to the kitchen. Or you would be working on the line making the food and prepping for the next rush. I learned a lot of customer service skills with this being my first job. Management is kind of lazy but that was 5 years ago so who knows now. Hardest part of the job is learning what goes where and what goes on what. Most enjoyable part of the job is the regular customers you get, and the smile on their face when you remember their order."
good,"A place you can take your family for a great meal. Food served in a warm, welcoming environment by people who care. A very relaxing place for customers."
good,"Managers were nice and helpful. Workplace was fast-paced depending on the time of day, but was a pleasure to work at. Would eat there seven days out of the week!"
good,"Working with Panera Bread for over 10 years has really helped me master my skills in the customer service field. I have learned to deal with change when mangers and fellow employees came and left. I was able to stay consistent and set the bar high for employees that came in after me. "
good,Great job. Great environment. Managers were great. They do not require disability pay when you get hurt unless you sign up in advance. Other than that positive environment.
good,"Panera was my first job. I quit because I got a better job offer that ended up not working out. Your daily tasks include, cashiering, food prep, drive thru, or dishes. Co workers are the best part of Panera, and management is very helpful and flexible. Overall great place to work."
good,Its A Very Fun Place To Work Easy To Maintain Your Outside Life And Your Work Life Very Easy To Balance. Easy to talk to the managers they are also understanding and always willing to work with you. even if its a problem with yiur schedule or you just need some time off to yourself or get yourself together. they even askif you need a break and try to move you around to different areas on the job.
good,"A typical day at Panera was fun and exciting. we were always learning new food items or drinks. Management was part of the team, if the line got backed up they would jump in and lend a hand.  The hardest part of the job was around lunch when someone new was on the line. Just the time it takes to get the food out was sometimes frustrating but we always managed to figure things out."
good,"while i enjoyed my job, management gave me an issue. when i asked for more hours, they cut me off, put me on medical leave without my notice, and refused to contact me back."
good,"My experience was very humbling, as a minimum wage job, I learned a lot about serving customers and keeping friendly and positive attitudes all the time even during rushes and busy hours"
good,"flexible scheduling "
good,I enjoy working here they are good people to work with and the enviroment is nice. Fast paced and they have excellent customer service. The food is great and good for you.
good,Company ethic based on clean foods. Fast paced work environment. Constant encouragement to succeed. Customer satisfaction and healthy menu content is prioritized.
good,"Management really cared about the company and staff. One of my favorite places to have worked. Training was excellent, the schedule was flexible, and the atmosphere serious but also very relaxed."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job at Panera was opening the bakery. I enjoyed getting it ready and presentable for the customers. Consolidating bagels and pastries for sale.
good,"The environment is very great and the employees are like family. Its a great job to work at, a lot of college kids. So 9 times out of 10 if you have a personal problem someone there can relate. If i had the choice to go back i most definitely would."
good,Management needs to not be so afraid to make associate changes and give disciplinary actions for not showing up to work. The job can be overwhelming when the store is short workers.
good,allowed to succeed in some areas; given some opportunity for advancement; allowed to get additional training;  meet new people and gain additional experiences
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I'v Honestly liked working at Panera Bread after  6 months but the Manager was to disrespectful so i gave my 2 weeks notice
good,"I like Panera. Meet a lot of good people at Panera. The management did their jobs, didn't allow anyone to slack. I had a great experience working for Panera. My trainer was fantastic, she knew what she wad doing."
good,always making sure my ticket times were good enough or under our goal of 4 minutes. being a good team player is a big roll in working at a panera bread. closing shifts were always done so well and staff was well trained.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with others. I loved the welcoming vibe that Panera Bread gives off.
good,Stayed with the company for nearly a year before deciding to leave for the military life. This was my first job and i was able to learn alot of patience and customer service. The management was incredible. The hardest part of my job was leaving. I loved the fast paced enviroment behind the scenes but the calm and collective dining experience.
good,"good place for teens, i love my job there i just want something more. fun environment and company really cares they treat you well fun happy delightful teamwork communication clean good food easy"
good,Everyone had a great relationship and always worked well together. The most enjoyable part about my job was getting to know my every day customers as well as my assoicates.
good,"The team was organized and full of integrity. It is a fast paced work environment, with a lot to keep you busy. I enjoyed working there."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Panera Bread. My co-workers were very diverse and amazing to work with. The managers were always very understanding about whatever was going on in your lives. The interview was very in depth and personalized. They even asked a very profound question: ""What is the most important lesson you've learned in life?"" During orientation we watched a life-changing video ""This is Water"" by David Foster Wallace, which changed my outlook on certain things in life. We got to try everything we make, which helped a lot. I also appreciated the company's policy on throwing away food. At the end of the night, we donated all of our unused bread to homeless shelters and needy families. We sometimes even got to take food home ourselves, as every bakery item was made fresh every day."
good,Not a horrible place to work for. It stayed busy at times which gave me plenty to do. I would absolutely tell anyone to apply if asked
good,"Very flexible with your schedule. I love interacting with repeat customers, they are the highlight to my day. Most of the employees get along and we laugh daily which make the day go easier."
good,"Calm environment with productive staff and helpful, supportive management. Encouraging co-workers who help you set smaller goals in life to achieve the big ones."
good,The management has improved. the job is very easy. you can learn many positions they have. dealing with customers is easy in this environment.
good,"Most of the day was spent overlooking elderly patients. "
good,The management was a little undecided. I would have my schedule with my assignments and they would assign me to someplace completely different in the restaurant. The job was very fast paced and kept me on my feet.
good,At Panere Bread a typical day for me started at 5am and ended at 3pm. You have 1 hour to set the bakery case and have coffee ready by store opening at 6am. It is very fast pace. But I loved the customers most. You get to know them on a personal level.
good,"I worked alone from 10:00 P.M. until 7:00 A.M. Baking breads , pastries and soufflé.It was a challenge everyday but in the end the results we're worth every bit of effort I expended.I would still work there but I moved to Florida."
good,I learned that every job has pros and cons depending on your expectations and how open minded you are. Management could do a lot better but a select few are literally doing the best they can. Half of my co-workers I can say I would definitely call if I ever needed someone to talk to outside of work and the other half I keep as professional relationships because some of the employees have nothing but negativity pumping through their veins.
good,Fun and exciting environment .Enjoyed all parts of my job. I enjoyed working for this company.I was able to meet a lot of great customers and build an honest relationship with them
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera Bread's clear guidelines made little to the imagination.  Always opportunity for advancement for the right individuals.
good,"I often start the day slicing the bread for the entire store."
good,"Pros:"
good,I've enjoyed working for Panera for the last four years. It has provided me with the additional management opportunity for career advancement as well as flexibility to go back to school.
good,The only people that were rude sometimes were the customers.  But overall definitely a great place to work.  The people you worked with were hard workers and understanding about everything and very professional.  Quality control was very important to them.
good,a reliable job that had a lot of room or advancement. Fun environment and popular food.
good,"The people were great, managers were understanding, and generally nice people. Some aspects of the job were really difficult, though."
good,"Typically you would spend the day working and working hard at that, but all at the same time you got to know the employees so well you all were like family which made work kinda fun. Learned some of the easiest ways to bring up conversation while hosting."
good,"Usually the two busy times of the day is between 7:30am and 10:30am, also lunch time between 11:30 and 2pm. For the most part my job is pretty easy unless we get a day when we tend to have alot of Catering orders."
good,"I took this position with the understanding that there would be fast promotions, but I could see after a while that they were moving slower than I needed. It was a job with a steep learning curve, based on a 6-week training course, very demanding physically, working solitary overnight. I got rave reviews for my baking skills, work ethic, preparation, cleaning and inventory attentiveness. I left to take a desk job in managing the print program for Express Scripts."
good,"I absolutely Loved my job at Panera bread, because it wasn't just a job it was a second home, it was a second family. Having regulars remembering what they like and there usual's was amazing for me. You begin to learn things about your co workers and customers that just bring you together. I don't know if it was the atmosphere that we were in but there was little to no conflict ever. It was always the positive oasis that, was our goal to create each and every day."
good,"Working at Panera Bread in Torrance was such a great experience. The company definitely knows the meanings of ""team work"" and respect. While working there I learned how to work as a team and how to treat customers the proper way. The managers there always made sure that the employees felt comfortable, whether it was just coming in to work or if we needed help. The employees were all so willing to help and work with each other that it made it feel like we had our own little family. I had a wonderful experience and would do it all over again if I could."
good,"take orders, make drinks, make guest feel at home"
good,"Panera is a good place to work, they have a good team work enviorment."
good,"a great place to work, with a good environment. Ive learned how to interact with customers on a personal level."
good,"Panera has a very welcomining establishment that offers great customer service, fresh food, and a clean environment."
good,i enjoyed working with this company but they need work on how to talk to employees
good,It could use more of my experience in management but I'm not sure if they understand that I qualify for the positions. I would be happy if I were able to help them with the inventory and maybe suggest some things of my own experience that will benefit the company.
good,"Working at Panera bread is a constant struggle if you don’t know what you’re doing. You gotta be quick on your feet, efficient, and friendly to your peers and guests."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Highly recommend working here for a first job or if you're in college, great team, flexible hours, and a wonderful learning experience. Sometimes can be a little stressful but if you're a hard worker it is easy to overcome."
good,Great place to work everyone is pretty friendly and welcoming as well as the company offers flexible hours and good pay. Most of the managers are very friendly as well.
good,"Cooking, sanitizing, meal prep, stocking coolers"
good,I feel like the company could pay a little more with my experience. I wish we had more team work. I feel that other get paid more for less work. Overall I love the company
good,"I learned a lot through this job on how to handle with money, and be able to handle all my tasks in a certain amount of time. This was a good first job to teach me how to handle things under pressure and fast."
good,This is a great place to work! Everyone is so nice and the company is so generous! Its like working with family! Im looking forward to my next shift!!
good,If you’re looking for a good Highschool job definitely work here! The pay is a little unfair and can be improved but this place is just amazing to work at overall. Management is AMAZING! Crew is so fun and makes this a place that doesn’t make you go “ugh work” if you know what I mean! Highly recommend:)
good,"Well to start off a typical day at work is just a typical day at work. There's not that much fun if we put it like that. But even on a typical day, we all can learn something new. I learn how to interact with people and be nice. My workplace was clean and I kept it that way. The hardest part of the job was multi-tasking. And the most enjoyable part was the break. Because it gave me time to think."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of showing up, gowning up, being notified of your position, and moving from the very moment you're on the clock to the second you're done.  This place helped me further hone my strong work ethic and I definitely did not mind the friendly environment provided from both coworkers and management.  It really was a big family.  The hardest part of the job was also one of the most enjoyable, the quick pace ensured that the shift would fly by much quicker than anticipated."
good,Panera is a great place to work while your in high school. They give you about 4-5 hour shifts. They care about their employees and want the guest to leave happy. The only downside is you don't make a whole lot.
good,"I took the job at Panera because I wanted to work night shift. I love it, but it is definitely not for everyone. Nightowls, however, will love the hours, and the feeling of accomplishment at the end of the shifts when you have piles of fresh baked bread. If you like baking and staying up all night and don't like having too many coworkers, this is the job for you, so long as you can afford to live on $15/hr."
good,"The management was amazing and the food was amazing too. I wish that the pay was higher, but we did get 50% off discount but only on days that you work and it doesn’t go past 20 dollars."
good,"Wonderful management, and coworkers were great. Love the fun- atmosphere. "
good,"Was a great job, especially for younger folks. Would be tasked with either cashiering, barista, line work, dish work, prep, or dining service. Fast pace but workable when prepared properly and if everyone works as a team."
good,"I don't have too many complaints.  It got busy and stressful at times, like a lot of jobs. But all in all, I had much fun at my location and the staff, most of us were family. Our manager was pretty much just that, our manager. But I loved it there at times. The hours I had just really weren't good for my home life..."
good,Working at Panera Bread was an amazing experience! I loved going to work every and the managers were amazing! I would recommend this job to anyone looking for extra income!
good,"A great place to work, flexible hours and co workers are great to work with. The staff is curtious to staff and listen when there's a personal problem."
good,It was a great experience I would definitely come back to work for this franchise and to grow along with it. Customers were definitely my favorite part about coming in to work. The work environment was safe and an overall happy place to work.
good,Typical day at work would consist of meeting with General Managers and their Assistant Managers to train them how to run a tighter payroll without hindering their ability to provide an exceptional experience for every customer.  I would meet with the Eastern Region VP monthly to review my territory's performance and to evaluate what can be done to improve the territory's performance.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It started off rough. I was a baker and watched a lot off bmm's come and go. Se3ms to have a hard time to make get things to run smoothly. But after years going by it got better. Always room for improvements.
good,"Good benefits and you can get insurance almost immediately. Decent wages. Can have weird hours that is one of the biggest issues, but most people are used to that. Great associates."
good,"Typical day to day  at Panera was opening the cafe`, putting out the bakery, putting out tills, and preparing for the lunch hour and taking care of breakfast orders, daily produce orders, daily dough orders, high set service goals and expectations."
good,"Panera has an exceptional flexible schedule. The work can be fast paced and can sometimes get pretty busy. Very rarely will I ever feel feel overwhelmed. There’s always work to be done in the restaurant if an employee cannot find something to do. Delivery however, has many positive and negative benefits. Sometimes there are many orders with lack of tips. On average I will receive a $40 order with $2 on it. Rarely will there be 15% tip. But every now and then I will earn 25% tip. Mileage reimbursement is excellent. However tracking mileage with the Bringg app has minor flaws. Sometimes the app does not record all the miles so I have to turn on my trip meter. The Bringg app itself also has some issues connecting over internet data. Sometimes it will crash, and other times it will affect my GPS causing my location to be incorrect. Other than that, my store has the best management team on the planet and would recommend this job to everyone."
good,"Panera bread is a great company to work for and has put all my skills i have learned throughout the years to the test. it is a challenge most days, but good thing i am never afraid of a challenge and like to overcome them and feel accomplished."
good,"Good place to work, nice people, food discount, easy job in a fast paced environment, if it paid more and I could live off that wage I’d go back, thanks."
good,"I loved everything about Panera, the only down fall is I worked for a franchise and the insurance was outrageous. The clientele was awesome and the employees were great."
good,"The menu changes several times a year, so you have to be willing to roll with the changes. I moved from an hourly associate to a GM within 2 years. Hard work is definitely rewarded"
good,"the people working there are helpful, interactive, loving. fun to work. great time working there. feel like working at home. i learnt managing stuff all around the house. there is no racism. the work of everybody is respected."
good,"typical day at work "
good,I really like working at Panera. Everyone is super friendly and the managers are great. I only intend to leave because it is not a good job for my mental health.
good,It was a fun job but didnt like the manager because they disnt know how to make food and asking for help you couldnt get that. But besides the poor management its a good job to work at beside paying for parking which sucks.
good,I worked here for a little under 3 years at 2 different cafes and enjoyed every minute of it. The management and staff are very friendly and the work is enjoyable. They are very understanding about hours and will work with you for a schedule that works for you. The people I worked with are still some of my best friends. The company as a whole is very honest in how it produces its product and it is a very amazing company in my opinion.
good,I liked working at panera bread for the most part. it taught me alot about working with different personalities as well as different customers. It taught me patience and a great work ethic.
good,"the job was great, good work environment great manage. works with you to progress in the company and make sure that you work the best to your ability."
good,"The work environment was very easy and relaxed, management was nice and allowed for lots of easy growth if you were willing and able. Any area of the restaurant is quick and easy to learn."
good,"I go to school while I work, so I can't work every other day like I used to in the summer. When I told my manager about my situation, he fully understood and was able to organize the schedule hours to my preference, while also complying to the other employees. Now I am able to balance work and school with no worries!"
good,"Panera Bread was great and the management was laid back with friendly co-workers. They fit your work hours to whatever schedule you had available and honored the days when you couldn't come in, as long as you had a legitamit reason."
good,"Would recommend Panera to anyone looking for a job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"It always felt like I was coming in to a family. My store used to listen to music every day. It was very fast paced, but if you couldn't make the proper speed, management found the best place for you."
good,They take your order within 5 minutes and you get your food within 10 minutes Very nice to customers. Give you free stuff if they get your order wrong sometimes.
good,"I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the people you work with are quality people. The customers tend to be nice and you really get to know them too. Management really worked with you as well."
good,taught me how to work under pressure in a timely manner and also how to maintain different jobs positions at once.  great job just doesn't give a lot of hours
good,I loved working for Panera in their FDF. It was fast paced with great pay and benefits. They worked around my home life. And made it a fun and enjoyable workplace.
good,Worked mainly with the drive-thru. It was a lot of fun everyday working with the drive-thru team delivering food to the customers. You are able to learn new skills quickly.
good,Fun environment to work in. They are always there to help and making sure that everything is right and want to be the best employee I can be. When holidays come up they are willing to help when its really busy.
good,I really liked working at Panera because I actually like the people that I worked with and the managers were very flexible and understanding of my schedule
good,"I worked her for about 4 months as a line cook making the food. It is pasted paced and hard to get a hang of the menu at first, but the people and managers are very chill and understand a lot. The environment is very calm, but the management lacks with upholding the rights of the employees because most of the customers used to harass our cashiers and even me, in the back cooking food."
good,"Panera has different environments depending on which store you visit. The one I'm currently employed with is by far the best, thus I still have a job there. I am a Freelance Artist, so I need time to fill and bills to pay. They've been so flexible and accommodating I can't see anyone doing better."
good,I really enjoyed working here for the two and a half years that I did but hours started getting cut and I started to feel uncomfortable working there because of a few select people
good,"Panera is a overall great place to work and really interact with customers and gain knowledge. Management is iffy but overall they are helpful, and push you to do your best."
good,Not a bad place to work. I prepped so I was not doing any customer service hardly. I was in the back making sure everyone upfront had what they needed. Everyone always used manners and were quick to help if needed.
good,"Off course management and the staff makes a place as well, however Panera Bread as a whole is just great. It is a stable chain, with great customers that know what they want, and overall very friendly environment."
good,i work 6 days a week and one day i was working and one of the managers from a differnt panera bread in kingwood asked me to go on break in the middle of a lunch rush with a line out the door i ask for help with the trash and sometimes the manger walks away alot of times but gives me the key to the door and i ended up doing trash all by myself because the manger wanted the delivery driver to stop helping me so he can go do his delivery and most of the time thay are very short staff but the most enjoyable part is that i love washing dishes i clean for hours and clean things that are very dirty in the company
good,"Panera Bread had wonderful managers with friendly employees. I felt welcomed into the job and enjoyed my time. Meal time rushes are fast paced, but you learn quickly how to properly handle them. They want to see you succeed and if you want to move up the employee ladder they will help you do so."
good,"I have learned the importance of food safety."
good,"Awesome company to work for with one goal in mind that drives the rest of the company’s decisions. Consistently improving/changing/making forward progress and setting the bar. Culture of the stores are always positice, relaxing, and inviting."
good,Its a good palce if you like overnights and being alone all night from 9pm to 5am then working with others from 5 to 7am. you spend most of the the day on your feet running around.
good,Much better work environment than other food service places I have worked. Better management too. Pay was good. They do a tip sharing program. So all the tips made during your pay period get distributed to all the employees. Often times we would get free food (mainly bread) although it was usually the day old stuff (still good in my opinion). I enjoyed it.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,overall workign a Panera coorperate store is good i enjoyed my coworkers and the enviornment. however i did not like that i had to basically beg for hours even thought i was doing my job better then anyone in my position.
good,Great management with a great manager. Fast-paced work environment. Excellent training program. Great team working employees. And wonderful food available with a discount
good,"-many opportunities for friendship"
good,I worked for them for 4 years and never got a raise. It was very stressful and the management just st there and you drowned in work. i enjoyed the other employees. they didnt not provide enough help when a rush came.
good,"The Panera team is amazing, and I truly enjoy the work environment. Working with Panera Bread has definitely been overall, my favorite work place. Both the team and management have a perfect balance of work and ""play"". I am challenged to be better on a daily basis and everyone ""pulls their own weight."""
good,"My manager is awesome, really allows for quality of life and work balance.  Collaborative teams working on process and system improvements.  Great location and perks of free food."
good,"I really liked working at Panera as an overnight baker, but overnights takes a toll on you and the pay isn't great for the large amount of work you have to complete. Management was wonderful though."
good,"A typical day at work could be very relaxed or very hectic, depending on how busy we were on the specific day, but we all work together as team so it's never a bad time. In my opinion, the hardest part about my job was getting to learn all the different parts of the store. After I learned the different positions, it was very simple and fun. This was my first official job and it really taught me time management, responsibility, and putting the customer first."
good,"Main line opener/Server/Order Taker as part of an overall Customer Service decorum."
good,"Over all the experience working for Panera was fine, especially having been able to advance as much as I did. However as time did go by it did become a more & more stressful environment that could've been taken care of by many of the people involved but never really handled."
good,"Panera Bread is a company to build, further, and better your career.  It gives you the chance to fully grow in the work life. I enjoy working for the company."
good,I enjoyed working at Panera bread and continue to enjoy going there to eat. There were pros and cons as with any company and would have stayed employed there but had my own life issues and working was not an option for me at that time.
good,I was a Shift Supervisor in West Bend. I ran shifts all different times of the day. I enjoyed my coworkers and learning new things. Learning about new healthy foods too.
good,my only issue was the pay it just wasn't there for me i felt like i was putting in way more than i was getting out of the job and if things were different i would go back.
good,"It had a friendly atmosphere with other co-workers, even though we were constantly busy and hassling with orders and customers. We are paid relatively high in comparison to other places, and we can opt for health and financial benefits. An overall decent and fun place to work at."
good,Is a very layed back atmosphere except around dinner and lunch rush. Very friendly coworkers and managers. there are lots of areas to learn as an associate.
good,I really Enjoyed working there.It had the best Management I've ever worked for.I would still be there but not enough hours and slow in the off seasons.Best people I ever worked with and for.
good,"This is a great company to work for, especially those who are young and inexperienced, retired, recently immigrated and those looking to supplement their income with a second job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day at panera would be fast paced and a little stressful during the peak hours. The management was overall great until they would push you to do management duties without management pay."
good,I would prepare hot and cold food as well as beverages. I served food to people and cleaned up the dining room area. I was able to use the cash register and also Washed the dishes and cleaned the store every night.
good,"This is a good place to work at while in college. "
good,"A typical workday at Panera for me began at 4am my wake up report to work & preform under minimal supervision. You must be able to work independently and be trusted to complete all opening duties or else you and your team mates could drown and fast. I learned something new almost everyday and was aware of all new trending healthy options coming to the food industry. It was challenging to work for the industry leader of this niche market however it was truly rewarding to know at the end of the day what you served was actually good for the general public. The managers were always empathetic or sympathetic if emergencies or life in general threw you a curve ball! The most enjoyable part of my day was when through all the diversity of team members, daily obstacles and astronomical breakfast and lunch numbers came in I could say I helped lead my team with success through all the challenges that arose. I learned innovative techniques and ideas to help me become a very efficient problem solver."
good,Really enjoyed working here. During lunch it's very busy which passes time. Great team to work with and the management is wonderful as well. Thank you
good,"I experince work in cafe.and enjoy and.balance my job "
good,I loved working here! We got to make our own name tags and they worked around my school schedule. I learned how to work as a team so no one fell behind. The workplace culture was relaxed and the GM was the best GM I've ever had. He knew my family as well as me very well and was willing to work with me on any problems. The hardest part of the job was being over worked. It could get very busy and sometimes very tiring being there all the time. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with. they were all great!
good,"Open and close Restaurant, conduct interviews and train new employees.  Conduct 90 day reviews, oversee the daily operations of the restaurant ensure guest satisfaction and maintain food quality."
good,My typical day working here would review and put away the truck. I prepped food for the day. I waited on the customers and cleaned the lobby. My kids loved to visit my work when I wasn't working. Food is great which was a plus.
good,"I always enjoyed my co-workers and management team at Panera Bread. As the Catering Coordinator, I had a mostly set schedule and received tips and was paid for mileage. My mornings started pretty early and the day ended in the early afternoon, leaving me the rest of the day to myself. It was a pretty harmonious place to work, everyone got along and were very helpful and cooperative when a challenge arose."
good,A very good environment and good work place the management team was good they was all understanding and will help u out anyway they could when we worked everybody knew what to do and everyone always help out if you fell behind.
good,I enjoy working here. It can be slow or fast depending on the night as each night you have a different amount to bake. All of my co-workers are lovely ans my manager was willing to work around my hectic school schedule
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to start off your career, whether it be in the food industry or not. The environment alone teaches you patience, and a lot about customer service. There are always opportunities to grow working here. The management team alone at Panera is amazing, there  are flexible work hours, and if you need to take a day off, you don't have to go through much. Great work environment, friendly and most of the time enjoyable!"
good,"I absolutely loved my coworkers, everyday was a blast with them. I would consider them to be lifelong friends. The discount is great along with great food. I enjoyed seeings my friends move up in positions. With that being said, our management was absolutely horrific. They did not solve any problems that were brought up, and if they did it took 500 years. Delivery drivers actually deliver 20% of the time and the other 80% is spent working in the cafe on a typical day.  We are the lowest paid due to getting tips and mileage but that didn't compensate. I've gotten into a couple accidents while on deliveries so don't expect the company to care if that happens to you. They worked well with my school schedule as I am only a seasonal employee. Overall this job is actually hard work, my body would be aching by the time I left. It's fun at times, but be prepared to work."
good,Fast paced. Not many make it on the line making food. Food orders must be made in under 3 minutes. Received a raise for becoming a trainer but then minimum wage got raised and I was making the same amount as new people.
good,Great place to work and interact with new faces everyday. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the satisfaction on customers faces. I've learned all it takes is a smile to brighten up someone's day.
good,"Associate are paid well for the work that is done. Great company overall, never had any major issues with management or higher ups. There are many different varieties of food and a healthier choice."
good,The people were great. Everything we well organized and ran very smoothly. I wouldn't change anything about this place. I loved it so much! I was pregnant at the time working here. They were very patient with me.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Have fun some of the time, mostly just get my work done for priorities, The hardest part about the job us when the rush hit have to try and get the food t customers by 5:00 mins."
good,"Working at Panera Bread help me to be more social and more outgoing. Its a very outgoing place for either a single, or family home. Management was also very respectful and patient when it came to helping and training others."
good,"As an associate cashier, my job was to greet customers and take their orders. Sometimes, I'd package pastries, slice and toast bagels, slice and bag a loaf of bread, and clean the dining area. Every day was different, with various customers complaining, or other customers being so very nice, but I was able to help and fix those complaints, or turn that nice lady into a regular customer. You get out only as much as you put in, and if you put in a happy attitude, you're going to feel rewarded at the end of the shift."
good,A typical work day is fast paced. Team work and communication is essential. The best part of the job is that you are feeding people amazing food that is good quality. The hardest part would be the high demand from customers.
good,"as a cashier you are required to be fast on your feet, always put the customers needs first, positive attitude and be punctual. the management was great and majority of the coworkers, supervisors, and staff were wonderful to work with."
good,"If you're looking to work in the food industry, Panera is the best place to do it. Front or back of house, it's usually really chill, only problem can be lunch rushes."
good,"A typical day at work was fun. A lot of employees were between the ages of 16 and 30 so mostly everyone got along. Management was always open to working with your schedule if something needed to be changed. The hardest part of the job was when closing with a new person because they weren't quite sure what to do, but as an associate trainer, it was my job to show them instead of getting frustrated. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people that I probably would not have gotten close with if it weren't for Panera."
good,"Love working at Panera, feel good serving their food to people, donating at the end of the night definitely feels good... plus having discount for the meals is a plus"
good,This was my first job and I really enjoyed it. All the employees really were comfortable to be around and made you feel like family. I would definitely take this job back if they ever really NEEDED the help.
good,"A typical day at work is breathtaking but in a good way, you meet so many different people a day and when you have regulars you begin to build a bond. With any job your always going to have a few challenges but its better to get threw them with a team behind you."
good,Overall good place to work for. Plenty of room for advancement. Rapid paced setting with more decent customers than you would normally see in foodservice.
good,i loved working here and i loved everyone i worked with i wouldn't mind working here again if i could find another one hiring. my time working here was short because i was pregnant with my third child
good,Good job good food and good atmospher. The only problem I ever had with the job was one or two managers and the fact that the people who dined there thought it was fine dining and would treat you like a waiter even tho all you would do was take the food out to them after it was prepared
good,"Very fun yet very busy everyday, positive work place with very friendly coworkers. Being able to work positively with everyone around you is an amazing thing, helped me learn that it is possible to make real friends in your work place. Management was very respectful, nice, considerate, and mainly didn't think of themselves as the boss but just another coworker. Hardest part was trying to keep up during a rush because Panera Bread is a sort of mix of fast food and a restaurant so everything is made as ordered but some things take longer to make then others. Most enjoyable part of the job was when it wouldn't be busy and everyone is stocking or prepping after a rush but everyone is still positive, there aren't bad vibes even if people were rude."
good,"I really enjoy working at Panera Bread.  I like my co-workers and really like the work atmosphere.  I also like the flexibility of my schedule, and they are very accommodating.  The meal discount is also a plus."
good,Good starting job. Nothing really amazing about this job. Very low hours and pay but the employees are close. Management are good. Wish pay was better
good,"it was a cool job very family oriented, the pay was starting at 8.25 it was ok you do get a raise after 6 months , it fast pace environment."
good,early in morning clean and prepare food for customers serve them and assist with orders sometimes work night hours to stock products and had fun with my co-workers and learn a lot with customers and co-workers good experience.Panera bread  is a good place to learn about quality food and customers expectations.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It's a good company to work for even if some of the stores aren't up to par but if you can find the right management team you have a great and wonderful time there.
good,"I love our customers! Our management is great. They work with us over every issue. In my first year of marriage we had eight deaths of loved ones. The managers did everything possible to allow me to go to the funerals.  My only complaint is that there are just enough employies on staff who are lazy and childish.  I have been at Panera for almost four years, that is longer than all but a small handful of people.  I have been a trainer for three of my years.  I only get respect from management, and the few on staff that have been here longer than I or that I have trained."
good,Had to work very hard to accomplish everything in one shift. I learned a lot and the job helped me grow in the workplace. Hardest part of the job was working third shift but overtime you get used to it.
good,"I have honed skills such as multi-taskng, scheduling, inventory management and training.Panera is a changing environment everyday with new menu items, changes in business focus and new updated procedures and reports regularly."
good,You just have to focus and everything falls into place. It's stressful and normally busy but the employees know how to work together to make sure every customer is happy and served promptly.
good,"At my work, or wherever I am, I typically like to look for what needs to be done and do it. If I see the garbage needs changing or the floors need sweeping, I would rather do it without being asked, rather than to have to wait for someone to tell me what to do. I am very patient to learn a job correctly. At Panera there were a few jobs which were tricky, but most were quite simple. In everything, though, my moto is to do my job above and beyond what is required and do it well."
good,"I worked 3rd shift as a baker. This was a great job, but I didn't stay long as I was in school and going from working 10-am and having to be at school at 7:30 was taking a toll on me so I had to leave. If I had a chance to go back here, I would. I really enjoyed this job."
good,"I have been working with Panera since 2014. Unfortunately I was in a car accident in 2012 and as a result suffered head and back trauma. The managers at Panera have been so incredibly compassionate and understanding of my health limitations, and appreciate my work ethic, so it has made my work experience much more enjoyable. A typical day at work consists of high stress, multi-tasking, and is very fast paced. It has taught me great patience, and a heightened sense of management skills."
good,"Panera Bread was my first job and I was hired in as a dishwasher, they respected me and they treated me no different  (I'm disabled and I was the only black male working there) and I had a fun time, I loved the management and the rest of the crew, the atmosphere, and the music. I also liked how I would get paid in a form of a check!. The only bad thing I can say about this job is that I wish I was given more hours because I only worked 3 days a week, 4 hour shifts"
good,"The work day at Panera Bread started at 4:00 am with heating up the soups, proofing and baking the bread, slicing and weighing meat and trimming the fruit for salads. I learned a lot about a standardized company and following procedures. During the time I worked at Panera Bread I had one notable manager. Co-workers moved in and out but there were a few good long-term co-workers. The hardest part about working at Panera Bread would be waking up at 2:00 am to start work at 4:00 am, on the other hand the most enjoyable part would be getting off work in the early afternoon."
good,A typical day at work is making sure all employees stay on task and give the best customer service possible. I personally try to talk to every table that comes into the café. I also have to do daily paperwork and food quality checks.  I am in charge of ordering all product for the café. My other main duty is the safety for employees and guests.
good,My favorite part about working at Panera Bread is the customer connections that are made everyday. Since the first Day I started working until now i have met so many great people and learned their stories.
good,panera is a good place to work the staff is friendly and kind. evryone works hard and everyone knows what they are working for. we didnt really get paid for the amount of work done but its not the biggest issue.
good,Within my time at bread company I left with more family then I would ever imagine. The staff was very well but the management never handled conflict well.
good,"great place to work"
good,"Panera bread had a different way about pleasing their customers, I actually enjoyed everything about that whole job experience."
good,"prepare baked inventory for daily sale... "
good,Co-workers and managers were great! They always taught me something new. I enjoyed the daily costumers that remembered my name. It was a very good work experience.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Great place to work!  Remote job and I enjoyed the selling and the training.  I would recommend anyone to work in  sales here.
good,The Customer Service was a fun and exciting experience.  The work load was very dependent on the day of the week and the events of the city.  There was always something to do and it was wonderful working with my co-workers.  I learned a lot from the Management Team and the advancement opportunities were available upon our capabilities.
good,Good place to start and develop. Enjoyed establishing relationships the best at the workplace with customer. Most of my co-workers were very motivated and work hard.
good,"A typical day at work involved coming in an hour before lunch, just as the rate of incoming customers began to increase. Panera's system allows it to easily serve food to a large number of customers at the same speed of any other fast food restaurant. However, the setting and manner of service seemed to cause most customers to feel as if they were not in a fast food restaurant. They would often be surprised with how fast the food came out as they were either unaware or unconcerned with the fact that Panera Bread is indeed a fast food restaurant. One customer called beforehand to reserve a booth. The manager yelled at her, which I thought was a bad move because we lost a customer for no reason as there were a number of booths available. But, the manager insisted that the restaurant maintain the attitude of a walk-in fast food joint, which I would presume is against the company's intent. The restaurant was most certainly a fast food restaurant disguised as a fine diner. "
good,"Food Handling"
good,Enjoyed working there. Started as a Sales Associate and was promoted to Catering Coordinator.
good,I loved being a trainer because I was able to be one on one with my co-workers and teach them great customer service skills that ive learned over the years.
good,"it was a good job throughout highschool, i need a better job though that can provide a more stable income."
good," Prepared Bread, Rolls, Muffins and other Pastries in high quantities."
good,"co-workers where very friendly, management would not help there employees, if anything they would down talk the employees. where never satisfied.  hours, never a set schedule. the most enjoyable part of the job was having customer coming in just to see you"
good,Great place to work. The environment was very laid back and chill and the coworkers were amazing.
good,"A typical day I go and either work in the dining room cleaning tables, stocking and making coffee or I work on a register to take orders. All employees and  mangament are great to work for and with. They are all very kind, the hard part of the job is to carry coffee pots to dining room if I don't use the cart. The most enjoyable part is to serve customers and help them to get the products they want and love."
good,"As an associate at Panera Bread, I gained a lot of skills that will help me in the future."
good,Went in and prepared food for the customers and made sure that they had a great experience.
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera Bread, altough I didn't like the way the management team conducting themselves."
good,Over the last ten years I have opened 2 new Bakery cafes including all hiring and training.Have also worked as a training general manager for the last 7 years training over 35 new managers.I open the café daily forming a strong bond with my everyday customers.Have a great crew of associates who do what it takes to make sure our customers have a great experience.

good,"A typical day at work included, ringing up sales, helping customers with various needs, keeping the dining room clean and organized, preparing bakery orders, fielding phone calls, making specialty drinks and balancing the register."
good,"Great place to work at with knowledgeable managers and superb corporate culture.  Low pay, however."
good,"Fast paste environment, fun place to work at . people are very friendly ."
good,I am who I am because of working at Panera Bread. Panera was my first job and at the age of 18 it was my first experience in leadership. I learned a lot and working there really helped mold the backbone of who I am today.
good,"I was a cashier mostly which I could handle but I had just gotten over open heart surgey and the rest of the work was too difficult to do,"
good,"THis was a very busy constantly moving day. "
good,Learned and improved my skills everyday. Was able to interact with coworkers and become a helpful hand. Also teaches you responsibility.
good,Panerad bread was a delicious place to work. The discount was awesome. i enjoyed the youth and diversity the place employs.
good,mangers are always stressed but i keep the peace its just sandwiches
good,"I learned a lot wile working here and was constantly learning new things. Management is great, they were very helpful in working with me and trying to get me the hours that worked best for me. The overall experience is great and there is tons of room for growth weather your interested in the cafe side or the corporate side of the restaurant."
good,"On opening, we arrive at five a.m and begin set-up for the cafe. We run all reports including labor, prep charts, food cost, bakery opportunities and daily and weekly trends. We review any notes left from the night before on the bake and closing. We follow a point inspection of the cafe to make sure all duties were followed through and completed, cleanliness and proper sanitation is checked thoroughly. We post deployment charts which let our associates know what position they will be working. The safe is counted and tills put into drawers to await associates to count and assign themselves. The opening manager runs all zones until the next manager arrives. There are three zones to be lead, bakery, line and floor. When the mid-manager arrives, zone temperatures are logged and all food is checked while being prepped. Sales and labor reports are run and reported hourly and associates are cut or added to business's needs. On specific days, product ordering is assigned by the Food Quality Manager which is myself. We normally order anywhere between $9,000- $12,000 in product to be used within 3-5 days. We use forecasting notes to decide on how business will determine our ordering. Inventory is performed every Sunday also by the Food Quality Manager and all growth and loss is reported and followed up on and then a P.O.A (plan of action) is put together to figure out how to stop product loss. The closing manager counts tills and safe where growths and losses are reported, closes each zone to make sure all areas are properly cleaned and sanitized, nightly food count of meat, soups and"
good,At panera i was a food prep. i made all of the sandwiches and cleaned all work stations. it was a very fun job and an amazing work envirenment.
good,"Management has their days, most associates are kind and very friendly. Learned a lot about customer service and diversity. Most enjoyable part is the ""Bread Bash"" its a meeting held when seasons change and the company brings out new products ."
good,"Great Company, Great atmosphere, Good management. Food is awesome. Schedules are the same"
good,This is an amazing place to work. i have worked at two different locations over a span of a year and both locations were amazing places to work. All the management was amazing and understanding.
good,"This is a very laid back job until the LUNCH rush kicks in. If you are interested in working the line for Panera, just know measurements are everything,"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Would open the store by putting bagels if their bagel basket would set up the Pastry area after that would start cutting the breads we used all day for the store.
good,Although it is a busy restaurant I had a great experience overall. They worked with my school schedule as much as they could and when I did have to leave to go to college they helped me transition out smoothly.
good,Great working environment.. pleasant coworkers flexible schedule ... great food .. managers are very hardworking... employees are pushed to become their best ..
good,"Working for Panera Bread was a great experience for sure. The staff and customers were very polie, I miss this job dearly alot of fun times and picked up alot of skills working with ovens and proper food safety and kitchen work"
good,"I really learned how to multitask and keep a cool head under heated situations. Quickly adapted to the fast pace movement within the building. The company loves the employees so everyone is welcomed to work there, just as long as you are willing and able to work."
good,Never have I ever worked a job where you feel like you're part of a family. The people here genuinely care and the fast-paced environment ensures there's never a dull moment.
good,Worked during college and it was a great opportunity. Flexible hours and great management. Paid hourly with tips. Advancement is there if any open positions
good,"Good environment to work in because of the managers who are friendly and understanding. It can get quite stressful during the lunch rush, customers can get demanding especially when it comes to coffee. You must have lots of patience and exude friendliness. Great coworkers who make the work days tolerable. Downside is no benefits, no advancement opportunities, pay is subpar, no set work schedule (schedule can change weekly) and they cut hours if it's not busy."
good,Not a lot of hours given. Lots of work to be done. Great managers and co-workers where all great. Had a good time working for them. Just the pay was lower than i needed
good,Was able to meet a variety of people working with the customers was wonderful drive through a little crazy at times but overall really good experience.
good,"I actually love the people I work around/with at Panera, we all look out for each, help each other whenever there's a need or if someone is not feeling well"
good,"I would say Panera is a great place to work. Benefits, discounts , and they donate leftover bread to the needy. Customers are friendly, the uniforms are casual and breathable for moving around. Good management at the Austell location. All around I’d recommend to eat and work there"
good,It's been a great experience working at Panera Bread. They have different levels of work within management. If you are hardworking person you can be promoted to area manager and or above positions
good,"Panera Bread has lunch rushes much like any other fast-food restaurant. During these rushes it can be very stressful if you aren't trained properly. These rushes happen about 3 times a day. Always be sure to be focused and prepared everyday at work :).  While dealing with angry customers you must remember to always remain positive. The staff at Panera is always very friendly, understanding, and helpful. Panera's Staff has  been like a second family to me since working there. <3. Being an associate trainer I was taught the duties of Cashier, Barista, Expo, and Dining. When new hires were brought to the store I was given the task to train them properly ."
good,Panera Bread is a very high intense working environment but it is not bad once you get the hang of it. The most enjoyable thing about the job was my coworkers.
good,"A typical day at Panera Bread was fast paced; multiple audits to be reviewed and ensured was completed successfully; client satisfaction and quality was/is their main priority. However, through any day, no matter the workload or traffic flow, the workplace culture always found a way to seep enjoyment and laughter. I believe that was one of the main memories I took out of my Panera Bread chapter."
good,"Honestly a great place to work! There is opportunity for advancement and it is structured very well. If you are good at your job, however, you will be there a lot. Not always the best work/life balance."
good,"panera bread is a fast food but healtly at the same time. i worked as a cashier, making sandwish,dinning room cleaning the tables, peeple are very friendly and respectful"
good,"Panera is a fast paced work place, lots of menu changes every quarter, always bringing in new fresh items, great place to work. Panera have great values and lives by fresh daily always! They never buy from outside the Panera family... very consistent with their products they make."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera is like any food service. It has its moments where we are super busy and super slow. there is always someone who needs help. The managers are amazing and are willing to work with you on a schedule if you go to school or if you have another job.
good,If you have good customer service this is the job for you. If you can handle people well i would apply for this job. It is a job that pays well and works well with your schedule.
good,The job was fun for the time it lasted a few little hiccups but nothing major.  The work load definitely wasn’t too much for the average person even on their worst day. The place where the mature high school kids work.
good,Over all Panera bread is a great company to work for. I get a great sense of passion and pride at Panera bread. The food is great and the employees are warm and welcome.
good,"Great experience working in Panera Bread."
good,Panera Bread as a company is a wonderful employment opportunity. Just be cautious of your interviewing staff. They will represent the vibe of their staff.
good,This is a great place to work. The staff works well together to provide outstanding customer service. Everyone offered idea and help in training to answer any questions that may service at any moment.
good,"I was overall content with my position. My coworkers were very helpful and polite. The manager was understanding, easy going, and goal oriented. I would recommend this job for someone who is up to growing with the company."
good,"I enjoyed the flexibility of my schedule and the people I worked with. Luch rush gets crazy at times, but I enjoy the pace of it. It also gets a little crazy during audit season, but audit is checking things you should be keeping up on daily anyways."
good,Wish hours were better only ended up affording to get back and forth the last 5 checks. I have a family i have to take care of. Also it was hard to move up in position because of being good register person.
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread but one of the managers are very rude, Disrespectful, Bias. I loved working with the people there and learning new things. I have learned so much in the year I was there."
good,i haven't been working there long at all but since i started there everyone was helping me out and making me feel welcome into the Panera bread culture
good,"Panera has a vast network of cafes in which to choose from, which allows the opportunity for the right person to transfer in order to promote when they developed and ready to do so. This prevents someone from being stuck waiting for the next person above to quit/retire/terminate in the same cafe."
good,working at Panera taught me how to handle money and work with costumers. The work environment is very good and the management and staff is very friendly. the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the costumers.
good,"It was a great experience And I liked it a lot, I was a cashier, stocker, prepared food, served food, and cleaned dishes and bathrooms and all around the store as well."
good,"if you like to be social this is a job for you, Panara bread is a fun place to work and there can be possible some job advancement while working there."
good,If your good with people you will love the job can be fast pace once you have the hang of everything you be a great employe it look more hard than it really is so don’t overwhelm your self but it is family organizations
good,The managers are great to work for. The worst part of the job is you may not make as much driving as you think you will. It’s okay for a summer job or if you just want some extra cash on the side.
good,I loved working for Panera . I walked 30 minutes to work everyday at 4:30 am . Unfortunately one of the managers took a personal problem out on me for being 10 minutes late . I moved on from Panera because I'd watch other employees who were White be able to be late or do no call no shows and not get in trouble . I loved the conpany but some staff were prejudice which happens alot in Williamsport.  Would love to work for a different location
good,Everyone is upbeat and fun. I never had a dull day at work. I miss it every day. The mangers are amazing and keep everything confidential. You never have to worry about anything other than your job at work.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera is a great place to work at. The atmosphere is delightful, laidback, but efficient nonetheless. I truly appreciated the time I spent as a Panera Bread employee."
good,"A typical day was anywhere from seven to eight hours depending on my schedule.  Spent most of my days helping customers.  I learned a lot about the food business and how to work with other people at work as a team.  Panera is a great company and I had fun at Panera.  The managers were very nice and helpful and made sure we stayed on top of our work.  The work place culture is nice it can be very busy or pretty relaxed but nothing that couldn't be handled.  The hardest part was dealing with the customers sometimes and learning all the menu items, but besides that it was a good place to work.  The most enjoyable part was getting a paycheck and the people that I worked with."
good,"it was a good job for my first real job , made me feel like i was one step forward, i liked working, it was a good working environment, the customers were satisfied with me"
good,"I started Senior year of high school, and stopped due to moving away. I  loved the environment and my coworkers. The training was super straightforward."
good,"I loved it here it was one of my first and favorite jobs as I was becoming more comfortable with the food industry, and they offered health insurance."
good,"Good first job and/or part-time income, although quite a few people stay with the company their entire work life!"
good,"Everyone was nice there. You get breaks if you work more than 6 hours. They give discounts. It does get hectic during breakfast, lunch rush and early dinner rush. Customers are for the most part decent but some of them dont respect the rules. They offer healthcare even if you work part time."
good,"I worked at Panera in my hometown for almost two years. Not only were the employees wonderful, but the customer base was as well. Very easy to learn and train. Managers were managers, but they were also good at building relationships with employees. Hardest part was that my store was a training cafe, and so we had some managers that would be temporary alongside our permanent managers. Most were great, but you get a lot of people that make you question why they are trying to get involved in a business that revolves around warmth. Also warmth! Definitely a workplace for people that like people, a lot of the atmosphere revolves around that homey feeling, and getting to know your customers."
good,Great benefits. Hard to balance work/life. Great group of long term employees. Love the culture of the company. Always working towards the next promotion. Easy to love up with the company
good,"Coworkers and managers are friendly, we work together, always help each other, its a pretty clean environment, everything is pretty fast and easy to learn."
good,"I worked at Panera Bread for a few months. Overall, I disliked my position at Panera, but there were many things I liked while I worked there. The management was great, they were all very nice people who truly cared about the people working there. The staff was great, everyone was close with one another. My only gripe with my specific position as a line worker was that I absolutely hated the exteme workload I had. Often, I would spend an entire shift, 4:30pm-10:00pm standing with no breaks. It was not to say that I couldn’t take a break, it was just that there was so much going on at all times, and many orders to make, creating a situation that was very unpleasant in my opinion. As I stated before, the management and staff was great, the job just wasn’t for me."
good,Panera Bread upper management was well managed. They worked to create formal open procedures. They where always working improve methods to complete a tasks.
good,With most places you work the people you work with have a major effect on your experience working at a place. All the people I worked with at my Panera were awesome to be around. It might not be the same for everyone but the work is fun and you don't work with greesy food like other fast food places.
good,Constantly busy so no time for down time and there managers work. like actually get into a position and work like everyone else does. never had a issue with any managers or employees.
good,"Good place to work part time. Good management, great food. Discounts to employees. Good atmosphere. Easy access to community and businesses. Best suited for students or part time help."
good,"I liked the company and would definitely work for them again. My managers were super nice, they are very flexible with schedules especially if you're in highschool or are a college student."
good,"As a baker there were long hours overnight. But if willing to keep up a fast pace over a long shift employees are treated well and fairly compensated. Money was good, managers were accommodating, and workplace culture was accepting."
good,You meet some of the nices people. You can advance fast as long as you do your job. At night baking you can just turn you music on and work. When things are needed you just ask and the managers get it as fast as they can.
good,"The particular Panera Bread at which I worked was located in a strip mall. Some Paneras expect customers to clear tables themselves, but with the constant influx of mallgoers, we needed to take their places for them to speed the process. The associates were a pleasure to know and work with. Despite the hectic environment, we maintain a good attitude."
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread! It was probably one of the best jobs I've ever had. The managers were great, the people were great, and I developed relationships with a lot of customers on a friendly, professional level."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Super fun place to work if youre able to quickly make food and stay on top of orders. If you crack under pressure this is not the job for you. Very fast paced at times.
good,"loved working there great place, i wasnt able to acclimate to working over night hours some times it was easy others it was difficult esp being on ones own for so long."
good,"Greta job even, but it went out of business. I enjoyed working with all the employees i encountered. The Managers was even great and very diverse work place."
good,"Working ressful in order to meet our marks, but the people at Panera the coworkers and customers make it worth it. I learned to multitask a lot with Panera and think on my feet quicker. The hardest part of the job is handling massive hordes of people ordering food at the same time and keeping serving times down. The most enjoyable part is seeing everyone smile even after all the hard work we put in"
good,"great bosses and employees, clean and healthy food, hardest part of job would have been how fast paced everything was, but once you got the hang of it, it wasn't too hard at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably challenging myself and succeeding."
good,Being an associate trainer at Panera taught me how to take charge in a leadership position while allowing to to be proud of my excellence within the company. While it was very fast paced it was truly an enjoyable place to work. The management was kind and supportive and there was lots of room for growth.
good,Panera Bread is a good job if you are a student. Lots of advancement opportunities but little pay if you are not promoted. Lots of physical labor but not a stressful job.
good,Productive and fun workplace I definitely would work good man panera bread as a job. It is cool calm and collective everyone should work at panera bread I love it
good,If you are looking to be a manger and want a different life style than what most restaurant mangers and experiencing Panera id the place for you. The hours are not as crazy as most food service opportunities. But it is a great place to work.
good,"You get disocunts on food, and it is a very fun job. You have to have a food handlers but you can get it online for like 20$. you make tips, and the hours are petty flexible"
good,"Great place to work, very fast paced. Really kept you on your toes at all times, best place i’ve worked for so far! Managers were great & so was the team."
good,My co-workers and customers were great people to be around.  It was a nice environment to work in. The food there is really good and healthy.  People there care about each other.
good,Day to day included ringing up customers orders and cleaning and brewing coffee and closing the store. Closing the store consisted of a lot of cleaning.
good,"I enjoy the people that I  work with.  As long as you are there to work you will enjoy your time there."
good,"In the almost two years that I've worked at Panera, a few things have been made clear to me. First, don't say ""slow"", ever, unless you want to want to have a line out the door. I swear this is not a myth, it has happened to me several times. Second, if even one person is slacking in their job, nothing gets done. We all need to do our part or we will all be playing catch up for hours. Finally, Panera IS a family. We rely on and help each other throughout our shift just like any family would."
good,Buenos trabajos . Todo lleve en orden en baker y en cleaner . Solo que el sueldo no me conviene
good,"I work for Panera part time during lunch, and I absolutely love it. It is fast paced which makes the time go by quickly. There are always new challenges, and every day something new happens."
good,"I'm 17 years old and Panera is my first real job, and I really do love it. The benefits are nice and the pay is just right for me. The people I work with are very kind and understanding. I also really enjoy the fast-paced work. you really have to be on your feet, especially during rush. Time really does fly."
good,"The environment can be stressful, but employees work together to get required tasks done in an efficient manner and to deliver excellent customer service."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Not a lot of people worked, many were quiet and kept to themselves. Not many customers throughout the day. It was a vey temporary job, not really anything special."
good,"This job is by far the best job ive ever had, management was great the best people you will ever meet. Aslo all the other workers will help you out and are very caring."
good,Working at Panera is really fun I love my managers and co-workers. Not to be cheesy but Panera is like a family to me. I would recommend this job to my friends
good,"The work was engaging. There were many different opportunities and there was always something to do. It was fun, while also most of the time being fast-paced."
good,Did not receive full benefits because I worked as a temp for a short time. It was a good place with a good work environment.  Would work there again if the opportunity came again.
good,Strong core focus within the market. Excellent training program with Baguette university. I only worked for a franchise so I cannot comment on difference between company and franchise stores.
good,"Panera Bread is a good company to work for, they strive to grow and satisfy customers. I learned so much about customer service, food cost, and many different things which help improve the company."
good,"good place to be when your studying or working online , and they also have free wifi ! although, the scenery is awesome when you sit by the window with a great salad."
good,I loved working here and I think it is such a positive culture. The managers were always easy to talk to and easy going. I would love to work here again; I’m hoping that I am given the opportunity again.
good,For all that Panera was worth it was what I needed at the time. The fast paced environment and flexible work schedule let me find the balance I needed in life and helped me move forward with what I wanted to do.
good,A typical day for a cashier usually consists of taking the customers orders and keeping your area clean. For night shifts you have to hurry up and clean your station before 10
good,Panera was a wonderful place to work everyone was normally nice the pay was little and benefits were little but everything else was great about this place.
good,Coworker and managers were all nice and became a fun but very stressful place to work as I worked there my senior year. They have made many changes since I’ve worked there but definitely recommend applying !
good,Having worked in every position in the store I can say it was an overall enjoyable experience. My time with the company is something I will always remember and cherish for the growth I received.
good,a typical day was pretty hectic opening and closing the store sometimes 
good,"It's hard to say because it will depend on each store, but what I can say is that the management at my store was great. The work was extremely fast paced and easy and time flew by very quickly."
good,This is a great job for anyone really trying to break into a career with huge upside potential. You can rise as high as you want as long as you're willing to put in the work.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"In all honesty working at a nice sit-down fast food restaurant was probably one of the most amazing places I have ever worked at. I would say in a personal opinion if you need a job that this would be one place I would recommend for someone looking for a job because even though some work days were rough everyone I have worked with got along with one another, it was an easy job to understand and the managers were there to help me if I did have a question. In all honesty I do not believe there was a hard part in my job requirements at all everything in the restaurant was self explanatory. I would also like to say that the most enjoyable part of my job was taking orders because I got to connect with the regular customers and I also loved to be the food runner and take the meals to our guests and connect with them in such a small manner. There was not one thing about this job that I did not like at all."
good,I truly have enjoyed my 10+ years at Panera. It is an ever changing company. They have been really great to work for and I have learned so much from my time there.
good,I believe that this workplace was the best place for me to learn how to offer professional service and a great way to learn great tactics. This job also was very consistent and reliable. One of the best jobs I had.
good,"Panera will forever be my favorite company that i worked for. I would return if i could, it was a fast paced environment, you had to be quick on your feet and know what youre doing. i only left panera because my gm had personal issues against me. would i recommend panera yes i absolutely would. the company is fantastic and promote alot theres a lot of room to grow in this company."
good,Panera is a great place to work and has great leadership!  The teams are empowered to find solutions for technology and to ensure that customer satisfaction is our first priority!
good,This was a great place for a first job.  It taught me well and how jobs work in the real world.  They make you stay organized while you are there and clean up what you do.  They hold you accountable which is a great thing.
good,Panera is a great place to work at. The management is good and nice. You make great friends and it was always a fun place. Everyone was always happy and that shows good character.
good,Fellow employees were like family; sometimes we got 10 cent raises; not much advancement after a certain point; managers were mostly understanding and nice.
good,"The hardest part of the job is not expecting a rush out of no where. If the rest of my crew isn't properly stocked up then that'll throw off the rest of the team on the speed of time. At my work, we want to be as fast as possible to get the food out towards the customers under three minutes."
good,"When I first arrive, I start with what is called the ""Red Book"", a list that has to be done daily, that consists of checking off what needs to be stocked and taking temperatures of the food stored on the line. Once that is complete, I normally find things that need cleaned, prepped or otherwise make food for customers, there is never nothing to do. I have learned how to handle situations which required me to think fast and react appropriately to the situation's and remain calm while doing so. Also, how to acknowledge that customers have concerns or complaints, and personally see to it that they are dealt with immediately. One of the hardest things about my jobs is getting new hires through the training process. Its difficult because everyone learns at their own pace, so I find ways that adheres to their style of learning. Finally the most enjoyable part of my job is the people i work with, many of the people have worked there for years and I'm happy to call them my friends."
good,"flexible hours for students, able to request days off and work around your school schedule. Nice bonus in a form of discounted healthy food. nice people to work with."
good,"A truly dynamic company to work for.  From the food to the people, you will be hard pressed to find a better place to work in the industry.  Our CEO, President, and executive board have tremendous vision, and know how to get things done."
good,"because i am in school i don't work much right now, but its a wonderful place to gain the first job experience. i would recommend it to anyone. its great."
good,"Prepare Prepare and more preparing the next day for the bread and pastries that need to be baked. I've learned oven times, temperatures, and steam times for all products and news coming ones. Proof times for all the verities of bread. Its was tough timing everything that needs to be done in a nights work."
good,"While customers are as diverse as any typical people group, a typical day as a Panera Bread employee is not too shabby. After being there 6 months, anyone is eligible to become a trainer (though, certain employees should not become trainers). Trainers can then be interviewed to become shift supervisors (or just ""shifts"") and will be trained. The store where I work is a training store for new managers. Incoming shifts and managers are typically internal hires, though we have trained a couple external highers. Shifts can move up to higher management within the store or within the franchise (I am at a franchise store, not a company store)."
good,Management and team member alike have a very easy going upbeat attitude. It feels lesa like work and more like a team project. All around good food and reasonable accomadtions are very good.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"While working here at Panera I had more than one job. I knew three different positions. I worked in the drive thru and at the front cashier desk, and I also worked on the floor meaning I cleaned up the lobby and the eating area for the customers. Most days I would do two positions in one shift so I was good at being flexible with my job. You're always on your feet when working at Panera, and I mean that literally. Everyone there is nice and welcoming and help make the workplace experience amazing."
good,"-Very hard to learn in the company but if you are willing to put in your part you "
good,"Half teenage staff. Very friendly, always busy, terrible GM, but great assistant management. Low pay rate for employees, a ton of hours to go around, and a clean work space"
good,Working at Panera Bread has been my favorite because of the amazing staff and management. Everyone is friendly and make you feel at home. Like most families there is drama however the work environment is professional. Management is great and considerate of your own personal schedule.
good,A typical day at Panera Bread always wet by fast. Customers always came in to grab food or to lounge around in the cafe. It was always a good environment interacting with customer all day helping them in any way I could. Work was always calm and relaxing until lunch rush that when things became hectic. Panera Bread taught me better communication skills. Having the opportunity to work there taught me patience.
good,"When I worked at Panera Bread Bread it was a good job, I never tried any of the benefits such as health insurance or anything like that so I can't say much about that but I did have a friends/family discount I was able to give out. One manager was unprofessional but that's not really Panera Bread's fault, especially since the others I have absolutely no complaints about. It's a great place and I enjoyed my time there."
good,"A typical day for me at Panera included taking orders, making drinks, and retrieving bakery items for guest. As my first food industry job, I learned how to handle this form of customer service and how to be the best I can be in assisting with orders in a timely manner."
good,"Nice management, felt that they genuinely cared about employees. great atmosphere of people who were ready to work. The hardest part was learning the flow of a new restaurant"
good,I enjoyed working at Panera and my co-workers were awesome!! It was a good company to work for and I liked waiting on the customers.
good,"This job was extremely enjoyable. I never had any problems here. From the time I went in to work to the time I left, work was enjoyable. Everyone was always so nice and encouraging. Corrective criticism was used in the correct manor and at the correct time."
good,Best job I've ever had! The managers are awesome. The co-workers work as one and the environment is relaxing and very kid-friendly. From Panera Bread I learned how to work at a spiffy speed and efficiently! It's definitely a job for growth!
good,"I would usually stay behind the register, but there were days when i have to leave the register to clean the dine in area. During lunch hours it would get packed. I learned how to work really well with others and how to handle upset costumers. I think management did the best they could do. The co-workers were excellent and always played as a team. The hardest part was trying to keep a certain flow of costumers order while not upsetting anyone at the same time. I enjoyed the team work and the satisfactory of costumer service."
good,"A typical day of work looked like this; "
good,The food is great and the attention to detail in how the company goes about preparing there associates for the job is impeccable. The customer is always treated with the utmost respect and that is one reason why people keep coming back.
good,"I go in an 5am Monday through Friday and set up the front of the store (all the pastries and bread) on the wall. I interact with customers everyday and know how to hold conversations with them, and make them feel special."
good,"Someday's are usually busy and other are sow and boring, but you managed to meet new people and enjoy what your doing. Sometimes the job can be hard based on how busy it is and trying to manage getting everyone there food while it still hot, but other then that its a fun place to work at"
good,"My very first job. Everyone was welcoming, nice and helpful. My only regret is leaving the job. Fantastic workplace even when its busy. Best managers on earth."
good,"Panera is a great company to work, really helps college students. Panera has great work ethics, they are flexible and thrives on customer service. Great company!"
good,"- Increased public speaking"
good,I make sure all money is accounted for. I make sure everyone is working as they should. I am very good at making sure things are in line. I take care of customer complaints. I have learned how to operate a business. The hardest part of the job is keeping everything together when it gets crazy. I enjoy being able to make the day go as smoothly as possible.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The food industry isn't your typical day. You get involved and figure out your actually great at new stations. My co-workers helped me tremendously I was new and they welcomed me with open arms. For that I will always be thankful.
good,"Everyone at the job is very friendly, smiles everywhere you look and the team work is great. Everyone helps each other out"
good,"When i would come into work, i would be greeted by my general manager and a few of my other coworkers. It was always great to be recognized as part of the team and that's what made work easy and enjoyable. My coworkers knew how to do there work and have fun while doing it which helped with slow days. Everything about Panera Bread was exceptionally perfect and it made me want to come in often to do what i needed to do. I think the hardest days would have to be when dangerous blizzards would hit the entire city of Colorado Springs, we would have to come in and we would have barely any customers. The blizzard days were the worst... That is all i didn't like about that job at Panera Bread but other than that it was a great job over all."
good,I loved Panera bread it was a great experience with great benefits  if you in school and looking for a job with benefits and can actually enjoy going to work than Panera is a place for you
good,Panera is very fun and organized. I don't like how things constantly change but it's a good job to have. Very easy to move up.
good,"I greet the customers, take their order then fill it.  I ensure that the food is not expired.  Time management is important.  A lot of my co workers are young, so they tend to bring drama or talk about things that aren't appropriate for work."
good,"Really enjoy working for this company. Plenty of room for advancement and very family oriented. Fast paced environment, but a fun place to be."
good,I loved working for Panera but at the time the upper management could not see that the immediate managers and there were a few were not good for the payroll dept.
good,"Panera's is a great place to work, the managers are amazing and so are the co workers. I love seeing happy customers and stopping to talk to them when I can, find out what I can do better for them, and what they love about what I'm already doing."
good,"Very fast, much multi tasking, loved the customers, and the people I worked with. I needed a fresh start and they offered it with openness and ability."
good,"It would be busy but since there was a team of people things would get done."
good,"Kept to their word when offering progress and advancement opportunities for those who were willing to show initiative and strong work ethic. With management being open, friendly, and organized, most, if not all days, were always smooth and easy to complete. The environment was always open to teamwork and help was always provided to whoever needed it at any moment. After work culture was very friendly. Overall, a great work experience and opportunity."
good,Management was great I loved working there. I was a trainer at this job for 3 years. I trained new employees on all areas in the cafe. I quit this job to go to college for a career.
good,The work day can be long and boring and the managers can be pretty mean but the pay is great. It's also can be a safe working environment.
good,working with panera it is fun at the same time it challenging. really i am enjoy in it .They  have a great tools for learning.
good,"While the bureaucratic side of working at Panera was lackluster, the sense of community with my coworkers and managers made working more enjoyable than expected.  While the demand for detail, speed and an impeccable ability to interact with angry customers could be exhausting, the fact that we aren't alone in our struggle to give people the best dining experience was an integral part of my development as an employee.  I learned that as long as you have coworkers you can depend on and a managerial staff that is willing to give proper guidance, you can accomplish much more than you ever could on your own."
good,Great place to work while in college. Co-workers are great and good management. I learned a lot of patients while working here.
good,fun and busy work environment and i got to meet new people everyday. Learned a lot about food handling there.Great sandwiches too.
good,"Very Organized and efficient. Managment on point and trained sufficiently, communication is key and is utilized correctly."
good,"making food, handling money, helping customers out, fixing problems, scheduling, training, planning meetings, making relationships with customer"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"At this job I greeted customers and took their food orders, made drinks at the barista, and helped with to-go orders while maintaining a stress free environment and clean organized work area to fulfill the satisfaction of the customers."
good,Typical days at Panera would the dinner rush which i enjoyed because it got my adrenaline rushing i like to make sure the customer is happy and by them receiving there order fast made them smile . I learned that the customers can be friendly if you interact with them ask them how their day has been and always give them a smile . This job was one of many jobs i enjoyed to work in co workers gave a hand when needed they were friendly and not judgmental . Managers were welcoming and helpful and very understanding . The meal discounts were very good too !
good,greeting customers. preparing meals in a timely manor. learned every position in the company. was shift supervisor for 2+ years. co-workers and management were friendly. it gets crowded and confusing for some during rush. food was delicious
good,Very demanding work environment. Not much help with catering orders or deliveries. Not great tip compensation. Not enough help with orders.
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera Bread. Management was very helpful with all baker needs. A typical day at work, I go in, turn on the ovens and begin prepping all pastries and breads ready to bake. The hardest part of the job was the amount of tasks that needed to be completed before your shift was over. Took awhile to get into the hang of things. The most enjoyable part was we got to listen to any music we wanted, we could break whenever we wanted as long as things were running smoothly."
good,Enjoyed my time there.  Andrew Ibarra and his team of assistant managers do care for their people; work hard to train them and set a positive example.  Hectic pace as you'd expect for breakfast and especially lunch.  Tipping not stressed but I managed to get $5-$15 per 5 hour shift when staffing the dining room..  Really enjoyed the team and customer interaction.
good,"A work day was either face or slow paced depended on the weather. I learned how to make drinks, such as, coffee, espresso, cappuccino, etc. Co-workers were much older than me so I learned a lot from them. Hardest part would be the rushes, such as busy times during the day. But I got through them and used to them as I worked there. I enjoyed my co-workers and managers overall the job. I liked working there."
good,"been there for three year , because they are lenient with scheduling ."
good,"A typical day a Panera Bread would start with putting on ones hat and apron and clocking in. Then one would count his or her draw to make sure that it is at the correct amount to start. Then one would sign into a register and begin to ring if there is a line or look around to see what needs to be cleaned up in the store. I improved my people skills as to how to talk to costumers and make connections with them. I also learned better time management skills and how to multi-task. The management is very easy to get along with and fun to work with. They respect there employees, but if you do something against policy or not up to the standards of Panera bread they will talk to you about it and find a solution to the problem. The co-workers are fun to work with everyone gets along and its kind of like having a family when ones not at home. The hardest part of the job is closing the store while trying to balance still ringing people in. The most enjoyable part of the job is forming friendships with your co-workers as well as the customers who are regulars to the store. The regulars will come in and ask you about your day and how you've been, the connections you have with them are something to look forward to when going to work."
good,"As my first job, I learned how to adjust to the schedule to a bakery. I was on a strict schedule to finish preparing the bakery items and sandwiches for opening. While being the team leader and top trainer, I learned how to teach per each individuals learning while getting the job done as fast as possible. We worked together as a team and accomplished much more."
good,good job just looking for something different and or mostly better. the employer is very nice and workload for most part is simple and easy the only truly bad aspect is the hours in which you must work.
good,"I loved working for Panera! I was only part time, but you get 60% off food the days you worked and 50% off on days off. Fast paced environment made it exciting, and the slow times gave you time to clean up and get ready for another rush. Great for a first job, if you like interacting with people, or just love panera!"
good,"I loved coming to work everyday to see all of my customers and co-workers. Management is great. Always helpful. I get to train new people and meet lovely new people everyday. There isn't really anything to hard to do at Panera Bread. The most enjoyable part to me was getting to see bright new faces all the time. I love people and at Panera, that is one quality you really need."
good,"I have worked for this company for 3 years now and all of my complaints are minimal. It is a great company that cares about its employees and is dedicated to giving back to the community."
good,"to help serve customers  to fulfill their needs. bake baked goods, run cash register, wash dishes, and keep dining room clean."
good,"Panera Bread is a great company to work for."
good,"It was fun, the workers were nice and friendly. The customers were difficult because they were the higher class people who wanted things their way or else you were a waste of time for them to talk to."

good,Panera Bread was all about working as a team to achieve customer satisfaction. I learned how to work better as a team. The management was inspiring. The worked side by side the staff when needed. The hardest part of the job was being a very fast paced work environment. I enjoyed the end of the night when we gathered all the left over food and donated it to the food bank.

good,good place to work and great pay. Do one thing wrong and your fired .
good,Quick paced and interesting customers. The food was great.
good,lots of autonomy in my position; no micro managing. wonderful place to place to work.
good,I loved working at pannera because of the manager. It was a cleaner much more likable fast food/restaurant to work at.
good,"I learned a lot there. They taught me how to bake a whole bake in one night. We had to bake by ourselves, most of the time. It was very scheduled."

good,Great place to build people skills because of everyday interaction with customers
good,"typical day very fast working"
good,Panera will not advance no matter the circumstance. RiverBend is an awesome job.
good,I enjoy working for Panera as it is giving me the opportunity I need to fulfill my passion
good,Come in starte my work day at 9pm. Everything is a timmed section. My main concern is baking everything ontime. The hardest part is trying to get things done on time. I master it everytime
good,Morning meeting and then start on email and working on emails and tickets.
good,It is a great workplace with fun co-workers and the customers are amazing. We work as a group and we get things done. Also getting things done individually is not a problem at all.
good,"I loved working for this company. The managers were amazing with employees, customers, and business. There was no tolerance for people not getting along, so those that didn't kept it to themselves. We were all close because of the bread bashes and we just had fun and a smile every time we worked. I learned a lot and grew in my job while I was there as well."

good,"Everyone there was always friendly and helpful, the store was always kept immaculate. The managers were nice, funny and vibrant people to work with"
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time working at Panera Bread. People I worked with were enjoyable to be around and easy to connect with. Helping customers and working with coworkers almost felt like it wasn't work for me. Only left cause I moved and there just happened to not be a Panera Bread near where I moved to.
good,My experience has been very good here.  I haven't had any issues with management and the staff has been great and many times the team steps up to help an associate to complete a task.  Great food discount keeps you eating good.  The best part of my employment here is Management really tries to abide by my schedule while coordinating with the staffing needs.  This is a job about team work and initiating individual task.
good,"Some managers are awesome, some are awful."
good,Working at Panera bread is a good experience and you’ll always be working at a fast pace. Their discount while you work there is always amazing. 50%!!

good,I like working here. Management cared about the employees and were nice. My coworkers were nice and the job was not hard. Good overall work environment.
good,"The Panera Bread that I worked at was basically on a college campus, so the environment was always lively at various times in the day. I felt that the simplistic nature of the job lent its self to each individual; I was rarely ever stressed out and I had a fun time while being as productive as I could. I was promoted twice in a two year span and I felt that I was able to learn a lot from my time there. I've recently moved away from my position, but I did enjoy my time there, and I do miss the manager meal I would get on my shift. ;-)"
good,Its good i just dont get enogh hours and im thats the only real bad thing about its ig because i like the co-workers and the locations cool  like stop though for real im reLly just trynna fill out suome apps god
good,The managers can come off a bit rude but once you get to know them they are great. Only negative thing i could say is they play a lot of favoritism there.
good,I really love working here it’s a great place to meet people and it is a great environment to grow.it is a great first job to be able to learn and there is great training.
good,"Cleanning my station organised my station cleanning the dishes. Clean de soupe machine, clean the washing machine."
good,Only one manager that was horrible everyone else there was amazing. Never been in a great work place like this before and not again sadly. Everyone was nice trainers and management team were amazing. Customers were bad but with a great team its no problem.
good,"Panera is a great place to work at, I just want to do something different. Working there the past couple years has helped me talk more to customers and my team."
good,"lots of culture, management always worked around my schedule. the people there were great. hard part of the job was the constant change in the menu."
good,I enjoyed my time there I worked almost 3 years. I loved talking to the customers and making them happy. I had some employees who were mean but over all I loved it there.
good,"This will probably be the best company you'll ever work for. Management listens to what you want and makes it happen, training is very extensive, and the place does feel like a family. Would recommend to literally everyone."
good,"A typical day starts with stand up to discuss ongoing projects and assign new tasks. After that, expect 1 or 2 meetings related to said projects and the occasional new assignment that another team may need finished."
good,"Fast paced work culture. .Good benefits.Well paid for the area. New challenges daily Good, training program for associates with plenty of growth and advancements."
good,"Very nice, fast paced, great customers and flexible schedule.  The GM is great.  The hardest part of the job is employees standing around and goofing off so to speak, and disappearing to play on their phones.  I have an excellent work ethic and only moved from the corporate world to retail/grocery because of family reasons.  All is good now and would like to move back into the corporate world."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,This isn’t my first food service job and I’ve only been here for 6 months but a lot of changes took place with management. When you first start obviously they want to make a good first impression but as time goes on true colors do come out. And I am aware that no one has to be nice to you but I believe it’s all about respect. My coworkers are great and I love the job but a couple of the managers do take advantage of their power and do use it against their employees. If anyone calls off the two managers name who it was and start rumors and say very disrespectful things about them to other employees. If you have availability set up they’ll schedule you anyways on days when you’re not able to without speaking to you first. They don’t take the time to listen and understand people’s different situations that may impact their work times. This is specifically about my location and those two managers. I hope no one has to come in contact with these two. Ever.
good,This is a company that truly feels like a family. Everyone is driven toward making the customer experience the best it can be. Management is extremely supportive and often promotes from within.
good,"I have worked here for 3 years now, and I have grown to love all of my co workers. we are like a small family. I will hate when I have to leave, but i would recommend this job for anyone as a first timer."
good,"A good place to work, good for anyone in high school looking for a job to make some extra money, it’s easy, everyone’s treated equally, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent paying part-time job:"
good,You learn more when u want.. People are willing to help and push you to do better.. You work hard in being successful in your job task..The environment is welcoming..
good,Great Concept offering awesome choices for our guests.  I enjoyed the drive to fix and clean up cafes in order to move them into a profitable margin.  Associates were awesome to train and develop.  Fun Food Cost system to work with.
good,"the staff is really fun to work with; it is a family at Panera. The managers always accept your time off and change in your availability. Your hours are based off calling out, uniform and ability to do your job. The management makes your priorities theirs and it makes a huge difference in work ethic."
good,"Organizing and prepping for the day, staying relaxed during rushes, completing customers orders to their satisfaction, and keeping a clean and safe work place"
good,Panera has a warm environment and a clean workplace. The management is good and has nice people in charge. The culture is very diverse and positive. The best part of the job is pleasing the customers. Everyone is always nice.
good,Panera Bread is a great place to work in my opinion. It has a great management team and flexible hours. They have trainers to help you learn the positions you will be stationed in and it is always easy to ask questions if need be.
good,Panera is my favorite place. The workers are polite and welcoming. The management team is understanding and helpful. They work with you if you have issues outside of work to deal with(within reason). It has an easy balance between work and life. And you receive a discount on the food. Easy going environment as well.
good,I loved wrk there I helpout any I can coming in on my day off and then able to go home after and when I got busy I sold out the bakery on a sunday and on mother's day I have the mother free coffee
good,I would recommend anyone to work for Panera Bread. They have great benefits and the employees are great to work with as well. I've never had a job where I looked forward to going to every day.
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to work at, They follow all safety and food safety rules, Everyone goes by the book and follow company rules, Also treat its employees great.  Also it’s easy to get an promotion, you just have to work Hard."
good,"My workplace is in a shopping plaza and the first Panera Bread off the Pittsburgh exit of the turnpike. I have served more than 4 years in a cafe that gets scrutiny for problems at our other locations. NO employee parking, no reliable repair service, and no guarantees that the day(s) you call off are granted that week. I barely get paid enough for food and gas, and the automatic (yearly) pay raise stops when the company reduces budget goals. Great management and new tech additions improve service and adds to work that needs done. Most of my co-workers are still in high school and leave in less than a year. uniform is a labeled t-shirt with my name tag and tan khakis or jeans. I have seen so many situations that I now know how to deal with. My college degree did not get me any promotions or make my job any EASIER. Longest time that I have worked for the same company though."
good,Really nice managers good pay and fun environment. Wish I could work there again. Nice customers. Job was fun. Made a lot of money.train u to do everything. Good place to get management position.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to interact with customers and help them and make sure they are happy and have what they need. There isn't really anything too difficult about the job. Management is friendly and easy to work with.
good,Honestly I did like working here had a great work  Environment Management was good as well and they have good food so your employee discount will definitely come in handy.
good,"Panera is a friendly workplace filled with lots of diffrent personalities. FUN, HAPPY but all hard working. Its filled with good vibes and great food."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I have learn a lot from working at Panera. but only bad thing is. Pay is low and benefits only go to salary managers. Other then luck of pay it a good place to work.
good,"I worked there for roughly a year. In that time, I learned everything and became proficient at all positions available at my level. If you are looking for an easy day to day job with some advancement opportunity, this may be for you."
good,Fun place to work very team oriented. The customers are very nice and friendly. The culture of the company is very good as well. I would recommend this place to everyone.
good,"Panera is a great place to work your get a huge discount for employees and there food is amazing , great work environment, only bad side you have to have multiple positions to get gold amount of hours ."
good,Panera is probably the best company I have ever worked for. Unfortunately for having a work and life balance it doesnt provide that kind of lifestyle. I would not have left if it hadnt been for a new child on the way and the constant hours and some health problems were not working out well together. I miss it every day.
good,"Panera Bread is such a wonderful job to work at! It's fast-paced, but also slow at times. The employees that are hired are hard working people who pay attention to how the job needs to be done right. The work isn't difficult at all, and neither is the management. I loved working at Panera! It was such a joy!"
good,"I was in my last semester(s) of college. The manager continually pressured me to advance in management, and I declined constantly. The manager decided to schedule me more, and I felt constantly pressured to quit school."
good,It’s a good place to start out at and as a baker the pay is okay some cafes are easier to bake at than others. However it can be a bit stressful at times and overwhelming especially having to have everything done in a timely manner depending on how much pan up and baking that needs to be done.
good,I really loved working at Panera. Everything was professional. The management was willing to work with you. The food was always fresh and prepared every morning.
good,"Working at this organization was a good experience for me. I was able to work independently at times and as a team. The organization provides great teamwork, ensuring success."
good,I really enjoyed my 2.5 years working for Panera. They put a lot of price and effort into their company to create a successful business. Everyone treated each other with respect.
good,I always feel welcome and get along with almost everyone. There are familiar faces and connections I will take with me. I always look forward to going into work.
good,"I currently still work at Panera and it is a great job with great employees. All customers are kind and respectful, I've worked here for 6 consecutive months and have yet to have a negative experience. Days are very busy during lunch and dinner other than those times it is typically slow so you have time to get things done. I think that we have good management besides a few thing, for example we have one manager who talks negatively about some employees to her friends that are also employed there right in front of them which makes you feel bullied by your boss. There is also some managers who do not seek a solution to problems rather they just let it be what it is. The manager who creates the schedule makes sure that all employees are scheduled within their availability and tries her best to give the employees requested time off."
good,"I learn team work"
good,The management are some of the most easygoing people I've ever got to work with. They made sure you kept busy while being very easy to talk to while the restaurant was slow. Very supportive as well.
good,"The restaurant business is what you make it, it can be good or bad. Depends on you. However, Panera Bread does its best to make the customer happy as well as their employees. It’s a good place to work and there’s tons of opportunities, but again, it’s how you treat it."
good,"I love working here I really do. I love my coworkers and the managers. The only thing that I would to see change is that we would get better pay for the area that we are in; and what I mean by that is, that the city average here is around $9-$10 for a lower job but here it’s more like min-$8.75 and that’s ok I guess but I have bills to pay. Also the hours here are either hit or miss. Some weeks I get scheduled every day of my availability then sometimes I’m lucky to get more than two shifts. But the reason why I stay is because I love the environment because it really feels like people there care about their work and treat others with respect."
good,I am easy to get along with and easy to catch on and easy to work with I come to work on time. When they need me to come in and work I do every body love my work
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The environment is clean, team members are friendly, it is a fast pace job which requires a lot of lifting, standing and talking. Cusromers are usually very friendly."
good,"I worked at Panera briefly, maybe 4 months all together in 2014. I regret that I quit working there due to a life crisis at the time "
good,"When I worked for them in Ohio it was great... I tried to work for them in another state and it was terrible. Lack of leadership, rules weren't followed, the staff ran the place instead of the GM( who was nowhere to be found )"
good,I have been working for 5 Panera for the last 5 years and love everything about the place. I enjoy working with me peers and I come to work with a smile on my face.
good,"I started as a 16 year old in high school when I applied to Panera as my first job and held it as my only job until I had to leave for college. I thoroughly enjoyed my work there because of the coworkers there and the atmosphere was prominently busy, which I like in a work area. I was promoted within my first year, but the downside was that even after my 2 years at my store, I still made a low $9.10/hr. I was barely making due with my fees that I had to pay and it made me feel underappreciated."
good,"I've really enjoyed my time at Panera Bread. It can be challenging and certainly stressful, but it is a fast paced food service environment that isn't fast food and isn't full service which I have always found to be the best in-between. I've spent years with the company, and been to many stores in my time and I must say they attract people I like to work with and my superiors have always been people I can look up to overall."
good,My co workers and managers are awesome! The discount is great. Amazing food. Customers are very friendly. Short shifts for delivery drivers. Feels like family here.
good,Good and peaceful work inviroment. Place to relax and enjoyed a coffee with friends.  Friendly faces and exelente food quality that make of panera an every day oasis.
good,Panera is one of the best places I have worked with some of the best people I have met. At times when things are rough we work together as a team to get things done.
good,"The environment was very comfortable,  very good company to work for, very clean environment.. The employees was awesome and the food was great.. I was a Baker and enjoyed every moment."
good,"I was very happy working at Panera Bread. If I didn't need to leave, then I would have stayed s long as I could, and would've tried my hardest to move up within the company. Although the work was fast paced, I was able to develop my skills within the company. I was taught patience and was able to learn more about my strengths and weaknesses through this job."
good,Working at Panera Bread was an amazing experience. The room for growth is unlimited and you learn a lot of reusable knowledge. I meet a lot of great people working with the company.
good,My everyday work day at Panera bread was very good and everyone respected the other and managers would help out a lot and as well as co workers. We all worked really god with each other and had a fun work environment as well. As long as we got our work done.
good,I enjoyed working at Panera. They accommodated my schedule. Offered benefits. It was an easy going happy place to work. I consider it one of the best jobs with the most growth opportunities I’ve had thus far.
good,My opinion on my work place at Panera was very inviting since the day I was interviewed. A typical day for me is like walking in to seeing family and friends because that's how we acted upon each other we worked hard to service the people coming in and to insure they left smiling and ready to comeback. The hardest part was learning all new foods and knowing what's in every meal you serve or suggest. It got easier over time but every season we change or menus to learn all over again. Overall my job at Panera was a second home.
good,"Panera is always striving to be better for customers and associates.  I learned the importance of serving high quality, clean food.  I learned to work with a very diverse group of managers and associates.  The hardest part of my job was balancing work and home life.  I had a company laptop so work was always with me.  I loved the people I worked with.  I had some of the best teams in the company."
good,The work environment was friendly and welcoming. The customers were great. Spacing and worker accommodation was very good and manager treated us well enough.
good,"overall Panera Bread was an absolute favorite of mine very chill and beautiful setting, the only set back for me was the wage. Management was fantastic, and always did their best to provide the most convenient schedule as possible."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I enjoyed working at Panera Bread for a few months. To be customer service the pay was pretty well. Very welcoming staff to new employees and very calm and understanding customers as well.
good,"When working the opening shift, you have to be there at 5am (or 6am on Sundays). It’s difficult at first, but you definitely get used to it. It’s pretty chill until about 7:30 or 8, that’s when you usually start to get a small breakfast rush. Up until then all you really have to do is set up your position for the day, but don’t slack at it because it will set you behind if you don’t get what you need to get done at a reasonable time. Closing shifts are easier but definitely slower at some points, and involve more cleaning and stocking than opening. This job involves a lot of teamwork and I found it very easy to get along with my coworkers and managers, even making some friends. I genuinely enjoyed working here even when it got rough, such as during a bad lunch rush which definitely can be overwhelming sometimes. But if you help out your coworkers, they’ll help you out in return. The hardest days are typically Sundays, as we’re usually understaffed those days and we also open an hour later so there’s less time to get ready for the day."
good,it was a great place to start my first job and i enjoyed it alot. they were reasonable and worked around my school schedule. unfortunately i had to leave due to leaving the state.
good,"Buena panera , buen ambiente limpio atención única y buenos compañeros de trabajo , me sentí bien trabajando ahí"
good,very laid back and they gave out a lot of free food. great place to work and hang out with free drinks and bread. management was ok but not the best. i got hours but not a lot of pay
good,"After having lost a job due to illness, I was hired at Panera Bread through a mutual friend. I negotiated my pay with the manager, and they're more than accommodating to me when I have dr. Appointments or I'm simply not feeling well. They work with me on my schedule if i'm having car troubles and need to come in earlier or not at all that day."
good,Really the only issue I had with them was that the hours were not exactly what I wanted and were not worth the pay and the trouble. I was unable to fully make a living from this company.
good,Panera is an enjoyable place to work but summer time is excruciatingly slow.  Hours tend to get cut.  There does seem to be opportunity for advancement however.
good,I loved working for Panera it was fun baking and smelling the bread. The menu is very very big very diverse. I just wish that to the management was better and knew how to take advice from people underneath them. It would make some of the stores better as a whole to have managers who are open minded and listen to what other people have to say. Everybody wants to help each other to make their store better.
good,I loved working at Panera Bread. I was given many opportunities to advance and share my ideas with the company. I was very happy working there. Flexible schedule and awesome workers.
good,"Typically I am dealing with customers for 95% of my shift. The hardest part of the job would have to be the cleaning at closing, because it is in fact a food establishment so the cleaning standards are different."
good,Place is very fun co workers are awesome they really help when you need it ..management needs help they don’t value their workers.. the hours are flexible and they usually can work with you
good,This job always kept me on my toes. Sure there the regulars that came in everyday but no two days were the same. The people were easy to talk to and work with plus a learned something new everyday
good,"work with customers, work of production, bakery, and back of house. I am certified to work in all positions so I can help anyone that needs help. The management is wonderful and they work with college students."
good,"I believe any customer service/casual fast food environment is stressful, but if you like adrenaline and are capable of doing well in a fast pace environment, Panera Bread is for you. At least this one location is!"
good,"For the most part the environment was warm and friendly, work was easy, however mundane. Management was generally pretty frazzled but it was a very busy store. However they did have a high turnover rate. People quit frequently, but mostly it was because the customers were usually unkind."
good,"I like Panera. I was a very dedicated and hard worker, so in return I was treated very well! Some of the customers are very nice and warming. Some are not as nice, they are more so impatient and rude. Overall I don’t mind working there."
good,Great management and friendly associates. Good hours given to employees and very helpful staff when in need of assistance. Would highly recommend this job for customer service experience and food service.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"On a typical day i would come in and prepare food. Anything from making smoothies to making hand-crafted sandwiches. I also was in charge of stocking the freezer and cooler. I would come in at six in the morning to unload the truck. Management was great and organized, they kept things running smoothly. Best of all there are so many ways to move up in this company."
good,"Enjoyed working there, workers felt like family and i had an opportunity to grow in the food industry and expand my skills and work in a new type of environment."
good,"I sometimes would help open the restaurant in the early mornings and I like working in those hours but working in the afternoons until closing hours is fun. Working in the mornings until the afternoon is calm and slow-paced also working with most of the managers that work at Panera are interesting to be around and they usually make my day go great and shift faster. I like working in a fast-paced environment because it would keep me focused and I would meet those managers' and general manager's expectations. I learned how to work better with the people that I work with and to contribute to others' that need help in any situation. I think the management is great. My general manger allowed me to be on leave during my first year of college so that I would be able to come back on my breaks and still have a position. I did not want to leave entirely during my first year because I enjoy working there and I've enjoyed returning so far. They are willing to change my availability whenever something comes up and to help me when I need if it's personal or for work. The hardest part working at Panera is when service is slow, it's difficult to keep oneself busy. What I enjoy most about it is the customers that come in, the managers, and the other employees that I am able to work with because they make me want to keep coming back to work to just see them and be around them."
good,"everyday was very busy no matter what day of the week it was, very fast paced work environment, from this job i learned various food and health code procedures with food and kitchen areas.learned to talk with customers when delivering food to them and making sure they have what they need.the heardest part of the job was just making sure you where checking in on all of the little things that you needed to do, weather that be making coffee taking out trash, wiping down tables, or remembering to grab something for a customer,the best part about the job was meeting all of the regular people that showed up daily and making a connection with them so they know who you are and enjoying being around your coworkers"
good,The management treats you like they don't want you there when you first start and then they changed after your first month there. Depending on your position you are either managements best friend or worst enemy.
good,Great environment. A place to work and meet knew people. Where you can be yourself and have fun. Frequent promotions. A management team that wants you to advance in the work place.
good,Panera was a big part of my life when i was there and did help me out as person to grow and mature. Working here meant working around my life and managing my life around work area.
good,Panera does a great job following their core values. They do a great job in hiring like minded individuals and allowing them to express their individuality while also being steadfast on the core values.
good,"Great work atmosphere, management, good food. A typical day at Panera involves stocking and rotating products, making food, greeting customers, daily cleaning duties."
good,"Awesome coworkers and managers ! "
good,I enjoyed this job a lot. I got to interact with almost all of the customers and help them order. It was great customer service experience. I worked the cash register and kept the dining room clean.
good,"it was fun and the food was great. aside from being forced to do inventory in a freezer, it was a dang good place to work, and eat. Management team was awesome to work with"
good,Nice Place to work. They have really been understanding of the difficult situation that I am currently in. They are understanding of the time I need off to handle my issues outside of work.
good,"I could not say enough positive things about Panera.  It is the best job/place that I have ever been employed at.  Management, location, and culture were super."
good,No me quejo fue un placer trabajar para ellos me salí por quedar embarazada de mis tres hijos
good,"They don't pay that much unless you're a manager. Overall, great place with great food. Quick. fast-paced, hard work. Depending on the manager, the job culture and environment tends to be friendly and welcoming."
good,It was great and exciting. I looked forward to work. I went at 5am and I didn’t mind because it was fun. I’d eat there even on my days off because it’s just good food. I still go back to eat there because I know it’s prepared right.
good,Working for this company is Great! Would reccomed to any youg person just starting off. Management is Great! The people are Great! Just a great place to work!
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Working for Panera Bread is a fast-paced, yet enjoyable place to work. Helping customers with their orders and any questions they have is very rewarding while working here. My favorite part honestly was baking the cookies and bagging them up at the start of the day. Overall, this job is a great and rewarding place to work for."
good,"It is the only place I have worked but I really enjoyed working there. When I had to leave the job due to scheduling conflicts, I felt quite sad because it was an enjoyable place to work full of new experiences, kind people, and the management was both understanding and great."
good,"Loved the job, it was simple and even when it was super busy it was still manageable. They donate all the unused bread at the end if the day so I loved that about the company and they even let workers take some of the used bread home."
good,The Management team really went out their way to make you feel the company greatly valued your importance to how the store flowed and the culture of the workplace was cultivated to ensure quality service was provided no matter what kind of day it was. The General Manager always made himself accessible and available to everyone and the customers all loved it.
good,"The typical day as A Panera employee is that of most cafes, usually with a fast paced lunch. Panera has a really great and interactive management team as well as the associates. The most enjoyable part of working there is Panera's ability to act like a magnet to good people which cultivates an environment that is relaxed and enjoyable; even when it is busy."
good,"I started my senior year of high school, worked with the pro-team; traveling and opening brand new stores. I met some of my best friends there and loved everyone I worked with. Fast-paced but they'll work with you on your flexibility. I worked my way up into management but left due to needing a simple life change. :) 5 years well spent with the company, great culture."
good,"Panera was one of the few companies I have seen that care about the development of the staff as much as they care about the happiness of their customers. I worked there for almost 5 years at multiple locations, including the 5am openings and 10pm closings. Two questions people always asked me - 5 yrs, didn't you get tired of the food? No! Honestly the most wholesome food you will find working in a fast paced restaurant environment. I never got tired of the food. Was it exhausting to work at 5am everyday? Nope... not when you truly love what you do and the Panera culture. I highly recommend."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Panera Bread in Shakopee, Minnesota, and am genuinely sad that I will one day soon have to part ways with the store. They have provided a great company culture in which to learn about the working environment and grow more responsible as an adult. They are flexible and understanding with scheduling and pay, and the education and experience gained in customer service is invaluable for anyone in any field."
good,Fun and rewarding even if some employees aren't friendly.   Lunch is extremely fast paced and could be stressful if not experienced enough.  Training was extremely lacking and management was it seemed as if everyone was grumpy from over working.
good,I enjoy working at panera. It is fast paced and exciting. The stores are very clean and well run. They offer very good benefits. I very much enjoyed my time at panera.
good,"Best boss ever! Great work environment, relatively easy to get extra hours, or to get rid of shifts. Lots of fun when multi-tasking in the drive-thru!"
good,"Easy well and relaxed , this job is so fun and easy to do your job to the best of your abilities. It’s very organized and the atmosphere is pleasant. I really enjoy working at panera"
good,"It's a good place to work. Management is easy-going, coworkers are are friendly. Very strict on the health policies. Stressful, but if you get the job done you will be alright."
good,"The people you work with are amazing, management listens and addresses your concerns and if you are looking to make a career out of this job then they will help you in finding the steps needed to advance. Loved working here in college and would gladly recommend to others."
good,"if your looking to eat good and healthy with unlimited discount then Panera bread is the place for you, Where everything is made fresh. Pastries are life."
good,"Panera Bread is an amazing  company and I will always be grateful for the employee I became in my time there, the food is clean, the managers are amazing and are always willing to work with you, the district managers are amazing and are always seeking to make things as comfortable as possible. I believe that Panera Bread stands for clean food and they really go out of their way to make sure people receive what they're paying for. Like any food job it can get hectic but theres always someone to help you and it's never an overwhelming amount of work. I love Panera and I think its a great and fair place to work."
good,I loved working at Panera bread great people they help you make sure you understand very fast I really loved being in the bakery it was nice dealing with all the costumer's.
good,"Great product, great coworkers, great managers. I have worked at 3 different locations and I believe in what I was selling which made it a pleasure to assist customers."
good,"Loved working there, would never get bored. Although my feet would get tired it was great to just keep moving. Everyone is friendly and good discounts. Easy to make it to management within  a few months or year."
good,"fun place to work, flexible hours, easy work, good pay, great for people starting out in their career. liked the environment and my coworkers. recommend"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera Bread was one of my favorite places to work. I love to environment and people. The management and coworkers are helpful and down to Earth. I dont know if it was my certain store but I recommend this place to anyone. The reason I left was only because I needed a stable 40hr job but this place offered good raises too.

good,"Panera Bread was my first job and I loved it. They train you well and the people are amazing. Managers even help when it gets super busy. If you work hard you can easily get a raise every 3 months. It's a small raise, but it's fast food so you can't complain. You always get you breaks, and the discount for food is really good considering the food is usually pretty pricey. The worst part about this job is the customers, but I guess that's like anywhere that has customers. Overall, I'm glad I worked here. I was even told I could always come back after I left."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I loved it a Panera it's a lot of thing to be done like professional management. Happy to help customers out and make them happy so they would visit Panera Bread again

good,"Working at Panera is a job that really tests my leadership skills as well as quick thinking. Being part of a company that is very passionate about not only their food, but the environment and tone that is set for customers, helps create a mindset for myself to to be cautious of a customers wants and needs. Working with food is a delicate process, because every person has their own twist to a sandwich or a food, and when not made properly, complaints come along with that. For the past few years working with Panera, I've made plenty of mistakes, but really understood what It meant how important customer service really is. Naturally, I'm an understand and kind person. However, that was tested when approached by customers who were either rude, or aggressively unhappy with their meal. I've learned how to properly and patiently approach a situation, solve it, and have a customer leave happy, even if there was a mistake. In conclusion, I've created great relationships with customers, getting to know them on a personal level."

The managers did their jobs well and kept on the employees to do their work. I learned how to handle people well and how to keep them satisfied with their food.

I learned working there to always stay level headed when things get busy and attention to detail because everything had to be perfect and quick. It also taught me great customer service skills to always keep the customers happy and represent the company in a good way. The managers were all great, they kept us at our sharpest and encouraged us to get better. The hardest part was probably handling large loads of stress during rushes and cleaning time. You had to do everything quickly, efficiently, and make it perfect but this grew me as a person I think because of the things it taught me.

good,I loved working for this company. I was an original employee when the cafe first opened in our area. I was quickly promoted to Via Panera Coordinator. As the Coordinator I help customers fulfill lunch orders for their luncheons and party's. I was also able to help a few families with loved ones in hospitals with free lunch. I was also trained in every area of the cafe enabling me to travel and help open new cafe in other area.

good,"It was a really great place to work.   I loved management, and my customers"
good,"My typical day at work was always different depending on what I was doing that day. Some days I would be working in the dining room, other days I would be working in the back making sandwiches and salads for our customers. While working in the dining room i learned excellent customer service and how to deal with the customers complaints in a nice way. While i worked as a sandwich and salad maker I had to learn how to work in a fast yet timely manner and be a team player. My co-workers were outstandingly friendly and I don't think I've had such amazing co-workers before. My manager on the other hand was different. I wasn't very impressed in the way he worked. I was a very hard working employee and he valued other, ""not so hard working"" employee's over me. I can't really think the hardest part of my job would be at the moment, I loved most of it. The most enjoyable part of my job was being a waitress and delivering the food to the customers and just seeing the big smiles on their face. It was truely the best and most enjoyable place I have ever worked"
good,"Relatively simple job.  You come in and set up, and keep things neat and organized.  Paneras are typically busy stores, so you must be able to work hard, and work fast. But the customers are A1, and so is the management team.  There is of course some lifting, and since this is a restaurant environment, can be very hectic.  But that is also a plus in my opinion."
good,A typical day at work was amazing. We would start off by making sure display table for bakery items were correct and looked good to customers. Management and co workers are what made the day go by faster. the management team is amazing. They dont boss you around. They help if things get busy. The hardest part of the job was cleaning. Most enjoyable part was just being around the co workers and management
good,"work is fun , I know how to do everything. I'm a certified trainer."
good,"The job is basically as hard as you make it. If you are consistent and hardworking, you'll be fine. However, if you are more interested in an easy job where you do nothing, this isn't the job for you."

good,"After working for Panera Bread as my first job, I have learned how to work efficiently, fluently, and strongly with my team. I would never dread coming to work because daily, the environment of helping our customers with a great team felt great. I was given responsibilities as an Associate Trainer so I was able to help new co-workers and even manage the front-of-house. The hardest part of my job was making sure we were all in sync to make sure our customers were satisfied. Without proper training on taking the customer requests, the team members making the food has a possibility of also executing an unwanted order. I loved working at my job because it has taught me to be comfortable with any ethnicity and leadership to maintain top quality."
good,"A typical day would be coming into the cafe and starting my job right away, proofing and baking product topping it when finished and cooled.cleaning my area when my work becomes complete. I have learned how to be a better employee i have learned how to to pride into my work and to the customers. I had great management and co-workers they made my day great and treated me with lots of love and respect. To hardest part of my job would be working alone and working the night shift. I enjoyed working with people and i loved being a baker."
good,I was very busy there but anydown time we had while preping for the next rush we still had our fun
good,"It is always busy, so time goes by fast. I have learned a lot  about baking and food prep. The hardest part of my job is standing on my feet all day. The most enjoyable part is dealing with the public! You never know what someone is dealing with when they walk through the front doors. I make it my goal to make every single person that comes in my line smile!"
good,"I learn new skills every day. Some days I do walk in and there is a rush hour, so I jump in to help. The employees work together to maintain a balance. Teamwork is a high standard and kept as such. I learned how to prepare food under 3 minutes. The hardest part of the job is to keep up with the day dots and make sure inventory is not out of stock. However, it is also the most enjoyable part as well. It keeps my mind active. Management is always out on the floor helping the employees or talking to make sure customer satisfaction is high."
good,"Even though with its ups and downs, Panera's a great place to work at in my opinion. I really enjoyed myself here a lot. I learned a lot of great things I can carry on with me in life. "

good,"It's the first job that I can say I love going to every day. Most of the managers are down to earth people. My co-workers are great workers as well as people. The hardest part of the job is being away from my son. The most enjoyable part of the job, as with any, is when I get to go home after a hard day's work."
good,"Panera is a great company that is growing fast even during rough times. Great growth opportunities from within. Provides essential tools needed to learn and improve managment skills. Inspires good co worker and employee relations and communications. As a market manager I work day and night so a typical day can be me working and doing interviews and making calls, emails, reports etc. Then at night out for a few hours working with my baking team. Can get very busy at times. Theres always something to do."
good,I opened the cafe daily. Done morning deposits invoicing ordering i learned alot about serve safe and food safety The hardest part of the job was actually nothing love doing it i love running a resturant. Once again the most enjoyable part of the job would be the people who came in every morning to get there coffee and bagel they put a smile on my face.
good,I would start immediately with cleaning my station and getting it ready for the next business rush. I learned the value of hard work and the benefit of open communication. Co-workers came and went so it was difficult to tell how they were overall.
good,"I enjoyed every moment I worked there. I loved helping all the customers and taking orders. I also did catering for Panera which was a very fast pace job and could get stressful at times. Iloved the challenge and my days would fly bye because of how much fun I would have with my employees. The management team were always helpful, I worked for this company for about four years."

Management was stern but understanding and flexible. I honestly loved my co-workers. Panera Bread had a diverse of races that worked for them. I was able to learn a lot of new things from different ages and races which made my job fun. The hardest part of the job was when I had to leave, due to pregnancy, and being unable to lift heavy items.

good,• Prepare sandwiches and other food items for customers
good,I really enjoyed this job. It really taught me the meaning of working hard. I did not think we had the best management to get what the store really needed. My co-workers were really great. Everybody worked as a team and made the job what it should of been. The hardest part of the job for me was not over working. I came in everyday and did everything I could. My boss told me I worked to hard. I loved that job.

I started as an associate and worked my way up easily. I have been able to teach classes for Panera and even get my hand in training other managers. I think that your management can make or break it. I am very impressed by their ability to work with different schedules. I am a full-time student and am still able to be a manager. It's a very easy job as long as you are task-oriented and willing to learn. Anyone at any age can apply. We have several retired people at our cafe and we have an employee that just turned 16. They push for their inside team members to move up over outside hires. Also, you don't go a day without good food! The pay isn't the best but the work environment can help."

good,This was my first job and it gave me experience in customer service. I loved the management and my coworkers while I was there. Everyone was quite friendly and always willing to help.
good,"Good people, lots of opportunities, Had a lot of growth with the company. Always a challenged if you wanted it. Loved that my managers helped in my development."
good,"I learned how to work all positions in Panera. I love multi tasking, so this was a great job for me! I even learned how to run the floor whenever my manager was busy. The hardest part of this job is when we are short staffed. That would have an impact on how fast our food would get out to the customers."
good,I really loved working at Panera Bread. I learned customer service being up front as a cashier. I talked to many people about Panera but also in a personable way too!!
good,If your real passionate ant giving people healthy food then thats the place.....they set up a nice culture of taking care of eachother to get the job done.
good,It was a very nice experience to work in panera because I learned to deal with clients face to face.  and have a phenomenal work environment and flexible schedules and good compensation.
good,"You basically had a set schedule and should expect doing the same work walking in. When more people are needed in certain positions, they might move you around."
good,"I have been an employee with Panera for many years and I have enjoyed working with the company. There has always been opportunities to move up and to gain new skill, but I have found recently that it’s been much harder for the company to help out our cafe. We are short handed on managers and myself and 2 other managers are running a cafe that calls for 1 General Manager, 3 Assistant Managers ans 2 shift Supervisors to run it daily. We are becoming extremely overwhelmed. Panera is a wonderful company to work for, but"
good,"We are like a family here, honestly. Even the pay isnt the best, the environment is good. We get recognized for the work we do and we are appreciated. There are a lot of teens working there so theres a little drama but overall, this is my most favorite job I've ever had"
good,The employees were very nice and the discount was very beneficial and the managers are very lineint given the fact that I was in college during the time.
good,"When I was being interviewed for shift supervisor my regional and area directors sat me down and asked me what outstanding customer service meant to me. On the spot I regurgitated every cliche I could recall “oh the five foot rule, the customer is always right, no jerks....” Looking back on that day I wish I had been more genuine; I may not acknowledge every customer who comes within earshot of me, but there wasn’t a regular who came into that cafe who’s name I didn’t know, who’s profession I didn’t know, in addition to the smattering of interesting and odd fun facts that come from seeing someone almost every day for years on end. That said coming to work each day never felt like a job. Even on our busiest days; $4500 worth of catering due before noon, $1200 lunch hours, with the oven broken and three call offs, we made due. Like a well oiled machine and the magic within those four walls we consistently managed to be the second most lucrative store in our directors region, and maintained the highest cafe health in our district."
good,"The location I worked at is recently under partially new management, and the new manager is great. I loved the job itself and nearly everyone I worked with."
good,"It is a great place to start working if you’re starting out , but it’s not a place that you should stay working for long because there is only so much you can learn there"
good,"I enjoyed this job. I believe God didn't want me there, but I continued to work there. My baby sitter started to be unreliable, so I decided to leave. A typical day was that I'd go in, count my till, transfer the till to my name, log in, and started taking customer's orders. I'd refill coffee when it either ran out, or expired, restock, and clean tables as needed. I learned that even though I enjoyed the work place, I needed to listen to what was best for me, because in the end, I had to end up leaving anyways. Management was awesome and I loved my managers. They took very good care of their employees even when it was their days off. They really care about their employees. Work place was diverse and the people were loving. Hardest part was getting use to the way the order screens were. The most enjoyable part was to be around people who truly care about your orders, and do their best to satisfy their needs and wants....also to have worked with such amazing people."
good,"I love panera, I don’t consider it a “forever job” but definitely a good first job. Mangers a good and so are the other staff, customers are also good"
good,able to work efficiently with fast-paced environment. I learned produce and workplace culture is great. I enjoy that customer is satisfied with the quality of the food and schedule is flexible.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The management was excellent at the Cerritos Panera. They are really understanding towards their employees and will work with your schedule. Training was clear and effective. Coworkers are friendly. If you work hard and do your job there's really nothing to complain about. It's also not hard to move up in the ranks if you express interest in it and are a good worker.
good,I love my job here at bread company. The people are friendly and always ready to help if able. Also the management is always available if there is ever a situation
good,"It was fast paced, but they gave you plenty of training and teamwork support. If you do a good job there is room for advancement. You get a free meal and drink up to $13."
good,my Panera location was phenomenal. i knew so many people and gained many new friends. the managers were fantastic. only reason i left was that i was barely getting by moneywise after my hours were cut back
good,Just a good place to work the place is laid back and fun most of the time I would not recumine ane one to work here  and I would not want them overlooked
good,"The work environment at Panera Bread is so uplifting and positive and it was so difficult for me to make the decision to leave. Everyday people would tell me how great of a job I was doing, and just generally making everyone feel great about themselves and the job they did there. They were fair and understanding with training, and ultimately one of the best teams I have ever been a part of."
good,I love my job at Panera Bread. The customers are always so nice. The coworkers and mangers are understanding as well as productive and make working fun!
good,"Panera set me up for my fundamentals in management. Not just over my team of employees, but with customers and vendors. I was able to use these skills to get my self promoted to GM, training GM and eventually a multi unit GM."
good,Panera Bread was a great place to work and I would definitely go back. People were helpful and everyone was very nice. Easy job to work and very fast paced
good,"Panera bread was by fair my favorite job. I loved the hospitality and great coworkers. It was a fast pace environment, but always clean and good service"
good,Love working at Panera. The environment of the establishment is very calm and enjoyable. Tasks are very straightforward and understandable. My coworkers are excellent at their jobs. 10/10
good,I worked for Panera for many years and mostly enjoyed it there. The hardest part of the job was that no matter how hard you worked you rarely got done with your shift on time.
good,"Just didnt know what to expect.Never was we fully staffed, had bad turnover rates.. Other than that the job was really cool i appreciate the opportunity."
good,"I absolutely loved this job. If I was thinking clearly, I would still be at that job. I loved the people I worked with, I got along with 99% of my coworkers. The customers were great and I loved getting to know them and putting a smile on their faces. Most of the managers were really good at balancing professional leadership skills and still being able to be a friend. They were easy to come to with any problems and always willing to go out of their way to help you with any issues you may have encountered. I'm really sad that I ruined my reputation there and can no longer be rehired. I still go in and visit from time to time."
good,Working at Panera bread was a wonderful experience. Restaurant is kept clean and managers knew what they were doing. I felt like pay was fair and so was everything else. The training was great and I made great connections with co workers! Working at the restaurant was stressful at times but that’s because it’s the food industry and the managers always were always sympathetic to me and knew I tried my best! I enjoyed my time there.
good,"It was a warm, inviting place. The managers seemed to enjoy their job. The customers loved us. The food and drinks were good and good for you. I enjoyed my time there."
good,"if you’re looking for a good high school job, this is a great place to be. lots of high school and college students work here, along with morning staff of adults so any one of any age can find friends at this job."
good,I enjoyed being a dining room attendant. I love working with people and interacting with the customers was so rewarding. I enjoyed working by myself under no pressure.
good,I loved it here.  The only real reason i left was because I found another job where I felt I would have an opportunity to learn more about my career ... but also the manager of the store was horrible to work for.
good,It's a nice place to work. You never have to worry about working Christmas or Thanksgiving. You'll get lots of free food between Planet Bread and all the meetings to go over the new seasonal menu items. You have a 60% discount on everything for lunch so long as you don't order more than $10. They're pretty eager to train in all the different areas. I worked in a pretty busy area so we were usually up and moving all day.
good,A fun workplace with great people and good management. Required a lot of team work which made for fast shifts and a good relationships with co workers.
good,"I learned how to take initiative from working at Panera. I knew what was required of me and what had to be done and I did it on my own without having to be asked. I learned how to work as a team. My days there were spent preparing food for customers, restocking my area, cleaning any mess that was made by me and interacting with the customers to ensure that they had a good experience."
good,Learned how to work more efficiently and able to jump around positions to help wherever needed. It was usually short staffed at the location i was employed which actually made me a better worker even though it was stressful at times
good,Panera Bread was a great college job. They were flexible with my hours and never complained. The managers there were all fantastic and made going to work enjoyable
good,"Panera Bread truly treats everu individual from their customers, to their truck delivery men the same- like family! You want it? We got it. The answer is always yes! Jerks are not tolerated!"
good,"Panera is about one of the only companies I don't think is run by a money hungry goblin. The workplace is inviting with coworkers who care and management that is there to listen. Hours are flexible and pay is decent. They get a little fussy with hours, especially with new procedures and technology. If they fixed that, I'd never leave."
good,Sometimes I would have an issue with a coworker being rude and management didn’t take care of it. It was a fun work experience because you get to know the regulars that come in.
good,"Was able to make a lot of different friends at this job, and there were a lot of people my own age. They were strict but encouraging with the job. They wanted you to succeed and they are very interested in hiring within so there are a lot of opportunities to advance within the career."
good,"Has a very peaceful and positive atmosphere to the place and management is spectacular,and well respected.It never had a stressful vibe to it the way some other restaurants do. Cross training is a huge thing here.Within only a couple of weeks i had learned prep,casier,bakery,and barista,lobby.That seems like a lot in only a little of time but they work with you on each thing till you feel comfortable and ready to do it on your own,which is great cause everyone works and learns at a different pace. Customers often seem to enjoy it here and you learned faces easily and what they would often order often."
good,"It's a fun place to serve the community. You get to know the regular customers and are always pleased to serve them. I love the diversity that Panera has. The management is great. I've learned a lot about the restaurant business and it gets busy at times. The enjoyable part is working with co-workers that will help you when you need help and, pleasing the customers"
good,"Panera is really a great place to work and eat. At the location i was at (Pikesville, MD) the managers were pretty cool. When you work somewhere you see all of the behind the scenes, and here, i saw all good things such as fresh food etc"
good,Working at Panera is great you get to work with incredible people the downside are the customers as they can be rude and pushy. The management is good and flexible schedules and a good amount of hours given pay is average and work is typically good.
good,"I enjoyed the other associates, but scheduling became a problem when I asked them to work with my other job, always scheduled me after finishing a shift at my other job, ultimately had to pick one job."
good,The management was very understanding and flexible with my schedule. Workplace was a fun environment. Training was easy and helpful. . The hardest part of the job for me was trying to train new people while dealing with a lot of customers.
good,"Working at Panera Bread was the best job I have ad so far. The people there are friendly and caring. The food there is amazing, ive been eating there sense I was hired and till this day is never gotten old. The managers there are friendly and are willing to hear you out on anything. The only downside is that it offers no type of advancement in a career unless you want to become a manager there. Overall its a perfect job for a teenager."
good,"The management is on point and makes the store run very well, no one is lenient to the point of lowering the value of employee experience or customer experience. The associates are all very good at helping one another and keeping the work flow going, very independent and the managers know when to step in and when the associates are good. All team members are very helpful and everyone is comfortable asking when they need to know something. Hardest part of the job is just the endurance required both physically and especially mentally."
good,I love my job with Panera. It's a great place to move up if you've never had management experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new career.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,It was a good company to work for and really enjoyed my time there. I learned a lot from my coworkers and managers. They are really flexible with how many hours you'd like to work.
good,"A great place to work with great people - depending on the time of day it can range from stressful and busy to relaxed and peaceful. As long as you know how to manage your time properly during the slow hours, you can prepare yourself well for the busy ones. Every Panera I've worked at has had a friendly team of associates and a mostly professional team of managers."
good,"Great place to work, flexible. "
good,"I actually made life long friends here! I was my first job and it couldn't have been better. Mangers worked with my schedule with school and church! Lots of memories made here,"
good,"Had moments where it was very laid back and then also had moments where it was incredibly face paced. the work itself was not necessarily difficult, but there was a lot to remember when making orders."
good,I enjoyed my job at Panera. I stayed for 5 years because it always fit my needs. I was attending school at the time so they were very flexible with my hours.
good,"For the most part every general manager I've had has been great, but the only issue that I ran into during my last year there were managers who kept getting lazy on the job."
good,"I loved my co workers, my boss, and almost all the customers I would see day to day, Sometimes customers were rude, but that can happen at any job. I had a very positive experience there."
good,"By far, the best and most in depth training I have every received from an employer. Every single thing about the experience I had working for Panera Bread was positive. I would highly recommend this company."
good,"Panera bread was a good fit for me. the dress code is really relaxed, and the hours aren't bad either. I enjoyed y time at Panera and would return if I got the opportunity."
good,Panera Bread is a great company to work for.  They have high standards and expect greatness from their employees. They have very strict guidelines and hold their employees accountable.
good,"The environment didn't tax you, and the workload was always evenly distributed. I learned to interact with others, work at a register, and cleaning a dining area. I would say the only hard part was waiting in between rush hours and an occasional short handedness in staff."
good,I have enjoyed the years spent with Panera. They are results driven and the payback is rewarding.  The day while working is fast paced and I enjoy the customer interaction.  Time goes by quickly!  They also have very good systems and ongoing training in place to help you succeed and continue to grow.
good,my time working there was the best i've had so far especially with regulars. the people there are just as nice as they appear. if i ever got asked to go back in id take it
good,"Change Sanitizer water, brew teas, wipe tables, chairs down , restock napkins, straws, lids, butter, lemon wedges, brew coffee, switch coffee earns as neededs, fill up creamer pitchers with milk, put new date dots on sanitizer water buckets, creamer pitchers, and on tea made Containers, sweep floor, clean bathrooms, clean counter where creamer pitchers are , fill up all napkin holders, take full buss tubs of dishes to the dish washer, bring out new buss tubs, trash , Take trash to the dumpster. wipe down booths, take plates from customers when they were done their food or meals. fill up condiment packets and sugar packets."
good,Working together as a whole communicating different Ideas In a stressful work environment with the ability to multitask. Communicating with customers leaving them satisfied with the service.
good,"Not only was working here a pleasure (good staff and management when I hired on), but I loved the mission of the cafe...providing a meal to everyone who walked in the door, regardless of their ability to pay!  There was a sense of family at this cafe, and we developed great relationships with our regular customers. The fact that this cafe was only opened until 4pm daily made the workday much more manageable. I feel my managers were good teachers, so that when I moved up in the company, I had learned a lot!"
good,Panera functions as a company that follows the golden rule of treating others how you would like to be treated. It is a continuously growing company with a lot of opportunity. Managing a cafe involves a lot of responsibility with a lot of different job titles. Overall Panera Bread is a respectable company that I was happy to be a part of.
good,"I really enjoyed delivering to homes and businesses. It was an easy way to make good money, and I usually had a great experience every time I went into work."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Go to work on time. Do your job and stay out of the way.  You have to be people friendly. Keep a smile on your face. Don't bring your personal life to work place.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with all of the different customers and my co workers. I have also learned that the customer is always right no matter the circumstance!
good,"Fast paced, great culture, the best part is meeting new customers on a daily basis, working with great people from associates to managers, making a difference in your community , serving fresh, clean food."
good,"Panera is a great place to work. I had a lot of fun here, made a lot of friends and even became a trainer, which was an additional 50 cent raise. The management and staff are very easy to get along with."
good,"Panera has a very fun work environment and can be fun with making food. They are always introducing new food items and hold meeting where you can try them, called a bread bash."
good,My panera has great staff and management. I've heard the opposite of other panera establishments though. I'm still having a great time most days working at panera
good,Excellent first job out of highschool. Articulate and passionate training. The cafe i worked for ran beautifully until management changed. Generally a positive atmosphere
good,"Panera is busy and fast pace, we work as a team to get everything done daily. Management is great, they take their time and patience to make sure everything you do is correct and that you get it. I've learned how to be a team member, patience in customer service with difficult customers, and how important accuracy is. The hardest part of the job is how fast pace it is and people being rude, but the people around you make getting through all of it easy. The most enjoyable part is having managers who want to pursue you, hear you out, and work with you to reach your goals. The friendships and the atmosphere of Panera are wonderful."
good,"Very busy, great coworkers, good food preparations, learned how to make different foods, management was good most of the time, hardest part was the scheduling not being consistant"
good,"I loved my job, I learned patience and that people do care. My coworkers became my family which I will always love. I loved being in an environment that even when I was down my coworkers and managers would bring me up."
good,"When I worked at the Panera in Carytown, a typical day was relaxed yet busy. There I've learned to depend on others and ask for help when needed. Management was outstanding. The most enjoyable part of the position were the meetings. During meetings we would talk about the new employees and new food items."
good,I had a great time working at Panera. The employees were awesome and some of the regular customers were excellent. The half priced meals were pretty good. The general manager right as I left was not terrible but needing reevaluation in his managerial skills.
good,"Panera was my first job, and was an excellent place for me to learn how businesses operated. I made sandwiches along with soups and salads. The other employees were very friendly which made coming to work something to look forward to."
good,"team engagement, monthly meetings were all big factors in keeping the work environment interesting. Staff worked well with accommodating everyones schedules as well"
good,Panera Panera is one of the best places to eat and work at the environment is of such a nature that I could bring my mother to the place and have a very nutritious meal plus the employees are top-notch when it comes to customer service.
good,"Panera Bread is a really great place to work, The environment is fun and friendly. Management is great and the hours are very flexible. This is the perfect job for students."

good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Panera Bread has a very freeing aura around it. The rules are not petty, the employees are realistic, and 9 times out of 10 there are no problems with the store. "
good,"I absolutely loved working at Panera Bread. The work environment was very positive and the people were very friendly. Only reason I left was because they weren't able to work around my availability and school schedule. It did get busy and that can be stressful depending on which position you're in. But it's not bad. The food is awesome as well. The way the company itself works is great. I forgot what it was called, but for every season when they came out with new products they would close the store early and have a store meeting and introduce the employees to those products and have them taste it so they knew that way the could explain it to the guests when they asked. Advancements were always an option as well, as long you worked hard and showed determination and dependability."
good,Panera Bread was a good establishment to work at because of the crew members were very polite kind and out going however the customers could get a lil rude it was nice when I was working there.
good,The only thing I really wish Panera bread offered is better benefits and pay for all employees.  seniority would also be nice for people who have been here way longer
good,"Loved all of the fresh, clean ingredients. Lots of educational learning.  Friendly and inviting atmosphere.  Team work. Caring people. Great place to work and be."
good,Great place to work lots of fun always people there never a boring day can get hectic sometimes but it's very easy I would recommend it for a high school or college student.
good,"The work environment is fun,up beat, and employees are enjoyable. The management and whole crew are very inviting and is a great first job for high schoolers that want good hours."
good,"I learned alot over a period of time. Everyone is very welcoming. The managers are always on task, although it gets slow sometimes, there is always work to be done."
good,"Panera Bread in Big Rapids, MI is a very positive and fact-paced work environment with understanding and upbeat management. I learned how to interact with customers in a professional manner and much more."
good,"Panera was my first job in high school and after I left to go to college. Flexible hours, good pay-to-work balance, understanding management that can be talked to and trusted with personal issues. To make a career out of it would take time, and in the 2 1/2 years being there I've only seen one person promoted to shift manager. Raises of bi-yearly as well as whenever you learn to work in a new area of the store."
good,"I found Panera to be very well run, and organized. From food preparations to the bathrooms, everything was very sanitary, and no essential items were ever out of stock. All of my coworkers (as well as the managers) were very kind, and did their jobs well. However, I don't believe that I made it clear enough that I was only looking for a summer job, for the company invested a lot of money in me, and I felt sorry when I had to leave."
good,"Overall great environment, very friendly and warm. Their values are truly one of a kind, always ensuring the customers are taken care of and happy. Offers benefits and paid leave after eight months of full time employment."
good,"Panera is a great place to work, we strive for excellence while having a fun work environment.  I'm so grateful for all the things I have learned with this company.  Training is at the upmost importance and I appreciate that.  I love the interaction I get with my staff and customers."
good,"I've worked with st.louis bread company for almost 2 years now and I am at second cafe. I can say that i am seeing from my last cafe if the managers cannot schedule people well, and they do not work as a team."
good,"Working for panera bread was such a great opportunity for me. Not only do they promote healthier eating, but the staff is friendly and helpful. Very flexible hours and pay increases when needed."
good,"Panera is a great everyday oasis. "
good,I liked working at Panera Bread because the work environment was always very clean and nice. The other employees were kind. My managers were flexible and understanding. I learned a lot about the importance of communicating to the customers and the value of money.
good,"Worked at Panera while in university, I absolutely loved the environment and the good work done by the company. The management was awesome and very hands-on, lots of freedom and fun to be had every day at Panera."
good,A typical day at work consists of moving quickly and efficiently to satisfy each customer that sets foot through the door. Being an employee at Panera Bread for nearly four years I have learned to work with accuracy in a fast paced environment while also enjoying my surrounding environment filled with full and happy customers along with a wonderful management crew and co-workers.
good,you Walk into work you start working ringing customers up if any or you start sweeping bakery or see if anything needs to be stocked for the rush.before lunch you see if the line is out of anything.you always have to stay busy.i learned how to make bread and make croutons which was fun.the culture is very quick people want to get in and get out.the hardest part of my job was being on barista
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Working for Panera Bread was one of my first jobs, and proved to be a great one to prepare me for others, even outside of food. Panera puts customer service first above all else, and learning to do the same makes it so that anyone can prove themselves to be a great employee."
good,Your always working. Very busy. It makes time go by fast. Great people to work with. Awesome customers that you get to know well. Discount is 60% off while working.

good,"my typical day was completing my tasks interacting with coworkers and customers. i learned how to cooperate, communicate, and have fun in a work environment while completing my tasks. my managers were amazing they always took a personal interest in your life and really became your friends."
good,Fun and friendly atmosphere. Everyone is nice and all get along with one another. Great flexibility with hours. Awesome general manager. There is no hard part of the job very easy to learn. What I enjoy about the job is that we do the same thing everyday. Every one knows what they're supposed to come in and do. Everyone works cohesively.
good,"I love working at Panera. The hospitality and warm welcoming is not only to their customers, but their EMPLOYEES as well!.. Only reason why i'm trying to find another job is because my hourly wage isn't enough for my household :("
good,I loved working here as a student. The reason I left is due to relocation. They were willing to work around my school schedule and was a great environment.
good,Probably one of my favorite places to work. You could work over pretty much as much as you'd like. Hours were always there. The management was awesome too.
good,"A typical work day would start with preparing my part of the line (Salad, sandwich, or soup) for the my shift. Proper food-safety measurements would take place before working such as cleansing hands, wearing gloves and a apron. Fulfilling each customer orders meant meeting a high quality of standard under a timely- manner. One of the most important job of each store employee was to maintain a clean restaurant up to standards to increase each customers quality of experience. The workplace culture was very relaxed while professional."
good,"If you can get into management with Panera, do it. It's as good as it gets in the food service industry. I have been with the company for 18 months and couldn't ask for more than what the company has given me."
good,"Great customer connections"
good,"As a former employee at Panera's, I grew as a hardworking and focused individual. I was a busser/server during lunch and evening hours, so being ready to work with a great attitude helped me tremendously. To get through a solid day satisfied,  I made sure to help my fellow associates with whatever was needed and kept the dining area clean for customers to sit comfortably. Management is amazing for helping their team however they can! When I had a problem they, in return, helped me resolve the issue with complete ease. I am grateful, and would work there again. Hope this was a good enough review for you! (:"
good,Very upscale café in a very nice area of Scottsdale. The management is very accommodating and make working there enjoyable. Very fast paced environment and large volume of sales.
good,I like working there some days are better then others. Management is great and inderstanding. We laugh alot. Customers are really nice. The food is clean food and delicious
good,"Each day was a challenge and reward. It was fast paced, customer and employee oriented. As years went on, I created tons of relationships with customers that have continued to build since."
good,"Panera Bread is a great place to work. Guest Satisfaction is one of their primary goals, Pure Ingredients are used there is also Seasonal Food items which keep Guests coming back all year long."
good,"It was easy to work at Panera because I was able to be self sufficient and not be micromanaged all the time and my peers, as with my managers entrusted that I could do the job safely and efficiently"
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Great place to work no matter your skill set. Panera was my first job and they taught me everything I needed to know for the workplace in no time. The pay is a good bit above minimum wage, because you will be doing a bit more than minimum work."
good,environment was amazing place to work at. I was able to grow within the company. Dealing with the costumers was my favorite part of my job. The employees continue giving Panera the amazing standard for there name.
good,I liked working for Panera bread because they actually care about the quality of their food. They bake fresh bread every shift and they also donate un used bread to local food banks and churches. The work environment is easy going but not boring and I enjoyed the management as well.
good,"Over all this was not a bad job. I worked here for a while and the management was great and so were the majority of the employees. They do a great job of helping employees and working with schedules, I do not feel as if they promote the people they should or recognize everyone they could, but not bad."
good,panera bread is a pretty good place to work and conduct business the people are nice and friendly i learned a lot of values working here
good,"The management at my particular Panera Bread is outstanding. I could not ask for a better management team.  They have gone above and beyond for their staff.  The Cafe is well ran and we are treated fairly.  My wages are fair for the type of employment and job I do.  My co-workers are amazing.  A typical day at work for me includes insuring a positive guest dining experience, keeping the Cafe neat and tidy, serving patrons their meals, handling problems that may arise and general cleaning duties.  The most enjoyable part of my job are the regular patrons that I have gotten to know and my co-workers."
good,Largas y fuertes jornadas de trabajo para muy poco salario.
good,Good experience for people that need to get experinece with customers. Very interactive workplace and structure for advancement into management. Thankful for this oppurtunity.
good,It's a fast food service and retail job! I mean its bust and can get crazy but the pay is good and most managers are willing to work with you on your hours. Really an enjoyable company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed the time I spent with this company, very friendly and easy going. Every one got alone for the more part, from time to time their was slight favoritism."
good,"I am more than happy to say this was my first job, it taught me many skills and how to handle situations. The general manager was the best manager i met."
good,I wish the baking didn't take place only overnight. Baking is probably my favorite thing to do as far as trades go at the moment. Really enjoyed it. I love baking at home as well regardless of wether I'm getting paid for it or not.
good,"I spent four years with this company and was promoted very quickly to management by demonstrating hard work. I worked at many locations and each location has a welcoming and warm staff, especially the managers. The only reason I left was because it would be quite some time until my next promotion."
good,"Panera bread is a job that will teach you about organic food and how it tastes great. Here you learn how to better work with customers in order to make their day, and yourself, a better one."
good,"As an assistant manager I manage a store full of 12-15 associates. While running the store, I deal with customers as well as the numbers behind the scenes. I order truck and do product panups for the business days. I enjoy this job and have been here for almost 5 years. Panera provides great promotion possibilities."
good,"A typical day at Panera (for me):"
good,"Panera Bread is a great company with such great values and principles. Fun, hard working environment. A lot of room for growth. This job will acknowledge your hard work and effort. The management team in Woodland Hills is really great and enthusiastic."
good,Always had a great time working. Never felt out of place or discouraged. The management is great and works well with you. The hardest part of the job was taking out the trash at night.
good,"Most of my days were pretty typical, but I was able to learn how to stay calm under pressure especially during the busier hours. My management was ok, they trained us but would do it in a manner that often times left us hanging in higher stress situations. My co-workers were great, all hard working and understanding. Hardest part of my job was learning the register, often times the layout would change. I loved talking to the customers, understanding their taste made ordering their food much easier."
good,it was a great experience working with the customers/ I would get a lot of friendly and understanding people. if it was super busy my customers were always patient to wait for their order.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"i started with dish as my part time jobs,since i work ther for couple month my boss had to moved to prep food as parttime jobs everyday ,while i was doing prep and m done with my sruff i go heelp on line cook plus cashier ."
good,Panera is a fun place to work if you are young. The money isn't great but if you live with your parents or someone else that is paying rent it can work out.
good,greeted by boss and ask how everything going. if manager sees you need help they jump in and help. co workers are friendly and fun loving. Hardest part of job is at lunch time get extremely busy and you feel like you will never catch up but working together with everyone you get through the day and at the end of shift manager always will let you know that you did a great job and appreciate what you do.
good,"Each day at Panera Bread had many challenges and offered numerous opportunities for personal growth. Most shifts were fast paced and required effective communication. Management did the very best they could to accommodate for employees' schedules and take much of the stress off of the workers, while still adhering to company standards and procedures. The hardest part of the job was learning many different positions, yet it was also the most enjoyable part. There was always a new challenge to take on and new tasks at hand."
good,Very good on helping associates move up in the work place! Managed well and if you do your work you'll be their favorite.
good,I love the band and the incentives. I learned allot with this company whom believes in cross training employees and fair opportunity and equality.
good,"I have worked for this company for three years now and I love it! The environment is always upbeat, and the company sincerely cares about its workers."
good,very friendly staff and just a really great place to work. everyone is so nice to you even if you are new. the management is very helpful and friendly. they even offered rides home in the winter!
good,"This job is very customer service based, and gives great experience with working under pressure. Opportunities for advancement are great if you make your intent known."
good,"A typical day at work involves taking orders and or making food for customers. Our job is not only to serve guests but to build relationships with our guests. I have learned that team work is imminent and communication is key. The management is amazing and they are all very friendly, understanding, and strict when need be. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone is on the same page all the time so that our customers are always happy and keep returning. The most enjoyable part of the job is making friends with customers and getting to know their life outside of Panera as well as seeing them smile."
good,A typical day at work would be you wake early in the morning and have a fun but productive day of work. The management and co-workers are all fantastic.
good,Panera is one of my most enjoyable jobs I've had thus far. We have good days and bad days just like every other company. My managers make the experience more enjoyable as they try to be relate-able instead of strict all the time
good,Great place to work. Management is very supportive. Co workers are friendly. Customers are overall great. Lunchtime is busy and constantly flowing but we get through it. Team work is very important.
good,"During my time with this company, one of the most important things I learned was pentene and understanding. Learning that every guest has different needs and requests. doing as little as remembering allergens or a name along with a warm smile can truly change someone's day. We work in a fast paced environment that teaches you how to incorporate speed of service, and top notch hospitality skills. Catering to every order big or small new or returning, family and cultural values play a major role within the company."
good,"good work envirernment every one that works there is nice and overall a happy place to be and the co workers are friendly"
good,"A typical day at work for me is somewhere that is productive, where I can have fun but learn at the same time.  I thrive on hands on experience where I can grasp everything required of me to perform my job to the best of my abilities and beyond."
good,"Typical day consisted of answering phones to help cafes be able to work and be productive and fix any problem that they have with their computers, registers, and menu screens. I learned lots of stuff about software within the stores and how to use it. Management was great and easy to work with which made the job good. Co-workers helped everyone with whatever was needed. Hardest part was waking up and getting there by 4am and not letting the angry managers from the cafes upset you with trying to help them. The enjoyable part was learning all the software stuff about computers that I didn't know before working there."
good,Fun place to work. Music and staff are always welcoming. The food is great and delicious at a great price. Needs a little help with management.
good,"I must say, the best part about working at this company. Was the fun and fast pace environment. Training was also very fun and I really enjoyed learning their diverse menu."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Fun coworkers, Management seems to care alot about employees and the customers. Everyday is a challenge especially meeting goals and workload."
good,Panera is a great place to grow in a workplace. Their roots and what they stand for is a good influence to anyone who works there. Food is amazing and fresh and you get a feel that everyone takes their jobs seriously.
good,Panera is a great company to work for. It's all about creating a good experience for the customer. The company has great values and I loved being a part of it.
good,A typical day at work is preparing for our lunch rush. Which means I work together with co-workers to make sure we have everything we need for our peak hours.  I have learned how to work with other people who have different ways of doing things.  I also have learned how to problem solve quickly in a fast pace environment.  The management of Panera gives us seasonal training as we gather for meeting to inform us with new product.  The hardest part of the job is not being prepared for lunch rush.  The most enjoyable part is having a customer come up to tell us their experience at our location was better than any other Panera.
good,"I love working for Panera, because it's more than a job to me. The people there, including management as well as the customers are like  a big family. We greet one another by first name and are intertwined in each others lives. Panera is more than ""lunch"" or a simple sandwich, it is quality food at a reasonable price accompanied by amazing people and speedy service. I mean don't get me wrong there are good days and bad days just like with any job; however, even at the end of the bad days, I am still happy about coming to work the next day. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I know all of the food is made from quality, fresh ingredients and that we acquire return customers on a day to day basis due to their appeasement from the food and service they received."
good,It was a fun and challenging work environment. My coworkers were easy to get along with and I met many nice people on a day to day basis.
good,"Over the time with working for Panera Bread i think the best part of this whole experience would be getting along with all the co-workers like a family, and the managers are super helpful! I even considered one of my managers to be like a mother to me because she would always make time for us and help us with whatever we need. I've made many great friendships thanks to Panera and definitely recommend newbies to seek their first job there."
good,management team very on top of what is needed. great working environment. Great team work support and understanding at times. atmosphere Panera created and core values are exceptional
good,Ability to develop teams. Customer Service is the cornerstone of the company's ideals. Excellent Training program is the cafes choose to use them. Very organized company.
good,"My time at panera was good. It was kind of the same as dunkin donuts , you have to keep calm. i would get there and also start right away. brew coffee every hour keep the place clean and presentable. the only part i hated was because i was the new one i always cleaned the restrooms."
good,"Working at Panera Bread you can always expect to come into work with smiles on every employees face. The over all environment is relaxing, easy pace, and calming. Having a fire place in the cafe along with music and out door dining makes the place enjoyable. Daily returning customers are always a plus and building connection with them makes working feel less like work. Management and co-workers all got along easy."
good,"A typical day at Panera requires employees to do numerous tasks, For example, use a cash register, wash dishes, clean tables, brew coffee, take out trash, make sure everything is clean and help out customers constantly. I learned numerous skills like how to speak with customers and make them as happy is possible with their visit. I've learned how to not only make the customers happy but the Management and Co-workers. Both my managers and Co-workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was doing the dishes, and the most enjoyable part of the job was working the register because I was capable of speaking with more customers and being capable of giving them my recommendations."
good,"learned how to open, and close bakery. workers were great the day would go by fast with all the coustomers I learned how to make the suffles and how to hold bakery down by yourself. things are fast paced and it makes the cousomers happy"
good,I enjoy Panera very busy it is a great place to work with amazing people
good,Panera is Panera. Like any other job we have a good day and we have bad days
good,Great place to work if you are in school. Advancement can happen but with a limited number of stores it may take some time. Catering now much better than the past. No party is too large!!
good,A typical day at work started with making sure the coffee was still drinkable as well as starting up a new brew and making sure the display was presentable. I learned a lot about customer service and helped many with any events to come. Management was very kind and understanding of certain situations. The co-workers always found a way to make it fun. The hardest part was leaving. The most enjoyable part was helping customers with their needs.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of reviewing my relieves progress, communicating about the shift and whats expected for my shift.Dealt with costumers complaints, had fun organizing games with the cashiers to achieve the greatest sales of a given item. Counted tilts, Input any deliveries as they came. Ordered coins for the safe. Made sure all the guests were satisfy on this day. I have learned that If you really want it, you go beyond expectations and achieve your goals.My co-workers were great, understanding, willing to help out in various situations.We were unbreakable team. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet all day long, and the occasional cranky costumer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to see people and how we as whole put a smile on their day, no matter whether was the morning or night."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"The people who work there are amazing, although the customers are very high maintenance at times. If you want to advance in this restaurant, it's very important that you speak your mind about it. Managers are extremely friendly and understanding about most issues that pop up. The higher ups are very personable and talk freely with their associates. Basically, if you're social, and have a decent level of confidence; you'll thrive here. "
good,"I absolutely loved my job!! I did all the layouts and catering. I loved going out and meeting new people to introduce the new catering concept Panera Bread put out. I got along great with my co-workers and management staff. We all worked like a well-oiled machine, preparing breakfast and lunch catering orders. I delivered all the orders on time and in the best condition. I would have to say that the hardest part of the job was speaking in front of large groups of people without much notice. My favorite part of the job though was seeing the look on customers faces when I made them the ""star"" of the meeting with great food prepared and packaged to perfection."
good,"panera bread was very good company, and i would have stayed except that i got divorced and because of same had to leave"
good,"Management rewards hard work, and that is all one could ask for. The hard part comes when forced to work shorthanded, but that is true in most businesses."
good,"I loved working at this location. The staff was very helpful and respectful. We all worked as a team to deliver great food and great customer service. I worked the pastry/bagel, as well as the deli/cafe. The customers were easy-going, nice, friendly, and very talkative making the time fly and the atmosphere good."
good,my job was to cash people out and clean dinning room. The most enjoyable part were my customers.
good,Management is awesome. If there's ever a misunderstanding just talk to management and the problem will be resolved.
good,"I started working for Panera as a line production worker and within five months I was promoted to a Shift Supervisor position. I worked in all positions where I was needed, I handled any customer complaints, I made deposits at the end of every shift, which included counting money and filling out paper work. Everyone always seemed to love working with and around me, we knew how to balance fun and productivity. The hardest part of the job was making sure we had ""all our aces in their places"" making sure we had people in the right positions at the right times. I enjoyed everything about this job. Everyone was fun to work with, the customers were easily pleased and friendly, the other managers were easy to work with, the company itself is amazing, they have amazing products, and amazing beliefs and values."
good,"My coworkers were phenomenal, and I really enjoyed this job. Most of the management was great as well, however some members of management were too eager to look good on paper and would sign off on training paperwork before the associates were ready, leading to scrambles when an associate didn't know what to in their assigned area, or short staffing because a person didn't really know how to contribute to the team and needed more teaching. Such issues were few and far between, but became a stressful factor in new hires and changes in schedules. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera Bread, I worked there while living with my parents and helping my mom take care of my sick dad. The managers were very helpful and willing to work with my schedule so that I could be at home while my mom was at work to care for my dad. My coworkers were always friendly and even now when i go in there we share news of our lives and have a laugh. The only reason I left was to continue my education in Pensacola, FL."
good,Panera was a great energetic work environment. The management was excellent and the employees were very helpful.
good,This was my first real job and I loved it. The people was great it took dealing with so many diffrent people was fun. Tasting the new food that would be featured was cool. managers were the best very understanding and helped out when the store would be very busy.
good,"I started at Panera Bread back in August 2006 about a month after turning 16 and being able to work.  This was the first job that I had and could not have asked for a better place to start.  Working at Panera Bread taught me a lot in terms of not only working hard but also as a team.  During the 6 years that I worked for Panera, I was able to move around to different locations when I went off to college which was comforting to know that I was able to get a job upon arriving at Kent State University.  Not only was I able to move to different store locations, but I was also given the opportunity to advance within the company.  Beginning my time at Panera, I held the title of Associate and gradually moved my way up to an Associate Trainer.  From this position I was given the opportunity to advance again to a Shift Supervisor.  As a Shift Supervisor, I held the responsibility of running shifts, opening and closing the store, as well as balancing the safe at the end of each shift."
good,I love panera bread company learned a great deal from them and super team work from generalmanger to dishwasher love it!
good,Very fun and professional workplace. Very out going and organized place
good,"You have to be able to manage yourself and your time well. That being said, you get to make your own hours. My typical day is 7:00am to 3:00pm. However, I have days where I am there from 5:00am to 4:00 or 5:00pm that all depends on your catering orders for that day. You are on constant deadlines, all of your catering orders need to be executed and on time and some days you may have $1500 to $2500 just in catering orders and every single order needs to get made and delivered on time, and that all falls on you and your organization and getting it done. There are some really great people that work there, from management to associates. Of course every store is different. The pay is pretty good, but raises are far and in between, and not much when you actually get one. The plus side is you make hourly, tips, and commission on your catering sales."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Great Managment. Fast pace enviroment.
good,"great bread baked daily, healthy alternative to the fast food world"
good,"Assisted in taking orders, provided help to customers, Cleaning the kitchen and dining areas."
good,The entire time I worked there we were short staffed and over worked. I was struggling to keep up with my school work. A typical day at work for me was stressful and always busy. I loved all of my managers and my co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Working at panera Bread was a pleasure. There is penlty of opportunity for growth. Managment is amazing and everyone is a there treats each other like family.
good,"Panera is the happiest most family oriented company I've ever work for. No problem is too big or too small and upper management is constantly working to make improvements. Working in customer service could be rough at times, but the company's goal was to stick with it until the associate was totally satisfied. So, at the end of the day it was great to be able to help people."
good,I loved the atmosphere and my co workers. It was a fun fast paced job. I always got alot of hours and there was opportunity for advancement.
good,"while working here i have made lifelong friends, i enjoyed interacting with the customers. i learned a lot about how all the baked goods were made and made a lot of them myself."
good,"Great teamwork good experience, environment of people working with each other making customers happy restaurant with great service and food"
good,Normally I would come to work and review the task chart. Go to my assigned station and begin work.
good,I enjoy working there for the employees as well as getting to make interpersonal connections with customers.
good,A typical day at work would be customer service. I learned a better way to order and project for sales/weather and events going on around the location(s). I learned more about baking.
good,"I usually work the line during the week and work line set up during the weekends, early shifts so i can get out early in the day and still have time during the day to be with family or friends. I learned that not every job is easy..u got to know what u are doing. The management was awesome, I loved my managers. My co workers were great, we always worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was when u have a breakfest, lunch or dinner rush it could get crazy but u got to stay at a fast paced. I enjoyed everything about my job i loved"
good,"Panera Bread is a job that is very laid back, its a very calm and fun place to work."
good,"Overall a great place to work, working with your supervisors and having imput on ideas to help run the stores better"
good,The customer to employee balance is fantastic and is an overall great place to work
good,I really enjoyed working here but I had to move and other things were going on so I had to move on.
good,"While I worked at Panera, I can honestly say I had fun. Management"
good,I love working with this company they always take customers opinion first and foremost they help employees out when needed they help with any problems when crew needs it
good,"I loved my management. I loved my coworkers. The job itself was fun. I loved the smell of fresh baked cookies. I worked there for over a year. I started to recognize costumers, and seeing their smiling faces was my favorite part of my day. My Panera coworkers and customers were my family."
good,All around a wonderful  place and great bosses and they care for their workers and not a hard job.  Remembering items on the menu and food items ingredients.
good,"Panera family, it is exactly that, a family. Everybody is friendly with each other, there is no drama, pretty much all of the associates get alone very well and we all look forward everyone success. Managers are very comprehending of every life situation, they are down to earth. Overall it is a great company to work for."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Loved working here. Lots of different options in working hours. From 5 am to 10 pm. I literally loved my regulars and my coworkers all became friends very quickly. Management isn't always the greatest but I think they have weeded out the less than admirable ones and replaced them!
good,It was not that hard I was happy to work there and be a part of them I just want to better my self and move on to big things . and I want to start with yall
good,You work third shift. You can have alot of time for breaks if you keep up with your nightly duties. Bosses are strict but mean well if you do your job and report any on work problems with the bakes to them.
good,"I was able to learn a lot about baking and other aspects of cooking which I was not previously aware of.  I also responsible for strict quality control and able to deliver a pleasant dining experience to customers with my food.  The hardest part of the job was being under pressure to not make any errors, as there was limited supplies."
good,When learning new roles they took their time with making sure doing everything correctly. Not just for their sake but to make me a better worker outside in general. Also Scheduling and management was in my opinion pretty fair.
good,Panera bread was a great experience I can say without a doubt that this was my overall favorite job. They staff were all friendly and helpful worked with you to ensure you are comfortable and able to learn your station both effectively and efficiently.
good,"This company has a face paced business and you have to be alert and ready to grind the entire day. The management team is good people,  your training is hands on and you do get  to eat a meal there you have employee discounts."
good,"Pretty enjoyable place to work at overall. The managers are the best I've had in comparison to other jobs I've had. During times where I struggled in my position, I've always been given some form of support to help me get through rushes. I've learned how to work with people more because I was a server and it requires lots of customer service skills."
good,"I love the team work and feeling included by the managers. Training is amazing.  Load of options to move around from within or store to store.  Employees get tip fringe, 65% meal discount,  uniform,  shoes for crews, free beverages throughout shift and the list goes on. Amazing company!"
good,Work with Panera bread for about a year  it was a great job good pay and excellent schedule for home and work I really enjoyed that only left Because I moved to Austin
good,"The hardest part of this job was repetitiveness of some tasks."
good,"It may be fast paced, but like The Budd Group, I would highly recommend working here. Great atmosphere, mostly friendly staff, somewhat decent pay, and very little work involved in the kitchen. As long as you can make a sandwich in under 5 minutes, someone else would thrive here definitely."
good,I deliver at Panera so I depend on tips to get over minimum wage. It is fun and everyone is very friendly. The hours are perfect for me...usually 10-3 during the busy lunch hour. But if you really need the money you wont make it working part-time.
good,It was always nice going into work for Panera. The staff was encouraged to have a good time and be friendly and no work place bulling was ever tolerated. The staff and management where always friendly made sure that this was forwarded to the customer as well as other employees.
good,Overall this is a really great place to work. The work place was very supportive. I loved the coworkers I worked with. This was a very fast pace environment but I preferred that so that I always had something to do. The only downside to Panera is that they don’t really work with your schedule and I wasn’t given a real training but no one is really. I only quit because of the management but this is a great job and I would return if the opportunity presented itself
good,"I started my day at 530, which is their opening time, I sat up the tables and then made breakfast orders. It was very fast paced and everyone did a great job of working together. Wonderful establishment and great food!"
good,Stuck with this job for a very long time. great place to work with great employees! always looked forward to coming to work and having fun. definitely learned a lot and have a variety of experience from working for this company!
good,"A typical day included taking orders, cleaning the dining room, and closing activities were cleaning and closing up the bakery. Overall, since it was a down season, working with friendly individuals made the job more enjoyable. The job is not hard or requiring of much, just be willing to learn."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Would recommend as a first job to someone. Can be fast paced only if you are working in the kitchen but if you are cashier or in the dining room it’s pretty relaxed unless there’s a rush.
good,"The gm is the best manager i have ever had, flexable with hours. Panera was a really awesome company to work for. I would definitely go back. 30 percent discount."
good,"I think they have too much busy work. It would be nice to be able to do your job without having to do books, send reports that is completely viewable by the higher ups."
good,"Just need to make more money; it will require you to work positions. Corporation needs to open in Houston, too many franchises. Corporations have a lot more structure and stability."
good,Panera has healthy food  clean environment. Great benefits. Great place to work.    Corporate is available for other positions. You will feel at home.
good,"I was thrilled when i got the job at panera bread, Not only for the discounts but because the working environment was lovely. I had little to no complaints about the tasks i had to accomplish. But my last manager did make my taste for the job sour."
good,"Management was fair and fellow employees have your back. Always stay busy, there is something to do, even when it is slow......................................................................."
good,I loved my time at Panera Bread. I loved what the company stands for and the growth paths available. I was given more than one option to grow with the company and build a career with fair compensation.
good,"Working for Panera, I learned more about different cultures and more about each guest that came in. Knowing everyone has something going on in their lives and for that 5-10 minutes, just conversating and learning their background was interesting to me."
good,Panera Bread is a store that has high expectations. We were held to a high standard because the store is a corporation. We had days where the rushes were fast-paced and we all had to work as a team.
good,"I love working for this company, my baking manager is a great person. He shows concern for my life outside of the work environment.The pay could be better for bakers because I believe we play a major role in producty."
good,Like the work environment. Deal with the public everyday. Great management team. Great team work environment. Customer make you feel like family. Love the beautiful scenery.
good,"For anyone who wants to work night shift, ready for responsibility, gives attention to detail and thrives in a solo work environment, then overnight Baker position is for you. I had to sadly leave. I would never have other wise. Good pay. Good manger. Good culture."
good,"I loved working here, great team. Great customers. Very busy but I like a busy work area. Very professional and fair about all work decions regarding you or anything else."
good,Learned skills and enhanced my work experience. Morals and values are what makes the environment good to work in occasionally you’ll have a certain few coworkers you don’t personally like however keep personal and business relations separate and you’ll be fine
good,I absolutely loved working here.  The other employees were amazing people who made working here absolute a joy.  Also the food we made was fantastic and tasted great.
good,"I was only there for a brief time. My dad had aggressive cancer, and needed aggressive chemo. I was the only one at the time that could drive him, and run his household. I enjoyed the customers, the fellow employees, and management. I would work there again in a heartbeat, if they would let me."
good,Enjoyed every part of it great teamwork except for two managers who weren’t empathetic and kind. Other than that it was a great experience to have a job there.
good,"Base pay at my location (Macon) starts at 8 or 9 per hour for most positions, but daily tips are factored into the paychecks, putting it closer to $10-$11/hr most days. Breaks are a minimum of 30 minutes for every 5 hours worked. Schedule flexibility is ultimately between you and the manager, but you can set your available hours through the online portal. Benefits are decent. I qualified for a promotion after working 1 year and being recommended for the trainer position by the other trainers."
good,Panera is a very cool place to work. It was my first job and I could not imagine a better start to my work experience. From the first day until now I have always felt welcomed and appreciated at Panera. The people are so friendly and helpful that it makes new employees want to go to work.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"If you are young and motivated into doing your job, Panera will reward you if you are under the right manager. They believe in getting their managers within their ranks. You must buy into their system and they will be watching. They have cameras everywhere and they review them. Teams and individuals will be worked and they like their cafes clean. They like for their employees to be cross trained too."
good,"Overall, i had a good experience working at Panera. Management was nice.if you have trouble in one area the employees or mangers help you to make sure you get it right."
good,"Panera is such a wonderful place to work if you are still trying to figure yourself out. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, if I was the type of person always looking to be better or just be me. Panera was good to me. My managers always encouraged me to be better and I learned a lot about the company and food safety and myself while I was here."
good,Personally Panera has been one of the best experience I have ever had. This job has taught me many rights and wrongs. I have learned many things through out time on working at Panera. I have also grew to become better since the very first day I was hired.
good,"Worked at this place temporarily, looking for a new job now. Management is pretty relaxed and is not incredibly strict on rules as long as you follow them most times,"
good,"There are a few different positions you may have, including dishwasher, food maker, food prepper, cashier, or dining room upkeep positions. I loved this position because everyone treated one another very well and it was a welcoming environment to work in. Everyone was treated fairly and ultimately the company looked out for what's best for it's customers AND it's employees. The hardest part of the job would probably just be to keep a good pace on all your work so you do not fall behind. Overall, it's a great place and I loved the experience."
good,Great working as a team and getting things done. There was gossip but that could be ignored long as you did your work. Laid back and fun work setting to achieve goals.
good,Loved being a night baker.  Kept busy all night.  It got scary sometimes when you were there by yourself.  But other than that it was great.  Paid training for 6 weeks.  Checks were great.
good,"I enjoy working at panera . It does not make me uncomfortable as I do my job, it makes me want to work harder and become better. Working at panera is not a very hard job to me because the work that has to be done is easy and I am very quick at learning something ."
good,"Top notch at my store. I’m retired and this is the perfect place for me. The managers here are awesome. They don’t ask you to do anything that they wouldn’t do. Flexible schedule is an understatement. After an emergency health issue I had where I had to miss a few weeks my job was there waiting for me. They made sure I didn’t overdo it. Love the delivery, love working inside, love the job. Great managers, great coworkers and I plan to stay here for a long time."
good,"Good place to work, In a freezer all day stacking bagels I just didnt see myself being there, i like hard work, Need to work with equipment. But other than that easy laid off work."
good,the people that work at Panera are really helpful. the management is really friendly and welcoming. you get proper training. it is a great place to work.
good,Difficult to advance in wages and in job status but if you’re looking for a low paying first job this is a great part time job! Highly recommend to anyone
good,"Work/Life balance is good, company culture is the best I’ve ever experienced, benefits are nothing special but I’d rather have a job with mediocre benefits than no job at all so if they can keep people hired by cutting costs on benefits, fine by me"
good,hard part is leaving you make so many good friends. great managers and very understanding. learned to be a barista and fast paced only during lunch rush.
good,great place to work i loved it but i moved away be. once they starting to cut hours for the 9months that i was there. they provide get customer service and you will be happy once you in there.
good,"Working front of house included taking orders and ring up customers, keeping coffee bar stocked and clean, getting bakery treats and bagels ready, and light cleaning. I loved everyone that I worked with and they made the day go by so fast."
good,"Panera is a job for those in school, paying bills, etc. If you enjoy the idea of a café-casual food style this is the place for you. Panera Bread exceeds industry quality, and portrays its rich identifiable culture through the world."
good,Good workplace good environment fantastic benefits as well as plenty of room to grow and develop while striving to be promoted.  However customer base is stressful at times
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"Had to learn patience dealing with customers , I’ve grown so much over these last 3years . This job was definitely an life learned experience. Not somewhere I wanted to be forever. I’m truly looking forward to getting a call from you guys to be apart of your crew ."
good,It’s an ok place to be working at nothing to complain about pay is a little low they kinda take advantage of that minimum wage food is great nothing bad to say
good,Fun start work early and get off early.  Most co-workers are in good moods.  The food is absolutely delicious. Love the regulars that come into the shop.
good,Working there was very fun because you could interact with your coworkers while still getting the work done and being able to talk with the customers.
good,Panera Bread is an amazing place to work for. The managers and higher ups truly do care for the employees. They will bend over back wards to work around with your schedule.
good,"Panera Bread is a fast pace restaurant that makes gourmet food on a fast food speed. This cafe location taught me how to use a drive-thru and helped me understand the new changes they have made to the cafe.The management at this location is exceptional and wonderful. They are proficient at their job and show a great"
good,"This was my first job. I started when I was 16. I can't say much about the pay, as I was earning Pennsylvania's minimum wage at the time which wasn't much. I liked the managers and the people I worked with. They gave me the opportunity to become a certified trainer which I really loved. I felt respected and needed there."
good,"A typical day at work involved joking around with crew members, while also getting work done. I learned many new life skills, and would I would love to use the skills I learned there at my next job. Management was quite nice, and I'd recommend for people to apply to a Panera for an entry level job. The hardest part of the job would probably be, in my opinion, was the drive-thru. This job was actually quite easy to do. The most enjoyable part of the job would be my coworkers."
good,"my first job, a new location had just opened up and they were hiring people with potential. I was selected and had an absolutely amazing time working there, my manager even picked me up from my house once, when i was unable to get a ride. They are as dedicated to you as you are to them. -Kiya D."
good,"I loved my job at Panera mostly because of the people I worked with. They made it a fun environment. Even when I had to buckle down and clean and do work, it was still a good time."
good,The overall atmosphere makes for a great place to work. There are many different positions you can work. I received a 50% discount. Well organized system.
good,Blue Ridge Bread company was one off the best franchises I have ever worked for.  They took very good cafe of their managers and employees on a consistent basis.
good,"Overall, I enjoyed working for Panera Bread as a catering coordinator. However, it wasn't an easy job. You have to be organized, fast, and well aware of your time. Time management was probably the most important and difficult aspect of being a successful catering coordinator. The most enjoyable part of my job was definitely making my clients happy and getting really great feedback from them and their experience with me. I learned a lot from working at Panera Bread. I learned that I just needed to believe and trust myself and communicate with my managers and my clients. I don't regret working at Panera Bread for a year. However, I just need change and better hourly wage."
good,"There is great opportunity to advance your position at Panera. "
good,"People are the difference when working at Panera. I work with an amazing group of associates and although it is a stressful environment, making modifications and getting the food to the customer that is not only delicious but eye appealing; having fun while doing it makes all the difference. This is a great place to work!"
good,A typical day at Panera is super flow and usually in and out with deliveries since I am a delivery driver. I've learned communication and team work! Very understanding people.
good,I love my job as well as the staff and management. Fun job and everyone is easy to work with I tell others to go work there. nothing else to say if you want a job come see us
good,"Panera Bread has been an awesome company to work for. I especially appreciate the transparency & Open communication. I feel like my feedback has value. I feel a sense of belonging within a huge organization,  There's a give an take in communication and it tends to break down hurdles.  I also feel a sense of work-life balance.  I believe this improves my job performance as well as my peers.  I don't feel like I'm overlooking other areas of my life that are, if not more important than work.  The company has stepped up their training and development as well. I feel like I have added value from all the additional training that I'm receiving.  They've created a clear roadmap and it's helpful.  Panera is focused on developing our Hard and Soft skills.  They also recognize Hard Work which creates positive moral and strong team spirit."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,loved working there friendly staff and management and clean environment Training was efficient flexible hours and good pay Always availability to move up in the company
good,To be honest I liked working at this job because when it was the busiest time of the day that was the most fun and hectic and memorable time I had at this job! Hard work was the key to making the day go by fast and exciting.
good,Team Environment. Work is fast paced. But pay is competitive. Work hours are flexible and management is reasonably and efficient. This job is for does who like to work hard as a team and like to serve others.
good,Your own your feet working moving around interacting with customers maybe making food or taking orders or even working in the back there's a job for everyone here
good,"Being a delivery driver at Panera bread was a very relaxing, fun paced job. As soon as I clocked in I would already have an order or two to take and I would just be on the move the whole shift. The management at Panera Bread is fantastic, they made it not even feel like work. The culture of Panera bread is very different from any other fast food place, a lot of business people come in there to host meetings. The hardest part about being a delivery driver is not being able to find the house you're delivering to, sometimes the GPS is a street or two off and it makes you late on the order. The most enjoyable part of the job was driving all over the city and learning back ways to everything."
good,Good experience between working with customers to working with co-workers.  Management cared about the staff and did everything possible to make it easy to work.  This is a good company to work for and treatment of employees is above average.
good,"clean and healthy environment to work in. you are trained and prepared well to work there, management is good, they genuinely care for their workers. overall and enjoyable place to work."
good,Friendly co-workers; Always have your back. Bakers were awesome as well. Room for advancement fairly quickly. Just be honest and make sure you do your job right. It's a great starter job.
good,when you first start everything seems hard and makes you nervous but once you get the hang of things everything just swings by easily i loved working at Panera and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent paying fun job.
good,"Was a manager at other restaurants, but got hired on as a manager for panera. This company is a fun and easy going company to work for. You can go to any of the upper management in the company with anything. It's a family oriented group of people."
good,I learned the basics on the proper building of the salads and sandwiches. I loved all my managers and coworkers. Panera really made it feel like my second home. I had a great support system there especially during the time my grandmother passed away.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Panera bread is everyone is happy and got along. the managers was very understandable when it comes to certain life situations and it gets very busy downtown which means more hours and more money.
good,The management at place is amazing. The people you work with become more like family. The thing I enjoyed the most about working for owner bread was the people.
good,The environment was really welcoming during the time that I worked at Panera. My managers were very helpful and easy to communicate with and also didn't make this being my first job uncomfortable. The hardest part would just keeping your patience with rude customers but the most enjoyable part is building friendships with pretty cool people and getting to know frequent customers.
good,Its awesome you will enjoy working under good and happy managers along with great associates who love to help your every move. Wrk hard and you will have nothing to complain about
good,It is a great place to work. The people are nice and they can work around your time if need be. My only complaint is that only the people they are friends with get the chance at becoming a manager and up.
good,To work a Panera bread you have to be very responsible with the time that you have to be at the job and also you have to be reasonable with your position.
good,"The staff at every location is always so inviting, the food is always amazing and its never overwhelming or too much happening at once. The company itself really strives to be as inviting as they possibly can."
good,"Environment is great, including management, they are also very understandable when writing up the schedule they will work around your schedule, which most jobs don't."
good,Panera for me was a good gig back in highschool before I joined the Army. The setting was very relaxed and fun. I enjoyed it while I was there. Great crew.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera Bread is laid back and has a nice atmosphere. pretty cool place to work. it was only a part time job for me but they were extremely flexible and mindful.
good,"The hardest part about working at Panera is having several bosses. This provides an excellent amount of potential training and development, but can also lead to communication problems. As long as you adapt quickly to an ever growing and changing environment you will find success. The best customer service training program in the food game. ""Be a constant learner and get the tough stuff done with optimism and mastery."" Words to live by in the customer service world. There is comfort in the routine found in each position, but you never feel stuck in a rut because you have constant direct authentic connections with your guests. You will feel apart of the Panera family very quickly and that's a hard thing to walk away from."
good,"Great first job to work at and to grow as a person. The work load is definetly do-able, and moving up through the franchise can be accomplished through hard work."
good,Fast pace and great opportunity in obtaining management skills.  Seeing regular customers.  Menu changes to create more interest and changes for seasonal  favorites.
good,"I enjoyed the Staff and Customer's it's a really relaxed,  fair, friendly workplace..You receive a 65% on Food items...If you needed a day off or something came up they were willing to allow someone to work in your place or they'd find away. You could possibly choose your availability..Excellence on food menu I would recommend others to work at Panera Bread."
good,I loved this job so much I have nothing bad to say other than one of the general managers should really take certain situations into consideration before letting someone lose their job.
good,Only thing I didn't like was the rotating hours every week.  It's hard to make plans when your schedule is different each week meaning prior planning is impossible.
good,I worked with this place for three years and I love the food and atmosphere but my boss was just far too obnoxious. The pay rate there wasn't much to live on and the hours were just too minimal for me.
good,I have called Breads of the World my second home for 19+ years.  They are currently being acquired by another franchise of Panera Bread and will be dissolving as a company.
good,"Panera is a great place to work as a college student; hours are flexible and the managers and other employees take you in and treat you like family. It is also really easy to transfer to another location if you need to, for example going home for the summer. I have really enjoyed working here!"
good,I had so much fun working at Panera. There was never any down time but you do get a little break. I learned a lot about food safety and customer service. The hardest part of the job is running around for 8 hours straight;
good,"I loved working here, it was too fast for me at first, but most of the employees were so nice/helpful. I moved up pretty quickly to certified trainer!"
good,Good job loved it I would go back to work there if I ever move back good work place to make into a career people were friendly caring and felt like a family
good,I had just moved to the area and the management hired me right away. The hours worked really well with my school schedule.. I learned a lot about food safety at this job. The management was incredible. The people there were like family
good,"Busy"
good,"Shifts were 4 days on 3 off so that is great.  You got to work alone most nights except for the overlap day.  So you could listen to music, movies or books on tape.  Very good health insurance and 401k.  aid leave was descent and bonuses were pretty good to.  I worked with them for 8 years and would probably still be there if I did not move to Alaska."
good,"a good teamwork job and good paying job for a first time job. i had lost of fun working with different people and having different people come in to eat. I got to work with old peers from middle school witch was fun, ii also got to meet new people and a good paying job. You have to be on the lookout because you have to be prepared for lunch-rush or morning -rush the busiest times off the day."
good,"- Typical Day goes by very quickly, plenty to learn and do"
good,"After a few months working at Panera I was able to score a set schedule; I work early shifts, and get the weekends off! I love greeting all of the customers, whether they be regulars, or people I will never see again. There is no hard part to my job; it is the same procedures every day which make it very comfortable."
good,"This jobs keeps you on your toes and trains you to work in a very fast placed environment, while keeping consistency in everything product sent to a guest."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"At panera bread one of the best things that it has is the people and how they work as team players. We all"
good,"I enjoy the customer aspect of Panera, the involvement with the guests and relationships I have made over the 10 years. My days run together, have been doing the same thing for 6 years as my main AOR, I understand that it is their way of saying I am good at it, but in my personal reviews I do on myself, they seem to fall on deaf ears. I want more, I am a sponge, but the company is a great place to work, I am not downing them at all!"
good,"Good first job, very busy and quick paced environment. I enjoyed working here for the most part but at times it could be stressful.  I was a barista and cashier which was easy and probably the best job out of all of the positions at Panera"
good,"I never worked a part  time job where you were so valued by management! On my first day and in successive shifts, I was made to feel that my being there was important. Easy to bond with all staff members, everyone pitches in to help each other. Diverse ages of staff working together and  a lot of respect for the older workers.  Management hops in during busy times and they set a fine example of the high standards of this company. Many youthful lower management makes a good blend."
good,Panera is a great place to work. It has a variety of benefits and has a relaxing environment. Only downfall to this job is there really isn't many working hours.
good,This was my first job ever and my favorite job thus far because everyone was like a family and we all looked out for each other and helped out. I enjoyed the conversations that I have had with co-workers and the customers. And I have made some of my best friends working here.
good,I absolutely loved working for Panera Bread! The compensation was excellent and so were the discounts. There are clear instructions on how you can advance and earn more with the company. Even though its a corporation you feel as though you're working with your family and people who want to continuously see you grow!
good,I would start my day by greeting all my employees and then reviewing all notes from the other managers. Then I would go and see what tasks I would need to complete and direct certain people to complete certain tasks. Throughout the day I would make sure all breaks where taken at certain times and for a closing shift I would make sure all admins work and tasks where complete.
good,"If you're fresh out of baking/culinary courses Panera is a great place to stretch your wings and get a feel for the bakers life. Just be prepared for the over night baking hours, which are 11pm-8am and a total social life killer. Great pay for a great job."
good,I learn that I can treat people with respect and give them the best of customer service. And I also learn how to handle angry customer in any situation that come my way.
good,I enjoyed working at Panera. My manager was very understanding and would listen to any and all concerns I may have had. Very flexible with my school hours and sports.
good,Great company to begin with. Management takes things serious when it comes to the work environment like needed. Employees become like family and the work environment is an oasis.
good,"I have worked at a number of different establishments both fast food and restaurant this was one of my favorite places to work. All the staff was smiling and happy and we all worked as a team. My favorite part about working for Panera Bread was their dedication to their service. When i worked there it was like making lunch for my family. If someone didn't like what they were eating we would fix it. Not only was the service spot on but the product they sell makes me even more enthusiastic. They provide healthy food that you want to eat because not only does it taste good it makes you feel good. The work style was like that of almost any fast food. Assembly line, drive thru, cashiers, dishwashers, and food preparation pretty basic. The hardest part of the job for me as the store opener was just getting up on time, otherwise if you have any sort of work ethic it is simple. There are not any cons other than that and all the pros i should have covered."
good,"This is the perfect job if you are in school and need a flexible schedule. They offer overtime, paid time off, and annual raises. This is a extremely fast-paced job and you will have to multitask."
good,"Not as stressful as a fast food job. Consequently, more customer-oriented and personable. Lots of opportunities for advancement and skill expansion through cross-training. Good training regimens."
good,"I started at Bread Company when I was 18. I enjoyed every moment of it. The managers worked really well with my personal life schedule (sports, etc.). I quickly advanced to an associate trainer and had opportunities to apply for management positions as time went on. I would highly recommend applying for a position at St. Louis Bread Company. They make it easy to relocate and transfer from one location to another."
good,its really nothing i can tell you working for them was a good experience you would have to see for yourself i have nothing bad to say one of my favorite jobs
good,"I really liked working at this place, it was fast and challenging and the associates worked together to make it a great place to work.  The manager was excellent with working with the employees with time schedule issues, and easy to communicate with. I worked early and that was good with my schedule for other things that i needed to do.  One has to catch on fast in this job but it was a satisfying experience for me."
good,Being a cashier at panera bread gives you the opportunity to interact with customers on a regular basis which gives you an overall positive experiene.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"So many regulars come in on a daily basis, you get to build a connection with them and build trust. Everyone has a good time at work and keeps a positive attitude even under stress. Being located in the mall, high school employees see many of their friends all the time."
good,"I enjoyed the food here as well as the people I worked with. Sometimes I would serve the food to different customers or cook the soup, it was fun but overall messy."
good,I loved working here because I love serving guest at a fast rate and being able to interact with a variety of guests and serve them. I was able to help create a restaurant environment  within a fastfood chain restaurant.
good,My work night is a full night. You have to make sure you have everything out on time before 5am. The managers are very nice to work with. Everyday you learn something new and l like that. I train new bakers also.
good,Panera was a friendly and relaxed culture that allows you to grow not only with yourself but with the company with the hands on meetings and emphasis on team work
good,Has a company standard for overall culture and experience that is one of the highest in the industry.  Improved my multi-tasking abilities.  Good balance for quality of life outside the business.
good,"Overall a pretty good experience working with Panera, made plenty of friends and learned how to be a barista and keep clean in the kitchen. Love the fact that they always tried something new when it comes to the food."
good,"This is a job I had dreamed about at night, and one I dreamed and pictured myself doing for a long time. When it came down to my last day, due to a family member being sick and me being the only one and the best one who could take care of them, it was the hardest thing for me. I loved what I did at Panera, I was an Shift Supervisor, it was very rewarding, I loved getting to interact with customers everyday, getting to be a part of peoples smiles! The staff was amazing as well, we had a great staff that really worked as a team. We could get through a rush together with no problems, and when there were problems we still made it through together."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working with Panera. I learned how to balance my time while working and having managers who are willing to help along the way has been amazing. The best part of the job is that we have fun while getting our work done. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers, the good and the bad. The managers were respectful; coworkers were very fun. The average day was definitely fast-paced, but it was a great mix of interacting with coworker-friends and meeting and chatting with kind, funny customers. Of course, not all were super kind, but the good always outweighed the bad. The hardest part of the job was obviously those few hard customers, but when you're surrounded by your friends, you quickly get over it."
good,"Panera is a strong company to work for, they are also family orientated. Panera is a very busy cafe and can become stressful at times. The best part of working for the company are the relationships you create with your co-workers and the customers."
good,"For quality of life, this is the place to work! The scheduling is great, the teams are supportive. Plenty of laughing and fun times spent working with this company."
good,I enjoyed working with the company. They really seem to care about you genuinely and make sure you have all the tools to succeed in the company. The only problem is when you go into a new store to help it almost feels like there is no direction given and you feel lost.
good,"Great place to work, good people to work with.  Demanding job in terms of attention to detail, but that is what makes Panera so successful.  Like and food service job work/life is tough, but better then most."
good,"panera bread was my first job in high school and i moved from associate to trainer to catering. very happy and always on my feet, meet lots of people and went from part time to full time"
good,One of the most reliable places to work for. Very helpful for all the basic needs of any worker who needs a job that is friendly well worked and more than the average job.
good,"Must be able to multi task, easy to work your way up . Good training system. Management allows you to cross train to further your knowledge of the company"
good,Panera is a healthy and positive work environment. All of the staff are friendly from cashiers to general management. There are many opportunities for advancement.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I loved working at Panera. The staff was wonderful. The trainer was wonderful. My schedule fluctuated from time to time, but was manageable. Left this great job when a new, very lazy and bossy manager came and replaced one of the best managers I have ever had. Very upset when she left, and had issues with new manager.."
good,"I am currently working here and it's a good environment the management and customers are great. You get a chance to work everywhere as in the register, dining room, line and dish. But of course there is training. They have flexible hours for students and others."
good,"This is a great place to work for, for anyone looking for part time or full time opportunities. They have benefits for part time employees and the schedule if very flexible"
good,"Panera is a great company to work for. They paid everyone extremely fairly at my store and the managers made sure we knew their door was always open. Panera donates all of their baked goods at the end of the night, that was my favorite thing about the company."
good,I learned how to consolidate and how to work as a team fact paced and be a team leader without making myself seem more important or more valued then other employees. Employees were all nice and had no problems with anybody. Management was great. They  always made sure to show appreciation to the employees that worked hard and made sure they coached the employees that didn't fully understand the job.
good,"Awesome staff, awesome working environment I love it . I'd recommend working here any position you'd like to anyone. Then think about it you not just working towards salary, you workin towards a new clean foods... No artificial flavors or preservatives."
good,It's alright.  The customers are always nice. Management is flexible and there is an abundance of hours. The company itself cares about the people who work for them.
good,Your day starts with breakfast which is usually not that bad depending on the day of the week but lunch is pretty fast with a lot of orders. It all works out though because you have some people that do embrace the aspect of team work
good,Working as a line cook at Panera was a good experience. I prepared each order in 5 minutes or less so the customer can enjoy their quality meal in a timely manner. I learned how to work quickly and efficiently under a time crunch and I also learned to take initiative and do other tasks when no customers were in the store. Management taught me how to do my job well and the workplace environment was good. All workers got along and were friendly to the customers. The hardest part of the job was being able to prepare multiple orders within a 5 minute time limit. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smile on the customer's faces as I served them their food.
good,"a day at work would be fun getting to prepare food with fresh condiments ."
good,Uma das melhores empresas em que já trabalhei no ramo de alimentação.
good,Working at Panera was one of my favorite jobs that I have had so far. It's fun and always upbeat. There's great benefits as well as pay for a high school/college student and you also get tips.
good,"I typically go in with a full staff ready to work. No one complain and everyone is mature. Before I approach my station, 9 out of 10 my station is stocked and clean. Friendly employers and employees. We all became friends and conversation is easy. Customers are generally friendly and very sociable. The management team is really good. Of course there are some shortcoming such as not having enough employees on the line, but I and my production line associates learned to adapt and work together to cover the missing person spot as best as we can. The hardest part of the job is staying calm during rush hours. They can be very hectic and if you are not prepared, you can fall behind easily. The most enjoyable part of the work is being able to work with other mature employers like myself and serve customers."

good,Overall a good company to work for.  There's a lot to learn with this company due to its large menu size and products they offer.  I would recommend working here.
good,"Benefits are okay for entry level. Hard and very time consuming trying to move up from within the company. While they do promote within it takes time to work through. Competitive and benefits. Management was always really nice, listens and tries to assist as best they can in personal concerns. Each location is like a family."
good,"It was a lot of fun to work here! We had the opportunity to learn everything that it takes to run the store, and worked together as a team through everything!"
good,"I worked in a fast pace environment dealing with many customers, making sure that everything done is kept track of and that every product is well stocked presented. I was trained in barista, cashier and dining room to be the most comprehensive worker. Everyone is extremely friendly and the we had a family type culture which I love"
good,"Greeting customers is the most important thing we do at Panera. "
good,I worked at Panera for over a year during high school. The people were great there and the restaurant was always busy which is how I like to work. I didn't have any issues with the work or anyone that I worked with. It was a great first job and growing experience for me.
good,"A very fast pace job that requires an associate to learn at a fast pace and keep up with a changing menu. A long training time but, long breaks and flexible hours."
good,A typical day at work would be very fast past especially near breakfast lunch and dinner lots of work party's to prep for this was one of my frist jobs so I think it defiantly was a learning experience good place to start but also has room for advancement
good,Fun place to work. Great benefits. Employee discounts. Great place for advancement. The hardest part was working third shift and not really having a life outside of work.
good,Overall a great location to work at. Great area for advancement and to learn to skills in the industry. Its very hands on and allows for you to grow in your skills
good,"The most exciting part of the job was when it was lunch rush, it was tough and difficult to keep up, but after that last rush customer comes through you just get this rush of accomplishment."
good,This was a wonderful place to work. I had an early morning shift and the manager was always there and always cheerful even at six in the morning. The managers and senior employees were so helpful and always willing to help me learn my responsibilities. It was a very friendly and customer service oriented workplace. I truly loved the workplace and I enjoyed going to work every day.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Panera was a great starter job. There is not much room to advance in the company. Its really depends on who likes you. But with this company if you do things right and by the book it will not go unnoticed
good,"You coming clock in and work with google. I myself did dish washing"
good,Always something to be doing and I learned all the positions at panera while working there. We became very short staffed so I learned to work really well under pressure.
good,a typical day at work is fun and exciting. co-workers are friendly and helpful. management is cool they care about you and make sure you are doing what you suppose to do.
good,I really enjoyed this job. It was very friendly and welcoming when i first began there. They offered advancement opportunities and they were very flexible with hours.
good,"I can safely say my job at Panera was the best job I've had yet. I worked closing shifts, mostly on drive through and barista stations. I was efficiently trained in a matter of a couple weeks, and the fast-paced environment made my shifts go by quickly. Some of my favorite parts of working were when I made a customer happy by greeting them with a smile at the drive through, getting their order out quickly, or creating a coffee drink or smoothie that looked delicious and appetizing. I also made some great friends while working here - everyone is very friendly!"
good,"Before you even go to training, you go to a short orientation that perfectly displays the company, what they're there to do, and who they aren't heart. Following that, you have an abundance of training to ensure that you are ready for the job. You are paid for all training and they pay very well, at that. Very friendly company and overall, a great place to work."
good,Panera is a great company that offers a lot in terms of work/life balance and opportunity for growth. Every Panera I have worked at has had a sense of family with their staff. Everyone is welcome and works together seamlessly.
good,"My boss was great. my coworkers were great. "
good,"panera was an overall great place to work. everyone was very welcoming and very nice. the hardest art of the job was just getting rid of such a long line but was always done. i liked everyone that i worked with, including manger."
good,"This job was fun, and i enjoyed it. Would come in the morning and make sure the display case was clean and see what I needed to make for the first bake. Warm up baguettes for customers and the front line for lunch and dinner. Later in the day i would check the front display for the 2nd bake. Then from 3pm to 5pm I'd have to help prep for the night bakers. The management was great. Always willing to help out where they could. My co-workers would help out if they weren't busy, such as helping me sample new pastries."
good,Panera Bread Takes care of their employees and ensures that they are all acknowledged for hard work and dedication. A typical day at Panera consists of friendly faces and building exceptional  customer relations. The staff (management and co-workers) were always willing to help each other or customers whenever there was an issue. They were friendly and hardworking. The most enjoyable part of working at Panera Bread would have to be the company in general. They are a well rounded company. Management always checks in to make sure you and your team are prepared for the day and if you need any help. An amazing company to work for!
good,I loved everything about panera bread. i spent almost 3 years here. i learned everything about customer service and food handling. i learned how to work in a great team atmosphere
good,"During my shift at Panera I was always on the go helping and making sure customers had the best experience. I would take orders, handle money, prepare food, and clean"
good,"From the training program at the beginning to ongoing education, being a manager was fun and fulfilling. I was well-prepared and supported to open, close, and manage all day-parts. Management team and associates worked as a family to serve guests and support each other. Hours were long and not stable, pay for shift was not great. My cafe was uniquely well-managed."
good,"Panera is a great place to grow professionally while having fun at work. Proud to be one of their employees and to have had the chance to grow to a management position, and willing to grow higher until I find a job that fulfills my career."
good,The managers helped you whenever asked sometimes without being asked. They will always make sure you are okay. They will make sure you are fully trained before putting you on the job.
good,Everything about this place was amazing for the top of the management to the employees. I can say you will always be busy.
good,"Panera has been one of the best companies I have ever worked for.  Hours are very flexible, and there is a lot of fun to be had during the job."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I would help customers with their order, complete cash/credit transactions. Help make their experience a wonderful place to come and enjoy a meal and create an oasis. What I learned working there is more patience, even though I already have enough there are certain situations that arise while working there. Seeing how my managers handled the situation and try to resolve the issue taught me management skills I can take later on in life."
good,"A typical day at work would be to walk in at six a.m., and get everything you need for the morning set up. You would make sure you had ice for the juice in the front and make sure your work area is clean. Being new you learned a lot from your co-workers and management and the regulars that came in everyday that walked in ordering there blueberry beagle or hot chocolate. The management was okay but till this day i feel as though they need to work on communication, and there organizational skills. The hardest part of the job was probably lunch rush or closing it got so busy that making sure you were getting everything the customer needed in a 5 min range was difficult making sure it was the right drink anyways. The most enjoyable part of the job was donating to the charity's at the end of the day and having the enjoyment of giving back to the communities."
good,"The days at work were pretty routine. We all knew what our duties were, and we handled them. We made sure to help out anyone who needed it. My co-workers and I got along great. We knew how to utilize our team. Our managers and supervisors knew our strengths and weakness, and did their best to accommodate. The job did not have any difficulties. It was an all around enjoyable job."
good,"I have never enjoyed working for a company as much as this one. The managerial staff is the best one that I have ever experienced. They are not hesitant when it comes to teaching their employees or taking that extra step to make everything run smoothly. This was a work place that felt like a second home and I even wanted to come back after my shift or on days off to eat there or see co-workers. Everyone was also acquaintances outside of work. I have learned from these managers and supervisors very valuable skills for customer service, business ethics and ethics in general. The hardest part about this job was leaving and coming back to school."
good,Panera bread was a great place to work. nice coworkers. it was fun learning about our new food items and trying them out before we sell it to the customers
good,Panera Bread has a great customer following. Best part of the job is the regulars that come in and satisfying new and old customers everyday. Panera changes quite frequently to keep up with new customer needs and wants.
good,"I cashier and get to meet a variety of people. The day starts with setting up the bakery getting the baked goods set up in appealing manner. Then I greet the customers  take their orders, and if need be get their food and beverages for them.  I also help with our vast menu and help people decide what they want by describing items and their ingrediants.  The management is very supportive and flexible.  My coworkers are a varity of ages and we get along well, helping and supporting one another.  The hardest part of my job is the pay which  is not very high and hard to manage.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to talk with the customers."
good,"I have loved working for Panera Bread, its a strong company with good values. They offer great benefits and flexible hours."
good,Panera is a nice place to sit and eat and drink coffee. Even a great place to go and do work or read a book. The food is wonderful there. As far as working it is very fast paced and there is little room for error. I myself worked a possition meant for two people so i had a lot to do.
good,"We are all team workers and worked well together.  It was a very clean place to work.  Although the hours worked were not full time, I wish I could have worked full time."
good,Almost everyday that I work here i almost always end up picking up the slack of others not doing there job correctly. I'm not always as appreciated as I should be.
good,"A typical day at work was to run the cash register, take and expedite guests orders. Or to act as a hostess in the dining area, maintaining a clean and inviting environment for guests."
good,Great Job to work. Great people to work around. Been there for three years
good,very nice coworkers and mangers. out going environment and nice to work with people of diverse  cultures. I learned to work with money and costumers
good,"I knew everything that there was to know in Panera Bread. I would open the food production line. Refilling whatever needed to be refilled, preparing and pre-making Panini's for lunch, keeping the line clean. As breakfast orders came in I would make them under a 3 minute mark and send the customer on their way. As associates would come in for their shifts they would help me out setting up for lunch and continuing to make breakfast orders. As lunch would approach my job was to consolidate. Orders would come up on the screen, orders to go and also to dine-in. I would have to plate the food and have it sent out, 3 minutes being my marked time. making sure associates are on top of the orders, making the right orders and following their modifications. As new hires were welcomed it was also my job to train them on the salad, sandwich, Panini and consolidation on the food line. I would also assist on the cash register when the line got too long. I would also assist serving customers their food as well as in the back of house preparing food and washing dishes"
good,Working for Panera was fun I enjoy  talking to the customers. I got along with management and co-workers. my hardest part was the line. I learn how to clean the dinning and wash dish at the same in timely matter which means i was the only one who could of keep the dish area clean and dinning clean threw rush hour and still help out threw out the store weather they needed me on the line or cashier or just getting them something.
good,Great first job for somebody part time in high school or young in college. They provide room for growth within the company and ther want you to have balance between work and life.
good,"Preparing Pastries and serving customers."
good,I love Panera Bread. It was a fun place to work and the employees were all so nice. I enjoyed going into work every night knowing what I would be doing and who I would be with
good,I enjoyed opening the store and setting everything up to quality standards and beyond.  Same thing with closing the store.  I should have just put a cot in the back.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"A typical day consists of taking orders, filling drink orders and bakery orders. Making sure everything is stocked and organized, most importantly barista beverages. I close so I have to pack away all left over bakery items to give away for donations and clean everything; that includes sweeping and moping. The coworkers make the job worth it. The hardest part of the job is the fast paced, busy environment. We are busy 90% of the time however, we are still expected to get other important tasks done. Though, It doesn't take very long to learn how to best manage everything that comes with the job and will teach you very important life lessons that can be used anywhere you go. My favorite part about working at Panera Bread would be my coworkers, along with a majority of our customers."
good,They treat all of their associates with respect and believe in work life balance.
good,"I get to work with a happy and positive attitude and willing to help my team and my costumers. I learn to love people and serve them better. I grow a lot as a manager and learn a lot of things. My co-workers we so amazing so helpful so understanding, willing to learn and be coached, always open to lean my things. The hardest thing i will say is trying leaving my team to move to a better opportunities. The most enjoyable is seeing my team members grow and apply what i have taught them."
good,I worked Morning Shift I honestly loved this job. I went to work happy everyday to see my friends and to just be at work it was a great working environment and it was in the middle of downtown. Best set of managers I’ve ever had out of all my jobs. Only complaint I can think of was that sometimes there would be some confrontation between employees.
good,"I arrived at work at 5am set up bakery case ,counted my drawer down ,filled all catering orders, sliced all breads."
good,"Open and closing of bakery café, training of new managers and employees, deployment of staff, monetary deposits, prepping, preparing and storing of foods, customer service, ordering supplies."
good,"I was the line set up in the morning so I was responsible for making sure everything was stocked for lunch. That included having plenty of backup food, silverware, dishes, and anything else needed during the lunch rush. After lunch, I was responsible for making sure all side work was completed before each employee left their shift. As a certified trainer, when needed, I trained the new people in whatever area they were starting in."
good,"Managing all day-to-day profit margins. Oversaw throw out to profit margins. Training new and existing employees on future or returning items to our menu. Managing inventory and what café needed. Maintaining a clean environment for ourselves as well as our customers. Dealt with spreadsheets pertaining to accounts receivable which consisted of our credits, debts, and total profit to loss margin."
good,"panera was a great place to work, nice employees, nice customers, and a very homie atmosphere."
good,"I loved it here and learned so much from Panera on Metcalf. the managers we ok. But there were 2 of them that really went out of their way to work with their employees on schedule and everything. Staff is helpful and very friendly with everyone. they all are ecixited to teach you something when asked a question. they food is great and they pay was ok for what i was doing. i would say the hardest part of the job would be the lunch and dinner rush. super busy no time for errors and fast paced. i got good at making sandwiches fast! I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job there was interacting with my co workers. they were all awesome but 2 people stood out among the rest as just outstanding people to me. the managers Jim and Tomas. they helped me when i needed it and gave me extra hours when my car broke down so i can get it fixed. they were not just my ""boss"" they were people that cared about its employees well being. they truly care about their employees."
good,Opened up a record breaking restaurant with the first T line drive thru. Learned high volume as well as managing over 100 employees
good,"I loved the people and the food, it was very calm no matter what was going on. I loved taking home free food at the end of the night."
good,"Coworkers are fun"
good,Good job.  Need to be aggressive and a self-starter to be successful.
good,"I loved Panera one because I was surrounded by the ""Mother bread"" of all pastries. Panera Bread is a diverse Eatery; Not only are u able to dine on pastries but delicious entrées,healthy smoothies and let's not forget WiFi heaven. As an employee you have the opportunity to excel based on your knowledge of the chain. Trust me you learn so much and being a bakery that everyone comes to, it's a skill to retain so much so fast! It was uplifting."
good,".great training program"
good,Working at Panera Bread was a blast. All the coworkers and managers got along. The entire staff at Panera Break worked together perfectly. The store was very organized and easy to navigate and the job wasn't too easy and it was definitely not too hard. There was always work that could be done and managers and coworkers worked well with me in covering my shifts.
good,"usually busy lunch dinner time "
good,"Each shift you were assigned to a certain area of work, many times I would be assigned to cash register because that is what I am best at. "
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I would get to work early set up the bakery. We would then open and I would get to take care of all my regular customers. As they day went on I would have taken my break before lunch and then I would be back in time for the lunch rush. We would take orders fill orders and send them down the line.
good,"Customer oriented oasis-type cafe/bakery. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of flipping the line, rearranging the older product in front of the new. I have acquired many helpful techniques as far as prepping the store for the next day, and stocking inventory for the following week. As far as my coworkers they are very open minded and cool. I enjoy them as if they were my own family. I wouldn't say that i have difficulties at my job. Everything is pretty simple.The most enjoyable part of my job is projecting my smooth voice over the microphone to announce that an order is ready."
good,"a level head is key, management is a phone call away, fun atmosphere, crunching time frame, interacting with the regulars"
good,"Panera Bread is one of the greatest place I worked. Atmosphere is nice ,food is delicious and people are very welcoming. I build a great relationship with my customers simply because customers are N1 opportunity for business."
good,Attending to customers in tha bakery and line. e-learning training from time to time. Nice cooworkers
good,"A day as a baker with Panera is slightly different form most job positions seeing has it is an overnight position with only one maybe two team members. Management supports its employees 100% while maintaining a ""closed fist"". The most difficult part of the job would be the 1st few hours pushing ahead while not impossible still a challenge. While the most enjoyable part was going home at 6 A.M. covered in dough but looking at a wonderful bake. Also can not forget the free samples!"
good,"All Operations of café, great people and been through sever development courses such as Sit Lead, FOCUS, GAPS.  Built team from ground up.  "
good,"Prior to having applied for this first job, I was prepared to face challenges ranging from trying to keep up with the pace of other employees to struggling with multitasking all of the work requirements. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the restaurant was a low-stress and high-productivity environment. All my worries about having my first job had been proven unfounded. My fellow employees and the managers were all fun to be around and it was a pleasure to work with them. Panera Bread is a great restaurant with a unique and original personality."
good,"it was a good company to work for did not leave on bad terms the only thing that I would have changed is the upper management having more authority instead of a ""buddy/buddy"" relationship."
good,very good experience was taught well and guided with good management
good,"At Panera Bread, the focus is always maintaining interpersonal relations with our customers. Great services and quality food is a gurantee. Panera Bread isn't just a business, it's a family. Teamwork is essential and plays an important role in the success of such a business. This is a wonderful business to work for."
good,"Typical day included dealing with a lot of customers and working a fast-paced environment, but it was fun!"
good,"cleaning,"
good,"I typically do a whole lot of everything at work. I make the sandwiches, answer multiple phone lines (have to answer in three rings or less), take food out to the customers that need help, take orders. I learned how to multi task, train new employees, and manage others when needed. The management had gotten better. The district manager made alot of changes in creating new people, so it runs alot smoother and makes everyone a lot happier knowing things are actually getting done. I love all of my coworkers as family. They help me when I need it, as I help them when they need it. Everyone gets along with everyone and it makes for a better work place. The hardest part of the job is when it gets super busy during lunch then everyone gets a little more stressed out. The most enjoyable part of the day is when everyone is having a good day, and things move fast and smooth, so it makes for a better environment to be in."
good,"wonderful culture, extensive training, co-workers were always friendly and helpful, management was incredible and always available, customer service was the most enjoyable aspect of my job"
good,a typical day at work is a challenge you never know what to expect it keeps you on your feet i learned to communicate more with my team members and handling food my co workers are family i cant live with out them the hardest part of the job is seeing and smelling all the food that looks delicious the most enjoyable part is when they say the food was great and become a regular and brings their family
good,Fun place to work. The customers were great. I always had a smile on my face when handling my customers and their orders.

Their is no hard part of my job because everybody work togethers which makes the day stress free. The most enjoyable part of my job is always my customers , making sure they are happy. I learned how to work together to accomplish goals"
good,"I worked in support of the managment team as a shift supervisor. I was in charge of employees during my shift. While in charge I managed up to ten employees at one time; with customer services as a top priority. As part of the management team I had further responsiblity - I implemented and organized a new associate training program. I handled training files and information on each employee keeping each file up to date. Furthermore, I oersaw the store's environment factors and followed through with plans of actions to resolve any problems."
good,"The typical day is busy, but myself and my co-workers work together to get the job done"
good,"I haved worked at two diffrent Paneras in diffrent states and they were both great places. Its easy working here. You meet so many people. You get to try new pastries, salads & all other great foods they have. Easy to go school and work. You get great hours and they pay pretty good for a fast food upscale resturant. The hardest part of the job is trying not to eat everything lol."
good,"I go to work, I find out myself what needed to be done. I'll ask the magager if something is out/low. I help the back-of-the-house person if they are having any problems: a rush/can not find something."

good,Harr working job. I would run food to customers who are dining in if asked to. Hardest part about the job is learning the menu and preparing food at the same time. Once your familiar it won't be a problem.
good,"awesome and very understanding managers, work environment is very upbeat and welcoming. the employees are great! the managers are good about working with your hours of availability too!"
good,The job is great it’s pretty simple once you get used to it your just delivering food and some real good food at that but I can say you will be mainly delivering to offices and businesses.
good,"Through my years at Panera Bread, I can confidently say that the staff and customers are incredibly friendly.  Everyone looks out for one another.  The only downfall of my experience would have to be the pay.  It never reached your experience or seniority.  I was an associate trainer for at least 3 years, yet I would always train people who would make more than me.  Other than that Panera Bread is a good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I started working for Panera in 2013 in Orange California  and met some of the best people. I had recently moved to California from Michigan and didnt know anyone learned to do cash first and then trained making food and was given a 1.00 raise in a year  I enjoyed working there and there food.

good,"Panera Bread has coached and developed me into the leader I am today."
good,"Delivering Dough carts to the restaurants. Anywhere from 11-13 stops a night. Starting time around 9 pm every night. It is component pay so you are actually getting paid more than your hourly wage. It works for me. I have alot of free time in between work days.

good,I loved working here. I’m looking to reapply. I had to quit because I was moving to a new state and I wanted to try something different but I loved working here and the fast paced environment so I’d love to go back.
good,"Panera employees run strictly on an Everyday Oasis mentality.  So the attitude is relaxed and completely customer based.  It can get very hectic throughout the day, but you work as a team to accomplish your hoals and make our customers happy."
good,My top five job's of all times. I'm still in touch with five members of my crew. An it's well over ten years since I have worked at Panera bread. Always speak to your team.
good,"Panera was my first job! They hired me with no retail/cash handling experience, which was completely okay because the training was thorough and informative. My managers were great, and my hours were EXTREMELY flexible. Was able to balance work and school very easily. Very welcoming and comfortable environment"
good,"Working at Panera Bread was one of the best experiences at any of the other jobs I had. Overall great work environment for new and old employees to start. Or, to end their carreer."
good,"Positive place to work , always something to do and always had a chance to make someone smile. caring company and very understanding I would love to work at this company again ."
good,As an older employee I was impressed with how well the company and management treat the employees. They truly care not only about the employees but also about the customer and wealth of the establishment. Panera has the cleanest back of house I have worked for and rewards employees that give 110% to their job.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Amazing company to work for. Panera knows what it’s doing and how to drive competition. Panera takes care of its employees and strives to be their best authentic selves every day.
good,"Assist customer with any needs they may have. serve the customer their food . maintain the stock system on the floor . keep station cleaned and organized. learn to bake the pastries, bagels , and fresh bread every morning or when it was needed. management was spectacular made sure everything ran smoothly as possible with guest and with the employees."
good,"everyday its a non stop fast paste, which is great because time goes by! on your feet the whole time the moment you clock in and out. 11:30 to 3 is the most busiest time of the day"
good,"Work there varied from being dull to extremely busy within minuets, so I had to learn to get all the prep cleaning done early so the rush of people had plenty of times stocked at there disposal. I would clean as well so they had a nice sanitized eating place. While during the busy hours, I would focus on work and complete my tasks, if a guest asks me for something, I would comply and complete the task at hand, even if I had already started something. I had to remember all the tasks I need to do in that moment, I had to learn how to multitask or elver I wouldn't have been able to get anything done on time. The management team all had there own style of work and I had to grow a custom to each one. The workplace culture was somewhat vast, we had many families, mothers and daughters, husbands and wife's who worked there, which in term made it feel like one big family. I learned while working at Panera Bread that working hard does pay off in the end. Learning to multitask helps get the job done, and making sure that everything was done correctly the first time so I wouldn't waste time going back and fixing it."
good,"Great place to work, management and staff treat you with respect, clients are always happy and friendly.  Highly recommend working and eating at this restauramt"
good,Panarabread is a team player job we all worked to together to get the job done. We took good care of our customers and treated them like family. Also made sure all orders was made right.
good,"As BMM a typical day began at 7PM, ended at 7or 8AM. I oversaw all bakery ops. and all training, traveled between 2 to 3 locations every shift to maintain the high quality production required by the co. and the franchise. My other responsibilities required that I interfaced with front of the house management, staff and operating partners. My take away with Panera was the co. was always on the leading edge of the quick casual dining experience, I never thought that there was a hard part of my job. I got the most enjoyment from watching my staff always striving to improve themselves and the finished product."
good,"I was sad to leave but it was the nest experience. I started when it first opened in Janesville. Great food, best learning environment & relatable coworkers and management."
good,The workspace was always clean and efficient despite the business of the restaurant. Plenty of opportunities to try other positions. If you were proficient at your job they would promote to more of a supervisor position which was very helpful.
good,Panera Bread is a very productive and fun workplace. Everyone that works there is very welcoming and everyone helps each other out as best they can. The hardest part is getting everything done on time. The most enjoyable part is pleasing the guests.
good,"Working here keeps you on your toes. High demand for the food served there always keeps you busy. Friendly co-workers, great staff. Regular customers, always happy to see you."
good,This was my first job in a computer science field and I think it is the best environment to prepare me for my future. The staff that was already in place there were extremely helpful and supportive to my growth and were very helpful to myself and their other more established co-workers.
good,"I have always enjoyed my job at panera, the team and the managers are amazing and I love our concepts and orlur values that run the store. There really isnt anywhere like it."
good,"Working overnight at panera as a baker was a big learning experience. It gave me the responsibility of working alone and being trusted to complete my job by the time the store opened. I worked with great people. I was a helper so there was always a main baker with me during the night. We got along and would help each other out whenever we could. Bakers definitely stuck together. Management at our location was very stable. We knew what was expected of us and she knew what we expected from her. We did have an actual bakery manager who was rarely in store with us which at times could cause issues but we could readily rely on the cafe manager for any issues. The hardest part of the job was ensuring everything was completed on time even when ovens would stop working or we were out of a product. The most enjoyable part was being able to work on my own, not be involved with customers all while making great food with coworkers I cared about."
good,The culture in place is one that empowers employees to be at their very best.  They provide excellent training and really prepare employees for the next level of their career.
good,A day would start with me entering washing my hands and putting on gloves. Finding my apron and name tag is something I would always do next. After I would enter the line and check the assignment sheet which showed who was working at which station that day. After figuring out where I am working I start to check the line products to make sure they are properly dated and fresh. I would also help an y co workers that needed help at that time. M management was always helpful and never made me feel bad for asking any questions. It was a great environment to be around everyone got along and was very professional. The hardest part of my job was not hard at all but would have to be training new associates in the stations I have learned. The most enjoyable part would have to be my managers for always looking out for me and caring about me on a person level.
good,"The people at my store were great, we would actually make plans outside of work because we all just genuinely got along. At work the culture was great. Pay was a struggle, but it's also the food industry. I loved closing the bakery because they donate all of the leftover bread and pastries to charities every night."
good,"I love Panera bread one of the best jobs I have ever worked at. Its a big family there and everybody that works there are great people. Positive place , and great environment. No bad vibes. The food is great quality and we have great benefits being their workers."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I really enjoyed working at Panera Bread. The staff was delightful and the management were kind hearted. I worked flexible hours and was given opportunities to work in different departments of the store. I delivered food i worked on the line and even prepped food in the back. I would highly recommend working there.
good,"Very quick pace with unrealistic expectations with how quick food needed to be made, however management was great and coworkers were always fun to work with, would definitely recommend."
good,The people there including the management are lovely. Getting to know regulars and bonding with coworkers is what I look forward to. I looked forward to working there everyday.
good,This was my favorite place to work at I loved my coworkers everyone was nice and friendly my reasons for leaving was because of school and hours other than that it’s a great place to work
good,Panera Bread is a great company whose goal is to have great employees. This company is all about customers enjoying food with people they love. Great company to work for!
good,"So as far as overall, it really is an amazing place to work. As an associate they really give you that flexible schedule that you really need. I gave the job/life a 4 star because once you advance into management it gets really tough to find a balance between both parts of your life. I enjoy the fast pace work enviorment, but I have seen a lot of people come and go because they just could not handle the fast paced needed."
good,Panera is a great first job. I really enjoyed the management and I enjoyed the nice atmosphere it has. The food is good and the discount you receive is even better.
good,I enjoyed my time there and I would go back if I could’ve gotten paid more. It was just fun! Communication was great with the management and they definitely worked with you when needed.
good,I've worked at Panera Bread for 4 years and everyone there I consider family and you can rely on everyone. Great environment on a daily basis. They helped me develop into the person I am today.
good,"Often starts off slow & builds up; peaks and valleys. Often very busy and hectic, but great teamwork and communication alleviates most stress. Both employees and customers are great and very warm."
good,"The management team was amazing. They were real people who cared about your life. It was very fast paced, but when everyone did their part it was a manageable kind of stress during those rush hours. All the associates were kind and fun to work with, everyone got along, no drama!"
good,"* Helping customers"
good,hated leaving this job due to my co workers and managers the job was quick pace but easy to keep up up with. everybody was friendly and it was a great work environment
good,"Great company and location.  Very busy, good enviroment, positive people, employees, managers.  Nothing hard about the job, sometimes tiring if we were short handed.  All ages came to the location, could be inside and outside at work.  The team enviroment was the best, everyone is and was a team player."
good,"I have enjoyed working here. The company believes in promoting from within, create a learning and mentoring environment. Working for a company with concerns for the employees is rewarding."
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera. It was a very professional work environment. Everything was kept up to date. Managers managed and actually supervised. There was a good balanced between the work and the play. It was a very steady paced. I always said, "" Panera Poppin"""
good,they give good hours and are very good at training. you have to learn all the food in the menu and how to ask questions. moving the line and making sure customers get the right order is key to doing a good job. its a great first job. the hardest part is keeping on schedule and making sure everything is ready for the next person on the next shift. the worst part is if you have a micromanaging supervisor you literally wont be able to work comfortably since that person will breathe down your neck stare you down.
good,The dress code is fairy relaxed compared to other places I have worked. We can wear whatever solid color shirt with a collar we like. Our pants or shorts can also be what ever solid color we like. The exception is no cargo pants or shorts for safety reasons. The management I easy going and willing to jump in to help if needed. I had to call out sick because of an unexpected stay in a hospital. Management was very understanding and even asked how I was doing when I came back.
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I honestly enjoyed coming to work when I was employed here the only issue i had, personally, I moved with my family so the drive was too far from my relocation. But 10/10 would refer a friend to work here."
good,The best part about this job was the co-workers. People were very helpful for the most part and provided a good atmosphere to work in. The worst part of the job is the angry/snobby customers that you get from time to time.
good,"I have always loved how clean the Panera Breads are and how great the food is and also the customer service.  Working at Panera would be a good start in the world for me, a 15 year old, although i would be working next year when i get my car and License."
good,"Best part of going to work for Panera, is working for a Management team that cares and easy to get along with.  Workplace culture and values is all about caring for the craft of making bread and your team members."
good,"Great Company to work for for a first job, awesome associates , very fast paced can be stressful . Customers can be great , they can be flexible with hours and days ."
good,"A typical day at work is just a calm collective day, sometimes when its really busy between the hours 11:30 - 2:30 it can be frustrating at times dealing all of the customers orders, and their concerns."
good,I don’t intend to leave because of how great the environment is. The managers are amazing. I just need more money to pay for daily needs. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for a good place to work with guaranteed hours.
good,"a typical day at Panera was always a positive one even when I got opening shifts. The people working there always had a smile on their face and the managers always greeted me with a big smile and asking me how I was feeling. I learned to work very well with others and in a fast paced environment. Every rush was a group effort and everyone would have to give the 110% in communicating and customer service. The hardest part about the job is getting used to the fast pace but once you get the hang of it, it's steady sailing. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the co-workers and having unique conversations with customers, especially with the regulars"
good,A typical day at panera bread was good there was a lot of moments where i was over whelmed but then i got it together. I learned that even tho someone comes at you wrong doesn't mana do the same maybe try to handle it a different way and see how that goes. The management there was kinda rocky. The workplace was very peaceful for those who just got off work or out of school and needed a quiet place to go and enjoy some nice food. The hardest part of the job was the closing shift there was so much that had to be done in short time. The most enjoyable part was just everything.
good,"I worked at the register in the bakery section of Panera bread so I took orders for breakfast, lunch and dinner depending on which shift I worked and sometimes my shift consisted on working at the Barista station too, where I made drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. I enjoyed this job. All the employees were friendly and fun to be around. The managers were kind to me too. I had good hours and made good money. It was an overall great experience."
good,"I'm still super close to all my coworkers, there is a huge sense of family and support of one another. It truly is a team effort and even the management has an amazing servant-hearted work ethic. Always impressed with the way things get handled with messed up orders or customer complaints. The discount is also kinda amazing if you can bring your family or a few friends with you. I've actually had times where I wasn't working there just visiting and we got a discount from the manager. The concern for the most part if you were late was if you were safe and ok, not people being angry with you because life happens and you all have a great relationship with each other. Wonderful place!"
good,I Loved working there ! It was fun I wish the pay was better while I was there now its great for NYC workers. The work with your schedule and they do put a lot on your plate but it still was a good company
good,It is a nice working environment.  I enjoyed working there. The co-workers are nice and friendly.  Wish I got more working hours.  Food discounts are offered.
good,"Coming into work is always exciting. Everybody gets along well which is great. The management is super helpful and caring. One of the hardest parts about my job is when it gets super busy and everyone stresses out a bit but we always get through it with a little teamwork. Overall, it’s a great place to work and it’s my favorite job I’ve had yet!"
good,I absolutely loved working at Panera Bread for my first job. Everything was great I actually honestly couldn't come up with any complaints. The thing I enjoyed the most was how we were like a big family! You don't come across that in a workplace everyday.
good,I learned how to handle high volume in a calm and efficient manner while developing and maintaining a great customter relationship for catering.......
good,"Long but busy"
good,"Every business says their team is just like family, but Panera had truly hit that nail on the head. Everyone is positive and supportive, always checking on each other and happy to help no matter where it is needed in the restaurant. You bond very quickly over lunch rushes and unexpected buses of sports teams. Management is very kinda and positive, and treat you as peers rather than subordinates."
good,"Great place to work. Love the people I worked for. Just didn’t care for the hours, and didn’t shifts that we had to work. Benefits are great, and enjoyed the atmosphere."
good,"I worked at Panera Bread while I was in college. It was a great place with lovely people, a fun work environment, and easy career advancement. The pay was competitive compared to other similar jobs. Raises are gained based on how many different areas you are trained in, but then very small yearly raises. Easy advancement if that is what you are looking for."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,A typical day at work would consist of me making sure our guests get nothing but 150 percent satisfaction. With their food and their customer service because its all about the energy you give to the guests. which could be the diffraction if they have a good day or not.
good,its kinda weird working at Panera bread. they like a fast food restaurant but more so with a longer process for things. they do run out of food quickly
good,"Panera bread is an amazing place to work , the people are always so nice and helpful . Fun place to work .  Managers are very laid back and sweet . They help you out a lot ."
good,It was a great place to work. I met a lot of good people.  The Managers were easy to get along with and very understanding.  The hours were great with chances of overtime.
good,it was great for me but i dont want to work with food anymore. i want to expand my horizons. I just didn't like how busy it was and how fast paced the work was.
good,"Great place , fast paced environment, Guest Loving, helps places around the community, Strong team members , Good managers, Relaxed environment for Guest"
good,Love working with people. If u like a fast paced place and having fun while doing it this is the place for you. My time here has been a learning experience working with different cultures meeting new people... I love it!!!!!!!!
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread in the Alabaster, AL location. The atmosphere was absolutely wonderful and there is a lot of room for growth. There are opportunities for promotion if you work hard for it. I received two title promotions in the 3 years I worked there. I also received yearly raises. In this cafe, management was awesome and everyone did their best to help you succeed."
good,"Career advancement is great"
good,"Good place to work, great advancement opportunities. I only left because I had a baby.  I did not feel the pay was sufficient for me to continue working over 40 hours weekly and to put a newborn in day care."
good,exellent place to work. Great work/life balance. good room for advancement. Good mgt team that communicate well with each other. ok pay and benifits. I was in the mist of my gm training when i had to take a leave of abcense.
good,The company was very fair and buisness oriented.There was a deadline that was to be met every morning and as long as you work at an even pace youre good.Great management
good,I enjoy working for Panera bread this is a fast pace job and the team members are great to be around. Most of the time is interacting with the us timers but you have to also interact and have great communication skills to make the job soomth an less stressful. I like the fast pace environment.
good,This company provides plenty of room to grow. Hard workers are compensated fairly and given full time hours if desired. This is a quick paced environment and can be stressful during peak hours.
good,This is a nice place to work to use interpersonal skills and time management. I am able to get the hours I need. I do like the warmth the cafe offers it keeps regulars coming back.
good,Me gusta mucho lo que ago en mi trabajo  pero me gustaria aprender mas cosas
good,The company provides us very good environment for job.company management gives freindly environment for working and they realise us that the costumer satisfaction is most important on business.

good,Working at Panera Bread-Catering was great. The management and employees were very polite and welcoming and I fell right into line with the rest of the employees.
good,This was my first job and it was a great job I learned a lot at this job specifically. At Panera I learned how to multitask and to step up and be a leader. Here i tested my skills and capabilities to do things. I started off as a cashier but within 6 months i was doing way more than that I thought myself how to make the sandwiches and salads. Great place
good,Great opportunities for growth along with a friendly atmosphere every time I went to work. A great opportunity for someone to move up quickly in employment
good,"One of the hardest parts of the job at Panera Bread was working in such a fast paced environment, and still being able to satisfy my customers it has also became on of my best skills."
good,Learned a lot and was trusted to train new employees.  I was also able to request time off when needed as long as I gave advance notice.  It allowed me to prepare for college and attend my senior prom.
good,"It's a really great place to work, especially for your first job as a teen. It'll give you experience and great benefits. You're in control of your hours you want to work."
good,"Loved working here. If you are a college student like me, they work to fit your schedule. I learned how to make salads, sandwiches and soups. Also was a food prep."
good,"I would still be working here if not for my gluten intolerance which did not allow me to work in a bakery setting. The company as a whole really does put forth some great ideals, gives back to the community, looks out for their employees, and has built a great foundation on their concept. "
good,Great environment to be in. Everyone knew what had to be done and did it within a timely manner but also knew when to joke around. All the employees were friendly to everyone and helped out when needed.
good,Panera bread was a good job the promotes team work and discipline Panera taught about how to do multi tasking while working g with others.Really cool .
good,"A day in the life of a Panera cashier. Work starts early, usually 5-6 am. I come in and stock bakery, bread wall, bagel wall and heritage tables. I slice the bread needed for the cook line and bag cookies and check for any early rapid pick up or call in orders. I'm the first smiling face the customers see when they enter the cafe, I take their orders, thank them for coming and wish them a good day. Throughout the day I refresh and restock the bakery as well as the bagel wall and keep my work space clean and tidy. "
good,This would be a great first job for high school kids. It teaches you a lot about working in a quick enviroment anf panera is definitely a company that cares about their employees.
good,The workplace environment was organized and clean. The amount of pay is awesome. I really liked working at Panera Bread during the day. The work atmosphere was positive and friendly.
good,This job is the definition of Opportunity I had a chance to go and manage three different stores at assistance to the district manager. I had  a lot of fun and learned a lot along the way.
good,Great place to work for and is basic customer service. It's got enough for you to do but not too much for you to get too stressed out. Love working there!  The company is super supportive of their employees and super caring of the food they're producing!

good,Overall Working at Panera bread it was okay but the only thing I didnt like was not getting enough hours. It was easy adnt ehpeoplpe that came in was very respectful
good,"The managers are amazing, the staff is amazing, working at Panera alone is a terrific experience. The best part about the job is working with the people that I do all day. The least enjoyable part of working here is the amount im getting paid for all the hard work I do. I would recommend this establishment to anyone who is looking for a fast paced, but fun place to work."
good,Working at Panera Bread has taught me how to manage others and work in a fast-paced environment. I gained important customer service skills that has helped me excel in various other aspects of my everyday and professional life.
good,"Panera Bread offers a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The company values employees and recognizes superior skill and ambition when considering promotions."

good,The most enjoyable time in my work was working independently and with a group.I experienced and learned so many new things meet great people and know i will used what i learned for the future.
good,"-Learnt what we do at Panera Bread"
good,I really enjoyed working for Panera Bread a Covelli franchise. They go above and beyond to work with your schedule and always look out for the employees best interest.
good,"Panera Bread was overall a great experience. I learned a lot about the fast food industry and (in my opinion) one of the most important parts - how to get through a lunch rush. A lot of people may crack under the pressure of a lunch rush, but Panera Bread taught me how to stay calm, keep a smile on my face, and get better and better."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"I enjoyed working at Panera Bread at first for the atmosphere, but it soon became more about my coworkers and working as a team with them. Typically we had an early morning rush, followed by a mid-morning lull, then a lunch rush. I learned how to work well under pressure and how to quickly learn different aspects of a job. I was learning something new almost every 2 weeks there and it became important to nail everything down as fast as possible as the restaurant industry moves pretty fast. I least enjoyed when management would not handle stressful situations well and take it out on employees. I most enjoyed when everything was communicated well and we were able to all do our jobs smoothly"
good,Managers cared. Environment is paced. Workers were all a joy to be around and you were never doing the same job. Nice they always had events within the cafe to promote work ethnics
good,"Most work days we would prepare our area of duty and prepare our areas with the required items for your particular assignment.We constantly stayed busy making sure that we prepared our customers orders precisely while keeping a neat, clean and organized working are. Our management team was pretty fair and showed good leadership skills. The hardest part about the job was learning about new items but also that became the most enjoyable part as well."
good,The management and my coworkers were great. It was a very easygoing environment. I liked how my coworker's encouraged me and praised each other for the things we did well. The job was perfect for a college student working part time.
good,A typical day at work involved preparing food and keeping the dining area clean for guests. I learned how to be a leader and how to keep others calm under pressure. Management and co-workers were laid back and easy to get along with. The hardest part about the job was the lunch rushes. The most enjoyable part about the job was interacting with guest and seeing the satisfaction in their faces when you provided them with excellent customer service.
good,"learned how to have patience, fast-paced so it gets frustrating at times. My co-workers are like my family we work together to give the customers the experience they want."
good,"This was a fun place to be and I always felt busy whether it was customers, or the management team pushing us to keep up with the store. Everyone cared a lot about what they had to do, as well as caring for their coworkers and customers. Great place to work."
good,"Panera Bread is an awesome place to work. They care so much about their employees. I can't speak for Paneras world wide, but where I work, they take care of their people. They help out people when they need it. They also work well with college students like me who don't always have the most open availability in the world."
good,I was the Panera Ambassador. Which I was responsible for making sure that every customer that wished to have a MyPanera Account was signed up correctly and that it was completely functional. I was also a cashier and waiter. I took orders and delivered them to the kitchen.
good,"My review of Panera Bread is Short and Simple. Panera is like any fast food restaurant. They offer good service and in a timely manner. what I do not agree with is the way they care about their workers. Like any restaurant service they are always short staff which has a big affect on the people who work their on a day to day basis. The pay is at minimum wage and I believe it should be higher because of the work we as a whole put in on a day to day basis. Management is like any other. Manager have no control over what happens at the job. They are told what to do, so they really don't have any authority. Their is always favoritism at any job, so some people get away with somethings that others wouldn't get away with."
good,Well I normally have to be at work real early so it helps me start my day. I go into work check to see if I have any orders for the day such as breads or pastry's and then I start setting up the bakery. I love my job because I go in get the job done correctly and then I normally have my whole day to myself. My managers are awesome very professional and understanding people and I wouldn't ask for a better management team. I would have to say that the hardest part of some days would be if we have a employee call off and we get left short then it just screws up the whole day. The most enjoyable part of the day is when its time to go home lol. I love working at Panera Bread.
good,"I enjoy working for Panera because of the people I work with, the willingness to help and go the extra mile for customers, and the management team."
good,"I love Panera as a company, the people are amazing and truly care about you as a person instead of just seeing you as an employee. The managers are great but sometimes they allow the employees to take advantage of them. I love all of my coworkers and we all get along very well, there are rarely any problems. The hardest part of the job is making sure orders are correct and customers are happy during lunchtime. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers."
good,"Fun work place with supportive team members and management. Each day you learn more and more about your fellow colleagues, which was nice. You got to see new faces from the customers every day, and you had a few regulars who would show up so it was nice to see familiar faces as well. In the beginning, learning how to prepare certain food items at a fast pace was challenging, but over time you get acquainted with the work flow."

I learned multitasking, time management, patients, proficiency, profits, money handling, budgeting, I learned as much as I could there. management was very understand, trusting, kept to their words, flexible, on top of their co-workers and followed rules and regulations. The Managers acted like real mangers should. Co-workers were responsible, loving, done their jobs but laid back at the same time. Hardest part of the job was opening the front of he store and making sure all pre-orders were completed for pick up before the store opened. Most enjoyable part of working here was the love and welcomness that was always there as soon as you walked in. It wasn't just a workplace there it was another home, they were family."

I learned multiple things working there and the most important thing was how costumer appreciation is important In any line of work you in"
good,"A typical work day would begin with completing all of the tasks required for the position put in that day. Take care of customers, make food+coffee, all sorts of cleaning duties. I have learned a great deal of customer service, and I have gained a great sense of urgency when dealing with speed of service. The management is very on top of everything, and they are very accommodating to employee needs. The group of people I work with are unbelievable and definitely make the job a great, friendly, fun, and focused work environment. The hardest part of the job would probably be working through a fast paced rush with other that aren't as skilled yet, or aren't as focused as needed. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the moment that I make a customer smile, feel welcome, and leave feeling like their day is better all because of my exceptional customer service I provide to every customer."

good,"From the moment you come in, you know what you're doing and have proper training for any job you want to do. You may be hired for a needed position, but once mastered, you can ask to try other things, as well. I was able to do practically everything because I was able to learn and management allowed me to do so. Most co-workers were awesome to be with while working and outside of work, but it was usually only the workers who wanted to stand around doing nothing and getting paid for it that didn't work well with someone like me. The hardest was definitely during the busy hours when the dishes would lag behind because they weren't getting back to the dishwasher in time. The best part was the whole working experience--yes, you have to work and do your job, but you can also socialize and support each other."
good,Everyday is fun and full of life. You get to help out your co-worker and become friends with the customers.

I then distribute cash drawers and inspect uniforms of each employee. I then start to prep my shift with any nessessary paper work, check staffing levels for the day and put out deployment charts assigning associates to there positions. I make sure the store is ready to open and assure we open on time and with everything in place. Once everything is flowing well I begin an inventory of the store to assure we have plenty of product to last until the next delivery and order accordingly, with constantly checking on staff and guests. Once I am through with inventory I begin, line checks and temp logs assuring we are set & ready for a heavy lunch. I work closely with out customers assureing a possitive visit to our store. Once my shift is coming to an end I am responsible for the cash handleing and closing paper work, I then make a final round of the store checking for food safty. The hardest part of the job is judging what the entire week will be like since I purchase all food products, a lot of our business depends on the weather as to what our customers will be purchasing and we have a lot of elements involved.

good,"At Wawa, I was very comfortable. The aura of the whole store was amazing. Everyone from management down to the associates genuinely cared about you. They were very understanding about any adjustments that needed to be made. Not only was the staff welcoming, the customers were so caring and very familiar with the employees. You begin to have regular customers who are always concerned and notice when your presence is missing. You do become very attached to the store and the people in it. The work load is a lot but very easy to accomplish as long as you work hard everyday."
good,"When I first work there, it was slow because it wasn't August and there were not enough customers. The schedule are not what I wanted to be at.

good,This is a great place to work.  Managers work with your schedule.  They help you find extra work hours in the cafe if you need them.  They value their employees and work along side them daily.
good,I recommend every one to work here once in their lives. Amazing place with amazing structure and a great career path. I flourished here and I know everyone who works here will too.
good,It was a nice place to work at except that there was kind of a lot of drama because it was a lot of high schoolers and they were there just to make money not to actually be kind to others.

good,"The job got me prepared for my future endeavors. wonderful enviorment, great workwers and authoritive figures.  It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,The terminal system is rather complex in that it offers a seeming unlimited number of options and variations on each menu item in addition to an endless number and variety of inquiries by customers. Requires extensive an rapid interaction with fellow employees. Continually changing menu items. Must be alert and multitask.
good,"When I worked at Panera Bread it was a different atmosphere and there were so many people to get to know and so many orders to memorize. As I was there longer things got easier and I became very responsible for everything around me at work. I was considered a knowledgable and honest employee. The hardest part of this job was having to plan around certain things such as school and sports, but it all worked out and my managers always made sure to ask me about my upcoming weeks. I enjoyed this job because of the people around me, they were who I was with 8 hours of the day and they made it so much fun to go to work."

good,"Every location is different. Free pastries at night time right before closing, free drinks, sometimes you have to go to meetings on Sundays to talk about changes."
good,"Working at Panera has been one of the best and friendliest jobs I have ever worked. Working with the co-workers and customers at Panera was delightful, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. I learned skills on multitasking, how to make coffee, how to take care of customers and make them happy. The workplace culture was friendly and inviting, definitely my favorite part about the whole job. The hardest part of the job was remembering the small tasks needed to be done every hour in the restaurant and when the store got busy and us workers have to multitask super fast, and I am not used to that so it was a little tricky. Another thing I did not like about the job is how much cleaning and labor was involved for it being just minimum wage. I work at a different company now, and its less labor than working Panera, and almost double the pay."
good,I was very happy there for a long time i enjoyed the crew and a lot of the members have been employed there for a long time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,really like the managers. they care about their employees. they are hard working. they get the job done. nice work atmosphere. good coworkers all together good
good,Good company to work for. Opportunities are available for advancement. Panera works well with your schedule and any schedule changes that may come up. Good pay and good environment.
good,I have worked here for 9 + years. It has had it's share of ups and downs as most jobs do when it's good it's great when it's bad it's real bad. There is chance for advancement for those who want it.
good,"An occupation that can be enjoyable and frustrating, but one that is certainly doable. I've heard that employees of food establishments are prone to dissuade individuals from eating at their restaurants, but that is something that I can't do with this company. They are incredibly critical when ensuring that product isn't expired, and they ensure that the bread and desserts are fresh every day. They also work with local shelters in order to donate unsold product to ensure that it doesn't go to waste."
good,Fun place fo work. Its an easy job but it keeps you busy. Hours are very flexible. i have issues with my schedule sometimes but normally talking to a manager will get the issue solved.

good,I have been working here for almost a year and i really enjoy my time there. The managers are nice and understanding allowing them to be flexible with ur schedule. It’s a great experience and environment.
good,"Panera provided a very clear outline on the daily tasks that needed to be finished. As you level up in the position ladder, tasks become more important and sufficient knowledge is needed to get them completed."
good,"Fast paced labor. Calm days. Good hours. Smart quirky co-workers. Especially the recognition in your work goes to show how much you accomplished. They're polite, well to welcome a new employee. I miss my job and supervisors of whom I worked with."
good,"Having worked for a high growth company where the leadership staff showed so much support for everyone, including the custodial team. The one thing I will always take from the company is having an open and diverse and collaborative environment where everyone can have a dialogue with each other. "
good,"I really enjoy working along with the people I am, the managers are super helpful and always look out for my needs. The cafe has a nice relaxed atmosphere."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,"You Would Wash The Dishes At Your Easy Going Pace And You Would Put Away The Dishes And Utensils After You Have Washed Them All Completely Clean. Then You Get Out The Squegie As To Make Sure The Floors Are Completely Dry As To Prevent Slips And Falls. Safety Water Resistant Dress Shoes And Safety is Required. You Even Get To Chop Up Fruits And Vegetables And Weight Out The Meat On A Scale. Next Thing That I Want To Learn is Cashier Skills. You Get Discounts From Panera Bread For The Fresh Free Bread And Chocolate Rolls. Yum! There's Also The Greeting Hired Position. Even The People Do Know You When They Walk Into The Bread Store. Within My Case, This Was Temporary, But I Had Loved This Job!"
good,Relaxed working environment. Allowed for a positive relationship between co workers and regular customers. Clean and innovative dishes as well as multitude of options

good,its a great job. The workers and management treat you like family. i learned about all the different products and food the serve. i also learned how to do drive through and shut down  a register. the work place can get stressful sometimes de to it being so busy but nothing i couldn't handle

good,Es un lugar placentero para poder tomar un cafe caliente
good,I loved working there and to be honest I am trying to get hired on at one were i relocated at. I would recommend working here to anyone it's amazing work ace and the managers are amazing.
good,Working at Panera has helped my costumer service skills and reminded me what it is like to work in a team setting. Being around different kinds of people all day helps with communication skills as well.
good,Great very friendly staff very happy place to work management was very nice and calm environment customers was always friendly very clean place the changing  of the menu was always a great experiences to learn
good,"I would choose Panera bread over any job , it’s Fun , it’s warm and friendly and it makes you feel like you belong there I felt as if I was at home💕."
good,lts light I mean you like walk in there and put ur apron on and then go to the dining room and clean stuff and answer where the water is or the bathroom. You make drinks and take out the trash
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,I worked at Panera for about five months within that time I had gained many skills. The staff is very welcoming and they have strong oriented goals. My reasoning for leaving Panera bread was only due to striving towards stronger and bigger goals after high school ended for my personal life.
good,"•	Managed client demand by producing requested cuisines in a timely fashion"
good,This job really pushes you to be your absolute best. I have grown so much since I started working here and appreciate the connections I have been able to make.
good,I learned a lot of skills such a customer service and cashier. I also became a trainer for each position available. I learned a lot of patience along with lucrative traits from this company.
good,"Unload food Truck, managing inventory, cleaning store before opening the store. Early morning shift starting a 4 in the morning and complete my shift by noon."
good,I really enjoyed working here. I would have loved to stay in the company and work my way up but unfortunately was not in the position to do so at the time that I wa as employed there.
good,"I'll keep it short and sweet the job culture is every single thing any employee could ask for in a job. It became a family and less of a job. If you want to be treated with dignity while in the workplace Panera is for you! If you want to be able to take pride in your achievements Panera Bread. What other company closes their doors early for an evening despite how busy it is to sit down with their entire cafe of employers in each store NATIONWIDE to educate us on the new products, taste test, practice prep, and employee rewards. Simply put PANERA BREAD is fostering a culture not solely employing you. If you want to work for a truly ethical company that with every single honesty every thing they say about the fresh and all natural ingrediants is true. Every single paclage with ingrediants says ex. fruit puree, natural agave sugar, carrots. The dough was truly shipped in for us nightly and baked fresh. Some mac and cheese and things were kept in little plastic pouches, but were still fresh no preservatives or anything (read their mission statement of everything they do not put in food and it is true) of my almost 4 months working there I felt at home and prideful for my employment and to finally work for a clean, positive, honest environment. When there is a problem with any supervisor or employee no matter what the issue you can talk to them or the GM and it is solved immediately, and the GM will always present you with an option to put your complaint in writing or talk to his higher up. At least in my location nothing was ever swept under the rug."
good,I love Panera Bread and would like to work there again if I have a chance. I love the customers not rude at all just loving and a delight to have in Panera Bread.

good,"Panera bread was a kindly Warm Cafe With Welcoming Arms And Well learning skills. A typical day at work would be Punching in, Getting your Work attire On and Beginning front counter."
good,"Panera Bread has helped me to cultivate my leadership and management skills. I have been able to incorporate my education through CSU Bakersfield and apply them, specifically my Management and Supply Chain Logistics courses, to everyday operations within the cafe."
good,One manager will make you do things you arent trained to do because she didnt want to do them. Need to finish opening bakery in an hour even if its busy
good,"I would arrive in the morning and start prepping doughs, pastries, and bagels and then proceed to bake fresh bread bagels and pastries. Great place company to work for. The most difficult part was my cramped work enviroment my baking station was right next to the dish pit. not a good design, but not all the cafes where designed like this particular one. Everything else was perfect. I really loved my job."
good,"The work at times was difficult and demanding. But in was promoted to manager at a very young age and i have people 20 plus years older than me, working for me."

good,Although i loved working here this was mainly only a job for me since it was the only thing i could find that would hire me while i was still in high school
good,i learned how to deal with stress when all the orders came in by working with others and letting them help me the management is very good id have to say the hardest part of the job is waiting on others to be finished making the food so i could sell it when were suppose to have the food out fast the best part of the job was the people i worked with they always encouraged me to be better as a person and as a worker
good,I was working at the cashier station; so when regular customers came in I would slowly get to know them each. I enjoyed being able to make a customer happy by giving service with a genuine smile.
good,I enjoyed my time at Panera Bread.  It was delightful and fun.  The managers cared and went above and beyond for their employee.  It was time well spent.
good,Everyone that works there is nice and gets their work done. The managers are very fair and respectful. Also they are very easy to talk to about anything.
good,"A great place to get a strong start to a career. Days begin early at 5 AM, so if you are an early riser, it's a great place to be. Hours are long and work is hard, so bring your stamina."

good,I enjoyed the fast paced crowd and being a cashier besides standing in one spot for too long.  I handled a majority of the cleaning closing duties of the dining room because I did it so well and knew the routine.  Most of the time when I was cleaning the entire dining area was every night because my other closing co-workers were teenagers that didn't care for doing the extra work of the dining room duties.  I like making companies more money due to my faster then average service.
good,"loved working for Panera, the people were awesome and the pay was good for a college aged kid trying to make extra cash, got to take snacks home after night shifts, and i loved how they donate the leftover balked goods to charity"

good,It is a great place to work. It is a growing company. I started out has just an associate and now I am a AGM. I even went to school and they have worked with my school schedule very nicely while I was in college classes and being a manager.
good,"I enjoy what i do at Panera. I love talking with new people and making our customers happy and comfortable. I have learned a lot with this company and would love to learn and grow more. I really don't have a hard part of my job besides the days we get complaints and try our hardest to give our all to the customers and fails but i don't give up, it only makes me stronger and learn on what to do next time that way i give better service."

good,Panera Bread had been an overall positive work experience for me. Opportunities to advance are presented to those who show initiative and put in the effort needed.
good,"providing excellent customer service towards customers and enjoying creating masterpieces for people to enjoy."
good,There really was not much to learn other than the ingredients that are  in the sandwiches. Management seemed to care more about less important problems.
good,"It can get stressful, But not too bad. Management was okay. I got a chance to work with people from many different ages, and backgrounds. I became a trainer and I was able to teach the new employees the ropes to an amazing work life."
good,"I loved working at panera bread kinda whish i never left. everyone there trated you like family you could always rely on one another.

good,"was always busy but also had the slow paced times, but everyone was polite and respectful and hours were good and pay was decent, time went by very fast and there was always something to do."
good,"I loved working at Panera Bread. It gave me a sense of purpose and I felt important. I began as a Night Baker working a shift of 10pm to 7am for about 3 months and then I asked to be trained as a Day Baker. I would rather work forever as a Night Baker, my days were all sorts of mixed up but it was worth it. I was responsible for the freezer pull for the next night, refilling order for the day bakers if a catering order came in to late. Night Bakers are in charge of pastries, flatbreads, baguettes, bagels, cookies, scones, artisan loaves and any breads that day bakers weren't able to finish on time. I have trained two people to be my baker assistant and eventually was given the responsibility of training 2 more people who become night bakers as well.  The hardest part of the job is being alone at night in the store while you bake everything and to have a store key, and security code so you can allow for food /produce shipments to come into the store every few nights. Finally the most enjoyable part of working there is the managers, I was mainly a Night Baker so the only people I saw were six opening cafe workers, all six managers and the GM throughout the week including my Baker Manager. I loved coming in on my days off and walking directly to a managers office and having an adult conversation that didn't involve the gossip of the day. Then going over different orders that were missed  and making sure produce items arrived and the day shift was okay with picking up my slack if something went wrong."
good,A typical day at Panera Bread usually started at 5am; setting up the restaurant before it was opened. It was a really fun work environment and very fast paced.
good,"Family friendly restaurant, serving comfort food and pastries at a reasonable price. The staff are really friendly and enthusiastic about learning and remembering customers who come to the store frequently."
good,I would recommend this place to anybody.  One of the best places I have found in the food industry.  Very positive environment they stress good values and want the best of the best.
good,I’ve worked at Panera for a year and couple months. It was my first serious job and I loved it. My coworkers and managers are awesome and motivate you to go to work unlike other places.

good,great communications with employees and managers. Very professional and kept it very work related. I dont have anything bad to say about Panera and my co workers.

good,"I liked working for penara Bred because It was fast pace. people were friendly. I got a chance to get skill from the job. about one clock I clock in and wash my hand, wear clean work cloth that is provided for me. I get on the line and make sandwiches."
good,Panera bread was very professional and almost every customer was satisfied and came back. They had the same people come each week. The hardest part about working here is making the sandwich on time and getting it to the customer. The most enjoyable part would be my co workers.
good,"Panera Bread is a very high maintenance place. Your job duties are very easy to comprehend and carrying such out to the fullest degree should never be an issue. Breakfast, Lunch, and 5'o clock rush hour are the busiest times throughout the day. This is where your ability to keep up and stay afloat will be tested. The hardest part of the job would be the night time because you have to store all the foods and clean the area effectively. The easiest part of the day is opening up in the morning because their aren't many breakfast items or should I say as varietal as the lunch menu."
good,Excellent job i love everything about Panera bread i love the family i bulit while working at pamera bread i couldnt of chose a better place to work & grow a family very friendly

good,I have worked here on and off for three years and I have always been welcomed back with open arms. Must have the ability to work quickly and efficiantly under stress.
good,A typical day at work is fun and full of energy and theres lots to do no one is standing everyone has a job and we all depend on eachother. I learned how to work with slow and fast pace people. The culture is pretty fair and fun its different and like i said full of energy and smiles. The hardest is when you get multiple tasks and you have your job to do and others dont give a hand out to help especially while closing. Most enjoyable part is just people around fun people everyone funny and can bring a smile out of you.

good,"In my franchise Hamra Enterprise I grew so much so quickly from previous jobs, I really learned how to handle real situations and was taught to branch out and become much more confident with all of my skills. Never had a task that I could not complete, always had help any time I needed it but was also always given the opportunity to show everyone that I could complete everything on my own. I had a wonderful relationship with every single person I met in the company and was so dedicated and genuinely loved making my store the best and helping any others stores that needed just to help my franchise grow."

I learned a lot about communication and being able to handle different personalities and age groups. The management was very reasonable with the amount of hours given to each employee, strict when needed to, and nice to everyone.

I was bringing my home life into work and in the end it screwed me over. I love this company so much and if I ever got the chance to work at another Panera, I would jump at the chance. Usually I came into work, counted the money in my register, and got to work. I got a 30 minute break and then it was back to work. I usually worked about a 6-8 hour shift. The workplace is amazing. Absolutely no tension between people. The hardest part of the job would have to be adapting to new positions. Sometimes you'll be on the register. Other times, you'll be serving food. It varies each day. The most enjoyable part of the job is that my coworkers were basically a second family."

We have friendly staff who work together like a family rather than a boss to associate relationship, which creates a fun and low-stress working environment. The only reason I resigned from this position was because I knew I'd be relocating to another state to get married and start my new life. I was still well under my 90 day probational period as a new associate, so transferring was not an option. I'll try to apply as a new hire in my new state and hopefully, Panera Bread will take me back. We'll see what happens."
good,It's an amazing place to work there are a Lotta youngsters that work there but they take care of there employees wonderful company they work with you in anyway they can you get 70% off your food the managers are great
good,"Overall, really good environment and because other employees come from all walks of life your co-workers are very interesting an range in age. Sometimes corporate office seems to be a little out of touch with what works best in the field, but overall good environment. There is also sometimes a lack of communication from top to bottom, which makes working difficult at times but a good opportunity and learning experience."
good,The stores I worked at were all great places. The baking all takes place overnight so you have to be a night owl to be able to stand the job. Over all was a great experience.

This is a place you want to sit down with friends and talk for a few hours or come here for coffee and study, not just an in and out fast food place to hurry and get something to eat. Working here has been so much fun. The hardest part of the job is probably handling unhappy customers, but even then, they are usually understanding of the situation and still leave happy."

Usually the store is pretty busy at breakfast, but that varies by location.After breakfast you have a brief period to clean the dining room being that it is the cashier, and dish person's job to maintain the dining room mess. As the lunch rush comes be ready to mess up, it happens. Learn from your mistakes and you will get better as time moves on.

That the only reason i quit i wish they wouldn't ever gave me a raise. I will still be there probably

And I highly doubt I'd find somewhere better than the welcoming environment Panera gives to employees.. I highly suggest working for them."

I learned that trying a majority of what is on the menu can make a difference when explaining how everything tastes on the menu. The management gives you an opurtunity to grow with the company. Co workers are always helpful.  Hardest part of the job is realizing that you some customers can be hard to deal with. Most enjoyable is seeing all the people you have made happy.

good,"	Handle customer inquiries over the telephone, take accurate messages and transfer calls to appropriate person in efficient manner."
good,"I came in with a good attitude and left with a good attitude. Most people at restaurants from what I have learned is that a lot of people do not. Work hard coming early and leaving late. I learned how to be dependable, wake up earlier and do mundane tasks like organizing even though I was not very good at it, at the time. The staff was the best part about me being and staying there. The hardest part about being in Panera bread and any other restaurant that I have worked in is that I have a hard time staying clean. I get a little too into my work and I move too fast. I enjoyed doing a lot of work and picking up the slack. It eels good to be a good worker. I especially love being competitive."

The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast pace of a popular quick service restaurant, but the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the enjoyment of our food by our customers."
good,I loved to work with Panera!!! I started off as an Associate and grew up within the company. I loved the environment and customers.

good,I see myself being apart of something great and why I say this is because Panera Bread has an excellent ground and  ive learned that no matter where you go you are recognized right on the spot.

Everyone makes you feel welcomed and they are very fun and positive majority of the time.

good,"When you are on the baking side of things you are completely alone to run your shift.  You go through an extensive 6 week training to make sure you are able to handle anything that happens.  However, if something were to come up that needs attention the management is only a phone call away and can come if there is an emergency.  I enjoyed this job completely and I would recommend it to anyone.  It is a great way to learn that you are self sufficient."
good,"I was fresh out of high school when I got this job. My very first job actually. Everyone knew the business except me, but that didn't phase me from putting myself out there. Wasn't the best salesman, but all the guys loved me anyways, best first experience of my life!"

good,"I worked with Panera Bread Company for five years. "
good,"Panera Bread is a very fun exciting place to work, and has a great atmosphere if you are looking for a place with yummy healthy foods, awesome smoothies and stellar deserts. I am a baker, so I bake and produce certain foods for the next day. Though it may not always be easy at times, you get use to the lifestyle quite quickly."

good,"I just loved working here. I was so sad to leave after such a short stay, and when I left Altamonte Springs, FL. there was no Panera Bread in New Orleans built yet. Panera had the best management, the friendliest employees, and it was just the overall best place to work."

good,"steady breakfast and lunch hours, keeps you going and on your toes. You learn to be patient with others in dealing with different personalities, fellow employees and customers alike. Great bunch of co-workers, you really get to know each other. The hardest part of the job is when a co-worker leaves going back to school or moves away and the most enjoyable part is knowing your customers are satisfied."

It is especially busy around all holidays. Mostly Christmas. I was a trainer for Panera for 3 years. I made sure every employee that came through the door had a fresh new step into learning a productive position in the company. I made sure they were aware of the company as a whole then helped them learn every position that was required for them to work. I kept logs of their progress and computer work.

good,"This was my first job at the end of my senior year and I had an amazing experience. All of the employees and managers provided me with a friendly and enjoyable environment. The best part of the job was being able to work with such charismatic people. The hardest part, however, was trying to keep the tickets under 3 minutes during the busy lunch rush.

good,I absolutely love working at Panera Bread. Everyone works together with little to no problems. The management is absolutely fabulous. They take initiative and go out to talk to the customes; check up on them and make sure everything is okay. My co-workers are very easy to get along with. The hardest part is probably the fact that it is not in the line of business that I am going to school for (animal science).

good,I loved everything about this job. My co-workers were a family and we always made sure one another was okay and if they needed help we would help them. My management team was also awesome.

Most of the managers were excellent, but there were a few who had issues with being able to communicate with one another properly. I love each of my co-workers, they were an amazing team to have during a lunch rush! The hardest part of working at Panera was knowing what to expect. Everyday felt like a new adventure. I enjoyed working at Panera because it was a friendly work place with very little drama."

good,"Typical day at work varied depending on which part of the restaurant I was scheduled to work (cashier, production, back of house). As a cashier, a typical day consisted of taking and filling orders. On the production line, a typical day consisted of working together as a team to produce orders quickly, accurately, and efficiently. In the back of the house, a typical day consisted of keeping up with dishes and maintaining a clean appearance in the dining room. My co-workers and managers are some of the best people I've ever worked with, although there are the occasional sticks in the mud who, in dealing with them, are the hardest parts of the job. The part I have enjoyed the most is seeing regular customers and getting to know some of them on both a personal and professional level on top of memorizing their usual orders."
good,"Responsible for opening store with assistance of a manager.  Accountable for greeting customers and providing excellent customer service.  Gathered customer’s orders and maintained accuracy for best quality.  Monitored cleanliness of restrooms and the overall work environment.

Its a very busy atmosphere which is a PLUS! Ive learned to multi-task & be confident when working in a busy atmosphere. My co workers are awesome & very mature.. We make each others day just by coming too work! The hardest part of my job would be when everyone gets stressed @ times when we're backed up during lunch rush or run out of dishes.. However all in all we always get thru it. The most enjoyable part would be to see  my customers happy & leave with a full belly & smiles on their faces."
good,A typical day of work I will set up the production line for lunch while serving breakfast to our customers. At lunch I will train employees if needed while working the production line.

good,"A typical day at work was routine and organized. I came in everyday, set up my work, and got to it. I learned a lot of sales techniques and customer service skills. Management was always helpful to me with any problems I had, as were my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was the cold calling sales.

Management is great very easy to get along with as long as you are doing things right. Co-workers are the best, they have your back. The hardest part of the job is at the end of the night when we all have to get everyone out so we can close and lock the doors.

We talk about how the night went,what we seen that made us laugh, and how much tips we made if we want to tell eachother about our tips."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and I made a lot of new friends. It also helped me maintain good customer service habits, and has made it easier for me to conversate with people in other jobs."
good,Of every job I have had working any fast food job seems the easiest. It's always fast passed so I do not have to worry about slow times and loosing hours. When working fast food you learn to be patient and keep calm in stressful situations. The hardest thing about working fast food is occasionally messing up because if you mess up it ruins the flow of things which makes it harder to get back on track.
good,this job was a good team environment i enjoyed it very much the leaders worked just as hard as they would have liked you to.
good,"As a Via Coordinator it was always very fast paced, dealing with clients, always made sure that theywere happy with the services thatI provided. Managment Team..... what I can I say they were right on the ""Ball"", they could handle any and everythingthat was put in front of them. Really no issues with the job, getting new clients was the only thing that took a little bit of time, but once I found my groove I increased sales by $10,000 for the year."
good,You have a great opportunity to excel in this business and move up on the scale of importance.
good,"it was alright, management was fun and nice, customers are always pleasant to have also"
good,The whole environment is amazing. The managers are understanding and everyone is treated like family.
good,"A typical day at work involves handling money, serving guests one on one and working together with leadership and co-workers to provide the best work and guest environment possible. I learned that good leadership makes all the difference in a cafe, and a management team that reflects the core values of the company is essential to having a positive working environment. The management team genuinely cares about the wellbeing of their staff and the satisfaction of their guests. My co workers all have different attitudes when it comes  to their jobs, but many are upbeat and enjoys  their work, happy to help one another.

The managers at Panera are helpful and understanding. Same with my co workers, my first close I had learned so much, and noone heistated to help me if I had became confused. Hardest thing depends on where you're working and what day you're working. Most people have a hard time when we have rush hour yet I like it. I enjoy the rush and being quick on my feet.

After learning my task for the day I start completing the task rather it be the dining room where I clean all the tables and socialize with all the customers in the restaurant. I am a very organized individual at this restaurant. My co-workers are always ready to lend a hand if I ever get into a position that I cannot handle. What I learned from this job is to be very punctual, be on time for every shift, and to do the task you are asked to do well. The most hardest part about my job is balancing out time to do all the tasks that my managers want to perform. The most enjoyable part of my job is socializing with the people in the restaurant and hearing about their day and what careers they have done in their past.  "

good,"A typical day at work, after arriving, would begin with greeting co-workers, then cashing a drawer to be used for handling. The money to begin the day with was to be counted, 200 dollars, and then counted at the end of the shift. During my shift I would provide customer service by greeting in a friendly manner, expressing ""panera warmth"" as it was called, that is, making the customers feel welcome. We were to remember names and even specific orders of habitual customers, which became quite enjoyable. This panera is perhaps one of the busiest because of its location right off the highway. I learned the necessity of listening and paying attention to customer needs. The managers were very friendly and encouraging. Co-workers were the main ingredient to the success of a day because where that failed, all else usually crumbled. The hardest part of the job was when orders were done improperly because it affected the customers, but with due kindness, they did not get angry. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning and meeting new people and now most approach me by name, which is pleasant."
