rating,review
bad,Manager don't care about the people that work their treats employees like they don't worth nothing..he rather hire new people than to keep the employees he has happy ..no pay increase if so it's very poor.
bad,On call subject to change bad pay old trucks horrible office staff put in dangerous situations often really the worst job I have ever had in my life no lunchtime in three years
bad,"Horrible management always changing"
bad,This company choose up employees and spits them out everyday I worked there for 11 years I don't know how I managed to stay there that long I would never recommend this company to anyone nor would I ever go back to work they're dangerous and unsafe working conditions management who just does not care.
bad,This Company did not support the office that was new and trying to regain customer's.  They would not work with me when my husband became diagnosed with Cancer and bypass surgery and I was needed to drive him to dr appointment.  The main office is in indy and that's all they cared about. There prices could not met smaller communities to be competitive.
bad,Giving one star is too much. Horrible micro management. Pay is horrible and they lie to you constantly. On call schedule for a week at a time is a joke and they will mess you over with that.
bad,"All politics... could care a less how good you did or how much you changed things for the better! Comes down to personal relationships and who’s butt you willing to kiss! Do not work here, they treat you like dirt. Turnover is crazy and they don’t want to pay good employees what they are worth... and they wonder why they are left with unmotivated workers. Pass on this company,  there are much better opportunities out there. And also the pay is absolutely horrible for the amount of responsibility in the position that you hold !! Farewell Gas should be their new name, because in less than a year, you will want to say Farewell!!!"
bad,Don't waste your time with this company too many bosses don't expect anything from this company just your paycheck no bonuaes all the employees including  your supervisor talk about you behind your back. Dispatcher was a joke safety personal was a joke everyone wants to be the boss go with amerigas if u want to work in the propane industry
bad,"To many bosses, doing nothing and sitting around while workers are busting but to get their daily work load completed. There was a struggle over territory and  climbing the ladder."
bad,This company  is cut throat. Upper management does not support employees who bring to light unethical practices within the organization and strive to cover up those unethical practices.
bad,"I wouldn't advise anyone to apply to work for this company. Very long work hours, on call daily, dealing with rude customers daily. Dealing with very nasty situtions."
bad,Ferrellgas was not the place for me. You work so hard but don't get anything in return. A big corporate company was just not for me at that time. I decided to move on
bad,"I would answer the phone and take orders for propane, receive payments, open new customer records and negotiate the price of propane with the managers. I learned all the above. A large company that competes with other propane companies for new customers. The hardest thing was the job for me was in another county and I had to drive far. I got to meet new people daily."
bad,"I am an Operations Manager. "
bad,This Company has no respect for the employees and does not recognize their performance when a job is well done. Management is very unsociable and does not reflect a good role model for anyone under management to follow.
bad,"stressful place to work, management and dispatch do not work together, every morning drivers do not know what they are going to do for that day, no raise after a year of employment , only good thing from this place were the employees , management and dispatch never answer phone calls they always have meetings. cannot work overtime"
bad,"Worked at the Sand Springs office in Oklahoma. While i learned a lot about the business that i will no doubt take with me, THERE ARE NO LEADERS,  ONLY MANAGERS....AND THEY AREN'T GOOD AT THAT.  If you're our looking for a place where you work for pennies, get no respect....this is the job for you. If not, keep it moving dont waist your time....TRUST ME!"
bad,The company provided a lack in professional Enviorment. No training provided..
bad,"A typical day  you will be working with unsafe equipment,driving a older badly maintained unsafe truck,trying to get dispatch to route you which could take hrs. Management will not help you with any problems you will have.This job was by far the worst place i have ever worked and i would not recommend anyone to work there. This job is extremely dangerous and poorly managed"
bad,"Heard this was a good company to work for, then got a job and found unorganized, bad management and no raises in years."
bad,the work is grueling and seemed never ending. Management is rude and unappreciative its workers.  Working in a mud pit every day caused my car to sustain damage that I'm still paying for.  Being on-call is frustrating & occupies your life.  My next job will be nothing like this.
bad,The drivers are treated like dogs and there was low pay long work hours and always another deadline to be met! Terribly poor management team with horrible business ethics!! They will do anything for the next dollar!
bad,The day I started the material handler and a driver warned me about the job. I didn't listen. The 3 of us dont work there anymore. They cant keep workers because CDL Drivers dont want to be worked like General Laborers!
bad,They are unorganized and don't treat you with respect. They listen to other employees about something before they even ask you. I preferr no one to think of Ferrellgas as a career
bad,"The position I was in, Operations Manager, was actually three jobs rolled into one. They expected you to manage all of them to the utmost perfection which meant you were working 70+ hours a week. Even then, you were behind. Unless you come in having already been in the propane industry for years and know all of the jobs backwards and forwards, you will burn out trying to do it. If you come in with no experience, you must get ALL of your training done before attempting to do any managing. That means Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 along with proficiency for all 3. Typically that would take approx. 3-4 months if they allowed you to do that. Good luck with that!"
bad,"Management has no clue what they are doing. Under payed, over worked and be ready to get called out in the middle of the night and on weekends just for them to cut your hrs in the week. Dog eat dog world at Ferrell. And if the work gets to be to much don't say anything because kiss your butt good by if you do."
bad,No pay for on call.  !   Not the same day off each week !  Do not come here if u like being happy at work! 32 hr is full time in the handbook. So look out  for that!
bad,"Poor management- they are 2-faced Drivers are great, coworkers know what needs to be done but Communication is extremely poor. No time off from Nov until March (busy season)."
bad,"Management has not a clue what there doing , very under paid long days long hours micromanaged avoid if possible would recommend this job to kno one who holds a cdl."
bad,"Had some good years at this company and unfortunately the local management did their best to run off and fire all their caring and knowledgeable employees to bring in green And unknowable people to work with propane. Very bad combination if you ask my opinion, poor and unethical boss that makes up trumped up lying stories to get people fired. Corporate should have stood tall and supported their long tenured employees, unfortunately they do not and allowed childish bullies to control the reigns. It’s sad because this is all that’s holding this company back. I still cannot believe how bad this all turned out in the last few years and not to mention this company is in financial disparity, just check the stock prices. Stay away from this company unless you are single and have no personal life and enjoy being threatened and demoralized by the director of operations."
bad,Very unfair place to work. Was being sexually harassed on a daily basis and management did absolutely nothing about it BESIDES giving the guy who was doing so a raise and a promotion for the job that i was already in training for
bad,"Little to no training, over worked, under paid, horrible management. Day one I was told I got the job, worked for two days than was told i wasn't needed, a week later I was told to come back in and work. took over a year before I was considered ""Full Time""."
bad,Overworked and under appreciated! I was a part-time Material Handiler and worked 50-60 hours a week easily every week and never had help. I'm talking I would come in at noon and not leave until 4 or 5 the following morning. Prepared to be overworked all week and weekends
bad,"Worst company I ever worked for!! Management treats you like a monkey! You will not be working out of location specified, you will be working out Tiverton delivering blue rhino! Save yourself the aggravation!"
bad,"Stay away from this company.I left a job I loved to work here, wad attracted to the pay.but no pay is worth the abuse you take from customers and management. They set you up for failure with poor training and even worse management. No one knows what they are doing and are unwilling to help. Placing an order for propane should not take 400 steps. My friends when I say RUN I'm not stuttering....RUN!!!!!!!"
bad,Avoid at all costs this company has management issues it also has one of the worst csa 2010 records in the sector( Just look it up)
bad,"Used to be a great place to work until I continued to get new GM after new GM. The current GM in place has created the worst moral that I have ever been a part of or seen anywhere I have worked. Until he is gone the place will not thrive. GM likes to distance himself from learning the business and leans heavily on staff for all of his answers to corporate. Many unethical situations are taking place with GM that will not be aired on a public forum. I would steer very clear of this place unless you are ready to work 7 days a week year round while the rest of the management team does their 9-5 schedule Monday-Friday. Employees are treated unfairly and managed through fear tactics. No open door policy if you talk to management about issues you will be a target for termination. Management brought in a porta john for the drivers while the managment and office staff were the only ones allowed to use the indoor facilities. No raises in years and bonus structure has been widdled away to nothing. No opportunity for advancement as outsiders are the preferred method of hiring. You have been warned, STAY AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE!"
bad,The company has a lot of debt and legal issues that doesn’t look good for the future! They have horrible Managers that don’t do their jobs. Just not a good place to work.
bad,"Finally out of this toxic abusive situation. When he'd belittle me in front of others I would make excuses like ""he's just stressed"". When he would cuss at me I would make excuses like "" he's just playing"", when he'd talk about me behind my back and thrive in the drama of others, I would make excuses like "" he's known them longer then me"". When he'd make me work overtime, not take a lunch, or come in early and not pay me for overtime I would make excuses like "" I'm am doing my job to the fullest"". The emotional and verbal abuse at a place of employment is not acceptable. This man abused his position as a general manager, and got away with it I resigned today."
bad,Reported a long time problem employee who has had confrontations with several employees including myself which created a hostile work environment.  That employee was terminated but so was I. Manager was also pressuring me to quit which I also reported and imagine that lo and behold I was fired!  If you go there it seems great at first but you soon understand the reasons for their high turnover rste turnover rate
bad,"The people who work hard are passed over and the suck ups are promoted."
bad,"Long hours, middle management constantly trying to push sales, (interesting since they are selling their propane for much higher than their competitors), and constant shifting of blame, responsibility, etc."
bad,"Different location might be different. However Inver Grove heights location has out dated and unsafe vehicles for driving.   New GM is a liar and a fake so if you apply here DO NOT believe a word he says. I can only comment on this location, others may be fine, however new GM oversees all of Minnesota I believe so tread lightly. If you don't heed the warnings of this review, in time you'll see, and you'll remember this review!"
bad,"Would be a great job if there was any leadership. Terrible work environement, zero respect for employees. Lots of backstabbing. They are always hiring because of high turnover rate. Older drivers skip stops or short deliveries then newer guys get those stops added to their route.If you are a solid worker who wants to be treated right this is not the place for you. You will be sorry like I am. That's why I am on this site looking for a new job."
bad,"As a former delivery driver, I was on on call all but 4 days a month. Would be called out in the middle of a blizzard at 2am to drive 2 hours to fill a tank so the customer could have a hot shower in the morning. Absolutely no regard for employee safety nor your time away from Ferrellgas. Stay away!"
bad,This not a place where you woould want to make a career due to mgmt uses personnel as scapegoats and you are fairly heard .
bad,Horrible company  long hrs horrible pay.  The competitors  pay better and offer better benefits.  Wouldn't  suggest this job to anyone. Poorly managed  an just a zoo.
bad,communication with boss's and employees is minimal. nobody answers their phones or returns you calls in a timely fashion. you are essentially on your own once you get hired training is very lax. you will not ever get a raise.they don't care about you as an employee and will work you more hours than they tell you and don't care about your family life or home priorities.
bad,"Thank god every day that I quit, worked my butt off for this company for 8 years and it was the most stressful time of my life. Management knows nothing any everyday you’ll wonder how the company is still in business because of how it’s run."
bad,"The manager is unprofessional, arrogant, belligerent, bully. I sprained my shoulder on the job doing cylinder exchange, I worked 15-18 hour days and he did not appreciate anything I did. He would sit in his office all day, every day just monitoring my work on the handheld to see how fast I was working and add more work from other drivers routes. He tries to intimidate you into doing what he wants, stares at you with this uncomfortable look. Thinks he knows everything. If you are a minority, he does not want you to touch any of the automatic trucks which are the newer trucks, you have to drive the older trucks. Monitors you all day through his cameras while you're on the property. Becomes aggravated when you get injured on the job and seek medical attention. There is a reason why they're always hiring in Conley, GA. Racist. The last day I was there, the manager cut an hour from my work day, the day before, claiming I did not work that extra hour so he took an hour away from me, and an half-hour away from the last day I was there, claiming that I was sitting for the last 30 minutes and said he would not pay me for that hour the day before and for the half hour for the current day(last day.) As a Floater, the manager told me I would be working whatever schedule the drivers route im doing for the week. So, if the driver works Monday thru Thursday and off Friday, that's what you will be working that week. And the last week I was there, because he was short on drivers, he tried to cheat me. He tried cutting time wherever he could so that I could work a full 8 hour day, Friday and"
bad,Not a good place to work for. Lifting 55 pound cylinders all day long. About 130 on average you have to move everyday and working outside in the elements. Long hours about 50 hours every week and being on call for a week every month. $20hr pay isn't high enough for that kind of work.
bad,"This place is so embarrassing to work for. I worked the front desk and the managers have no filter, in front of  coworkers and  customers. I was ashamed of our management. No respect for one another what so ever. Their is an open door policy but every one knew your business if you talked to any of the managers in private about any personal issues. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Don't pay enough for putting up with management."
bad,"They cut people for the most idiotic reasons just to make a bottom line. They are ""ok"" if you just want a temporary position to make the bills, but I would not recommend expecting to retire from there. And their equipment is severely antiquated."
bad,"I have worked there for 8 years and seen a revolving door of management. It all started when they decided to get rid of all the ""Duplicate"" management"" Ferrell gas and blue rhino"" . management is on duty 24 /7 so they burn out in about a year . They don't promote from within so the people they hire start from zero and get thrown to the wolfs. As a driver you hard work but pays well. its a young persons job. your body can't take the abuse for too many years as i'm finding out."
bad,no hours and summer long hours in winter and no job securityand all the customers yell at you because of the price
bad,this company is a joke they treat you like junk and then throw you away. The job is great and I loved doing the work just not for ferrellgas. The reason I was let go is because the os didn't like me so he lied to the upper management and I got let go because I used my key loop wrong (which I didn't ) & he would have known that if he would have done his job correct. They also expect you to work 40+ hours per week but don't pay you for it they say they will and then they don't if you tuen it in on your time card they erase it and pay you for 40 basically this company is a joke like I said
bad,"If you like working for a seventh grader then this is the job for you.  CSR Manager is not able to manage anyone with a strong personality.  Therefore she makes up for it on ones that don’t talk back, or put her in her place.  I have a lawsuit pending.  Stay away."
bad,Customer service reprensatives were very fun to work with all ways willing to help they made you feel like part of the family. All the drivers were outstanding.
bad,You r just a number with no name ! Upper management over paid an over rated ! I do not recommend working here ! The drivers / Csr / an techs r the back bone of the company !!
bad,Low pay for delivering around 350 plus propane tanks to convenient stores. By the time your done with day all you want to do is lay down. It was modern day slavery! I'm glad I ain't there anymore!
bad,"Dead end job with no advancement opportunities. Insurance is no good but the 401k is great. No support, work structure culture or backup from human resources or management. Company has cut workers to the bare bone while and rarely updates equipment even when needed. Equipment is often taped together or rigged to get through another work day. On the bright side they work around your hours."
bad,Beware lest ye explode. They will and do send unqualified personnel out on service calls. A quick internet search will reveal their dirty secrets. They'll kill you and say it was your fault. You must be licensed to go out on service calls alone.
bad,Management is incompetent and dishonest but I think that is just a local problem.  The pay is about right but you pay a lot for the benefits. Good coworkers.
bad,Was offered a full time position only to have them renig it away to give to someone else who had 3 dependents. Got offered partime instead for 40 hours a week but no benefits. I’d say discriminative to say the least. Dishonest people from top to bottom. Pure liars to the core.
bad,"Very high turn around, always under staffed,over worked, raises are not given, no appreciation at ALL, no bonuses and next to NOTHING for compensation on gaining sales. Managers are awful."
bad,"Management is the worst I've seen.  They cause havoc daily and put it all on you. Equipment breaks down daily and they expect you to handle it. Trucks with deployed airbags, no brakes,  no a/c and they still expect you to get 24 stops done in 95 degree heat then complain daily that you dont do enough for them for the dismal pay they give you.  Keep away from this place there's a reason they cant keep people."
bad,I wasted 2 years of my life with Ferrellgas they will run you to death and if you go above and beyond of what is expected they will having you do your stops and other driver stops also they can't keep drivers so they are always understaffed they will tell you anything to get you to work for them except in the peak season to run 60 hrs a week and you are on call all the time and I don't care what they tell you you will pull a 12 to 14 HR shift and turn around a few hrs later while sleeping and get a out of gas call and you have to run it and 3 to 4 hrs later you return to bed and sleep a few hrs and get up and run another 12 to 14 HR day and you will get called out  no question about it. As a driver you are responsible for everything like housekeeping all the up keep on the truck and making calls and setting up repairs for the truck you do everything and I mean everything on top of running you butt off during peak times and the pay is very low for what you do not even close to what you do the managers are over worked and spread thin I couldn't have asked for a better managers but their hands was tied and couldn't do much to make my job a little easier they was so short staffed
bad,"Suspended Friday & fired today with no charges or investigation  Stock prices crashed , company trucks are rotting away on wheels .nothing good  to report"
bad,The work ilegal about DOT hours. You never clocks in or out. Just report you hours at the end of the week. That’s way no body can’t tracking the DOT hours.
bad,"New management that doesn't know what they are doing. Gossip about their employees, scream at them in front of the customers. Very unprofessional, especially with employees"
bad,"Management was very bad, they lower your hours so you quit if they didn't like you, All my goals were high and management knew they had no reason to fire but I kept coming in with low hours, I had better call volume then other girls, I was always at top of list and they knew it and it showed on my paper calls which I kept for reference.  I was a very good customer specialists it was the management  that was very bad, after I quit all the other girls quit too or got fired."
bad,Good luck trying to enjoy family time in the summer because its not going to happen.If your single and dont like being home early and working every weekend than apply.
bad,Constant management turnover(4 om's and 3 dm's in 2.5yrs) and most had no clue about running a propane delivery location. Huge overtime all winter long - make plenty of money but no time for anything except work and sleep. Upper management will dump you in a heartbeat even if you work your butt off for them. Now only hiring seasonal and part time drivers with few benefits. Permanent employees all quitting or getting fired for BS reasons. Stay away unless you only care about the short term.
bad,"Poor management, no raises, no hot water in the restrooms , not allowed to used sick time earned, difficult to use any vacation,  they cut hours or make you work OT, inconsistent"
bad,"No current opportunities for advancement. No raises or bonuses in the last three years.  MAybe a good job for someone not working, but not good for long term."
bad,"Stay away! Was there for years and so many people come and go! People having liquid lunches, not following any policy but as long as your buds with a boss , then you get away with anything!"
bad,"Before employment, you are told there is a ton of room for internal advancement. After employment there is NO advancement opportunities, Seniority comes first over who is available for / needs work. Is a bunch of Micro-Management, a lot of favoritism."
bad,"a day filled with in coming and out going calls, many differnt customers you get to work with on a daily basis"
bad,"Being a material handler at Ferrellgas is more of a young man's job. Late 20s - early 30s takes a toll on your body over time. Work is strictly outside all year so expect brutal summers and freezing winters. Management looks at you like a piece of meat with no regard for your physical well-being. You will be given 0 responsibility as if you're a child with no common sense. Getting a raise as a material handler is like trying to teach a raccoon physics - not going to happen. But you're still expected to break your body to get the work done. ""Potential for bonuses"" is a complete joke, at least for anyone who is not management - they get bonuses regularly. The only path of advancement is by getting a CDL and becoming a driver, which if you look at their reviews, is almost just as bad. The company is run by complete idiots who have a complete lack of common Sense. Just compare the stock prices to other companies that supply propane."
bad,Co-workers were lazy and incompetent. Unfair treatment of employees. Poor communications. No recognition for accomplishments. Poor working conditions. Vehicles not maintained properly.
bad,They do not care that you have a home life!   during the winter months 5-8 add on’s a day on your route.  I repeat do not work for this environment!!  Very unhealthy environment and the avg stay rate of any employee is only 2-3 years.  I watched 3 General Managers quit in 6 months
bad,"Every day is very stress full. Orders are not correct ,charge customers to much for there product. Management is very poor and under trained. NO or very small raises. No set lunch time if you get to take a lunch. They do not promote form with in the company . They think you should be available for them 24/7/365 days a year .The guys I work with are great . The hardest part of the job is not knowing any thing they think they are the CIA. The most enjoyable part of the job is you meet a lot of good people"
bad,Overall corporate culture was not positive. No real management or HR person to improve processes. HR was not actively involved in changing or developing an open door policy. Policies were not in place for staff or management. HR dept was nothing more than 3 recruiters and that is just one piece to HR so individual managers were allowed to do whatever they decided - legal or not. I felt helpless to change anything in the dept. Pay was low in all positions and benefits were just average. Long days for all positions..expectations are 7 am to 7 pm minimum
bad,Work with some good people. Management not so great. Not sure what else I can write to get the minimum amount for this thing to let me finish setting this up.
bad,They tell you home every night worked there 7 weeks 6 week straight spent night out 1 week was training management and Dispatch said that's just how it is I hate when they lie to get you in the door
bad,"Very fast paced, always something to do.  Phone traffic was consistent and the customers were very nice.  Management unfair, loyalty means nothing.  Relationships in the office happening."
bad,"Safety is always our number one priority..... until the price tag comes in and then it is next quarters or next spring's or next year's priority.  We overwork and undertrain our employees and wonder why we can never hire/keep qualified and motivated individuals in my region. "
bad,"Should of closed at 4, cause was not busy to stay open till 5, managment was a hot mess, no vacation during winter months, lots of conflict between all stores, because of management.."
bad,"I stepped down for pay to gain the experience with hazmat and tanker. And believe me, I stepped down. They knew what they were getting from me with low pay and the work load."
bad,"Working day is Monday to Thursday 40 hrs per week sometime we work only 3 days or 8hrs on Thursday when production is slow. Paid is not good you start at $12.00 after you get hired on 90 days only you get is 75 cents more, total when you get hired is $12.75 we no anual increase. To start a job is good but for you get future salary is better find another job."
bad,"Hard to get hours in the summer, way too many hours in the winter. You're on call often including weekends and holidays without pay. No raises or bonus is worth mentioning. There is a serious division between white-collar and blue-collar workers. Blue collar workers are looked down upon. Nuff said."
bad,"Management is not professional, stressful working environment, you are expected to complete tasks you were not trained in.  Coworkers badmouthing the management and tasks at hand.  Customers were rude and overall the company was chaotic."
bad,"long hours no communication with upper supervisors."
bad,They say your job title is customer service and all they are worried about is regaining customers they have lost due the high prices. My walk in customers loved me and would ask how my life was and my manager hated that. A person cant help what the customer talks about. Its more like they want you to be a robot only. You are a paper pusher there. I don't think I would recommend this job to anyone!!
bad,Corporate mentality. Every decision is driven by the bottom line and shareholders. No loyalty to employees or customers whatsoever.
bad,"This companies' upper management team will run this place into the ground eventually! They make poor decisions which in return lose customers and in return, lose drivers' pay! The operations manager at this location is the only positive that the company has! But his hands are tied by the upper management which trickles downhill to the drivers! If you want to be told NO overtime and you like a company that's super unorganized and routes customers totally inefficiently then come work here!"
bad,"A typical day I answered 50-125 calls a day. During slower periods we would work on collection calls. We provided a lot of information about pricing, tank sets, sales of tanks, delivery orders, service calls, and anything requested by the client."
bad,No benefits and some workers lacked good work ethic. Large turnover and disorganized management. Company has since closed and has not reopened.
bad,"Typically have to load and unload propane with forklift, no management to report to in Fredericksburg, and only good part of working your back off is you get to work 3 days and have 4 off."
bad,"Very little supervision day-to-day.  Come in, inspect your truck go out and do your route.  Co-workers were great, but corporate puts tons of pressure on management to get the most out of the workers for the least they can.  The result is a cheapskate mentality, getting by with as little as possible and fudging the rest, with empty promises.   The most enjoyable part of the job was being out and about every day by yourself in the truck, making customers happy, and knowing that regardless of what the rest of the company is doing, you are a success."
bad,"expected to stay out until daily route is completed. inconvenient reload locations-mostly depending on route. inflexible requirements about staying on customers driveways- do not take into account narrowness or amount of curves. expected to work in any weather as if it was clear, dry and daytime. No incentive to bring in additional customers."
bad,Company fluctuated way too much with no defined plan to keep business level.  Company policies were sometimes a little too much and would rip off customers.
bad,"Work 20 hours a day trying to keep up, general manager unrealistic. Great people to work with, management poor. No set goals, day to day survival. Waisted 15 years of my life."
bad,Job was easy but pay is not what u would think you can make more driving a trash truck vs driving a propane truck
bad,Not a job for slackers but good pay if you like being called out of bed at night in the winter and never get home early in the winter.In the summer its better.
bad,Not a bad job if you don’t mind not making money most of the year.The only time you will make money is in the winter and don’t except a raise ever and if you do get one it won’t be much.A lot of favoritism as well and you are expected to do a lot.There are worst places to work but this isn’t much better!
bad,"Lift a lot of weight every day. Guys will not fully cover your route if you take a day off, leaving you to pick up the slack."
bad,Bad management.  Moral issues caused by poor management.  Untrained management.  Power/control issues with people placed in management positions.  Pay not up to standard.  They do have good benefits.
bad,Stressful working environment. No opportunities for associate workers to provide advice and support.  Constant phone interaction with irate customers whom felt unfairly treated by Ferrell Gas.  Short time given on phone with customer to satisfy dispute. Frustrating that customers needs were not handled properly.
bad,"Company is all about the bottom line, and will cut you out of the picture very fast.  You may work 40 hrs a week you may not. Routing is a joke and customer service is very poor"
bad,The day at Ferrellgas started out with sorting out all the mail and delivery to all departments. Moving of some furniture and answering questions from other employees regarding facility operations. Processed mail to go out and be picked up.
bad,"good workplace"
good,Decent job. Decent benefits. Terrible pay. Worked for 3 years never have I received a raise. Have to wait years for openings to be allowed to advance forward through company.
good,"They do cool things for their people but it doesn’t pay very well. Their compensation isn’t very good either. However, I have been happy with it for the most part."
good,Ferrellgas and Blue Rhino both in Taneytown M.D. Ryder tractors are dreadful and shouldn't be allowed on the road. Bobtail shouldn't be left out because they are trash as well. Newer trucks will be here in the next year or so. Management sucks at communicating anything. If your cross trained you never actually know what you're doing. Pay is decent if you threaten to leave. They will give you more money so they dont have to look for new employees.
good,I worked for Ferrell Gas 3 yrs they don't give raises or bonuses and management shows alot of favoritism with certain employees..if your looking for a secure job it's good but don't expect anything else. Also 10 months out of the year you only work 40hrs..
good,"I have only seen a manager 3 times in the last year. The last time was one I never met only coming by to tell me I was fired for ""talking bad"" about the company. Wonderful folks to be associated with."
good,When I first started working there it was good I got along with everyone but as time went I started to see why this job has a high turn over rate which I was even told by the Manager. This place will overwork you with no appreciation shown and the people that I worked with while I was there did not like being there and was looking for other employment. I learned how not to treat your workers and if an issue comes up between workers you deal with it in the manner it should be and not just blow it off like it isn't a big deal.
good,Great place to work for a new person out of school or semi retired.  Not for the person middle of the road in his career path. Very poor internal controls on cash.
good,"Poor management, pay is not good. Main job duties pump of railcar, pump propane, and run front counter. Daily bank deposits. The benefits were ok. You can move up to a driver or a service tech. I would not go back to this location because of the service tech is hard to work around and is not professional."
good,The company could be great as a whole but the branch I worked wasn't so great. The manager was unskilled and pressured drivers into unsafe situations. The pay was low for the jobs I performed.
good,There is little room for advancement or compensation. Most of the management is out of state and there is constantly a merging of service centers and major changes in policies.
good,"Amazing benefits, overall the company itself it great. Each region is managed differently, sometimes you get a good manager and sometimes not so good. Definitely not a transparent company."
good,"kind of ok. dead end job. being on call is rough. Management is very hard to deal with. decent people to work with, but the job is hard work for the money they offer."
good,Pay was good. To many consultants and to many changes for the bad.
good,"My immediate supervisors treated me well, the company is a good company to work for if you are willing to work very long days and don't mind leaving the comfort of your bed to chase out of gas calls."
good,"Winter versus summer is an amazing contrast. Summertime means hourly labor cutbacks, flex help layoffs, and major spending cuts. Winter becomes a hectic mess of long days and 6 or 7 day weeks with employees forced to work OT regardless of choice, and holidays missed due to callouts and weather swings. 70 and 80 hour weeks were not uncommon as a manager, with Saturdays and Sundays spent working in the office or from home."
good,I love my job just there is no advancement or incentives. I want to further my career and have job security
good,delivered propane to customers houses
good,delivering propane to customers or doing service work. not tough but not very organized and slow to make needed changes. People there are very nice but not good managers.
good,"Arrived earlier in the morning do an pre-trip"
good,I don't have much to write about Ferrellgas. The entire management was crooked and half of them were terminated due to suspicious company spending.
good,Management had their favorites that they would advance the rest of us would get excuses. They keep you at what they call flex which is considered part time but they wanted you to work 40 hours every week. It was a way they could get around providing insurance.
good,"If you want to get into the business its a place where you are trained very well, I leaned a lot as far as DOT requirements, and went through some intense safety courses with the company that put on in house.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management structure that seems too change very often."
good,"Management structure inconclusive, drivers and subordinates are not understanding who to report to and not management guidance."
good,"I worked in corporate offices in Liberty, MO"
good,Simple day consist of pre tripping your truck with cylinder count. Readying for route delivery. Pretty much on your own. Complete route and go home.
good,This was a workplace of relaxed atmosphere.  Everyone got along like family.  The job duties were enjoyable.  A typical day at work was setting up new client accounts and waiting on customers who came in to make payments.  The hardest part of the job was explaining to clients that they were not approved for credit and had to pay for gas upon delivery.  I did not leave voluntarily.  My job was eliminated.
good,"Taking care of customers needs to install propane gas to their homes for heating, cooking and pools. I was always very busy no down time."
good,"This was an excellent opportunity to learn the propane field. The customer base essentially wants to know just two things!. ""When am I getting my propane and at what cost"" That was our top priority to our customer base.  My days started by reviewing the previous day stats for my customer service reps. How many calls taken and how many calls dropped. Call volume was a seasonal concern, during summer months we were focused on getting our client base signed up for discounted propane when the propane prices have not increased.  I learned a lot about negotiation on propane prices, I learned quite a bit from the Director of Operations about thinking ahead to ensure that the employees were constantly seeking new customers whenever the chance presented itself. The most difficult part was learning the many reports and deciphering how those reports impacted my service center comparatively to the other internal service centers. The most enjoyable part was traveling to the different service centers, spending time with the customer service team receiving feedback and getting to know the staff!"
good,"typical day - prospecting new customers/existing customers for new business.  Coordinating with operations on customers waiting to be set."
good,"Job involves using a small tanker truck to deliver Liquid Petroleum Gas (Propane) to customer tanks (normally at home residences).  Locating customers in rural and semi-rural areas can be frustrating at times.  Frequent driving off-road requires special attention. Handling of liquid propane plus additional responsibilities of the installed systems (customer tanks, gas lines, appliances, etc.) isn't for everybody."
good,Salaried employee's work a TON of hours and expected to sustain that pace. 
good,Enjoyed the job for most of the years I was there. The Co-Workers in my department were the best. Although many are no longer with the company.
good,depending on office location must be able to work independently and with a team - Customers of Ferrellgas are friendly and warm - must have confidence in working on the phone with some cold calling must be able to prioritize as depending on the time of year the day to day varies in call and business volume.
good,"Not to much I can say about them, there pay is ok I guess. I doubt that they  give any type of a raise. The people that work there are good people who is just trying to make a living. The company sucks overall."
good,"Various jobs. Driver, maint. Delivery. As mngt. You have various skills, to gain. As employees you will learn by being cross trained, and learn gas safety measures for safety."
good,"No advancement, no raises to match inflation. Work hours are great. On call once a month for 7 days (required) different rates of pay for completing the same job. Managers hold employees back from advancing."
good,Poor upper management leads to high turn over in the field.  The company vison is not followed or in line with what is followed in field operations.  Employees are left with the uncertainty of always having a job or not
good,Average company to work for.  Manager is supportive and territory is reasonable.  The pay scale needs to be evaluated as it is different in every state.
good,This location has been through several management changes in the time since I worked here.  For me to review would be misleading as I have no idea what the current work day is like.
good,I been working there over 2 years. haven't received a raise. I work long hours during the winter. but it really slows down during the summer time. not a bad place to work.
good,went to another job for better benefits and more pay.  The job was ok but needed a better opportunity with a better grade of work and grade of pay so left
good,coworkers were great people. management not so much; didn't seem to care about staff unless they were making the numbers to make them look good.  Lots of policy changes and nickel/diming customers
good,Pressured to meet quotas for sales of propane tanks and rentals.      Pressured to keep calls with a very limited amount of time when at times seems nearly impossible with the information expected to enter into the software when setting up new accounts.
good,I have worked there for over 6 years and find it a very friendly place to work.  Long hours in the winter with the cold weather but willing to work with you.
good,"Good Company to Work For, But To Many Changes going on with management. Hope They manage things better and work harder on bringing in more work for the disposals...."
good,"very enjoyable Co-workers, never a dull moment.  A little more organization would be good but overall a nice place to work."
good,They only care about the bottom line not their employees. It doesn't seem who they hurt or whats best for the company further just whats best for the bottom line.
good,Lots of work busy days. Very long day during the winter. Shorter days during the summer. Still a full time job. Good supervision.
good,"Good training, Growth Opportunity, Demanding work environment"
good,"great atmosphere for an entry level sales position, good opportunity to learn B2B sales"
good,"Work day can be fast paced from 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. and requiring you to keep shifting gears to make sure customers are taken care of in the most efficient and affective way. During the few slower days you adjust to analyze future demand, equipment requirements and enact a plan to maximize utilization."
good,"I think for the type work and the hazardous conditions and safety requirements ... the pay should be higher. Benefits are standard at best. no pay for being on call , and many times you find yourself having to do more work because of lack of planning or scheduling... poor equipment to work with or none at all (no concept of having the tools or parts to get the job done. The people at my place are decent, management is typical (all about the bottom line, breathe and live propane, propane is the best thing that has ever happened to the planet)."
good,"again this is a place that trys to get by with very few staffing members, and then the customers are the one who suffer"
good,"I didn't like when we where short staffed and this happened a lot. We would have to do our shift and someone elses shift and do it all within our 8 hours. if we did not finish we would get yelled and told that we could not do any overtime. "
good,"The route management system has turned the driver into a useful idiot behind the wheel. Customer satisfaction is no longer the goal. Making a good score on your delivery route is. Competent drivers get the longest routes and most complaints about overtime. If you recommend  changes to benefit a customer (more cylinders or a better delivery pattern) and the computer disagrees, then you are wrong. Even if it is what the customer asked for."
good,"Ferrellgas for many years was supportive and pro-employee and customers.  The philosophy was to put the customers first, and the working climate was great.  Typically we would begin with our routes being sent, and we could use our experience and knowledge of our areas to run our route.  This changed this past year.  Bay City management sent routes that were inefficient and back tracking to run and and we were tasked with following them exactly or get scored poorly.  Many of us became ""seasonal employees"" who would be worked only during ""busy"" months, and benefits were dropped to seasonals."
good,"good people to work with in are division.Pretty much on your own,just get your job done and go home."
good,"A very challenging industry with many different variables to over come constantly each day. A great group of dedicated, hard working co workers getting the job done. Constantly changing management structure to try and find 'Better way' which lessens moral and productivity. It is very enjoyable accomplishing each day and satisfying each and every customer, some days being very long accomplishing that mission."
good,Laid off after working at the company for two months without the possibility of a lay off ever being mentioned during the hiring/interviewing process.
good,It was a sometimes stressful job when people didn't pay and techs were sent out to retrieve or lock off tanks.During a severe winter storm in the midwest we were the emergency call center and helped other stations take calls and assist people to get gas.
good,"Overall good company to work for part time. Full time not to bad but older trucks. Needing repairs a lot. Hours were good. Job of filling on other hand, hard to find customers, no one updated palm devise or routes. always calling dispatch can't find address or customers won't answer phones. Tank way behind houses in bushes, gardens, or just almost out of reach of hoses. Not driver friendly location about 50 percent of the time. Customers Out of gas calls high."
good,"3 person office and not enough work for us to stay busy."
good,"If you like being your own boss and dictating just how fast or slow you have to go, then this may be up your alley. Filling up propane tanks early in the cold mornings and delivering them to customers."
good,Was with this company for over 4 years. After being a material handler for some time I was trained for a driver position. The coworkers were long time employees all who enjoyed their job.
good,This is a great company to work for if you are looking for a stable long term career. The work environment is good with great coworkers. Management is very understanding will work with you if you have obligations outside of work. Overall a good place to work if you can handle working in the elements in good and inclement weather. Opportunity to grow and move forward.
good,Typical day would be working by myself working on propane bottles and when customers came I would fill them up.
good,I only worked here for two years temporarily and they knew that going in I was going to leave in 2 years. But during the time they accommodated me in every way because I was also going to school. Management was very friendly and talk to you real person. However I never received a raise and neither did my coworkers ever. If I had planned to stay there I would have made a bigger deal. The starting salary was ok but you can make more elsewhere. Easy job.
good,I wouldn't  recommend this job to anybody because of the dispatcher in this area. Lot of descent drivers to help out but the supervised are mess & won't  listen when there is a problem with dispatch.
good,"Ferrellgas has laid people off multiple times with absolutely no notice.  The former CEO is now back leading the company after a culture of a ""good 'ol boys club"" continued for a very long period.  I am hopeful that this can be turned around."
good,Company up held management  treating employees on a personal level instead of professional. Upheld management with changes employees hours based of personal issues and religious views.
good,Very excellent place to work good pay and benefits coworkers very cooperative and reasonable and a very fun employment and office staff are very professional at what they do
good,"Been working here for 7 months, and can’t complain about much. District manager is awesome, co workers are great. "
good,"Looking for a full-time job in the Human Services field with the same or better pay and benefits.  Currently obtaining my Master's Degree in Human Services Counseling: Addictions & Recovery, I would like to begin working in my field of choice."
good,"Family retained that home down feeling of home town business.  Many of the office workers were of the millennials generation, due to hours kept.  24-7 on call.  Benefits were kept for those that were full/part time employees."
good,"safely hauled propane with tractor trailer to 60-70 locations in 3 states,"
good,"Training and equipment maintenance during the summer, but heavy work and long hrs during the fall, winter and early spring.  ON CALL 24/7 weekly rotation schedule."
good,"Educated well for each job performed , must anwer each call as they come in . Management is in St Peters MO not with local office work alone with your daily responiblities "
good,Great company to work for and the job work load can very due to weather. they have good benifits and hours to work. I recommend this place as emplyement to anybody
good,"I am a former Logistics Manger for the Southeast United States. responsibilities included but not limited to controlling DOT hours, Managing Drivers, Safety Manager."
good,The company is very friendly and will help you big time with dealing with children and having a personal life.  It was an enjoyable job but just wasn't for me any longer.
good,seasonally fast paced. AWESOME SUPERVISORS & CO-WORKERS!
good,"On a typical day its pretty much the same, do your pre-trip inspection and deliver what ever is on my route sheet for the day. The hardest part of the Job is going in there everyday knowing, in 7 years I have not had a raise, even though they are constantly telling me how great I am for the work I get done. "
good,Enjoyed the 18.5 years I was employed great environment great staff great work place management support top notch Safety was a priority  enjoyed customer relations Office location was convenient
good,Rewarding job if you but the time into your training. Need to be aware at all times because it is a dangerous work place. Make sure you are getting paid enough for the amount of work you do.
good,Would not recommended because it is a corporation company out of Missouri and they have loss there feel for the customers and the employees at the time. Co workers were great until all of us got layoff.....
good,Learned all aspects of propane business Including installation of propane systems on residential commercial and agricultural accts there was a set start time each morning then you would work tell the job was completed .If you were on the gas delivery truck sometimes you work 12hrs a day. Sometimes the job would require out of town work which hotel and per diem was paid The hard parts came when it came to raises or advancement people were being hired making about as much as me company had an ESOP program which recently took a huge drop appox 60%
good,Ok place to work.  While I was there the company was doing a lot of downsizing.  My manager left and the closest manager was an hour away.  Equipment worked most of the time.  Our busiest time was winter and that is when we had the most problems with our equipment.
good,Pre trip deliver propane to customers refill. High turnover of drivers due to a lot of slow time. Having to be on call was a pain.
good,"Enjoyed my time spent there , had a lot of miles to cover in my position, which at times was difficult , responding in a timely manner, but overall was good job.."
good,Was a good place to work until new dispatch systems where put in place that almost bankrupted the company. I believe they have seen the light and went back to their prior operational model.
good,"The drivers I work with are fantastic. We are all one big happy family."
good,"Good place for Corporate Development, plenty of opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in short time frame."
good,"Arrive early to route all drivers for customer deliveries. Take care of daily paperwork and review the work from the day before. Take care of any customer problems. Schedule any service or tank sets at customer locations. Work with the customer service rep. to enter work into the computer. Ride and observe driver functions and determine where training would increase productivity. Upper Management was not a problem for me, as my Districts always fell in the top 10% in company rankings. I enjoyed training many of my co-workers, with the goal of maximizing company profits. Many more day to day management duties to complete."
good,"Good team of guys willing to work together, and help each other out. Good with pre-trip and preventive maintenance on all trucks in the fleet."
good,"NEGOTIATE your starting wage, guys that have been working here for yrs won’t get raises but they’ll hire new guys making 20-21 hr with no experience. So what I’m getting at is they’ll hire you at 21 but if you already been there for a few yrs and make 18-19 hr they won’t raise you up to the new guys pay that has no experience at all"
good,"I loved working there but management changes quite a bit.  The last GM when I left was arrogant and had no clue how to manage the customer service side of the company.  We had an intirem customer service manager come in and crack her whip like we were all terrible at our job.  Very condescending to staff.  Before that happened it was amazing.  It is stressful at times but you learn to prioritize your work load.  I’ll miss the job, not the management."
good,Processed travel logs.  Answered customer inquiries and help resolve complaints.  Cash reconciliation. Bank statements.  Monthly Billing statements.  Account past due collections.
good,"Great place, just wish pay was better , winter time is extremely busy, equipment is dated, need better trucks , new hires are paid better than existing employees, if they would keep up with the cost of living it would be better"
good,"I enjoyed this company, I hired in expecting to be there until retirement, then due to financial distress on their part my position was eliminated, I have no ill feelings just wish it would have worked out"
good,"I managed 3 departments totaling 33 employees.  The Financial Analysis and Budgeting department developed budgets and internal operating reports for 700 retail locations.  The Fixed Asset Department managed over 1 million assets throughout the country.  The Accounts Payable Department processed over 1000 invoices a day including a corporate purchase card program for all employees thoughout the country."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the my job was the people.  Customers and persons you worked with."
good,"Great people to work for, very knowledgeable in the Propane industry. Good on educating customers about Propane and how it works and the safety of the gas. CSE service techs and del drivers are well educated on how to fulfill customers needs."
good,"Started by filling propane cylinders and loading trucks."
good,"I was new at Ferrell and everyone took the time to make sure I knew my job. The manager, dispatcher, the techs and other drivers were all very helpful."
good,Ferrellgas like a lot of the big companies was focused on giving the customers a dependable service. They also focused on customer and employee safety.
good,"It's a good job. Benefits are good but I don't get a raise every yr but insurance goes up. I'm on call every 5th week so I'm use to being on call. I deliver propane to customers, paint tanks in the yard in the summer time or fix cylinders."
good,"New employees are being hired at a higher rate.  IWe haven’t had reliable trucks for a few years. Would start every day with a route. Nearly every day having more (keep Full) customers added to route. I believe this can be managed better. The routing covers areas more than once a week. This can cost more in mileage, fuel, and hours to get these customers taken care of."
good,It was a good job I just got laid off and I need a fresh start for me and my family to provide for them and to show u guys that I am what u r looking for and I have excellent refrences that will tell u IM a great worker
good,District managers did not have understanding of employees being off hurt with doctors notes and going by the books when employees had injury that required time off
good,"Good shop environment where everyone seems to care about helping out. The benefits ESOP/401k are nice, but not the best health insurance plans."
good,"started a 6am and work 8-12 hr day "
good,propane delivery to customers drive truck about 300 miles a day all over NC and SC co workers good a lot of good customers
good,"You make it your own job here.You are your own boss and run it at your pace,for the most part dispatch is helpful through out the day. If you're willing and able you'll travel to many places in CO."
good,"Good place to work and great people for the most part.  Too many ups and downs due to weather.  Salaries move far too slowly, missing merit increases often and then never making them up so you fall too far behind on the IT side.  Very low turnover though and a family atmosphere"
good,"Enjoyed learning on the job, great experience and team-oriented environment. Wish the call center had not closed I would probably still be working there."
good,"It is a very good job if you are willing to work, work all year around. id go back anytime. i really enjoyed working here i dont know what else to say"
good,"work place good but management was giving new hires more pay than current employees and we had to train them, I was listed as service but had to do forklift bottles"
good,"While I do somewhat enjoy working for this company, from my position their is little to zero chance of any advancement. They do not offer full time to many employees and even discourage getting close to it. And in two years have only received a single minimal raise. However it is one of the most respectable and mature working environments Ive ever been apart of. So if your looking for something more on the part time side of things, its an excellent place to work."
good,"Environment at the office and with other employees is great. Very nice people and all are understanding of the job at hand. Must always remember that we were dealing with Hazardous materials being driven around everyday roads with normal commuters. Safety is the number 1 concern always, followed by making to your next stop on time. Only have to deal with the grueling traffic of everyday working hours and minor mechanical issues from time to time but overall a good commercial driving experience and definitely a stable career for CDL holders."
good,Routes would be emailed night before to be reviewed. I would arrive at the office on scheduled work days. I would set up and download my teams computers. I would Pre trip my equipment to insure safety opperation. I would run my route in a safe timely efficient manner. I delivered product safely to accounts and gave 100% customer service. I would continue this process between 16-24 stops daily. I learned many different techniques in customer service. Management with this company was hours away so I basicly ran the satellite office efficiently and as profitable as possible. My team memebers were great considering I trained them and recommended them for the position. The hardest part about the job was actually reaching out to management in other areas for needed supplies. The thing I enjoyed most was the family/Team environment I built. No one was ever left behind. I love working outdoors in Florida and I enjoyed all my customers and relationships i built.
good,Had set routes people were cross trained people were always willing to help
good,i enjoyed my day to day job at ferrellgas'i liked my job very much
good,Very busy in the busy season from October till April then very slow. Good bunch of people to work with. Meeting new people is the best part of my job.
good,"Ferrellgas: Excellent benefits "
good,"great place to work friendly atmosphere. Pay scale is good for the area for a entry level position. Good place for a alone worker, with self motivation."
good,"I love the job, but I just can't make it with what I'm paid. getting out every day and seeing the countryside is great. The hardest part is trying to guess when you'll get home."
good,"Prospecting, permitting selling and retaining accounts."
good,"If you need to be home for  your family and life, this is the job for you."
good,"a good place to work. people are friendly, and hours are pretty good. if your willing to put in the work and time you can move up. trucks are in decent shape."
good,My daily routine consist of me fixing old propane tanks and also filling tanks for customers. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with the high demand on tanks since the company is growing. The nice part of this job is that I don't have to comute a lot but comuting wouldn't be a problem either way.
good,It is a self paced work environment. You learn a great deal of safety habits from management. There is minimal supervision. Winter can be long hours but the coworkers are great to work with.
good,load truck with gas for deliveries.skills in customer service on product lines.co workers hard working.dealing with customer compliants.the managers needed to be more ingaged in daily operations
good,"independent job,learn to handle propane,comunicate with diferent people and companies,have good benefits,salary,driven local deliveries about 120 miles per day"
good,"I opened up the office, I learned how to work with propane, the management where really easy to work with, and the hardest part of the job I think was having to stay logged into my computer all day and would get scolded for leaving to long when I had to fill up propane cylinders, but I liked learning the area in which I lived in that I never new was there and the customers as well."
good,The management where I was was incredibly helpful and gave me tons of freedom to get the work done as I saw fit and not micromanaged. The people that I worked with were top notch and It was definitely a hard decision to leave there.
good,Safely operate and deliver off a propane bobtail.
good,"The company is a mid-west employer with mid-west values. They appreciate employees and recognize their efforts. It's a ""field-focus"" employer and gives recognition to field employees."
good,"Many days it is required to run routes, making multiple stops and lifting many heavy objects 50 pounds or more. After you finish a route you are generally required to reload the truck and maybe do other small jobs around the office before going home."
good,"Ferrellgas is a great company to work for. They have great benefits, insurance is wonderful and a big thing in these times.  The retirement pkg is great too.  You are part owners in the company.  They own so much along with Blue Rhino if you stay with them any amount of time you will be a rich man in your old age."
good,good atmosphere.....You go in to work do your job and got home. Nobody bothers you. Very laid back. Go in download your stops on the handheld. Go do your pre-trip inspection. Complete your stops. I learned alot about the propane business as a whole. The hardest part of the job was to handle the 33lb propane tanks. The most enjoyable part was to get to have my own route and be out on my own.
good,The pay is every other week  the boss in this region is an absolute amazing guy   The work for the blue rhino side is very physical  delivering bbq grill cylinders  about 200 to 300 a day  great benefits
good,"Worked alone in office, drivers are really nice. Loved to work here even though winter you have no days off since its the busiest time of the year. Worked in Imperial location."
good,Great place to work but unwilling to relocate with young kids.
good,"Good to work for, clean and new trucks, clean facility, good personnel at local offices, Lots of Overtime in winter months and during orchard season. up to date technology, hand held delviery system- need dispatcher to have better local understanding- based out of the tri-cities office."
good,"Newer managers that have some kinks to work out but overall supportive. Feels like family, no required/forced overtime, benefits are amazing and we have gotten quarterly bonuses. It is stressful, customers can be very aggressive but not any more so than any other customer service type job. Just like any job there are personality conflicts."
good,My day consisted of filling propane tanks for the next day for the drivers to deliver. Along with refilling propane tanks I would clean the dock and check propane tanks for expiration dates and any malfunctions. If a driver had vacation I would deliver propane tanks with the other driver to help make the day go by faster and make the job a little easier for the driver.
good,"Great place to work, amazing benefits. Management staff was very supportive. Great growth potential that allows one to grow with the company. Long work hours"
good,"Good pay, good benifits. The management is decent. Paid sick leave 2 weeks paid vacation. This what I know about Ferrellgas But I have not worked there since 2010."
good,"Management expects one to get a lot done in your eight hour day; however, the manger has done this job before he made it to the position he is in now so he only expects of you what he knows can be accomplished. You will be expected to work in the weather so if it is cold or hot you will be out in the weather."
good,"Schedule safety meetings.  Give drivers their routes, answer phone, schedule deliveries, fill up propane bottles, enter tickets in pc, balance end of day, do bank deposit."
good,"The job had potential to advance but it closed down. A typical day would be answering the phone, greeting the customers, accounting activities and calculations."
good,"I loved the company i worked for and loved their core values.  But HATED my workplace.  It was always a hostile environment, te management was bad, and when brought to the attention of higher ups nothing was done which resulted me in resigning from my position to keep my health from going downhill."
good,"Enjoyed working there. Good District Mgr. and good General Mgr. "
good,Hard working people and company. Everyone worked together very successfully. I enjoyed my time with this company and the people that worked there. Great job.
good,Good job with very large campus and outer campuses to travel between. The nature of the work was nice and the people were also very helpful co-workers were nice too.
good,Very laid back job environment. Management cares about their employees. Everybody is treated with respect and fairness. I would recommend this job to family and friends.
good,"The day started by checking the messages on the answering service, then logging in to take phone calls, then trying to take as many phone calls as possible while maintaining a high degree of customer satisfaction. I learned a great deal of resolving the customer's issues on the first call, so there would be not need to drag out the experience or risk not calling back. My manager was great, she was concerned with insuring we were up to speed and maintaining a high level of service, most of my co-workers were happy to be there, but there was that one that would find reasons to complain.
