bad,"I worked there over 9 years. It was the worst experience I have ever had. Management is not trained for their jobs. I should have sued Ford for their management and treatment of employees,"
bad,You will end up working your life away you hate your job you hate your life you hate everything you do all you do is work you never sleep and that's the end
bad,"Majorly discriminatory on age. Zero professional development, training budget is tiny and continually cut or it doesn't even exist. Very toxic, aggressive, male-dominated culture especially in product development. The company says one thing in public to please investors and Wall Street and does exactly the opposite day-to-day, then tries to spin that into evidence they are doing what they said they would do. Technology-wise, the company is 5, possibly even 10 years behind everyone else. If you are young and are thinking about starting a family, you might be OK at Ford as they do give you many weeks off if you have a new baby. Otherwise, if you are older, have a family that is already established, are looking for true professional development and advancement beyond just going to work for one of the other automotive companies, you should look elsewhere."
bad,"The company is full of incompetente people which force you to do the things the dumbest way possible just they can check a box."
bad,"They don’t help you and was an all around bad experience. nothing against Paul  he was a good boss, it was his managers and co-workers. Would not recommend for anyone."
bad,Management has no clue how to run anything. The company is overly micro managed and has no structure of people who know what they are doing or how things should be ran. Higher up workers treat us as if we are scum. Constant ridicule from individuals who have no respect other then their own. People who are in the favorite pool get away with everything under the sun and others are disciplined
bad,Worst place to work very stressful not enough manpower ever which creates mass job reductions and eliminating jobs to add to others that are already struggling
bad,This place is for you if you do not have a life and want to waste it they work you till you can’t anymore and then keep making you do the same thing. The Union is something to laugh at and not one of the union reps will care about you they are just around to keep you quiet
bad,A union job. Where you bend over backwards to get anything done but there is no competition at work and it makes everyone lazy and incredibly unproductive. The electricians and machine repairers are literally asleep at the desk and get angry when they have to do any actual work. It's a culture of perpetual laziness and a waste of company resources.
bad,I have been a temporary employee with Ford since 2016 and still isn't hired I been moved around to different departments not eligible for profit share
bad,"Livonia ATNPC is a soul crushing environment, it is a matter of who is in the  supervisors boot licking club, not a matter of who is the best at the position. Probably why they are in the news again for production of substandard transmissions, which is a direct result of the extremely poor leadership at this facility, including the plant manager an main dayshift supervisor. The latter being the type who is intimidated by anyone who is is smarter than him and will purposely put roadblocks in your way, even if he has to lie to Upper management to keep himself employed."
bad,They promise all of these things you'll end up being a temp for years no benefits... they treat you like youre worthless. They let people harrass you everyday.  When you go to hr for help they blame you because there's no proof they do a   investigation. The full timers are lazy and rude most are never there cause they lie and get fmla...
bad,Working at the dealership was not good hours for always wrong underpaid not getting paid for jobs that working for you too and so on and so forth dealership
bad,Management is very discriminative they show no mercy whatsoever. The people are very deceitful & and the union picks and chooses who they want to help properly. And temps are being treated so poorly.
bad,"No work life balance, stressful, constant back stabbing and belittling by upper management. Pay and benefits stink! Only good thing was that you could get a decent discount when purchasing a vehicle"
bad,"Ford USA culture is good but all Indian Manager and leads create worst  culture"
bad,"Not a great place to work.  They don't treat their people like that portray in the media.  "
bad,"Es una empresa rasista desde el acceso, toda la bola  que están ahí se sienten gringos y dueños de la empresa ., RH es una vil mentada de madre con la gente  , rasistas déspotas  soberbios mala paga exceso de trabajo...esa empresa debe desaparecer de México...sus carros son muy caros , sus mantenimientos son carísimos así como sus refacciones..no se cómo México puede tener aquí ese tipo de empresas.. FUERA DE MÉXICO... LARGO"
bad,The job is okay the management is terrible I had an issue that's on going which I had to take multiple days off bc I couldn't work and they litteraly fired me for being sick. Ford is a joke full of people who are racist and think you are under them. I'm being told to wait for a call and il have an answer but I call and call and no one calls back they keep avoiding.
bad,Worst place I’ve ever worked in my life working in a prison would be more fun. I would not recommend this job to anyone. They could care less about anything going on in you life and if someone dies you still can’t take off without getting a write up.
bad,"Extremely fast paced, back breaking job. Your work isn't valued nor appreciated. Non communication between workers & supervisors. To many supervisors on one line"
bad,Not happy with how Ford manages its contractors. They treat the contractors very low and do not appreciate our efforts. There is no concern about our work-life balance.
bad,Managment does what they want with no accountability and owners allow it. Are not for employees.   Very secretive regarding pay and paychecks always wrong. Add in fees that are not disclosed up front. They don't like employees who speak up to better the company. Benefits cost more than you make for a family plan.
bad,Management has no respect for those that are less experiencedthan them and THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO TALK TO PPL AND THE RATS THAT ARE IN THERE ARE LARGE
bad,Strong liberal culture with many people that are nasty and false accusing toward one another. Love and kindness is lacking. There is a lot of arrogant attitude floating in meetings daily.
bad,"I felt like a slave. I don’t work for money I work to keep myself active. Everyone is a number at Ford. One slip up and your out. After you’ve put blood, sweat, and tears into someone else business, for them to not consider you at all."
bad,This was not the idea job. You only got 40 hrs or better is during shut down of the plant.You worked 1day a week. That is not enough to take care of a family. There was discrimination and nepitism being shown to other races.
bad,"this place was terrible. it makes you misrable, long days and you spend most of it in the same spot, my feet back and legs eventually made me quit. The moneys good but it itsnt worth it"
bad,"Not enough pay for all the work that you do..$15 hour ...But your body broken down from lifting , pulling . Hands swelling even from high amounts of ibuprofen there is a Non-Stop speed you have to do for 12 hours a day and even night differential your check is $490 this explains the high turn over!!!"
bad,"Well paid job managers got there picks and the union is worth a quarter. Despite it all I would go back there if was possible lol. Well paid job , weekly pay"
bad,I should have stayed at my previous job. Poor management and very untrustworthy. The union sucks and there is no support no matter how hard you work or never miss any days.
bad,"The job was not a bad job. Some of the co workers had attitudes and gossiped and spread lies about individual. The pay and the benefits were not bad, Just stay to urself"
bad,"Ford has the worst IT and overall management I have ever seen."
bad,"Great people work there friendly and kind. Managment is horrible they look at employees as if,they are just a number or a stat. Union dose absoulty nothing for,you when you need,it and you pay into it.I had a accident after 4 years working there on lunch break and they terminated me for not being there for 2 hrs when I called them they Don't care about you or your family very greedy company"
bad,Management was terrible people are left for dead for they come in as intern with no indication or time frame before becoming full-time. Would not recommend this job for anyone.
bad,"Very poor management, didn't really get to learn very much from managers. Always arguing and not much of a help. I did learn a lot of things on my own."
bad,Did not get compensated well day to day was a struggle to drive to and from work at the hourly rate. Lack of leadership and help from senor employees.
bad,"organizado"
bad,"I was treated unfairly by the Sales Managers and male coworkers.  My sales were sometimes given to other sales people for no reason and I was told a woman is not welcome in the Car Sales industry.  I worked over 10 hours most days, every weekend (Sat. and Sun.) and rarely had a day off during the week.  It was frowned upon to take your day off by the sales managers.  I will never work in Car Sales again."
bad,The job is not worth the hassle. The supervisors are terrible and do not want to teach anybody anything. When they do decide to teach you you have to know everything in 30 minutes or if not they shut the line and write you up and up to HR. Supervisors will ask you to do a dangerous job and if you don’t they are down you neck knowing it life or limb. They rather see people risk there lives to do a job than do it right and safe. Another thing is that you think that the union would stick up for you there but it’s not like that. They are terrible at handle anything that makes them getting up and doing there jobs. They like to do the easy way. They rather get you fired than to save your job so they don’t have to protect your rights as a team member. They are nothing but of lazy people and jokers and all they do is drink coffee and chatting it up with friends than doing there jobs.
bad,"The company wants someone that will come in everyday, never complain. The work is back breaking but once you break your back they will let you go. They have high expectations of you but they wont take care of you if you are not a permanent employee."
bad,"Empty promises of career advancement with multiple relocation's, inconsistent corporate direction and toxic culture.  Consistently restructuring without clear goal of what the organization should look like."
bad,I have seen Ford selling damaged car to customer as new cars and requiring us to lie to the customer  that the quality is perfect. The new employees don't have pride in their job or work ethic. The product we now offer is minimal and embarrassing. I am no longer a good fit to work in such a negative and toxic environment. Looking to work for a company that I can be proud of where fellow employees have a positive attitude and are happy.
bad,"A True Multinational company with diverse work culture, "
bad,Was a temp for a year and a month. Got terminated for being three mins late One day but had a prior incident where I ended up in the hospital and against doctors orders went to work the next day worried I would lose my job. Temporary for over a year and was never made full time
bad,The job with Ford Motor Company ended up being the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.  It ended up being a waste and terrible experience for 22 years 6 months.  After my retirement I will never buy a Ford product and will never have respect for Ford or the UAW!
bad,You go to work every day like any other job and you do the work that is assigned to you and if you do t like the work then they don't need you anymore
bad,"Is a nice place to work for experience but not for salary ,safety is very good some times exaggerate . not as clean at specially in VO , is good as a company when u first get out of collage"
bad,"Ford has a reputation for treating contract workers like low-level employees.  HR will not talk to contract employees and allow managers to blackball contractors out of the ENTIRE company based on relatively minor reasons stated by the manager:  does not like your hair color, does not like the dress clothes you are wearing, Tech Specialist tell Director what to do and Director allows Tech Specialist to bully other employees/contract workers."
bad,"Not what I thought it would be. It's like going to college, it's just not for everybody! It's not a bad place and it's just NOT a good place either."
bad,"Very positive, Good work enviroment. Co workes ae very helpful and cooperative. Facilities are nice and. It has been a great oppurtunity for me to be a part of this team.."
bad,"My duties here included making table bookings, waiting on customers, including taking and delivering food and drink orders and settling of bills. Towards the latter end of my first employment period I was also responsible for the preparation of the staff rota. During my second period of employment I took on the role of Sous Chef and was responsible for the preparation and cooking of the daytime menu.  This role taught me the importance of providing good customer service and I strived to achieve this with every customer served."
bad,"Working conditions really poor,  no carrer progression no benefits...management is clueless and careless...working there is frustrating and makes you depressed..."
bad,"Done nothing. "
bad,"Terrible management, absolutely no help and no progression provided. they say they're there to help the customer but they aren't, they just want to rip everyone off."
bad,"The work place was very unorganized and cluttered, the work environment was filled with disrespecting coworkers. The management team was very disrespectful and how they handled certain situation."
bad,This company does not appreciate it's employees and does not promote hard work and abilities.  Instead they hire and advance people due to employees complaining to HR about discrimination (inept and incompetent employee who didn't deserve any advancement). They favor new people over veterans.  They make exceptions for some people (i.e. Attendance) but not others based on who they like
bad,"Provided administration and maintenance, network and PC based test system support, prevented any downtime resulting in inability to perform required tests from test stands. Provided support to over 400 users."
bad,"Good oppurtunity become ojt in ford motor phils, first work free food free shutle free medical free alllll free.,,.Good co workers"
bad,"horrible environment, treat injured people there with no respect although they were injured working there. NO RESPECT"
bad,Does not provide awork/life balance. Tends to be a hostile work environment.
bad,"	Provided call center support with technical satellite communications to ford Lincoln Mercury Dealers throughout the United States, Canada and Ford corporate sites"
bad,"No comment on this company, would not go back. Needs new management"
bad,"More trainees but less employee."
bad,A day at this company fights trickery from employees use by uwa no   strenght in the company.
bad,"My responsibility was to do driveability problems on cars. Then I transferred to the parts department. I learned that usally if I couldn't find the problem I could still fix it with just knowing the system that was broke. I had a good bunch of co mechanics and shop foreman, but the upper management fired him because he wouldn't lie for them about the warranty claims. Hardest part was them cutting my hours because I wouldn't play along and the most enjoyable part was being at peace with the fact that there were other guys there with integrity also who didn't compromise either..."
bad,"It's early, I'm up Mon-Thurs at 4am and the job itself requires a lot of heavy lifting than normal & its very fast paced."
bad,Test Driving proto type vehicles
bad,Was laid off 3 times in a 10 month span. Management would always lay me off one more day than my actual days worked. Reinstating my start day all over. Needed 2 solid years receive Health Benefits for family. One of the worst jobs and experiences I ever had.
bad,Management  didn't  know their job the longer I was there the worse it was. I was a self motivated employee I took pride in my job and  at one time was proud of Ford and UAW but all of that changes with the nepotism from Ford and UAW it is who you know or who you golf  with. Management was more worried about outside interest than job.
bad,"They pitch it as a dream job but is really a nightmare. As a temporary STS or TBT you are treated like awful . You have four day orientation that really doesn't explain anything and once you get on the floor your put wherever they can put you at. As it benefits you only get health care no Dental or vision and any of your put on a 3 strike rule which means as long as you're a temporary if you get three strikes before you get hired they will fire you. Hiring can take up to five to seven years. You put on any shift and you cannot pick or choose put on morning shift then get put on night shift the next following day"
bad,Ford Plant Chicago was a dream job until I got there. I have been in automotive production for some years now this plant only in the worst managed place I have ever been. The plant build a great car but the upper management team needs to be rebuilt. there is absolutely no help or training for its processes coaches. upper management doesn't offer any help or support to its new process coaches its a throw them in pool and see if they float environment. This is not all Ford Plant just this one in particular !
bad,"Completely unethical. You won’t get paid. You will be personally & professionally attacked and undermined. You will be gossiped about and disrespected. You will work ridiculously long hours and not paid commissions. They are NOT “HOMETOWN HUDSON” as Owners lie and pretend to be, they are out of town business men who are out to make a quick buck at the expense of their customers & staff."
bad,"This job is more intended for someone who really doesn't intend to do too much as far as a career outlook is concerned. It's monotonous, boring, and kinda makes you think about bettering your life.The starting pay is well below average for this kind of work $15.78( I live in the Chicago area so this cannot support a family) But, they have good benefits, which explains the low pay.I hear this has been their starting wage for at least the past 15 years.  The work culture is rife with drug use, favoritism, and unprofessionalism. You get 3 shifts, and you don't get choose to which one you prefer. 6am-5:30pm; 6pm-5;30am(hybrid shift) and swing shift Thur-Fri 6am-5:30pm Sat-Sun 6pm-5:30am. It is what it is, it's not for everyone. One person's trash is another person's treasure."
bad,"The company was family when I first started an as time goes by, it is cut throat, people are negative, they work you to death, family that you have at home they don't care about, they want you to consistently work. An get mad if you say no. The quality is quality, it is quality, get the cars out if good or bad"
bad,"Nenhum ponto positivo, emrpesa que não se preocupa com as pessoas"
bad,"Cuando ingrese a Ford tenia la idea que era una de las mejores empresas para trabajar pero lamentablemente lo que arruina todo ahí es su sindicato, solo están ahí para amedrentar y robarse el dinero de las cuotas de los empleados y si la empresa permite eso pues forma parte también de esto."
bad,If you are a person that can phase out for a paycheck it's the place for you. Unprofessional and poorly managed workplace where you are sure to be disrespected and unappreciated for hard work and dedication.
bad,"Two words"
bad,"Terrible management and work environment, at typical day would involve me filling in for any open positions to make sure the assembly line ran smoothly."
bad,"It took me 6 weeks to get a badge to work. I was a team of 1 person"
bad,"Typical day consist of reviewing spreadsheets and reporting information to management."
bad,Pay needs to be the same.  Older workers making $30 hour and newer workers making $15.78.  That is not fair.
bad,"There is no job security, can get terminated by surprise for no reason and no warning."
bad,If you are not related to anyone here you stuck where you start.
bad,Clearly took care of the caucasian workers laughing and having a good time. Treated their issues with card allowing them freedom to mess up while managing minorities every short coming.
bad,"no commitment to the employee. poor management of people"
bad,Social cliques is an understatment. More like a cult. If you want to do your job and not get involved in drama. This is not the place for you. Social media rules the floor. If a group of coworkers has it out for you they will do anything they can to spread rumors and ruin you. Drugs and alcohol are the life blood of the plant. And dont count on labor relations to help. Not worth the damage to mental health and body.
bad,"You used to be treated alright. Now you have to give up far more than you get paid for and I’m not just talking about your time. Working here will make you miss out on watching your kids grow up, it will cost you your health in general, and your relationships with just about everyone you know. They’ll lay you off with hardly any notice so best hope you’re in that top tier pay because if not you’ll lose everything time and time again"
bad,"Not a good work / family balance. Very physical. Lots of errors in pay. Takes forever to correct. Very long hours. "
bad,"I left I full time job to work at Ford, they told me it was temp to hire after 90 days. After 90 days I was told that my probationary period had not yet started, they start your 90 probation whenever they feel like it. You can work there 5/6 months and they’ll say your 90 day period has Not started yet, then the switched me to part time working three (3) days a week... this place is a real joke"
bad,"I hate to give anyone a bad review but there was very little positive I can say."
bad,To much to do with no monthly raise getting paid twice a month has got to be the hardest thing to do healthcare is extremely to high! Management if very mean to others and you don’t get recognized at all w
bad,"Horrible management. Hr doesn’t care very rude and nasty. "
bad,"The Least qualified people with no technical knowledge or experience get promoted into management. You have to work extended/AFTER hrs/Wknd under so much stress since they lack planning and knowledge of the subject matter. They just make the $$ and take time off. I can't even use the benefits and can't go to routine doctor visits due to the workload. There is no advancement opportunity. They hold you as much as possible and there will be no opportunity to move within the company and change positions. Many professional young engineers in my team  left ford as there is no advancement opportunity,work life balance, salary increase, appreciation or process improvement, at least in this division. I have a family to support but I will leave soon.."
bad,qualification or talents means nothing to Ford management. it is who you know and your background that counts. company is still stuck in the 60s. race background are always included in management discussion regardless of what their PR team says.
bad,"Teamwork, eager to learns, prepared to work under pressure, From school of Engineering, no experience. My mother is a single parent who struggles to make ends meet. Will continue studies if being offered a job"
bad,this was the most unsafe and terrible mechanic job ive ever had. The day i walked out i was asked to work in about 2 inches of water after my bay flooded and my lift was broken.
bad,"You're just a number to them. "
bad,Why am I being forced to fill out a review??? I don't like working here and wish I had never accepted a position with Ford Motor Company. There is no respect for other people.
bad,You are a number and you body takes a beating. the work life balance is not there. Only 2 weeks vacation for hourly employees. No more retirement for new employees
bad,"a fast pace environment. The moral is low. The plant has it's days, and good bad. If you like over time this is the place to be. There are some friendly people."
bad,"Es una empresa muy mediocre al momento de tratar con los empleado de niveles como técnicos u operadores, al momento de un problema  en ves de ver soluciones o solisitar la colaboración de los trabajadores busca a quien culpar y sin preguntar toma represarías contra la persona que cree culpable aparde de ponerse en el plan de si no te agrada busca otro trabajo."
bad,"Working here was like being transported to the 1930s. The fostered enmity between the union and management is laughable. The ill will and tangible scorn is unbelievable. Contrary to popular belief getting a job here is not ""winning the employment lotto"". I saw more alcoholism, broken body's, failed humans  and all around repugnant people then I thought could honestly gather in one place and time. Yes you will make money but not because they pay you well its because you're there all the time and wrack up the hours. There is no concern for your life period and god forbid you get hurt on the job. You will be treated as a pariah. over all it was the least satisfactory job experience I've had and would caution candidates to triple think their decision. I could right a book, but think I'll stop there. That is of course only my opinion."
bad,The employees were all good people but the company themselves care about no one. As a new hire your considered a temp part time employee with no benefits and no bonuses. you arrive at 6 am and sit in a cafeteria for up to an hour to see where you will be each day and your not paid for it it can take up to 6 years to get full time and good pay  call in once and your fired.
bad,The leadership has no idea where to direct the team.  There is no focus except to pay consultants to do the leaderships' job because they have no idea what to do.
bad,"Management is a good old boys club who don't value creative thinking and who resist change.  They love to do things like they've always been done, but, they expect new results.  Difficult to get anything done in the slow paced environment.  Most over the age of the Millennial resist keeping up their computer skills or learning anything new."
bad,"Ford motor company is a joke, the work environment is horrible and they all promote harassment. Half of workers are seeing psychologist due to working conditions and environment in"
bad,The business culture was terrible.   Always had to blame someone for something.   This was a poor choice on my part.   I should have realized that nothing has changed at Ford when it comes to production.
bad,"The HR Manager and Director do not make discisions in the best interest of the employees.  Morale is low, stress level is high and much due to lack of concern of the management team.  They like to rotate you into positions you are not interested in working.  If you decline working those jobs, you will be terminated.  Never worked at a company like this before 👎"
bad,You will go from part time to full time as they need you. No health vision or profit sharing. And you start at worst jobs in plant no vacation time. Union is worst union ever worked for. Unless your a horrible worker
bad,"it was a terrible experience for me, I never knew companies could be ran so poorly. That is why I left, the whole environment was unprofessional, so many people would come to work drunk, or other intoxications, my own trainer would drink on the job while trying to train me. A terrible institution."
bad,No work life balance and no support from upper management.  The union is allowed to run the place and there are a lot of unprofessional deals made by the union with management that put you in a bad position to succeed.
bad,This company wants a BMW on a Chevy budget. Get ready to do more than the average for a lot less. Terrible management. You get to pay for your travel then they reimburse you. If you don't suck up to management then they will make sure you quit or get you fired.
bad,"Left outside in the freezing cold all winter, rats in the yard."
bad,"I was hired on to be an engineer. When I arrived I was told that I would actually be a production supervisor. I wish my situation were isolated but it seems that about half of the latest crop of supervisors were all lured in under the same false pretenses. When you interview, they'll tell you a few other things: that you'll only work a 4day 10hr schedule (during the day), that you have vacation and personal days which you can take anytime, that you'll get paid overtime for every minute you work over 40hrs, and that you'll only occasionally supervise a small number of skilled tradesmen. All of these promises are at the very least misleading. I've been on the night shift for over a year now. We work long days (routinely over 12hrs often more), most of the weekends (going on 3/4 this month) and rarely receive the aforementioned compensation. You are allowed to request vacation, but it's always going to be denied. Instead they tell you (often when it's not convenient) when you will take your vacation. You can forget your personal and sick days, you'll be lucky to use one per year."
bad,"Clock in for midnight shift. "
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked.  You are treated as an employee number only. Any mistakes you make you are punished for. "
bad,The company hired temp employees and you must be there 3 years to become full time there is a major difference on the pay benefits shift and job placement when it comes 2 full time vs the temp employees. Problems with leadership u become despensable it was the longest 4 months of my life
bad,There the worst place I have ever worked for and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I care for absolutely disgusting and vile the way your treated!
bad,"Sometimes its really slow and if you work with a bunch of ghetto people you stand there with no one to talk to, and have a very boring night. Everyone is drunk or high on the job, you can get fired for freedom of speech. Enough said."
bad,Zero job security signed a 2 year contract but constantly told they will get rid of you if you're late or sick. Only positive to working was the money
bad,Not grow well talented employees.. Poor internal union. Unnecessary job and department change it's affect employees healthy and mentally upset. Salary not good compare to other OEMs.
bad,"The worst management ever, I was hurt at work and Ford tried very hard to fire me and I didn't Sue like all the employees do. I gave my life to that horrible place to work and was stabbed in the back."
bad,"My store owner was horrid. Always yelling at employees and never showing up. He was not there to help and made the workplace a hostile environment. I loved managing the website, photography, price and inventory but the management was poor. We had to figure out everything on our own because they didn't have anyone training. He would fire people every week."
bad,"Management had no idea where to lead the company.  Poor communication.  Even within senior ranks, people didn't understand where the CEO was leading the company."
bad,Would not wish this job on anyone regardless of benefits. Management creates an us vs. them atmosphere and are always negative. You are always presumed guilty and punished with false accusations. Easily labeled by appearance. They have punishment jobs and use them to their advantage.
bad,"Not the place to be at times have changed, the auto industry is not the way it was back in the day everyting is part-time now how can you make a living. I should of never left my old employer wish I could go back."
bad,stressful and fast paced.  People aren't very friendly.  the stress is unbelieveable.  I build the f150 and the ford raptor.  I think the people aren't friendly because the work is so stressful.  the benefits are a bonus.
bad,Ford motor co. is  a poorly managed buisness. The hourly pay and benefits are great. Worked with great high-tek machines. Worked with hard working individuals.
bad,"Eh muito dinâmico e corrido, muito intenso, escravo"
bad,"Ford Chicago Heights Stamping very political would not recommend.Upper management blames all issues on the Process Coaches in all areas Maintenance, Material and Production.No forward planning and no engagement of Team Leaders."
bad,"Don't have a review to discuss on this company. However to keep it simple it was not the job for me. On the contrary, only took the job because the timing and money was right at the time."
bad,"This place is a horrible place to work. The conditions are deplorable....mold and cockroaches everywhere. Management and physician manipulative, decietful, unprofessional and just downright rude!"
bad,A typical day at work was exhausting I learned I do not like a fast pace. Management did not care how you felt. my co-workers were fine they understood how I felt. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the line. The most enjoyable part of the job was joking with co-workers.
bad,Call Centre did not like the enviroment and taking complaint cll all day
bad,"Not a company that has a culture where the transfer of technological information is freely exchanged. If you do not have the technological knowledge of robotics and car making already do not apply to this company. They do offer some courses, but the senior employees have the first option to take these courses first, even if they have already taken the course, leaving no open slots for new employees to gain new knowledge. The senior employees do not freely exchange technological knowhow (self preservation is the motto at Ford Motor Company.)"
bad,Made redundant when overtime was limitless. People who started same day as me are still employed there. The give permanent positions by using alphabetical order or surnames!
bad,Not really as helpful as they claim they are no hunger or determination into wanting to get the job done possible sign of laziness..dealership full of favouritism and politics expect you to do as you’re told and no have a say in any conversation whatsoever
bad,"Managers here are clueless and have no clue how to lead or organize people. They do not care about developing or retaining talent in their organization. You are a cog in the machine here (just a number) and they will exploit you until you eventually get fed up and leave to go somewhere else. They do not engage in actions that support the growth and advancement of the people below them, which is antithetical to what you would expect if your intent is to grow as a company. The projects you are given are unfulfilling, emotionally exhausting, and spiritually draining.  You will slowly go emotionally and spiritually bankrupt by working here so save yourself the misery and strongly consider employment elsewhere, even if it means a pay cut.  I would strongly discourage anyone from working at this company."
bad,"Too many salesman on the floor, Extremely hard to get started in the business. Management team is fun and helpful. Coffee and food provided on weekends."
bad,"The problem at Ford was the supervisors they treat you like slaves not equals,or kids. It was more like telling you and not coming to you with respect."
bad,"Poco motivador para el personal, pero con muy buen ambiente de trabajo,"
bad,"Ford hired me as a long term supplemental, then laid off, hired back as a Temporary Part time, and could've stayed that way until I died. The Union Reps were thugs and we weren't allowed to vote, only to be bullied."
bad,Management is horrendous. 
bad,Ford laid me off it was a nice place to work in they gave you time off if you needed it they where layed back it was just lil hours in I needed more hours
bad,This job is very stressful and full of negative energy. The environment is uncomfortable to work in ans the union does notbing to help you so yoymu pay union dues for notbing
bad,"1) Fiz tudo que fosse necessário na área de RH e DP;"
bad,I come in for work and the culture is typical.  There should be some improvements but the feedback employees give to the company are ignored.  Management is not consistent with quality and safety for employees.  I wish for changes and tried to make a difference but the culture and the attitude of managers are content. Work station analysis should be addressed to allow assembly workers to be more productive.
bad,"The goals are way to high,regular employees dont do the job and the management wants TPT do all the job. The harrassment is continously and the work conditions horrible. No AC at all."
bad,They have nice break rooms with good coffee. I enjoyed working with some awesome co-workers. I learnt that is not the field of work that I am interested in working. However am thankful of the opportunity to produce a income that helped supported my family at the time.
bad,"I worked this Company with very carefully and interested. I knew there about suspension and about Engine of Automobile whicle."

bad,"Worst management of any company I’ve worked for!"
bad,ITS STRESSFUL TO WORK THERE. Manager do not speak with you in the right tone you are disrespected in front of your peers. supervisor compete with each instead of helping each other.
bad,Having no work
bad,I made a living at it while it was still half way doable but until they start paying techs by the hour especially on warranty jobs but really all jobs should be paid that way because you never know what kind of abuse the car has been through or how rusty the undercarriage  is until you start working on it.
bad,aprendi a atender al publico porque como ser humano debemos tratar bien al cliente
bad,"This job is horrible. No climate control, so it's either extremely hot in the summer or freezing in the winter. Long hours; can go up to 10 on a normal day, if the line breaks down probably 12. They either schedule too much, where you're working 6 days straight or we can go under 40 hours if there aren't enough people ordering units. The work is tiring, and dirty; you always come home with back pain and smelling like grease. It took them three years to hire my group permanently, we were working full-time hours; without receiving full-time benefits. Some coworkers are too uppity for their own good.      "
bad,Union wasn’t for the people and I got treated poorly as a black Woman and very much disliked my time working because of company politics and they use to stop my time and not pay me
bad,i was basically discriminated against and treated like trash because i didnt drive a ford. forced to park blocks away from my work space when there was hundreds of open spaces near. all because i drive a chevy and not a ford. pathetic
bad,This company is trash and the managers are racist. Just not a good company to work for. The owner owns all the dealerships in the area and the owner is a joke
bad,It was depressing nothing excited about working there. No one gave me feeding back how I was perfuming. There was no communication who I need to ask for help. Everything was out dated.
bad,The employer practices unfair labour practice acts.the environment conditions are not up to standards. It does not recognise the worker's qualifications.
bad,Ford was the best job I have had in a long time. I learned a lot of skills and different jobs on the assembly line. I loved working for my bosses. You learn a lot of things about yourself.
bad,I have never worked for ford motor company. I have only worked for a ford dealership which isnt even close to the same thing. but I had tio write something in this box to contunue
bad,Never work in a more racially degrading and oppressively intimidating place in my life.  Management style archaic and unbearable to many supervisors.  I hated coming to work here.
bad,"To make a meaningful contribution in an organization with innovative ideas and develop my skills to the fullest"
bad,A wasn't a very fun environment but as far as compensation it was very good . Unfortunately you had to stand in the same area for the whole work day because it is a production line .
bad,"Check daily work request, create job file folders with quantity of parts, manipulate parts using corresponding software per technology. Post process parts if needed."
bad,"A typical day at work required me to defend my integrity as I was cussed by coworker and managers, physically hit by two of my coworkers, and had my work sabotaged on a daily basis. "
bad,"Job is not what was described in the posting. Was hired for engineering work (designing, test development, manufacturing issue resolution). Upon hiring, was asked to do data entry and clerical work. Disappointed."
bad,"es una empresa en cuestion de regimenes de salud ocupacional, laboral y a nivel mundial tiene gran personal responsable y confibale"

bad,"I got to work with these company threw a  Staffing agency  called Staff source.They are the WORST company i have ever worked for.The office workers in the front are always yelling and treated every body like trash.There management always comes in drunk ALL THE TIME, and when its payday You will be LUCKY to even get the money they owe you.They put less hrs then you work on almost EVERY check you get."

bad,work mostly 8hrs.then during model change hrs. gets longer at times. hard work easy chance to travel be important.share other ways to improve work habits.
bad,"co-workers are very friendly"
bad,A typical day at work: meetings and preparation
bad,Too much ego in upper management therefore a lot of micro managers.................................................I would stay away from this as it may seem cool at first.
bad,When I got hired in as a TPT or STP in the year of 2016 the contract states anyone hired in is a temp. Only got medical insurance and that was limited benefits and did not get any bonuses at all. No vacation or sick time and both years got laid off right before the holidays at the end of the year.
bad,"When I first started it was a great place to work, pay was good.  But the more that I learned how the system works the more I hated it.  You are paid by the work that you do (commission) but if no one brings a car/truck in to get worked on then you will not get paid.  Or if you are in a team setting then the team leader takes the good work from the rest of the team get paid good while the other team members do not.  Ended up worked weekends (7days in a row) to get a paycheck to pay bills.  If Ford requires you to be at work then they should pay you to be there not write you up because you are not at work due to no work.  I love the ford product but will never work for them again."
bad,"I was put on a job that I was physically unable to do, so I had to quit."
bad,"Worked as an intern for Ford Motor Company. It was an okay job. However, the culture of the company is lacking. They will allow you to fall through the cracks."
bad,"Very unorganized, from management to schedules to customer service. "
bad,Not the best place to be honestly works are slow and there is very little room  to explore your options in projects. Not much of works are given and not much of personal grow.
bad,They have production people handling the maintenance area. They need to bring people from the skilled trades to run skilled trades. There is way to much paper work that needs done than actual work being completed. There is alot of very skilled people in the skilled trades area and they treat them like dirt.
bad,Challenging work environment due to Management/Union relationship.  Zero Process discipline at the current facility.  Very little respect throughout the salaried workforce.
bad,this is modern day slavery.
bad,"Ford has the opportunity to treat contract employees better, and I wish they would.   There's a lot of talent within contract employees and this is a relationship I would Ford would strengthen and nourish.  Contract employees should be able to work from home, especially on days when weather is an issue."
bad,Ford Motor Company does not respect or care for employees. The people the put in place to oversee the small workers abuse their power and disrespect and ill treat workers. Nothing is flexiable and they are not diverse at all. The temporary workers are treated the worst. We are made to do whatever and if you can pcant donit great your talked down to then fired under false assumptions. Worst years of working for me.
bad,"Tech lead put people down, pay your dues mentality, and much of my work was overlooked and/or not used at all. Was supposed to be an agile environment but much of the time a standup was updating on slack due to a team member avoidance mentality. There is a work from home policy as long as you don't use it!"
bad,"Toxic, Unpleasant and degrading. My payroll papers have been lost, our payroll agreements have been broken... I feel scammed out of my time and money."
bad,"Decent job if you don't question anything and like monotony and don't have a strong work ethic. Things are better if you're related to someone. Also, the union is more of a do nothing fraternity unless you're related to someone or are on one of their committees, I think"
bad,I do not enjoy working here to much as I was promised much better pay and lower hours. Now I earn very little as the commission scheme is awful despite over achieving on my sales and I work 6-7 full days a week so I have no time to even see my family let alone have a social life.
bad,"If you can maneuver the extremely packed parking areas and dodge the speeding techs. You will be greeted by 3 service writers who have to work the phones and try to help the customers walking in. Takes a while. Not their fault. Small waiting area, dry popcorn, and the never working coffee machine. Very pushy salesmen."
bad,Not a team driven place to work. Looking over your shoulder always. no advancements to look forward. No achievement awards.Constantly not looking outside the box.
bad,"Très stressant. Management à revoir. De nombreuses promesses lorsqu'on intègre l'entreprise, mais rien au final, rien ne se passe."
bad,Office personal is overworked and unappreciated. Plus management doesnt have a clue how to run an office much less how to do the job required of her or the staff. In my opinion as well as many others here the current office manager needs to be replaced by someone who knows what they are doing and how to train their personnel. Also needs to hire enough people to do the jobs required and not expect 2 to do the work of 5.
bad,"I had big hopes of working here, considering my father had given them so much of his time. "
bad,A regular day at work would consist of extremely hot conditions but I enjoyed having a job with great co workers I was in charge of sweeping the rows getting up all trash so it wasn't that bad.
bad,"Was brought in at entry level. Was told I would be trained appropriately for my job. Aside from it taking weeks to get an actual desk, telephone and computer, I was never given actual work. I was in perpetual ""training,"" until someone felt obligated to use me for a job. Which never happened."
bad,i was worked in ford as a appendix for 1 year and it is a good in safety for the employee
bad,A day at work included the majority of warranty work and my pay check reflected it.
bad,8 cent increase after working one year. The highest increase on our team was 9 cent an hour
bad,Don't value people -- review process worthless -- management is focus on cost not doing the right thing -- can't even replace broken desk chair -- stay away
bad,"If you do a great job in your position, that is where you are more than likely to stay. You need permission to apply for an internal job. Career advancement can be very slow to happen (8+years if not longer). So if you do a great job, permission to apply for an internal opening is next to none. 80/20 inurance plan. Corporate Policies sound great, but management walking the talk really does not happen. If you can be an executive great compensation and perks.  If not, oh well."
bad,I worked for a dealership and have almost a decade of dealership experience. The management only looked at performance numbers not the differences in jobs being preformed. Example a tech handling a warranty intermittent issue is expected to produce the same a someone getting consistent recall work with predicable time frame. regards to manager treatment of employees it was heartless and if you offered a suggestion it was quickly and completely ignited. No benefits either with
bad,If you start as temp (sts/tpt) expect the worst and then some. You only get health after 90 days. No other benefits or time off. Management and leaders treat you horribly and work you harder than any other member on the “team” Ford would actually be worth it if we have better benefits and job security since you could be laid off at any moment. Overall not the best place to work unless you’ve been there 20+ years
bad,"There are 2 areas in Ford, at a manufacturing site and at staff. I would strongly recommend a person seeking employment not to take a position in a plant. Huge amount of stress, no support from upper management, UAW will undermine you at every chance and there is absolutely no work/life balance. Plus, as management, in plants, there are no breaks or lunches. You work 12 plus hours a day."
bad,"Production overruled everything even safety.  Production management focused on running.  Consequently, the same downtime issues popped up consistently."
bad,Too many layoffs it’s a Automotive factory  u work fast paced which isn’t a problem for me The assembly line is strenuous my work hrs were 6pm-4:30am Tuesday thru Friday I enjoyed driving the Hi-lo it was very interesting and fun working in Material Handling unloading and loading trucks
bad,"Process Management (Former Employee) –  Dearborn, MI – April 2019"
bad,It was a man's world at the particular car dealership I worked at. The sharks were at the door constantly and I felt like because I was a woman they purposely put my desk at the back. I was hit on by several team members and was very uncomfortable working here. The amount of work I put in did not match the amount I made.
bad,Took forever to get my commissions you don't mess with a man's money was a terrible company to work for.  We had five sales people when I decided to leave it was a joke.
bad,Being a car salesmen is tough but you shouldn't have to feel like you're ready to slit someone's throat for a sale. The retention rate is terrible because some of the salesmen that have been at the dealership for a while will try their best to make sure you don't get a sale.
bad,"Its was a good pace job until it became cutthroat, and stressful, not knowing if you would work are be set up by management, family teaming up on employment."
bad,hustle work environment and old building. I got assigned to a job that doesn't match my expertise so I had to leave the work. immediate supervisor was micromanaging and it was unpleasant experience.
bad,"once you learn your job, you do the exact same thing 10 hours a day 48-56/ week. Cannot advance without seniority so good luck newcomers. You do meet some nice people/ co-workers but for the most part production and numbers are priority over quality and employees."
bad,"rampant nepotism, cronyism, moves at a glacial pace. Backward hiring practices and an antiquated agency hire model.  Offered me twice my previous salary to return, I couldn't do it.  It's a career dead end."
bad,Co workers were great and the job was easy but the morals and ethics of the company were horrible. I am not a fan of lying to people just so bad people can get rich.
bad,"shop manager is egotistical, he cannot look beyond his own benefit to work with anyone. Is very close minded and cannot step back and see the bigger picture when working on new problems/concerns. attacks them with the same routine every time."
bad,"A)  A typical day at work: Sucks !!!"
bad,"Emails, meetings, and spreadsheets were the essence of my daily life at Ford. I was an engineer in title only. Almost nothing I did required more engineering knowledge than one could gain within a month or two. My responsibilities were more akin to an extraneous middle-manager, as everything I did was for the purpose of asking others to do things for me."
bad,"For a competent engineer, this is a dead-end job, like working for the government. Advancement is based solely on politics, performance reviews focus on anything but performance,  and you're very likely to find yourself reporting to someone who got their job for reasons having much more to do with race or gender than intelligence or ability."
bad,"People are okay to work with, but there's always something wrong. The management has no idea what they're doing, and they put people in charge that shouldn't even be there."
bad,Culture has changed at Ford Motor Company not for the better. Everyone is afraid of losing their job. Management focuses on keeping their boss happy versus selling more cars and taking care of the customer. Present CEO is disconnected from the rank and file. Senior managers profit at expense of lower level employees.
bad,"This is modern day slavery. They will bring you in as a TPT (Temporary Part Time) employee and that is where you will stay until you leave. No PTO, No Profit Sharing, no other benefits that you will slave for just like the person with 30 years. The union is a joke and after 3 years of working and being laid off with no job security you will quit."
bad,Ford Motor Credit Company was highly stressful and long work hours with mandatory overtime. The work environment was sometimes somewhat hostile towards the workers and needed much more diversity.
bad,As management its hard to hold people accountable for their actions due to the strength of the union. First place I have ever worked where the hourly do not use a timecard system.
bad,"A place to retire, not to be promoted. Promotion criteria is more about  networking than professional skills. Management doesn't know much about work."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Ford for some time, but slowly (specially as an agency employee) you see how they treat you. You do not get any benefits Ford employees receive. You're guaranteed to make at least 50% less than a Ford employee without any site of getting a raise withing years. You're looked down upon if you don't have a degree even if you do the job the best or one of the best,"
bad,"pessoas que passam por cima dos outros para subir de cargo."
bad,Management structure needs to down size tremendously. The management needs listen and empower its engineers instead of grandstanding. Workplace culture is a hit or miss and It depends where division you work at. But overall is declining.
bad,Upper management talks down to you. Work life balance does not exist unless your an Area Manager or higher. Working conditions are terrible. The culture is bad no teamwork its like the wild wild west.
bad,"Process Coaches have the worst job in the plant. If you came from an outside company, its even worse. You have no time to learn your job or everything thats required to do your job. Management expects you to know how to do things that you never heard of until they mention it for the first time. Machines are outdated and when they go down, It's your fault. You constantly get yelled at by 6 to 10 people for things you can't control. Working with union workers at Ford is awful. No regulated heat or air. Forced to work on off days. If workers don't come to work they are punished and if too many come your forced to get as many out as possible even if they don't want to leave. It is just Cut throat!!!"
bad,"Management is not good here. Please do not be fooled during the interview. You will be micromanaged to death and it is not fun. Run, don't walk away from this workplace."
bad,"My experience was pretty good since I had really fun and helpful fellow employees. It would have lasted longer but, once I went to college, the manager didn't want to work around my schedule and instead gave me some made up useless job of calling customers that recently had vehicles worked on to see if they were satisfied. Problem was, they expected me to solve their issues and I am not a mechanic nor did I know enough to help, so I was set up to fail. I think overall people are pretty happy working there, although there is discord with salesmen and the service team, because the former thinks they are better than the latter - which is untrue. Overall, I wish my experience had been better because I would have for sure stayed much longer, advancing as I could but, if your feet are held to the fire there isn't  much you can do."
bad,"Daily examination if changes improved line function"
bad,"Had very high hopes when I first joined the team but found myself very dissapointed.  The culture is extremely careless, most people spend as little time as they can at work."
bad,"If you enjoy going to workand doing your job everyday, as if you're a robot, then this is the job for you. Your opinion is not valued, your work ethic will be taken advantage of, and in my opinion there is no more unequal place to work than a Union"
bad,"Ford is very stressful, Ford does not care about your family life or your personal life. It's about run the line don't let the lone stop for nothing. Don't get paid for overtime but they want you to be there 12 plus a day."
bad,ford é uma ótima empresa é o lugar certo pra mimaginar trabalhar
bad,"A waste of life if you work the line. Assembly work is mind-numbing and soul-crushing, but the money is there if you need it. The union promotes mediocrity, and management is your enemy."
bad,Good company with excellent job security wages and benefits. Could not believe the day I retired that 32 years had passed so quickly.  I became a the union benefit rep. I really enjoyed that. Helping people with their health care benefits was quite rewarding. In my later years I was lead hand another rewarding job. I enjoyed the responsibility that came with the job.
bad,"noyé dans la masse ,a construire des boites de vitesse en 3/8"
bad,"Péssimo ambiente e ferramentas de trabalho a desejar."
bad,Being a contract employee you are treated as just a person doing work and nothing more.  Requirements change and no increase in salary.   Don't join as a contractor.
bad,"Very few women in management.  Company still being ran by caucasian males.  Very patriarchal.  The women that are in upper management do not help other women up, and they stomp on whoever to get to the top."
bad,"If you are a technical person who does not bore of repetitive tasks, you 'll be o.k. Most assembly jobs at the Claycomo plant are VERY hard on the body. Beyond the required company physical, one may want to see his private physician to check for autoimmune, joint/bone, and breathing conditions. One may have functioned well in other settings, but a large, dirty, chemical- filled industrial environment wherein one is using heavy tools and hand tools with speed and repetition may present stresses on the body that can wreck one's health."
bad,"Mucha seguridad, los guardias le cuidan a la empresa como si fueran los dueños."
bad,This job was all out horrible. They over booked employees a lot. A lot of the time you will get to work just to be sent home. Just because you make it to a line at the beginning of the shift doesn't guarantee a employee 8 hours.
bad,"High Turnover"
bad,"Union reps never have the answer to any question you have."
bad,"The pay was good, but not worth the stress. When Ford downsized 25% of their employees worldwide in 2010, I was relieved that I was included in the 25%."
bad,Weren't any work and expected hard work and so i did work hard only for them to use me and then tell me to leave when they wanted without notice.
bad,muita correria linha de produção voce nao para nem um minuto
bad,They don’t take pride in their work or employees they are unorganized and sloppy at building cars they fire employees for unjustifiable reason and they are not team oriented
bad,In this plant environment the working conditions are a challenge.  Hot in the summer and cold in the winter with constant high volume production noise.
bad,I was hired on as a temp and we only got 30 hrs a week and thats only if they didn't send you home you couldn't miss any days regardless the circumstances. Very tiring work we didn't qualify for any pensions on 401k. Its's not for everybody it took a long time for you to get hired on full time great job if you are starting off young
bad,"Ford needed worker's at the time was doing a mass hiring. I was one of the new hires. They ended up laying all the new hires off, a total of 180 workers, after 4months when they had knowlying getting rid of two of there big vehicles. They brought in the 2020 new model vehicle. Didn't need all the new hires after 4months. Jobs are never secure there no matter how long you work there. supervisor"
bad,Worked on C shift for a year straight worst winter ever did not miss a day moved around facility facility ended up at the F-150 plant on the basketball team kept me on the hardest job everybody else had to do for one hour out of 10 hours but I was special I had to do it 10 hours 4 days a week for a month straight
bad,"Here is what matters: If you are good at your job you will be slowed down and held back by massive bureaucracy (standard fair for large companies). Advancement in the company really is a popularity contest - if you are not out doing activities totally unrelated to your job (see volunteering, leading culture events..etc) then you will never move up, regardless of how good you are at your job and how little those auxiliary things really matter.  "
bad,"Best advice for working at this organization is to work hard, build a reputation and strong relationship with the key personnel. Remain neutral and politically correct."
bad,"A typical day was incredibly busy.  Difficult to get things done with management log jams. "
bad,"Ford is huge and really really big company.  They have shoddy managers/supervisors and a few good ones.  There are opportunities for the right person and if you make it into the inner circle.  You could spend 30 years here and no one will know who you are.  Company is huge, oh I said that already."
bad,The Customer Service Manager was challenging but I enjoy multitasking so it kept things interesting on a daily basis. I enjoyed working with my dealer region. The job also provided and opportunity to learn about the technical side of parts and service which  I also enjoyed.
bad,"Pay is better than most, but you sacrifice most of your life to earn it.  High stress level job for something that should be fairly simple.  Everything is timed and management is stringent.  Great benefits but atmosphere is challenging and draining."
bad,"Empresa ótima de trabalhar,todo tempo e indico pra outras pessoas"
bad,"Ford is an ok job. The union has gotten just plain out sad and weak and sides with the manager more than the employees who actually pay their union dues. The way they treat the STS and TPT's are just sad. They can work for  straight years and not get hired on full-time, when they are working twice as hard as a full-time employee. The whole culture at Ford has changed and it has changed in a bad way."
bad,"Working at Ford is very stressful.  The corporate culture is very, very hidebound and can be really unpleasant sometimes.  Managers are poorly trained in people skills and staying current with behavioral practices people coming out of college need.  Very unfortunately, bullying of direct reports is still widely tolerated with no plans to do anything to change this.  It's sad but I won't miss it."
bad,Do not take a job in Chicago Assembly. No structure at all. Very unorganized and chaotic. Hired in with 7 new college grads who were just placed as supervisors on the assembly line since there was such high turnover at that position. After 2 years when I left there was only one other leadership dev. hire left.
bad,Não pretendo mencionar nada dos fatos ocorridos ...
bad,"They are the most racist sexist company I ever worked for."
bad,by far this was the worse job ive ever had we only got paid 9.00 hr to lift the floors and put together things for concerts and any other events I feel like they could pay more and give more hours
bad,"was hired as a consultant to their real estate arm, FORD Land; as a result of my PGA TOUR successes with the TPC of Michigan they asked me to stay around and help to market their property surrounding the golf course"
bad,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, com otimo ambiente de trabalho."
bad,"This is a fast pace, stressful environment. The management talks to you like you don't matter. This is a job for benefits only, but make sure you are more than ford tough.(just my opinion)"
bad,the pay and benefits are good but everything else about management is terrible. If you like working excessive hours and not having a life this is the place for you.
bad,"The company is extremely under developed in terms of diversity, employee morale, and job security for salaried personnel."
bad,every day is a scramble to ensure enough employees to run the line.   job is quite physical... it is a little city you have those who look after their space .. you also have abusers of the system it is a great big machine that rolls along
bad,Money is good and that's it. Nobody is truly happy on the assembly line and the leadership rarely communicates with you. The union is more worried about lining their pockets with money you work for than they are about protecting your rights.
bad,"a typical day at work starts with a morning meeting where "
bad,"Workplace is extremely HIGH STRESS. Guys are kept ""on edge"" and never know form one minute to the next where they stand, or if they will have a job tomorrow."
bad,"ordered and stocked all product for warehouse one,handle the loading and unloading product with cat 950 and assorted fork trucks,handle all returns for the company"
bad,"It all depends on where you are or what department; I work in purchasing and the enviroment is stagnant, leadership is consistently moving around, management is questionable in terms of support or teaching (again, depending on your department and who you work for), and moving from one position to the next depends on how much you're willing to sacrifice.  It does not seem as if your progress is truly measured by skill, but by time and who you've gotten on your side.  Most enjoyable part?  Flex time.  Hardest part of the job?  Learning enough to become dangerous because a lot of people won't tell you all they know or spend the time to properly teach you; you learn on the go pretty much!"
bad,Very tired when I get off. The most enjoyable part of work is when they call our time. I learned about this company that they only care about them trucks being built.
bad,"Assembly line work is hard work. I truly love customer service. Assembly work pays well, but as i said before it's hard work."
bad,"Working there was ok besides the fact that all Seniority Employees get upset when you're new. I guess they feel that you're there to take there place. The Company & Union sell you high hopes, but really, it's FAR from the truth. Ford Motors DOES NOT care about it's employees."

A parte mais difícil do trabalho foi infelizmente a falta de efetivação, e parte mais agradável que uma empresa muito grande então tinha diversos recursos internos."
bad,Fast paced and very busy.  Learned a lot about Ford Motor Company and its affiliates.  Management was weak.  Great employees but did not stay long.  Excessive employee turnover.  Difficult to work with supervisor.  Not a people person.
bad,Borring job but good pay at the time line working and I did not like working shifts
bad,ford company has mostly contribute our safety. If i have identify the external concern company was give spot recognition award for me
bad,"Non-stop fire-fighting for the most-part is how your day starts and finishes. If you are not having issues with the quality of the build from your department you are having them from the other departments.There are many mechanical issues in the facility due to lack of time or manpower to properly maintain the equipment. The production floor is constantly in the state of change due to manpower reductions and operation changes having to constantly attempt to do more with less. Upper Plant Management philosophy is to delegate work down to lower managers for accountability. Advancement in the company on the plant level is determined as to who you are related too and not by how proficient you are at your position. Question a superior and you are classified as a problem. The ""One Ford"" philosophy of working together ""team player"" communicate candidly does not exist. Definite lines of demarcation exist between managers and supervisors and a double standard exists on how you are treated. Zone supervisors and department foreman are held accountable for every issue that arises. Supervisor conflicts with UAW membership are always the fault of the supervisor. The HR department does little to support the supervisor in issues of conflict with the UAW . Discipline the wrong union employee harassment charges against the supervisor are automatic as part of the grievance process. Recognition for doing a good job is almost non-existent from upper management."
bad,"Well honestly a typical day at Ford Motors the same each schuled day of work. This is not a job I can make a career out of, all management cares about is production. I have not heard any of my co-workers speak good about this job. People walk in and ready to walk back out. The hardest part is the heat as well as the job itself,I dreed it. The only this I enjoy is the pay every week, but now it dont matter."
bad,When working for ford i was highly disrespected from the management and the lead on duty. when working there the people only care about the ford parts and not their employees.
bad,They have great benefits and make full use of them. The jobs are repetitive and wear on your body is accelerated. Make sure you're well hydrated as there is no air conditioning in summer and the heat is high in winter.
bad,"Everything seemed fine until I was force transferred into a design and release / management type of position.  It is then that you realize how dysfunctional the company is as you attempt to drive progress, and how much you cannot do a thing about getting back into a desirable position.  I petitioned HR and management for years about my concerns with my new position.  I received false non-committal promises of potential ""discussions"" about this.  As I pushed to the point of the ultimatum of leaving the company, I was finally told that my role was business critical and management refused to work with me on any transition plan.  False hopes, and feels to this day like a mental prison and dead-end career path.  Be very leery of any position that will have you interfacing with a large portion and multiple areas of the company.  You will find that there is no teamwork or respect for D&R engineers at Ford.  Also be careful about ""Feature Owners"".  They get dumped on just as much as the D&R's, if not worse."
bad,Worked as a help desk technician for about a year.  This may not actually qualify as Ford company employment as I believe it was a third party company that took and made phone calls for them.
bad,They asked u to work lunch and didn't appreciate the time I gave even if u work shut down and were mot helpful in management to assist you with courtesy
bad,"Constant financial cutbacks, always losing money, but they can buy a train station. Strange way to run a business. No direction and stock price reflects."
bad,"Worked here 23 years almost pay is good atmosphere not good high rate of injurys management is the worst in the world I was injured first time in 22 years they made me catch a cab while I was cut  if you work there only the money they will work you like a  slave trust me I worked at two ford plants gang members ,among other kinds of people depending on the plant you are . Forced to build cars with defects or get fired .Dirty filfthy no clean air I could write a book god bless you if you work there I prayed ever day well paid  hole."
bad,"Decent job and pay but poor work environment and management. Most fellow employees were either hostile, belittling, or short tempered. Nitpicking shop management made job frustrating and stressful."
bad,"Ford remains an incredibly hierarchical organization, level and title mean everything. Human Resources is focused on implementing programs that prevent litigation by current and former employees and identifying and ""developing"" the select few who are perceived to be executive leadership material.  And recently another line of demarcation has emerged: the cool kids work on ""mobility"" and can anticipate a groovy new workplace at the old train station, while rest of the employees (the majority) toil away in old school jobs in old offices."
bad,"Muy demandante y ambiente de trabaja muy agresivo e incomodo, no permite atender familia."
bad,"You get threatened everyday to do more work, if you do more they come back and expect more. I’ve never been a union guy and after this experience I never will. Some of your co-workers act like they’re better than you because they have more time in than you, never again.They also strive on safety but videos are out dated back to the 90’s so nothing is what it seems."
bad,"Ford Motor Company is unlike any place I have ever worked, with that there is plenty of good and bad, it has given me the means to support my family and life style for over 20yrs."
bad,They are using very old technology and they have very less technical knowledge. They do not even want to explore or provide opportunity to explore more on new technologies.
bad,Ford Motor Company is a very interesting company. I learned a lot while there and the employees were very selfish and like hoard the knowledge. There was always a constant changing in management. But overall I would recommend the company for someone to work there. The pay is fantastic.
bad,"If you not use to standing for long periods, this is not the job for you . if you can't work in very hot humidity place this is not the right place for you"
bad,"Recent management and restructuring, along with unfair hiring practices have turned a fun, relaxed, family atmosphere into the lowest employee moral environment I've ever experienced."
bad,"A Ford tem uma cultura empresarial muito difícil, pois, apesar de dizer que querem fazer coisas novas, na realidade não aceitam mudanças. Parece funcionário público."
bad,"Currently employed at the ford diagnostic service center through advantage resourcing.  ONEFORD values are preached, but the environment they have is quite the opposite.  Employees are severely micromanaged and talked down to by subject matter experts and team leads.  I was once yelled at for going to the bathroom.  The environment is very hostile and this makes it hard for employees to feel comfortable and excel."
bad,I worked on the assembly line at the Dearborn Truck Assembly Plant. I learned many of the assembler positions that is required to build a F-150. Assembly work is non stop. I had to be on my toes at all times. Pay was good and the crew I worked with was great.
bad,"Typical call center, Long shifts - Good rapport among staff members"
bad,"Good job, great people to work with, good pay and, on the phones.The hours aren't good. In this department, there are shift bids and you can end up with a horrible schedule."
bad,"The Ford Plant in Flat Rock (FRAP-Flat Rock Assembly Plant) works their employees long hard hours and sometimes forces people to work on Saturdays.  They work from 6:00 to 5:00pm and by the time I get home from Flat Rock to Flint (a 3 hr drive), I have no time for anything, but sleep and get up at 3am to go do it all over again."
bad,"The pay is good the benefits are decent, how ever as a salary employee on the manufacturing side you work 12+ hour days, and you are compensated, but you do not have a set work schedule and can be called in to work weekends last second. Work life balance is bad, plus you are forced to use vacation when they want you to."
bad,"linha de produção"
bad,A very structured environment with lots of checks and reporting requirements.  Timing of programs are very tight so keeping all program objectives on track requires constant examination.  Any deviation from this standard can create multiple issues downstream.
bad,"When sales are low, employees suffer. Job is only good if you are a tier 1 worker"
bad,no había a penas trabajo estaba todo el tiempo limpiando y mirando las musarañas
bad,"Use to be fun place to work before, for last 5-6 years the things have change"
bad,Typical traditional automotive company with inner politics that require proper support of superiors to get ahead. Management biased towards folks that they like and difficult to move ahead if they don't like you.
bad,I have been very disappointed with my decision to accept a position with Ford.  I left with the next acceptable opportunity.  Highly recommend talking to current/former employees prior to making a decision to work here.
bad,It was impossible to gain the trust of one of the family members that owned the business who unfortunatly oversaw my position.  They spent thousands of dollars training me but never gave me the freedom to reach my maximum potential.
bad,"The colleagues are very cooperative and knowledgeable. They work hard to catch up with the program milestone but, deal with too much workload usually."
bad,Ford IT has many managers in existence that are 50+ in age and rooted in monolithic work ethics. This tends to hold back younger people who works for these managers and creates a slightly toxic work environment.
bad,"This place is not for everyone, it’s very difficult to work with so many people of so many ranges, most people do not respect each other, and everyone is talked down too."
bad,"Poor morale instilled by management, poor pay for work performed, great benefits. Weak union. Hours are so unnatural that you will feel as if you never spend time with your family."
bad,This company could be great if they recognized the talents of their employees and offered them the opportunity to grow.
bad,"Ford does not understand IT.  They want to be Agile, but completely do not understand what that means.  Their financial systems are outdated.  The project manager role does not participate in anything that is not considered admin work.  Basically, you are a paper pusher at the highest degree."
bad,My coworkers make coming to work a pleasure! I look forward to the day when I am placed in skilled trades and can began using the knowledge I have learned over my career.
bad,Hired by way of talent management conference.  Do not feel skills were aligned properly with position.
bad,"I may have started out on the wrong foot with Ford, but for 7+ years I had problems with people. It all started when I was harassed by a material Handling person who decided to call my phone and shout every obscenity you could think of at me for absolutely no reason. I was new and had no reason to associate with this person at my job and he had none to associate with me yet he would call me and tell me to quit because he wanted a ""good lookin woman"" to have my job and he made my job miserable. This got me backwards with the company because nobody believed me and he was promoted instead. I on the other hand was blacklisted. With that experience I think the company is a big joke. Another thing is the company clearly had their favorite people and clicks they ran in."
bad,Manufacturing environment was not positive. Not much Inclusive environment. You cant even park foreign vehicles close to manufacturing lot. culture different from detroit
bad,Unrealistic expectations on new hires. Managers would lie in weekly reviews. Seemed to be petty about things out of my control. Not enough equipment or scan guns for employees. Cut backs during contract year.
bad,"hourly- dead end job - opportunity to learn new things, but none for advancement, non- merit based company  inconsistent work schedule ,inability to listen to employee input, poor management, disheartening morale culture"
bad,"Expect to work many hours, especially while on a launch. The work load balance between the team members is not equal. Many meetings to attend that often times do not accomplish anything. Some of the meetings schedules on top of one another's time. Additional pay for temporary relocation while on launch."
bad,Ford is a great place to make good money and has a union but does not offer good job security and has very poor work place culture. A regular work day consists of standing there doing the same job thousands of times.
bad,Sorry i don't want to say any thing about ford motor company. because i lost my life in ford motor company that's the only reason. but i wish all the best who are all working as a trainee to get permanent roll.
bad,Laziness and freeloading. Twice the amount of people doing jobs than needed. I never thought unionizing was a bad thing until I joined Ford. Bad internal communication.
bad,"Long work hours, badly managed, a lot of required overtime and no room for career advancement. Gets into the 100s temp inside the plant in the summer months."
bad,I have learn that working hard towards pays so am willing to work more than just like previous job that I personally myself would intergrate and learn
bad,"Great benefits package but with what all you have to endure and deal with, it's no wonder that the pay and benefits package is what it is.  Some company personnel is great while others can be difficult to have to work under.  You will live inside this place and if you have a family, you will hear about their lives thru text on breaks."
bad,"il mes arriver une situation tres decevente"
bad,very good pay. Hard working atmosphere. neat to see vehicles built.and very good insurance. assembly line work can be very difficult .
bad,i am traiing operter in fod motor company aasemle line is my main working all car working safty is first main so operter helth is good contion
bad,The job was never steady they had constant lay offs. Management makes your days unbearable. The work is really easy the coworkers get along. Management doesn’t allow regular breaks or bathroom breaks
bad,"Sometimes it was good other times it was bad. People did not respect one another.  Bosses put the majority of the work on only a few while others did little to nothing. Problems and issues were only spoken of at start up meetings. They were never actually resolved. I did like my job, the pay, benefits and some of my coworkers were good people!"
bad,"Assigning the same task to different employees"
bad,"Zero work life balance. Plant is not climate controlled, summers are brutal.  Management is poor.  Takes too long to get simple things done due to convoluted and unnecessary chain of command."
bad,"Management withing the learning and development department rotates on a regular basis.  Management is empowered to control the ISDs, but don't listen to their suggestions enough.  The management should be consultants only.  The ISDs should be actually managed by individuals that truly understand the learning and development process.  The current process changes with the management that has no true knowledge of learning development processes."
bad,"I had injured myself on the job and acquired workers comp. they were very difficult to deal with in this time frame. i had to have surgery and i was also in so much pain. now that i fell again elsewhere (but due to this injury, i was on crutches) they refuse to work with me and have ended my assignment. i have a family and bills and they could care less. i was also working there for a full year and never became full time and this is the reason why i am so out of luck. if you are healthy you can work if you have health issues or hurt yourself FORD DOES NOT CARE.!!!"
bad,"This  job  is  for  someone  that  like  done  the  same  thing  over  and over  again.  It's  repetitive  work.  The environment is negative, harassment by the management and all forms of the word!   On one cares about that happening to you or anyone else. It affects  your mental health.  Ford will beark you mentally,  emotionally,  and spirituality if you're not a  strong  minded person. The pay maybe good, but think very carefully before you make that decision to work there. Not Good For Your Health."
bad,Ford is a big company with a large global name that is hindered by the way it conduct daily business.  Work departments like corporate HR show how out of touch they are with the rest of the company and they often provide more obstacles than they do with help for the employees.
bad,"I love my job,"
bad,"Would not ever work there again"
bad,"average company, here the problem is job position. if you will work at ford 10years then also you will on same position. working culture is good and can work."
bad,"Ford utilizes many, many contract workers now and I was one of them in an administrative assistant role. Every contract employee wishes to be hired in and they string them all along but there are no opportunities to go direct. Only opportunities to do more work for less pay. These employees work side by side with Ford’s but don’t receive most of the benefits including good pay and paid time off for the days Ford is closed and no bonuses either. It was very frustrating to work hard for years without being hired in. The only admin that got promoted was the one who slept with all the engineers in the building."
bad,"al invitarme a renunciar el equilibrio de mi vida laboral me perjudico , el beneficio de la empresa en el salario era muy bueno,comodidad en los vestuarios y muy buen comedor  ,buen sindicato y buena atención en la obra social en la clínica san cayetano .no asi en la sede de don torcuato donde la atención daba mucho q desear"
bad,Ford Purchasing was an interesting place to work. Contractors were treated very differently than others. They were not given laptop computers like direct hires even thought work load was the same.
bad,"trabalhei dez anos na ford, era raríssimo ter alguma falta no trabalho apesar de ser uma rotina extressante sempre  estava la"
bad,it was a great place to work good pay and people.you learn teamwork and get along with everyboby.the work was fast and hard .learn robot that was cool.it was a good time.
bad,horrible work life balance but great benefits and stability.  this place is extremely political and the best people do not get deserved promotions and opportunities.
bad,I learned a lot about what it takes to work in a factory setting. I would say the hardest part of the job is getting what we have to get done before the next shift change.
bad,"too long working hrs 5:30 AM to 5:30 PM, 6 to 7 days of week +night shifts."
bad,"Flexible hours where you can arrange your own work schedule if your supervisor approves of it."
bad,This company is very dynamic and provides a lot of information for starters. Politics and connections in this company could move you up. Rarely your hard work
bad,Not enough opportunity to grow here. The training was not strong enough to make sure I was learning my job fully.
bad,"put batteries into a car upwards of 500 times a day"
bad,Was employed for 18 years. Worked in a variety of departments always in a Control Engineer capacity. Very political plant as is the case in most large Corporations.
bad,Even though I went threw many hardships I loved the my job. Met plenty of good people inspit my time ending sooner than it should have I'll always have love for ford
bad,"If you enjoy being yelled at by 6-10 people a day about things you cant control, you will love this job. The management from other departments will put their hands on you and their is nothing you can do about it. Just a poor work environment, money is NOT worth the pain at the Claycomo Plant"
bad,"Ford is a great place to work but you have to be the right type of person.  If you want to work hard and get ahead, it's likely not the right place for you.  Ford's employees have a very narrow range of responsibility and not much is asked other than you know what you're doing and do it when required.  If you like a broad range of responsibility and want to work hard and be compensated for it, look elsewhere."
bad,If you hire in as a temp you will stay a temp employee for as long as they want. the only way to accept this job is under a full time circumstance.
bad,it was just not for me the people i worked with were awesome but the managment was horrible the work was ok but like i said hr was really bad and had no respect for the workers because we were union.
bad,"This position was a nice and settle place to work, there were many values about this place. The co-workers were easy to get a long with they made the day go by real smooth and fast."
bad,"Great job, great compensation, but I have a family which was getting shortchanged, because I was always working."
bad,productiewerk teamwerk fijne werksfeer en leuke collegas
bad,"Responsável pelo recebimento, auditoria, processamento e pagamento de notas fiscais de duas transportadoras de grande porte referente aos veículos que circulam pelo território nacional. Além disso, todo o registro sistêmico e em planilhas, assim como responder a listas de pendências e tratativas diariamente com a transportadora para alinhamento e resoluções de problemas."
bad,Es una  empres  que e permite elaborar tus actividades laborales y a la vez te  permite realizar   las  actividades que te gustan es flexifle en los horarios y dias festivos
bad,"What can I say that anyone who has worked here doesn't know already...  Lots of people not doing their jobs, management who doesn't care, or will throw you under the bus..."
bad,"Good company but i am not satificated salary, i learn from managment how to  face customers & coffinent"
good,This job was self employed and because I couldn't work as fast as other due to my disability I found that I was not making a living wage. Also the management didn't see anything wrong in the other worker taking the easier jobs.
good,"hard to learn and make a paycheck. no structure, management just react to sitation instead of being proactive. day by day its least enjoyable to work there."
good,the culture in the office side of the company is such that management is never to blame and they have no problem laying off however many people they need to in order to hire talentless managers with bonuses.
good,I felt that it was a very sexist environment and women weren't taken as serious as the men; and since it's commission based the money being made wasn't that great because of too many sales people and not enough traffic of customers
good,"I have been with the company for almost 4 years, and the greatest thing about being a supervisor in the plant is that there are no days that are the same. Ford is a great company, but the plant culture is draining. I enjoy the pay checks."
good,You are just a replaceable body. They don't care about you or your family unless you are actually somehow one of the elite union people.
good,No Comment .  Contractor only . No support  from management for workload .Priority is on finance. Priority is not designing a good robust design. Coworkers attitude is looking to retirement early.
good,"Aucun avis, juste une envie d'évolué impossible au sein de ce groupe"
good,"poor working conditions, and everyone is just there for themselves and there is way to much drug an alcohol abuse. Knowone does anything about it and there isn't random drug testing which I feel necessary!!"
good,Posso dizer que possui características semelhantes a empresa anterior.
good,"Ao chegar a área de serviço participamos de uma reunião para definir o trabalho a fazer,depois iniciamos o trabalho conforme distribuição nos posto de trabalho."
good,"Working for Rick Ridings ford dealership was hard work that was under appreciated.  Management didn't do a good job of making sure the work load was equally distributed to all the technicians in the shop.  My co-workers of equal ranking to me is what helped me get through my days working there.  Some days I would work several good jobs and other days I would have nothing to work on.  I was not paid as an hourly employee, I was paid commission based on the job.  So even when I was working 40 plus hours a week sometimes I would only get paid for 28 of them.  When I gave my two weeks notice the boss would not even shake my hand on the last day of work.  He didn't care about his employees."
good,"100 mini's  "
good,"It was overall fine. I felt the ford could try to be proactive and take more care and give support to their employee. "
good,"The pay and benefits are great, the work environment not so much. Literally doing the same thing over and over again 500 times a day. It's hard on your body, it's so monotonous, all there is to do is be inside your own head."
good,Some employees can be rude and not so polite to customers or workers. Also there is also much lack of communication between employees and others. Not such a fun work environment.
good,"Better to over come it outside for career growth and to get benefits ,there is no common behaviour amoung employees in ford motor company.	Resolving."
good,"long hours with no overtime pay due to salary title though paid on a flat rate/piece work plan"
good,"When I started at FMC, I knew I was going to be a TPT (temporary part time). Well, 2 years later & there's no end in sight for when I'm going to get hired in. So no benefits, no time off, no bonuses. I work a horrible schedule that medically doesn't work for me & I was let go because they won't abide by my doctor's restrictions for me."
good,"Very stressful, management is very insensitive to employee needs. Working conditions are very dirty. Management is more concerned on quantity of products being produced and not quality. Also they believe in job overload."
good,"A empresa trabalha com a maioria terceirizado e temos poucos benefícios, procedimentos muito engessado dificultando a criatividade e melhorias apresentadas."
good,"The work  that I do is very administrative, I deal with employees walking into my office either for medical aid or death claim queries. I have learnt to respect all people and their differences, Ive learnt to be patient and to separate my emotions from my job.  Some of my co-workers are very helpful, but I've also learnt that in the workplace you are your own best friend and you should strive to become and better you while maintaining respectful relationships with the people you work with. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping an employee with a problem to the best of my ability. The smile on their faces gives me satisfaction and makes me realise that I am making a difference in people' lives."
good,"10 hr shifts Mon-Thu"
good,"You have some good people u will run across at ford, coworkers and supervisors but not everybody. Some supervisors make u feel like u not worthy or can't handle the job after just 2 to 3 days of training!!! They'll try and talk to u like you're a child and not an adult! All they care are about is numbers, production & money!!! U cause the line to go down, u just lost ford hundreds of thousands of dollars!!! They don't care about your well being! U either can do the job or not! What they pay u is not enough to live and support your family! Smh"
good,"Comunicación escasa"
good,"A typical 10 hour day , is pretty different it requires you to be in position at all times , ready to do your particular job , some days are easy some are not , I have picked up quite a bit skills and knowlwdge as far as Production is concerned , I like Ford but somes days it seem unreliable since I have been a temp for about 3 yrs , the mangement is ok but I have to just come and do your job and go home ."
good,"Pros"
good,if you are OK being unnoticed and under valued this is the place for you. Other than that the money is good but the environment is very negative. be prepared for a culture shock if you never worked a factory job.
good,"As it was the starting of my professional career, overall a good learning experience."
good,"sem nada a declarar, pois a empresa deve ter modificado suas estrategias"
good,"The pay is good....but that's all. I felt like a hamster on a wheel day after day, and I hated it. The place is the most filthy place to work. Huge rats and huge roaches infest the plant. There is no AC on the work floor so summers are a risk to ones health. Many people fall out due to the heat in the summer months. And the medical system is complete trash. After four and a half years working there I couldn't take it any longer."
good,"I learned to operate the machines and safety regulations of the company. i can not work so long in this company as i would like to get a chance of training to become qualified,as i studied machenical engineering,and also i could appreciate the opportunity of stable job. for working the motor industry it is not a garantied job because sometimes the company volumes go down,and that leads the company to retrench its poeple."
good,"If you are looking to advance, the opportunity isn't there. Long hours and bad on your body. The union and the company work hand so you really don't have good representation. A typical day is start at 6, break 3 hours later, work 2.5 hours before next break, and work 2 hours before last break. The problems are management lies about reasons we go down and that causes early breaks and longer work times before next break. Also, you never know what time you are leaving until 1:30 or after. This brings the moral down. The co-workers are good people. Some of the managers are really good too however, upper management put a ton of pressure on them which makes them have a not so good day."
good,"Nursing skills are used at a minimum, more secretarial work, not challenging enough. Immediate management uninvolved, no room for growth"
good,Work is a cycle its usually the same. Learned lots of skills every day. Co-Workers were always the best part of work. Hardest part is when parking cars in really tight spots. Most enjoyable part is when i have to go do dealer trades.j
good,Alguns líderes não foram treinados para serem gestores ou não conhecem o mercado brasileiro. Alta rotatividade de funcionários na empresa.
good,great job but no advancement get to learn new skills great hours and people to work with
good,"on a scale 1-5 I would rate it as a 3, I give it a 3 because it does have it's perks if your trying to get a car or a house, the new people that they brought were very hard to get along with the management was terrible and they cut the pay."
good,they don't care about you and don't worry about wanting to use the bathroom or ever taking off because you are sick. both will be denied and if you like doing the same job 620 times a day then this is the place for you.
good,"I was a Sales representative.  I was there for 3 years, which was nothing compared to the rest of my coworkers.   Many people there have worked there for a long time although not sure why? Pay was less than you should make.  Way too long hours.  But some nice people there.  Good place to get some experience if you are new in the business."
good,"A fairly good place to work but a lot of room for improvement. The salary and benefits are good, lot of opportunity to learn. However the job insecurity made the workplace rather toxic"
good,"I am very grateful for the job at ford and I've honestly learned so much. However, there are some things I'd like to move forward from. For instance, pair programing. It feels contracting to me and I'm not sure I can grow with someone constantly looking over my shoulder. 1 computer shared for 2 people makes you go crazy after a while."
good,"I don't work for Ford Motor company, I work with Ford products.I work with an out source company named PDWorkforce. They supply the man power to Ford."
good,"My boss was an arrogant man and chose to cut me down after having me work 70 hours a week, riding me to get things done while having no support from other members of the team. Offered no coaching for advancement. If you are an a** kisser then this is the place for you."
good,"If you're fresh out of high school and employment options, Ford is a great place to work. It's hard work. Long hours. It will toughen you up. They pretty much own your life, and don't even think about getting sick or having personal issues, unless you've been hired on full time, and have some kind of tenure. The only thing that matters to Ford is Ford - you are nothing but a number, but in reality: That's the bottom line of any corporation. The moment you learn that, the better off you'll be."
good,"Great place if you do not have a life and want awesome benefits."
good,A typical day would involve putting out technical fires with employees.  I learned that everyone's Technical level is when challenged. Management need more involvement.
good,"Minha iniciação profissional foi na Ford quando comecei como estagiária, a empresa acredita no potencial do estagiário de forma a desenvolvê-lo a ser um profissional capacitado para ocupar uma função de analista dentro da empresa."
good,"Required to be at work at least 30 minutes before shift start up to review previous shift information review manpower requirements, leaves of absence, vacations, disciplines to ensure manpower line up for start of shift. Move manpower as required at start of shift to ensure smooth start up. Monitor ALL aspects of production, maintenance, supply and support to ensure.all aspects of production are running smoothly. React to and resolve all interruptions in productivity and resolve all maintenance related issues during assigned shift. Deal with all abnormalities throughout the shift."
good,"Management at the warehouse I was at, not so good.. Hours didn't allow you to have much family time. Don't miss work even, I feel its for single people not family"
good,"I've been with several dealerships and a great, fun, lucrative job. Until I moved into the Greenville area and on the motor mile I loved it. I think it's just this dealership that has the stingiest pay plan in the car business. The owner is stashing all his toys, cars, boats, etc under our nose and even running out of room for them while the sales people are starving. The GM gives one guy all the house deals and there isn't any bonuses worth mentioning here."
good,"All the seniority employees hate the ""new hires"""
good,"I did not enjoy my time here.  I worked as a contractor and we were not offered the same benefits or even fair benefits, contract house kept a big chunk of our pay.  Forced on different shifts, laid off with no notice, etc."
good,This is a good job for somebody but not me. I want to grow and take on more responsibility and it has proven to be quite challenging for me to do so within this company thus far. You stand on your feet for 8 - 10 hours a day. It can be really rough.
good,"1.Lack of support from management."
good,"It was too confusing at times with so many different Team Leaders and no position or schedule is permanent. Every position there was about a 6 month to a year. One example is we would get our QA reviews with a different coach every month and their position is temp. So once you got used to doing it their way to improve your scores the next month you would have to start from scratch again with a new QA coach. It was all about being flexible for Ford but not for the employees. Ford has a slogan that is ONE FORD BEHAVIOR, meaning we take care of our customers as well as our employees, well many of us there never felt like they cared much. It seemed it was more about the bottom dollar. I did enjoy my co workers a lot but don't miss the upper mangers that didn't take the time to listen to our concerns on how to better the work environment."
good,"Very productive, team player and enjoys challenges.  Global Security Analyst for several applications.  Global Data Management Analyst.  Assist in developing automation of global form.  Lead tester on new applications and enhancements."
good,"- long hours"
good,A typical day at work would be busy but with a downturn in work recently we have experienced redundancies. Me being one of them!
good,Hard work but worth it. Once your in the door your set unless you get involved in the high school drama just like anywhere else. Ford is rough but union.
good,"Just your basic factory job. Not too much room for advancement, good hours, fair pay. Great first job or job to gain some experience. Shifts are first come first serve."
good,"if you like feeling like you are not even a number there or like you mean nothing to anyone then its the job for you. Nobody there cares about anyone but themselves, even managment"
good,"Llegar al trabajo y comenzar con la tarea , llamadas, comunicación , entrevistas personales , atención al publico , charla con los jefes ,ambiente cálido con buen clima ."
good,A good place to work depending on how well you get on with others. Can be quite bureaucratic and with such a big company career progression can take a while. Overall good employer. As long as you're not a contractor...
good,La planta de Ford Motor Company tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo laboral y con mucha presion
good,"I'd still be working for Fords if my plant wasn't closing, after 25 years of service with them. Quite bad workplace cultures there for me in the main, though the automotive industry is currently going through big changes, hopefully it will only get better."
good,"Clean workplace in Dearborn, Michigan.   Lack of procedural processes and lesson learned not followed.  Management focus on their career and not the total team.  "
good,"If you're single, young, and don't have a family, this is probably great for you. If you desire to feel some sort of accomplishment or have a position where you can be creative, or can achieve something more than clocking in and clocking out, this is not for you."
good,"got to work and just started from where you left off "
good,It’s a different world with management who only cares about numbers that’s it period. Everything is a fight and struggle to get anyone to listen or even act like the care.
good,"Coordinating launch of New and re-tooled Gaging for Gear components for 8F57,10R080 and 10R140 transmissions used in Lincoln, Mustang, F150 and Super Duty."
good,"The lack of job security really hurts the company. I’ve been a temporary employee for over a year with hopes of being hired in. Ford is ran completely on seniority and does not hire in based on work ethic. Management is very poor,"
good,"Working for 4 was not what I expected it to be. there are no programs to help with investment, most supervisors come from outside, and there is no job security"
good,"Good People, Friendly Staff. But salary package is low for contract worker that's only a negative point of this company other than nice place to working"
good,"At the end of the day, all the personal sacrifices that you and your family make does not mean anything.  You are a small fish in a big sea.  They preach a family company, but will divorce you with no problem"
good,"Good life balance depending of the position, but nothing will make you excited about company culture. Jobs are going to jndia and china, therefore is complocated to get them engaged with Australian culture and it does stress people."
good,"Don't care to share,  my views are my own personal!  Very stressful, unconcerned, all they care about is making cars. They don't care about their employees, nor do they care about our health nor injures. Horrible"
good,"poor leadership, micro management. poor communication. check sheet management. lack of true culture to drive profits and focused on task sheet items and not driving business. managers managing other managers"
good,"The company has been decimated by pencil pushers. Regardless of your number of years of seniority, you could find yourself out of work at any time. Union doesn't have your back."
good,Its one of the multi national company in all over the world. I am very proud to work there and also i wish and pray  them to increase their achievements.
good,No real advancement opportunities. Jobs on the assembly line are not at all hard to pick up. Dealing with the multiple attitudes of co workers as well as supervisors and team leaders is the most difficult task for the job. The facility is very old and outdated not even a central air unit in service.
good,Empresa séria mas não cumpri com o acordado. Falha nas suas avaliações e não dar valor aos funcionários.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. The most enjoyable part was getting off and the paycheck. It is hot sometimes and cold at other times.The hardest part of the job is being sent to a different job everyday.
good,"There was little opportunity for advancement inside or out of the department.  I spent ten years launching various vehicle lines, in multiple states and countries."
good,"Feast or famine!!!! Great benefits, crazy hours, decent pay. Assembly is not for everyone, it you can stick it out and keep your nose clean it is a decent job."
good,Work you're butt off like no other job you've ever done. Never make enough money to do what you want. Get treated badly. Job security..whats that? oNly work there if you have confidence you have notgghing elese
good,"Working at Ford Motor Company has provided me with some great experiences.  I have had the benefit with working with various departments such as accounting, fleet, Vehicle Remarketing, Brand, and pricing."
good,"Good place to work with open minded and nice people. To much politics but not different from what to expect from such a big company with lot's of management levels. Many different fields of knowledge and open information to be explored and a great social commitment."
good,"no employee loyalty, minimal advancement availability, minimal work-life balance, minimal pay for tenured employees, decent vacation benefits"
good,Not so good for contractors. So many restrictions for contractors... Clearly there is no raise... no facility and people fight to join as employee...
good,Trabajo interesante pero demasiado gente que ponía lengua.
good,"Devido a sua ma administracao, a empresa Julix nao fornecia o suporte necessario para que os trabalhadores exercessem a sua melhor performance.."
good,Long days assembling trucks yearning for some relief. Just a normal factory where everyone wishes they were not there. The most enjoyable part of the day is leaving.
good,I will drive the car if any complaint to write the complaint book
good,"job is usefull but salary low."
good,"Very unionized, if one wants to excell basically I found it was who you knew and not based as much on your productivity."
good,"Great place to work. Room for advancement after being with the organization for a long period of time (6+ years). Hard to get information from Leadership, rather than getting answers you get ""it is what it is"". Requests are made for suggestions to make changes but changes are not made based on lower salary employee suggestions. Difficult to get into a field that was studied in college. College Graduate Program tailored to place associate where needed rather than suggesting a temporary fit with a promise to make the attempt to get the associate into their desired area."
good,Typical day 8-10 hrs
good,"Overall rating a 3, the compensation was good, got paid on a weekly basis, but after the layoff they dropped their pay, and it took about 4 years before you got medical benefits. The culture was good, I really liked the people their, you'll find your own group to fit in with because its soo many people, but it can be stressful on a relationship though. Job security and advancement i think was the worst, I did not see any job advancement for anyone, and we were constantly laid off due to production. It seemed like management and your union rep were the same person, so take that how you want to. Depending on your shift and if there was forced overtime then your work/life balance would be fine, just in case, have some support if you have kids."
good,"In my capacity as a disability coordinator at Ford Motor Company, I had to ensure that early and safe return to work policies were being followed, implement and kept up with current disability trends. We had to keep track of cost claims and developed short term and long goals to reduce the overall financial cost of disability at Ford of Canada. In addition to short term case management, I also managed the long term complex cases. I would work with all stakeholders to over come many barriers that would be preventing return to work. It is important to note that we worked within the collective agreements and human rights legislation. I activity worked with the union to help ensure that long term solutions were met. I have extensive knowledge of WSIB and communicated on daily basis with case managers to move claims forward. I have worked with Work Transition Specialist and Return to Work Specialist. Additionally, I attend weekly ergonomic meets to bring up issues that have been identified on floor. And daily safety meeting to go over injuries, department safety walks, accident investigations or other safety issues."
good,"Being an autoworker means long hours in a very fast paced and, often, physically grueling environment. Quality and efficiency is extremely important. The pay and benefits are very good so leaving is done with the knowledge that you might not get another job that offers vacation pay."
good,Worked to the best of my abilities each day and on each task that i was given to perform. Many days in the facility were either really hot or really cold depending on the season.
good,"zero growth potential. extremely boring, yet some positions can be very stressful with having limited time to complete a task. some overworked areas and some jobs require you to constantly move in and out of the vehicle."
good,"a empresa em si e boa para se trabalhar com serviços compatíveis com sua área, bons salários, e benefícios, a parte ruim, e a chefia, onde nao reconhece seus funcionários e onde tem muito panela, tipo pessoas favorecidas."
good,"I was hired by E-Tech to work for the Chyrsler Plant and was working for the Ford plant also on the Holidays, Meanwhile, The Management from the Ford Plant allowed us females to be Harassed my the Supervisor at the Chysler Plant. I made the report and the Ford Supervisor told me to be very quite and it would go away. I spoke to the Union and made a report and was fired."
good,No hay entendimiento por parte de jefe y no hay igualdad
good,Ford once felt like a family but that culture is rapidly changing into a  more sterile and cold environment.  The company is changing at a very quick pace.   I am very grateful for my years at the company and I wish it and all of it's employees all the best in future.
good,"Modern day lambdas, begging for an opportunity to be devalued through veiled slavery."
good,It is company culture at the plant level to live at work. People will casually work Saturday and Sunday every week and make you feel bad for not coming in. The pay was great but at what cost.
good,"They keep temps for years on end. They use and abuse temps by playing with there hours and insurance at will. If you are hired in after years of the struggle you have a solid job for life. You will most likely be in multiple plant and spend 3 or more years waiting to finally get hired. After you are hired benefits are great and the pay is good, and job security."
good,Ford is trying to get in the league of the new age companies and is fighting for survival. however the plan is not clearly rolled down to the last employee and many distorted communication
good,I personally didn't like how I was treated there. A lot of the people there are disrespectful and don't know how to treat or talk to you. The job just wasn't a good fit for me.
good,Show up at work. We the Line starts you put on your parts on vehicle and when done you go back to work station and get parts ready for next vehicle. Repeat like 600 times a day. When the line stops at end off the day we then go home
good,"I can only speak for the field, but the culture varied widely depending on your region and management. Some places offered a better work life balance than others. Some offered more opportunities for advancement than others. Some managers were more accommodating than others. There was little consistency. Overall, to become a manager, you basically need to be at the company 10 years. I had colleagues leave to receive manager roles at other companies that only people with 20-year tenures receive at Ford. The pay and benefits are amazing though, so it’s very easy to get trapped."
good,"Not a terrible place to work, but just know that you are nothing more than a body to that company. It is super fast paced and physically demanding, but the benefits are amazing."
good,Liderança não alinhada com a proposta da empresa. Procedimentos pró-forma. Politicagem descarada.
good,Stressful and face paced. Diverse workforce with need of better management skills. I have not had a very good experience at Ford Motor Company over the five years I have worked there. To many safety hazards and harassment issues.
good,I liked what I did for Moser Motor Sales.  I just needed to work closer to home because of my small children and a job with more pay as well as benefits.
good,"Gostei de atuar nesta empresa,mesmo sendo terceirizado."
good,"Very bad working conditions. Crazy hot in summer, building floods when it rains, trash on the truck side of the place.  Very bad management. Favoritism & cliques run the shop. The best part of the job for me is working in my own area. Equipment was also dated, old drills & tolls."
good,Ford was a cool place to work. i had fun learning different jobs in the building of the Ford Super Duty. The few draw backs for me were being a temp for over 2 years and only being given medical benifit s but no prescription coverage or vision or Dental. Having to pay Union Dues and not being treated likea Union brother was a big draw back for me as well. i did meet many great people whom i am still friends with so that is a plus.
good,"General administration and daily liason with dealers. Follow up with accounts payable regarding outstanding supplier payments."
good,Job was purchased services. No clear job description was ever given and my manager was too busy to meet with me. I had a great review and all of a sudden I was let go because I wasn't a good fit.
good,The production floor is fast  paced and stressful.  You need to be able to handle stress in that position.  You also need to be able to work well with others
good,Depending on the plant and plant manager would dictate how you would feel about Ford Motor Company. Have worked for great plant managers who made working at the company a 5 star have worked the last plant who made working at Ford a 2.
good,its seems like the higher up the chain people go the more they become intolerable. everyone at your level comes across friendly. Ford promotes their interns almost exclusively or else hire into a higher position.
good,I have been with Ford for 8+ years. Berkeley Ford is my second dealer. Within the last 3 years I have been through 5 different managers. This dealer has no structure and I can't deal.
good,"Company took a great turn around out of 2008 financial crisis and was on right track for few years under Mulally's leadership, but then derailed back to business as usual soon after his departure. "
good,"was a good place to work until 2005. after truck plant closed attitude of management changed and employees attitude declined. the introduction of a two tiered wage system started the decline of the union and produced excessive in fighting amongst workers,much to the delight of upper management part of their plan to weaken the union"
good,"This job was very stressful. The long drive to work was rough, The work environment is very hostile, Many managers are there to get peoples jobs. Most people had addiction issues from work enviroment"
good,When I applied for Ford I was supposed to be hired for a full time positon. Only after I was there for approximately 4 months did I find out that I was considered a Temp employee. Ford used us as needed when their full time employees took off of work or were out on Medical leave. I have worked for Ford for 2 seasons and have heard that I will either be hired or retained as a temp until the next contract is negotiated which will be in 2019.
good,"Ciber gave promises they couldn't keep.  Promised a lead position, I moved cross country for and they gave it to someone else.  They did give me the salary but I have too much experience to pull the salary."
good,"na I wasnt a fan of the culture or the management. The union wasnt always helpful. "
good,"work life balance is not good. excessive bureaucracy stops the ideas and opinions."
good,Stuck in dead end contract with no benefits and no chance of getting hired in direct. Work and life balance is good. High turn over rate causes more work. No raises or increase in vacation time regardless of time at the job.
good,"Ford is still a great place to work, and given the proper role and a manager  that supports, can be one of the most satisfying companies to work with."
good,I worked and gained knowledge about automobile industry. Ford produces great products. Works truly towards customer satisfaction and they force more and more to achieve high on customer delight.
good,The five years I was there it was a quick paced job with good pay. However there were long hours with short breaks. Also management could've been better but decent workers. My five years was a great experience.
good,A typical day at work involves managing a very stressful workforce.  These are adults that act like they are in middle school. The upper management dont make it much better.  Due to their inexperience it causes strain on the supervisors.
good,"If you never want to see your family then this is the place for you, the managers and supervisors have no regard for your safety or your family all that they care abut is production, if you get hurt bad they pull you off lay you on the ground replace you An keep that line moving."
good,Kariyer Yolunda Güçlü Bir Başlangıçiçin ideal bir ortam sunmaktadır
good,It was very monotonous. Same thing every day. Very stressful. Injuries were common due to repetitive motions. It takes a special person to do the same thing day in and day out.
good,"Empresa com nome forte no mercado de trabalho, uma das grandes multinacionais no país, salario maravilhoso, benefícios otimos.....mas muito mal administrada, um carro caro q é facilmente superado pela concorrência e a empresa nao se importa em abaixar o preco, ou arrumar uma solução para conseguir se adequar ao mercado a solucao q ela acha é mandar os funcionários embora, esse e o melhor jeito pra ela se adequar ao mercado! Administração muito ruim desde da gerência até o líder de produção, infelizmente prestes a fechar as portas, pela péssima administração, por não preservar o mais importante nela.. o funcionário q se dedica muito, e q pra ela e só um número descartável... o q importa é só os carros e caminhões, e o lucros q ela consegue ganhar! Gostei muito de trabalhar na empresa, aprendi muita coisa q nao conhecia em linha de produção, uma experiência muito boa, falta uma gerenciamento melhor para a empresa voltar a ser grande.. aqui no Brasil....salário e benefícios, ótimos!"
good,Pretty good automotive company for people who can deal with a massive bureaucracy that values tenure above all else. Ford is a corporate dinosaur that has a prevailing old school culture. Ford does a lot of things well when it comes to building vehicles however the company seems to be very set in its ways for better or for worse.
good,"I loved the physical work involved in the job, but the job culture made it difficult to continue working with this company.  There is an excessive amount of drug and alcohol use on the job.  This is not something I was comfortable working around any longer."
good,"I enjoy the everyday challenges that come with my position because, Ford is a very fast paced and productive company with many changes by the second. I learn by the minute and mostly everything is self taught because, of the changes that take place at any time. A typical day at work is very upbeat, meaning staying on top of safety, quality, and productivity at all times. I have learned how to maintain and manage over hundreds of people and making sure that Ford Motor Company produces the number one Super Duty to consumers."
good,"My ethical side always reminds me ""When you don't have anything nice to say, then say nothing at all""...............................crickets.............................."
good,"I loved car sales, but I needed a more stable job.  The 8 or the gate policy was stressing and taxing on your head.  A typical day was either getting on the phones to cold call people or waiting for a customer to drive onto the lot.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to drive new vehicles when they launched and working at the Motortrend Auto show."
good,It's a nice job to have if you are a full-time employee!  With going from tpt to sts it's kind of hard deciding if you want to keep the job.  Or the fact that you just keep wondering if you will ever get hired in full-time!
good,"Being at a dealership you are exposed to the ins and outs of the car world and it being car make specific you end up learning everything about that make.  And as far as training is concerned the possibilities are endless, unfortunately working for a dealership does have a lot of drawbacks, mainly the drama of a high school world and there is a lot of political stuff involved, everything is based on time down to how you get paid."
good,"A typical work day is basically making sure that all production equipment is operative prior to starting up the line. And the production line maintains it's cycle counts, & that all allocated parts are  inspected prior to loading of cell/fixture according to OIS . And that ""ALL""  safety procedures are followed! I've learned the importance taking personal ownership  of my job along with being detailed and working as a team is vital...this includes management! Also communication and mutual respect between management and my co-workers are of the utmost importance in order for us to the most efficient, productive team. And  in order to operate at full capacity and excellence we must have clear and open dialogue daily!"
good,"Can learn new things, have lot of opportunity to work across different culture. but the whole system works like a Govt company."
good,"a typical work day, what I learned, management, your coworkers, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I can't say much that that is good.  As a senior mainframe person,  I have not been afforded the same benefits as my co-workers that have been here for twenty years.  The only thing you hear about with promotions is mid-managers or upper-managers being promoted to the next level.  This is definitely a good-old boys network.  Managers here don't act like managers;  they tend to be frustrated technicians who make lousy supervisors or managers.  Part of it is that they don't provide any formal training for managers.  They have some self-study courses.  Managers here are more concerned about their own interests then their people.  Then if you throw in the physical facilities, it's a nasty place to work.  They haven't put any money into some of their building for 25 years.  Dirt everywhere,  air quality is terrible, and the bathrooms are nasty."
good,"Es una excelente oportunidad de estar ahi porque se aprende mucho, es muy buena escuela como dicen. El ambiente es un poco frio y se respira mucha competitividad. "
good,The work hours & workload are very intense and challenging. This job is not for anyone 45 years and over it is very hard on the body.
good,I enjoyed the job. The work was repetitious. The building had no A/C so it was very hot in the summer. I enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,"Daily management of Material department employees, inventory management and storage in support of the production line. Ensuring minimal stock is line side for production use."
good,journée de travail épuisante  opportunité pour mon poste il n'y en a pas  le management est très dur  mes collaborateurs en général sont agréable sauf  2 personnes/l'aspect la plus difficiles la charge a porter ainsi toujours les mêmes mouvements et l'aspect la plus agréable ces le contact avec la clientèle
good,"Good company with a long history.  Processes need to be improved to include global platforms, current facilities for engineers to sit are extremely outdated and lack design and are depressing.  The company keeps stating they want to cultivate innovation, yet management is not willing to spend the money to encourage innovation.  Working in a dirty, depressing building is not going to make me want to be creative.  Upper management doesn't always give the best direction (usually because their management doesn't provide it)."
good,"Money is great, but thats about it. long hours and hostile work environment can make for challenging days at work"
good,Assembly line work require constant focus on a job. This was a place where I learned some of the parts and drives of a car
good,Not much to say. Environment was not good. People were very gossip and not productive. Very bureaucratic work. Management was a mess.
good,"- always something new happening"
good,"Team worker, very dependable! Even though you're ahead on your performance, supervisors folow you around contantly"
good,"A trevauto é uma empresa muito boa, "
good,"Typical manufacturing job, working 10 hour shifts were I build sub-assemblies in the Body shop. Union brothers and sisters are all easy to get along with."
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo = Es como en el ejercito todo marcha sin excusa ni pretexto, siempre orientado a resultados con una visión y mentalidad analítica"
good,"Before it was really fun working but with the appointment of new G.M everything is changed actually our new G.M is a chartered accountant and he made so many new changes to the system, Ultimately the result is job dissatisfaction in every expect even my other employees are not satisfied with the changes."
good,I like working for the company. I enjoyed working with so many differn't people from so many differen't places. It payed low that is the reason I left the company.
good,Daily team meeting .
good,"produktiebewaking aan pers,instellen van pers en robotten"
good,"Our plant fell prey to the ""Big Three's"" objective to move all component manufacturing to "" Lower Cost Manufacturing Environments."" It had operated in the black since the 1950's but was closed just the same. When the decision was made to spin to Visteon the family atmosphere of the past was gone. It was replaced with an Imperical attitude that was uncomfortable. It was a great plcace to work but is now gone forever."
good,"Laid back place to work, but I feel like Iive there! They are not very flexible at all. I want more time with my family"
good,"i learned here how to communicate to the other people how to discuss or demo the products. how to make business appointment, field works and telephone marketing"
good,Not proper automation tools at the time but upgraded and made it to work.
good,i had to run 6 CNC machine and check parts on the hour i made rack and opion for the f150 and the ford focus
good,Good to work but very low salary for trainee. confirmation should be confident for 1 year trainee though he can settled his life earlier. wants to update our culture as per our government rules.
good,LInha de produção trabalho intenso instressante. Precisa ter um condicionamento fisico  e mental.
good,fast paced work environment can be fun if individuals are interested in working with tools and assembly productivity. co-workers can be friendly and helpful
good,so many talented hard working people managed by stiff corporate culture with cut throat promotions.  Extensive internal controls stifle speed and agility.
good,"Earlier this year Ford went  through a global transition for salaried employees where it targeted reducing higher seniority, pension eligible, nothing to do with performance, reductions.  A lot of good workers were let go and a lot of the management that needed to go protected themselves from being reduced.  The organization has restructured and a lot of people are in new jobs, without a lot of direction or job knowledge.  As a result there is a lot of frustration within the organization at the moment but hopefully it will get better over time.  The company historically has gone through these type of reductions about every 8-10 years,  It reduces, and then over time builds resources up again, and then has to adjust again with reductions.  There are a lot of jobs open now for new, younger, lower paid, no pension positions.  Ford does pay well and there are a lot of career opportunities if you want to pursue them.  The company is hurting due to the lack of management direction that is currently in place but that will change as the top managers move on.  When I started with the company I really considered it a “family organization” but that is no longer the case and I don’t see that ever returning."
good,"Family own good crew to work with, the work life balance is tough especially if you have a family, but it a sale job, you get what you put out, you must be a go getter; Knowing how to Penetrate the crowd of people who walk and get them to land on a vehicle is key.  If anything YOU MUST BE TOUGH, you have to have a TOUGH SKIN and be able to ROLL with the PUNCHES beside that, it a job"
good,"Finance careers at Ford require long hours and exceptional effort.  On the plus side, many different rotations available through functions such as Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales, Product Development, etc."
good,"I worked at Ford Motor Company for almost 5 years. I learned how to pace myself over a long day making parts, and I also learned how the plant moves. Management was difficult to talk to because of company policy. The hardest part of the job was the job itself, and working the schedule that I did (weekend Swing)."
good,"people coming at you from all directions,  ford mgt. subcontractors union representatives.  several of which will throw you under the bus SHOCKING. too many people getting trained and orientated. safety not being practiced. terrible negative attitudes. I was a independent contractor in as a lead safety manager for general contractor."
good,the new culture has made the Ford Motor company a workplace I would not recommend. Management would eat their own mother to get a step up the corporate ladder.
good,"Early in my career at Ford I had a couple good managers. Later after several layoffs, IT was not fun to work there anymore. Only a few were stars and no matter what you do it is not good enough."
good,Its to many politics and everyone is in everyone business as long as you do your job you are OK for the most part . i have noticed favoritism . So you jus have to remain to yourself
good,Is a great company to work to enhance a full assembly process with good car & truck model. best place to learn and experience the new things and technology in the day to day Job
good,"good work life balance but less flexibility with management in terms of snow days and sick hours. Low appraisals for salary which is not really great, which it were better."
good,Working at Ford was a great experience.  It is a very face paced and competitive environment.  Working for Ford has really challenge the managerial skills that I already encompassed.
good,The job requires a significant amount of time invested weekly. Heavy hours can be difficult for work life balance. Overtime is regularly available to work and often required.
good,"Empresa onde você tem a oportunidade e exposição para aprender e se desenvolver muito. São muitos anos no mercado, o que te permite conhecer muito sobre processos vencedores. Porém, a empresa parou um pouco no tempo ao não investir de forma mais agressiva quando deveria, e hoje está sofrendo o impacto."
good,Loved being on the phone with potential customers. Loved learning new software programs. Loved feeling like I was contributing to the overall success of the company.
good,As an intern I had a great experience.  Nice co-workers and gained valuable experience working on projects with different levels of employees from hourly to management.
good,"The benefits were good and many aspects of the job very fun, but there was a lot of daily meetings that weren't necessary and a lot of stress brought on from lack of cohesion between departments. In addition, management is constantly changing and those changes hinder innovation."
good,"some days are very relaxed and others are very stressful it all depends on the season or the deals going on really, the summer is usually very busy rather than the winter"
good,"This is when the market went under, and Ford was in the Red.  Their corporate best interest was to sell the building to Taco Bell, and move forward with re creating themselves."
good,not much of a work/life balance.  Short handed on other managers so you have to cover multiple areas.  Typically work 6-7 days in a row.  Never know what shift you will be on.
good,"The company seems to be on track with others, but I was contract and due to a reogianzation in my department it made it nearly impossible to get hired direct and grow your career."
good,"Prospeccion de clientes y cierre de operaciones "
good,The people are great to work with but the rules of getting work done are unbendable except for the next tier of management.  Ratings of work approval are made by off site activities which can be harmfull if you are not an after hours kind of person;
good,"Trabajo en equipo, exelente vision laboral, desarrollo en el ámbito laboral, trabajo correctivo, preventivo y de calidad"
good,"The relationship between hourly and salary was rough. I was told by a few workers I would probably be gone in six months. Some of the workers showed low motivation and were frustrated when they had to work more than two hours of their shift. It was interesting getting to know the equipment, but only a few of the workers were willing to help new people learn. I ended up working about six days per week. The pay was nice but the job was very stressful."
good,"typical factory environment long hours good pay repetitive work management is not friendly nor helpful, coworkers are very cut throat. Good pay and benefits if you can handle the work"
good,"Como multinacional, se respeta muchisimo la diversidad. Hay que mejorar la estructura fisica de las oficinas que muchas veces queda sin mantenimiento. Como el proceso de fabricacion de veiculos es muy compleja, el learning curve es más lento y creo que eso affecta las promociones. Hay una cultura de mantener las personas en el mismo puesto por muchos años."
good,"Good place to work if you need health insurance, fast paced, a lot of days off, the managers are terrible, they only hire short term temps now and if you get hurt you will get fired."
good,"The union culture was adversarial with management. This meant constant fighting and arguing. Union workers often have problems with each other (lots of drama). It was relatively easy work, but there was no security in it. You could get laid off any minute."
good,Hard non-stop assembly with almost no chance for new employees to move into better positions. Company Non-union workers do more than the Union guys over you. Nasty work environment with almost unbearable heat in summer hours. Constant non-stop production work that is extremely hard on mind and body. Workers that put in the best work not appreciated but piled on more work for them. Do your best and hold on till you can't stand it any longer.
good,"Ford Motor Company does a pretty good job of compensating their employees for an honest day's work.  Few other companies today match Ford's compensation package i.e. hourly pay, healthcare benefits, paid time off, and bonuses.  The workplace culture, however, is stifling at best.  There is very little opportunity for advancement or promotion for someone starting out on the plant floor.  Often times one's only option for getting a less physically-demanding job that utilizes one's skills and talent, is to go the UAW route, which is super cliquey.  As I mentioned, my experience has been that Ford (the company itself) does not promote from within, even for qualified employees.  Management often lack people skills, which perpetuates the rift between hourly and salary employees.  In general, the morale on the plant floor is low, which is the backbone of Ford's workplace culture."
good,"It’s cool not dealing with customers. If you feel like talking there’s always workers there to talk to when you’re bored. Days you don’t want to socialize, just put in your headphones and jam out. It’ll make time go by faster. There’s not that many people there in their early 20s so it made me get out of my comfort zone to talk to the older coworkers (majority) more. There can be drama but mind your own to stay out of it. Doing the same motions everyday really does cause wear and tear to your body. Also we never know what time we’ll get out so this was very challenging for someone still in college or with children."
good,Working for FMC is very stressful with long work days. Life/work balance is something they say but do not practice. Not a bad place to work if you do not have or want a family.
good,This is a good job.  It pays well and has great benefits.   But it is extremely hard on your body.  Repetitive motion injuries are very common.  Management is constantly on your case if you have to shut the line down for something.
good,"I've worked at Ford for almost 2 years now. It was my first full time job after high school and waitressing, definitely brings money to the table. But my hours are on 3rd shift, I've tried my best to transfer to morning shift to acclimate with my life outside of work, but I was sadly denied. Therefore, searching for a new job opportunity in hopes of getting a morning or evening shift."
good,"Management wa looking a the time for any was to reduce cost short turm, this proved to be a major mistake to the facility following the may cuts performed at the time"
good,"Not the worst job, not the best job. Pay is decent, but not a whole lot of room for advancement and almost no room for lateral movement. A lot of your happiness depends on your direct supervisor."
good,"I did not mind the job itself, though management for the detailing bay was very poor. Saturdays and staying after was also a pain because you wouldn't be able to go home till all the vehicles that was in the talks of being sold are clean and gone."
good,If you have a family the hours are tough to do every day activities with family. It is very hard because you don't have much time on certain shifts to be at home to help kids.
good,"Good work life balance. Competitive Salary. Lower level managers are against change and don't think outside the box. Very slow moving and slow to adopt change. Do not welcome different views and opinions. Very process oriented, to a fault. Forces you into group think and blind loyalty."
good,"Highly stressful, toxic environment. However, you learn quickly and grow as a manager. Holding employees accountable becomes extremely easy and being assertive/aggressive becomes second nature. Highly political environment. Great compensation, but be careful not to create a life where you are dependent on that salary. Few places pay like Ford does."
good,Empresa multinacional fabricantes de veículos que possui o centro de desenvolvimento no estado da Bahia.
good,"ùltimos 2 anos a gestão do medo foi estabelecida com a troca do diretor de RH, que foi agravado pela crise no setor."
good,"A typical day at work is all about taking phone calls, chats, and answering emails pertaining to any issue customers face regarding their FordPass.issue.  "
good,"There are huge amount of time spent by employees in attending the meetings at various level which has drastic impact on the productivity of the employees and hence on the organisation."
good,Company is in constant crisis mode. Continuous stress about job security. Work -life balance depends on immediate team. Managers can block advancement.
good,managers were very uneducated but the  money was kind of worth it ..working under such unprofessional people... the building was very hot at times.. i feel the more you put in work at this company the more you get un noticed
good,Work at Ford to get experience only. No longer a career move. It is not a place that once works for the rest of their careers. Management is quick to blame subordinates.
good,Falta de Oportunidades de Carreira e crescimento profissional na empresa.
good,"Repetitive, boring, takes no skill. It's a job that pays well. Management is horrible. There are a few good coworkers in between a lot of not so good people."
good,"The Job was good but the supervisor was a very man person and very hard to work with, the culture was not so good given several people had died in the plant I worked in."
good,Mi valoración fue buena estuve poco tiempo pero valoro mucho el compañerismo que tuve y lo aprendido en el sector.
good,Working as a contractor is somewhat unsatisfying but I really enjoy the people I work with and the type of work I do.  Working in manufacturing means that there is something new to learn every day.
good,"I would come in, early prep for whatever work i might be doing. I try to keep up with the line, Quickly adding or modifying a part to the unit, and then repeat the same tasks for * hours, each taking about a minute and a half. small line stopages happen frequently and briskly as every manager tries to keep the line gooing non stop. The hardest part is keeping up with the units as the line keeps moving, some jobs have small tasks while others are extensive."
good,"Communicating with staff member's at Ford"
good,Direct manager is not experienced enough for the role he stepped into witch desegregated work experience. made day to day very tedious and stressful. overall organization and owners we pleasant
good,"Great place to work if you 'fit in' and are willing to work hard with good pay, perks and cheap food (if poor quality). "
good,"This type of work isn't for everyone however, my advice would be to try it out for yourself. Come in do the job to the best of your ability and you should be fine."
good,"People working together as a lean, global enterprise to make people’s lives better through automotive and mobility leadership."
good,"very good place to start and great guys to work with. they gave me a chance to grow my knowledge in this industry so I feel greatful for the shot, but you cant grow much."
good,"If you have a job you currently love or even like, do not come to Ford. My 1st 87 days working at Ford we had 1 nurse quit, 1 nurse terminated after only being at Ford for 2 weeks & I was terminated the next day citing I wasn't learning or working fast enough. Makes it difficult when there is no structured orientation program, no one wants acts like they want to help you & everyone just out for themselves."
good,"Almost everyone there is fantastic to work with. Management is very poorly organized, and they do not treat their employees fare."
good,Needs better manger at TEK to listen when you complain about how the job responsibilities are not what you were offered. TEK don't listen and just wait till your contract ends with them.
good,But management for my particular department was very tight and over-managed.  Too much micro-managing of employees and not enough attention to things that needed to be fixed in the workplace.  They seemed to care more about irrelevant things.
good,"Auditing is a high energy job with a lot of demands. You have to be self-motivated and work flexible hours. The joy of working with engineers local as well as form other states is very self-rewarding.   One thing  work on is the location of the constraints with in the department and brain storm on how we can adapt a lean working team that would adapt and release the constraint on the area or department. "
good,It was good to learn the work environment and also very good experience. But the only thing is the salary was not given on time.
good,"Need to be in click."
good,"Work was enjoyable, I learned a lot at Ford but there should be a clear learning program especially for university graduates."
good,"Turnover is so high that work is often left incomplete. Many contract workers are often treated as outcast, which creates animosity about being a Ford employee. Most Managers will favor family and friends for direct hire positions. Culture of intimidation is common and most are afraid to speak about it for fear of being terminated. This is reflective of the history of  quality issues within the entire American auto industry."
good,"Came on as a contract position, left when it was made clear that permanent positions would be few and far between. Overall a good job though, and being in a manufacturing environment is very interesting and fast-paced."
good,Ford is a very old school bureaucratic organization that could use some innovative thought leaders to drive significant improvements in process and operations!
good,"Every day am going to company on the time to the company. i learned from company how to work on safety,quality and delivery. I support to the management .my co-workers are guided to me work balance. Am not thinking any of those job are hardest. Engine fitting parts are enjoyable of the job."
good,Ford is a prestigous company to work for. Ford gave me my first job out of college and I was very happy. It will be nice to work for Ford again.
good,I don't believe you receive proper training to complete the job they are requiring of their employees. They will and have changed people's schedules without notice and I do not think that's fair. The hardest part about the job would not being able to find a member of management when you have a customer/client waiting.
good,"Chegava na empresa ia ao refeitorio tomar café da manhã depois colocava os ipis entrava na área e ia para o dds. Aprendir varias operações e fiz alguns cursos que a empresa oferece. Com a gerencia não tive muito contato mas posso dizer que todos trabalhavamos para o crescimento da mesma. Sempre tive um entendimento com meus colegas de trabalho, procuravamos deixar o ambiente harmonioso. Era muito agradavel quando batiamos a meta e todos nós elogiavamos."
good,a typical day is arriving 30 minutes before start time be on the job 10 minutes before start time get ear plugs and gloves go on the robot line wait for line to start load parts into robot fixtures step out of light guard push robot call button wait for robot to finish welding and for robot to take welded part away and repeat process i have learned a lot about production lines and robotics over the 27 years i was employed there the managment were not to bad my co-workers were ok the most enjoyable part was learning how robots work
good,There is lack of motivation for employees and job security is a big issue! They can surely make things more productive with a younger workforce and one that is more futuristic.
good,"Able to work independently as well as in groups. "
good,"Emails, meetings, and spreadsheets were the essence of my daily life at Ford. I was an engineer in title only. Almost nothing I did required more engineering knowledge than one could gain within a month or two. My responsibilities were more akin to an extraneous middle-manager, as everything I did was for the purpose of asking others to do things for me."
good,"Even though some constructions have taken long, those office and building renovations are worth it later on. New interior designs allowed greater collaboration and an overall better mood at work."
good,"Ford has a great reputation within its own walls, for how much it cares about the work hours and leisure time of its employees. Great effort is put into making this group feel needed and appreciated."
good,The only thing that I have to say is the pay was the only thing that kept me there. If you don't have a life then this is the place to be. After my family grew up and I had little debt. Gone baby was gone.
good,Trusted to complete duties in a timely manner appropriate for company expectations.  Can be fast paced and challenging at times but also very rewarding.
good,"It’s just a place to get your paycheck and leave. People always want to back stab you and the supervisors want more and more from you. There is so much favoritism, that the lazy people get rewarded and the best workers get left behind"
good,Empresa com ambiente agradável e carga horária excelente.
good,It was a good job and the experience is too real the union is no good they show favoritism only because you are a part time worker but u work full time hours
good,"Skills learned early in my career were constantly being upgraded or were no longer pertinent to the job application."
good,Too many layers of management and number of upper management.  Decision making takes too long. Benefits continue to get cut/reduced. Very intelligent and nice people to work with.
good,"For going through tough time, lots of uncertainty regarding job security. Not sure when your job will be cut and you will be asked to leave."
good,Ford Motor Co has reached the point where the direction of the company is changing and they are starting to trim down old Ford for new Ford.  This is creating anxiety with employees at this time.
good,"They dont rotate you from station to station like supose to your work 7 days a week 12 hours for months why because Ford said so I quit .  They work us like dogs at webasto I work on the Ford line 7 days straight 12 hours for months then 6 days for like 6 months,  12 hours they drop parts they put them right back on the line , Mercedes line that would never happen but Ford line in the q1 flag line how can we give Ford the sunroofs if you work is like a dog how can we cook a meal for ours kids if we are never home that's a hard job making those sunroofs for Ford so why kill us everybody fights and argue on line why because we see each other more then we see our kids or mom and dad I'm glad I'm not there no more my body hurt less .. my new job cares and I still work for a car company pays less but less stress and i get to see my kids ."
good,Management pushes supervisors to write people up vs coaching and leading them towards being better professionals and/or providing training and leadership development.
good,A typical day had meeting and conference calls at least 3 times a week. Iearned a lot about processes and procedures. Some of the management were okay and some were not. The ones they were not had no people skills. The workplace culture was okay. The hardest part of my job was not being recognized for going over and above. Working long hours was expected. The most thing that I enjoyed about my job was my employees and co-workers that made the day pleasurable.
good,"I enjoyed working for Ford, but when I realized that there were no advancement options for me, I moved on to a place where there were.  The hardest part of the job was getting used to new jobs when you got moved.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got used to the job, I could just do it without thinking about it and listen to music or talk to the person beside me."
good,"On a typical day at work, there are many meetings to support throughout the day. "
good,Never thought i would ever get into the Big3. Im a tier 2 so it took a really long time to get where im at now. So in short ford has its ups and downs just like life.
good,Lets have a meeting about the meeting we just had! Expect to be stuck in your role for at least 2-3 years due to HR making every worker fit into the same bucket.  They drastically underpay compared to other markets and the politics that go on during your average workday are enough to drive any person crazy.
good,I started at the end of the short term supplemental workers (that are kind of like Fords temp to hire but are still Ford employees).  After 13 months I found out I could not change out of my department and would never have enough senority to be a Ford employee with full benefits.
good,Ford has been very good to me I appreciate the time that has been giving to me considering it’s becoming a hassle for me to get up early and take my daughter to school due to the late work hours I have it’s very hard to get a shift change I am no longer able to keep up with there schedule and hours they need us to work
good,"Overall has great benefits and pay, unfortunately the company itself doesn’t care about you. You are just a number to them. Poor management. Unsanitary work environments."
good,"Tasks varied & although many were pretty easy, they all take a toll on your body over time. There is a wide diversity of employees but most of them all seemed to have one thing in common, little or no morals. It was a very depressing place to work."
good,Automotive industry is highly cyclical. Nobody at Ford makes decisions that impact the business unless you have put in at least 20+ years of time at the company.
good,Couldn't ask for more as far as compensation+benefits and a flexible work schedule. Work environment is cut throat and everyone feels the need to validate their job because they are constantly afraid they are going to get fired at any minute.
good,"One of the highest paid production jobs but you WORK HARD for the money. HARD LABOR! Not a job for a person who's needed in their family's life. Great PAY and benefits but long hours 10-12 hr days. Also, little to no wiggle room for attending anything for you kids or family."
good,good pay and hours but overuse of same movements can break the body down. The jobs that you are assigned can vary. There are two shifts. seniority based postitions and you bid on jobs you want.
good,I am satisfied with the work relationship. I would prefer to be classified as a full time employee with a future path of employment. Currently working as a temporary employee.
good,Ford is a good place to work and to get valuable work experience.  It is a faced paced place to work and can be very challenging.  The rotating shifts is hard to deal with for family life.
good,"Great company with fantastic benefits.  Expect long days and a lot of weekends/overtime. Like any large organization, you work with some really good people and some very bad people."
good,"Working at ford is a relaxing environment. Get paid well and very flexible with work/life balance. "
good,"It is not a bad place to work, just not for me. The hours for the weekend shift are not really all that great. 2 days on day shift then 2 days on night shift. Most jobs are physically demanding and the heat stress is unreal. The politics behind the union factory worker at Ford and not very conducive to a healthy mental state."
good,"It takes 15-20 minutes to walk from your car to your job. Then you don't stop walking once the line starts.  It's a physically demanding job, a dangerous job & if you like variety,  don't work there.  You are essentially a machine. That's your job."
good,"Promises will likely be made that never get delivered, despite work ethic and attitude being great.  I was promised schooling for the entire year there in exchange for great work and attitude, they never delivered, I left. Health insurance was a joke price wise, decent coverage but was and still is outrageously expensive."
good,"In product development it is impossible to get anything done. There are a thousand approvals, checks and sign offs to go through before even menial things can be done. Even getting internet access at a new building can take weeks."
good,Good job for quick cash not the long run.  Managers some are good some are horrible.  Very old school not very progressive company.  If you need a job you can make money quick and leave here it is.
good,"Automotive is a cut-throat culture, and the plant environment is even tougher.  Quality and production are king at the plants as they pump out a new vehicle every minute or more."
good,Very hard work the hours and shifts may very. People are very nice. The management runs this place like your in the service though. You have to have thick skin to deal with the different personalities.
good,"Poor management, good benifits, helping co workers, management very in organized. Learned a lot on the job training. Good experience in the automotive industry"
good,"management is fine. but some work station is hard. some work station easy. Easy work station is take a TO training operators."
good,Very busy requires a lot of training after aprentership still more required very repetitive low pay long hours very dirty requires you to be physically fit
good,"The company's organization is good, and are able to look to the future for changes and they reinvest into the company and it's workers.  They hours were long and grueling at times."
good,"I'm sure my experience is atypical. However, my body was not up to the task of what was expected as somebody who works on the line. "
good,I thought I had found my dream job until the training was over and I stepped onto the floor. Everything that I had been told in regards to how people are to be treated was completely false. Management is constantly yelling on the radio and public performance reviews are the norm. Not a good environment- the pay is the only reason I have stayed as long as I have. I am actively seeking other employment.
good,"I absolutely love my manager, he is one of the best people I know, he always gives me perks as he can't actually dictate salary, but have never been treated wrong by the people in my department. However for a qualified and motivated person they pay minimum wage when I do the same tasks as the manager."
good,"I spent 11+ years at Ford, and completely enjoyed myself for most of that time.  However, when the auto industry takes a down-turn, as it often does, the work environment becomes ""hyper-competitive"" to the point where it's not sustainable.  I chose to leave to maintain my sanity and integrity in the early 2000's.  I hope they have changed a bit since then."
good,"A typical day at Ford consisted of managing two lines, both final assembly.  Management was OK most of the time, but not always fair.  The union did step in to help those who were constantly in trouble, but if you had a legitimate claim and never had a problem, the union would usually let your grievance go."
good,"Traditional   American    Company. . . .            ."
good,There is little respect given from either upper management or the union. Its a tough environment. Compensation is good though.
good,"I enjoyed working at ford because there was so much going on. People seemed somewhat complacent, but none the less if you wanted to work hard then it could potentially be rewarding."
good,Es mala ya que no hay un buen ambiente y hay mal manejo de personal asi como preferencias
good,Fast paced manufacturing production environment. Managed 25 to 35 people on a daily basis performing construction of Ford F-150 front axles. Managed skilled trades team to perform effective maintenance and preventative maintenance on assembly lines.
good,"This position requires a lot of effort out of the employees. Each day, we are responsible for making everything run smoothly while keeping upper management up-to-date with the latest status. As an engineer, I do not have any hands on work, but we are responsible for solving logistic and quality issues that require the engineering mindset to work through. "
good,"cada dia lo importante no solo es rendir obteniendo los resultados de producción sino que el hacerlo implica con 100R% de seguridad, o sea, sin accidentes y con 100% de calidad."
good,"Slow on getting me setup with email and other materials I needed to carry out the job, training wasn't the best although I did learn whilst I was there. Very hectic with the manager and his duties and relaying them to myself."
good,"As a Ford employee for 28 years, I feel fortunate to have worked there.  The pay is good, the benefits are as well, and I have made lifelong friends while working at Flat Rock Assembly.  That being said, the hours are inconsistent, at times working less then 40 hours per week, followed by periods where we worked 60+ hours per week.  Floor management was inconsistent as well, many being entry level management personnel with little experience.  All in all, I enjoyed my career at Ford and am thankful for the opportunity to work there."
good,I learned how to be more productive in a short amount of time due to me working on the assembly line. I've also learned how to work as a team in order to allow the line to run more efficiently without stopping.
good,"Buen ambiente, compañeros de trabajos amables. Me permitieron conocer la red de concesionarios (otras ciudades) y promocionar mi trabajo con la posibilidad de crecer en la Compañía."
good,"Decent Job, work/life balance is usually good. The management is good as well, very open and easy to talk to. A steep learning curve but everyone there is helpful."
good,You come to work and do just that and more. Union Seems to be interested in Ford and not the people. Overall treated like a number and told to quit if you have a problem. Torn apart plants by the 2 wage system.
good,"Decent company to work for but too much workload.  Alot of travel, no work/life balance.  However, most employees are good people."
good,"A relação entre os cargos de gestão e o pessoal de chão de fábrica são das piores, falta de respeito a pessoa."
good,just ok not something someone can do long term unless they were really cut out for it. I don't know what else to really say about them.
good,It could be a matter of my management but there is no job training/education.  It is talked about how much Ford supports it and in my experience no classes or conferences are approved.
good,"enjoyed my job a lot,,liked working with every one that was in my building the old ford cop car frame building. remove the old building machinery and installing. new machinery for the 2015 f-150"
good,quality is job one but unfortunately management doesn't agree at times. Its a very discriminative to women and uncaring about injuries at occur on various jobs in the plant. Overall it does provide a sense of security for your families with the high income brackets.
good,High volume  assembly of heavy truck units in very adversarial union environment.
good,"Fun place to work, co workers were fun to be around and work with. Very professional"
good,Great place to work with great pay but no room for advancement once into a position and you do it well.
good,"my operators in my zone (trim department) , u can't ask for a better group then them"
good,This job is a laborer job with lots of hours. Very enjoyable with the people you work with. Exciting at times and hard at times as well. What makes this hard at times are the hours.
good,This would have been a perfect place to work if you don't mind being bullied. They want you to be happy and grateful for working there and anyone who has just started better go with the flow. The coworkers a very rude especially to new employees and once you defend yourself  that's the end of that your fired.lol
good,"A typical day would be one that was very routined, system knowledge and management.  Management was supportive of subbordinates decision making,"
good,"werksfeer is goed   "
good,You know there is a problem if you cant even ask the Lead technician a question .Don't get me started on flagging hours at a group in the fast lube department its a joke .
good,"This is a blood company with good values. But, sometimes things can get hard with the type of people around as they tend to suppress anyone who is doing a good job and ate vung to succeed in career"
good,"fair and good hours , they work you steadily and hardly do overtime which is up to you whether or not it is good or bad. company and employees are professionals."
good,"I don't regret bidding on the ford job. It was good for me and my family. I met some life long friends. Good insurance,good pay. Be nice if there was a pension,though."
good,I felt like a child working there. experienced major micromanagement. very boring. the workload was not enough. people working there are worse than zombies.
good,"Acredito que o salário é bom, porém o dia a dia é bem estressante."
good,"As a maintenance personnel at ford, it is fun to work because not everyday is the same.One is faced with different challenges work wise.Not every breakdown is the same,that helps one to learn new things almost daily,which keeps me on my toes and alert at all times."
good,The job was ok. I feel like the team leader wasn't a good team player. He put me on all the hardest jobs with no help. Im a very hard worker and a team player but when i feel like im not being treated equally I don't want to be apart of such.
good,Superb working with FORD.   Looking forward to work again.  Working in FORD is flexible and interesting....Anxiously looking for next opportunity to working in forD again.
good,Generally speaking the employees and the environment are that of any other office in a fortune 500 company. The niche benefits can be nice (launch engineers test unreleased vehicles) however becoming a direct hire of Ford from a contract position is quite uncommon.
good,"I had a long career at Ford, and I learned a lot and was exposed to many exciting product initiatives.  Throughout the time I was there though, the culture never really changed.  Very focused on the individual and how to get ahead/advance.   The product came second.  The product would suffer due to this."
good,"This is just my experience, it could be better in other areas of Ford. Everything is a numbers game to management, it doesn't matter if you are making the right decisions for the business or not, as long as you hit your numbers! D&R position is a very hallowing position, you play babysitter for 8 hours a day. The company does very poorly at acknowledging success or hard work. Great pay and benefits but the company does not care about their employees, or their safety...they will tell you they are all about their employee safety but when something dangerous actually happens they ignore it. The most enjoyable part of my job is leaving early when I can."
good,"carece de buena comunicacion entre areas, no invierten nada en la capacitacion de los empleados nuevos sin experiencia en venta de autos."
good,Be on time and work hard don't miss work and try to get along with your coworker and do your best on the assembly line keep your area clean keep up with the assembly line
good,"Iam worked accounts collection"
good,There is No job security at all. Been a temp for over 4years and now by the looks of it I'm not getting a renewal or permanent role.. Many of us are in this situation and have no leg to stand on.
good,"Stark internationell organisation med starkt centralt styre i Europa. Jag lär mig dagligen nya saker men med central styrning kommer svårigheter att utveckla och förändra för att anpassa företaget till rådande marknad och vi som bolag upplevs ofta som ""mossigt"""
good,My typical day was the same. My work pace was continuous unless there were issues throughout the plant. The atmosphere to my was do my job to my best ability. End of the day make it home safely.
good,"Not much work to do at this job, work is easy, nothing outside of job description asked of me. Work with a good team, all hard working and don't fight you to do the work. Our business customer can never make up their mind about what they want and don't understand technology well enough to make an informed decision / aren't interested in our advice about why their decision won't work."

good,"very busy store, expect the client to wait because there are not enough help, is a hit or must with the techs, ford in general is not a good product, so you gonna get all the complaints."
good,"worked there 11 months then just got let go, no real reason. there is quite a bit of favoritism there too. with the position I had, there is no where to go, as in promotions."
good,"Good experience and good staff. Really enjoyed working there for the most part. Most people don't understand how much the job entails unless they've worked in a similar place."
good,I think it is has three star review rating. Fun workplace and has foos ball table to play. relaxed work environment. It is great place to work. It is located in MI
good,Empresa seria con alto grado de responsabilidad en lo que a seguridad en un auto se refiere.
good,"Really great resume builder as an intern. there are so many buildings and opportunities. The company has many employees on the older side, not too many young people."
good,"Overall a fun place to work great people too work with, many of the supervisors  lack the experience to supervise their staff. "
good,"Compensation/benefits were one of the best for the area.  Job was challenging and the direct manager was great to work for.  The hours could be quite stressful and demanding.  In the end, senior management made resource cutbacks without any feedback from our direct management and many areas were eliminated."
good,You are paid based on the amount of work you do. This doesn't work well when there isn't any work to do. They expect you to work slow so they don't run out of work for the employees.
good,"Union dues are fairly steep, numbers are most important and at times it seems like deadlines are number one priority, which is not unlike most employers."
good,"At Ford, management decisions are pretty slow and they don't embrace latest technology. Many people are very old school in their ways and resistant to change."
good,"This company has outstanding benefits and competitive pay, great worklife balance and cool experiences.  However it seems as if it is easier to leave the company for the next step of your career rather than transfer within the company."
good,"I was backf illing for a person who was on medical leave and could not add to much insight into the VDP organization with Ford Motor Company.  Overall, Ford Motor brings value all around, but unless you have Ivy League schooling, Ford motor Company will not take to much interest within your career growth"
good,Competitive pay but lots of travel and bad worklife.  Tough work life because of all the required travel and long hours required to deliver new models.
good,"Direction uncertain, vision without direction, cannot be all things to all people - first mile last mile, needs a mobility partner as they do not have the human nor financial capital to go it alone."
good,Very good place to work if you enjoy working on the line. Hard work but the pay is nice! Great job to have if your a student or someone looking to put years into the industry for their lifetime job!
good,need improvements on management maybe some training to teach professionalism  and the company could do better with showing employees that they are appreciated
good,The most enjoyable aspect of the automotive industry are the new product roll-outs.  Everyone has an opinion about every new vehicle that comes out.  It's a lot of fun comparing opinions and following industry trends.
good,Come everyday don’t slack off  don’t be late. Likes to promote within company. Some rules aren’t fair but you do have a union to back you up. Paid holidays and vacation. Nice pay. Hard work
good,"Good benefits, Work life balance. Managers take care of you. professional work environment and Company respects diversity of culture and opinions. Overall a great company to work for."
good,I worked in their F150 plant as a contractor. I can't really give an review on this company as the work in the plant is different that what a regular employee would do.
good,"Despite the talk at the top, the company culture is still rooted in old-school manufacturing. The facilities are old and the working environment in the plants are ill-maintained."
good,lots of work
good,Still in need to improve on their Software development process. Has the old Automative process which favors more of the Waterfall development process.
good,Decent place to work.  There are a lot of management layers to get anything done.  Always worried about cutback as they are constantly in the news as a struggling company.
good,"Upper management tends to move people around a lot, without much regard to apparent skills or desires.  Some supervisors/managers want to look over your shoulder for all of your work, some will defer to  your judgement.  Lots of opportunities if you're looking for electrical engineering at the moment."
good,Wanted to work for this company but due to location was not able to continue for a long no wellingness to work in chennai now. if possible bangalore would be good.
good,please help me deal with the issues i am dealing with but I am just typing this for the sake of hitting the 150 macharacter mark this is way too complicated for
good,"Great company for engineering now-how. "
good,I cannot write an accurate review since I did not work directly for the company. Your situation is always different and less than ideal if you working there through an agency.
good,"Ford opted to hire senior level management at FCSD from outside of Ford Motor Company.  Many of these new additions were extremely  biased/negative towards experienced, highly rated FCSD existing employees and drove them out 1, by  1."
good,"If your not a college graduate, this place will pay similar to an entry level  grad. Once hired in, it's a little better, but it may take you 5 years to get hired in."
good,Ford has a very old school hierarchical structure very similar to the military. This can be a good thing but it also tends to stifle the innovative ideas.
good,Very great company to work for but hard to move up within the company. No room to grow. Life work balance is great at ford. Very flexible working hours
good,i only worked at nestle for a construction project in Kentucky. i am not familiar with the company other than the interactions i had with them in a contracting environment
good,"Ford is an okay company to work for. Like many companies, it has its pros and cons. The hardest part of the job is the extensive traveling schedule. The most enjoyable part would certainly be the team members in which you work with on a daily basis."
good,"While I worked there, I really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately, due to business decisions the assembly plant closed down and hundreds lost their jobs and so I had to move on."
good,"Good place to work, friendly environment.  Although staff should be valued and compensated better.  At least to the Industry standard.  Ford hires under contract through another third party company. Both Ford and the other party promotes that if valued, the role can turn into a full time position within Ford and under Ford.  But this was found to be a false statement after talking to seasoned employees in my department.  It seems Ford will tell you what you want to hear, but cant deliver."
good,"Expect a new challenge each day."
good,"Being at Ford is a mixed feeling. The environment was good, people seemed to be friendly, but growth opportunities were limited and the compensation package was not the best."
good,Learned about being completely process driven in everything that gets done.  Most of the employees had a lot of pride in the product that they were making.
good,Didn’t like the way the manager was running the service department a lot of tension was built between the manager and employees and most people didn’t get along
good,"Consistently moving and making sure I, my surroundings and others are safe to maneuver in the work place is a typical day at Ford. I've learned that working in manufacturing with a lot of commotion requires important safety rules an regulations. As far as management,  its more so up in the air, most of time there's a lot of confusion on where to put TPT's (temporary part-time)  in particular. Workplace culture is very welcoming. There wasn't anything hard about working for Ford. Most enjoyable part of the job was lunch time."
good,"This particular location offered great training however, the pay was not the greatest. I was getting paid a low hourly wage along with a small commission. The pay was still less than average for this area."
good,Its very nice place for Job stability. Good environment. Lot off opportunities. Working on latest technologies. Encouraging work place. Keeps going.Thanks
good,factory was very hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter.  Managers were micro managing you.   Job was tedious and not rewarding -  co workers are not supportive
good,"The department GDIA has lack of knowledge and no direction at all. In the beginning the department has good ideas, but as soon the direction changed everything was dismantled."
good,"* Working on production line changes and work station ergonomics."
good,Learning to built the number 1 truck in the world is fun great company could use a better management system sometimes but other than that alright company great benefits that are free
good,I don't mind a good days work naturally a good wage doesn't hurt either Good and bad days anywhere you work but overall it wasn't that bad  to work there I've done and worked worse jobs
good,"Ford is a very large company.   Too often, non-value added meetings and focus on time at work vs real value of results. "
good,"I like my work. Work can get too busy on some days, and it can be way too light on other days. Work allotment between teams, team members needs more attention."
good,Lots of opportunity.  Slow moving development cycles.  Happiness will be directly affected by your supervisor.  Set processes that are followed and slowly updated as needed.
good,"Enjoyed my time in this company, I really learnt a great deal."
good,"the thing about ford was the money made life easier to obtain house,car,taking care of family,retirement,great benefits,other isssues include dealing with the heat(plant has no a/c)"
good,"Definitely a stressful job"
good,"I assisted customers and technicians with ordering, picking up and delivering automotive parts. I also kept accurate inventory records of automotive parts."
good,"Ford es una empresa escuela en todo lo referido a manufactura, por lo que es un gran lugar para aprender."
good,"Com algumas questões contrárias, como em todo lugar, mas no geral, um bom lugar para se trabalhar."
good,"i worked as a tpt so i would be moved around alot. if the line goes down, you have to stay for overtime till you reach the goal of cars made so they are long days."
good,"Work with tools, rotate jobs, worked in Trim, chassis, PDI, paint, body. Train on new jobs, WIres, winshield wiper fluid cords. Key fob in back of vehicle, dashboards."
good,I worked at Ford several years ago.  The company was too large and did not have effective communication between the various departments.  I think they may have made some improvements in this area in the previous few years.
good,"Pay and benefits are astounding, but the jobs are miserable.  If you can handle doing the same task over and over in the upwards of 650 times a day then you will be fine."
good,apprendre à travailler avec ordre et discipline . préparation de véhicules destinés à la compétition
good,I spent 3 years working at Ford as a contractor just time to move on.its very fast past. You don't get a good job or thanks for working hard. I wad told my paycheck is the thanks.
good,The every 4 month rotation of supervisors does not fit very well for people who have a personal life. I do not see the benefit in this constant rotation from nights to days.
good,"Rules were distinctive at Ford for contract or agency employees.  you were designated and treated differently than direct employees, to a fault.  I was happy to move away from those conditions."
good,In order to be hired in a a full time employee management has to really like you.  It is not necessarily based on your work ethic.  I would recommend if you are not looking to get hired into the company.
good,"Standard day of work with meeting, input-output, maybe to many meetings, dealing with other departments sometime slow response ;"
good,"This job is for somebody who loves working under the sun, long hours, and has parience with wiring because that’s all it was. Not much to the job, but it was a great experience for me. It taught me to value money."

good,"Nothing good to say no comment.Management,everything is about numbers.Profit,loss,product.Bonuses are over rated.Some good people workes an management"
good,"é uma empresa que tinha tudo para ser a melhor no geral ,mas a administração e os encarregados ,precisa aprender o que é trabalhar em grupo,falta transparencia para quem é contratado,de 4 anos ate agora, e o regime de escravidão e militar é orrivel."
good,I would recommend this place only because the benefits are good. You will do the same thing every day day in and day out. You can do the job in your sleep. Vehicle comes by every 55 seconds. Benefits are very good.
good,I love working on cars and working for a ford dealership that let me do what i loved and paid me to go to school definatley couldn't complain about that. I really enjoyed working with ford motor company and learned a lot there both hands on and in the classroom.
good,"Fast paced, teaches you how to juggle multiple deadlines and work with different cross functional teams whilst gaining skills for your next role. Work very hard, but also remember to practice work life balance."
good,"My work day is pretty busy running machines, sorting/assembling ford car parts working with someone or by myself which can be somewhat boring. The culture can be somewhat cut throat at times."
good,I enjoyed working here since finishing my apprenticeship I am now a Ford senior vehicle technician and training apprentices as they come through and develop in the workshop
good,"Good/friendly work environment with fellow engineers."
good,Overall good place to work. Nice coworkers. Good pay. Shift work. Long hours but adequate breaks.  Safety training could be better to be honest. Parking is annoying.
good,"Overall good experience, wish they would've gave me work earlier. Most of time was spent calling people from different buildings and asking them if they had any extra work they were willing to give me."
good,Ford was a alright place to be at if you know how to clean and don't mind driving a far distance. Other than that it was cool all ypu was doing was cleaning.

good,"Ford is a great company to work for,safety is a huge factor and employees work together as a team..one big happy family.The company has a lot of privileges for employees for example artisans and management may lease cars,medical aid provident fund etc."
good,"Back in the day Ford was a very good place to work.  I learned many things.  The company was on top of its game in the early 2000's. loved working they market changes moved to other industry just before downfall."
good,There's too much time sat doing nothing in departments which leaves time for things that should not be done at work. I would not recommend it for my child.
good,"."
good,They shouldn't hire many applicants and then fired them later on. They have disgusted manager. Managers act unprofessionally even the branch manager..
good,"The best way to get through a day on the assembly line is to learn your job, master it, and have very minimal down time. There is always a team lead on the shift that is always there to help, and even your surrounding co-workers are there to help."
good,Decent workplace but you have to get over the nepotism and the managers giving away car deals to their favorite salesperson. Overall good pay and a good environment.

good,Ford was a good place and they paid their employees well. The best part about working for Ford was the Union. Ford is a Union job and it is great to have someone fighting for the employees.
good,"Very outcome based driven company, with high emphasis on quality and safety. It is a high pressure environment reserved for individuals who are eager to please management. Positives include: reasonable job security and well defined job responsibilities – I always knew what was expected of me. In my experience, the bad side is that individuals where not encouraged to think “outside the box” and some of the tasks can become repetitive and boring, but that is to expected when working on a production line."
good,Rien à rapprocher. Bon équilibre. J'ai travaillé en tant que partenaire de Ford à ISASTUR également.

good,Ford Motor company is a fun place to work at but the problem is we work long hours sometimes . By long hours I mean 10 hours a day and.

good,Very little reason to be promoted beyond mid manager level unless you have a surrogate manager in your corner.  The hours and responsibility become overbearing.
good,"On a typical day the upper management distrusted the lower management which caused downtime and at times poor quality in parts.  Many persons in a management position, feared for their jobs on a daily basis."
good,"If you enjoy repetitive work, then this job is for you.  Another case of forced cross-training.  I enjoyed some of the people.  Hearing about contract workers talk about not being hired after a decade was quite discouraging.  There's no incentive to stay."
good,"Dynamic, highly motivated and committed, customer service and administrative"
good,"its good money and great benefits but it's not for me. The hours are hard, the work is long and repetitive, and the people aren't great. There's a  Constant feud between salary employees and hourly."

good,"Better have back up funds if times get down..."
good,"A typical day at work would be undergoing cleaning tasks while handling customer orders and requests fast, efficiently, and effectively while making sure that customers are treated with the utmost respect. This job was truly wonderful, I wish I could have stayed but I found out exciting news about being pregnant with my son therefore I was quite alright with starting a new chapter in my life.

good,I tended to the needs of 15 people and their operations making sure they had everything to do the job right and safely.I would make repairs when needed and did a lot of problem solving. I was very well liked by my co workers and was rewarded and got to go to the Texas state fair and I worked the auto show selling cars.The hardest part of the job was to try and keep everyone happy. The most enjoyable part was when we hit our number without any quality issues

good,"A typical day at ford was a 10 hour shift, which consisted of using tools and dexterity to assemble cars as they travelled down the line. The hardest part of the job was staying focused, due to the monotonous nature of the work. The most enjoyable part was how efficiently and easy the job was once you had done it long enough."
good,Who you know will determine your chances for advancement. Outlying locations are quickly forgotten unless constant management of your career.
good,See resume... Very ethical company. for a big global company that is impressive to me. Who wants to read about my impression of Ford? There are many more avenues to get a better review of the kind of company Ford is than from me.
good,"The American Way..."
good,"I really do enjoy my job. The people I work for a great people. I think we are maybe a few to many sales executives at the dealership and this does not make for a steady work environment.

good,"Coordinator of major logistical projects, challenges all the way, deadlines needed to met all the way, Established good working relationship with co-workers, Most enjoyable parts of the job is seeing the new systems launched/implemented in operation and successful"
good,The hardest part of the job is the physical damage that is done to the body overtime since most of the jobs are repetitive motions at a fast paced environment. Most enjoyable part of the job is making new friends at work and everyone acts like they are your family. Most jobs you are working on a line or on a machine and every job has a cycle time in which the job needs to be completed in. My station i work at has to be completed in 15 seconds The most important part of my job or any job at my facility is making sure all our parts are packed properly and within quality and safety guidelines.
good,"The job is okay depending on your personality and current family situation, and your desired path for promotion within the company. There are perks that most enjoy. Company employees and associates that employees have to work with are ego-driven which can be frustrating."
good,I worked on the assembly for Ford Motor Company which had its cons and pros. I was able to earn a good salary but the physical aspect did have it toll on my body. I had to learn to eat the right food when I was at work so that I wont sluggish on the line. Also I had to work with my fellow employees. I did long hours and alot of overtime. I taught that this job would be secure but it didnt due to the economy.

good,"Ford is wonderful to work for, and is truly doing an excellent job as a leader in the automotive industry."
good,Days had its good and bad. There were days where I loved my job and other days I loathed it. The supervisors don't really handle issues between employee's and even incite them to a degree that it feels uncomfortable to work. The pay is good but As the topic states it isn't for everybody. Coupled with my allergies it was not a good fit for me.
good,I work with a crew that works days from 6am till 5pm Friday and Saturday then 6pm till 5am Sunday and Monday in a factory with no windows. we all work together to make the day go fun and easy and not seem so long along with the management to love the day and night. I love it when we all get going and laugh and can still manage to get the job done with no problems. The hardest part of the job is when we have no cars to build and the day just drags on.
good,Too many issues working with Developers .. no Goals or target set and keep switching projects many times.
good,"Hard work, working from the time you walk in, repetitious work a lot of micro management hardest part of the job is dealing with how the upper management doesn't know how to talk or make it comfortable to do your job"
good,"So, Ford invited me to work with Digital and others issues based in advertising campaign.

good,"while I was apart of ford motor vehicles, they overworked me because they were short-handed. I didn't complaint because I am a dedicated and hard-working individual."
good,"Good company, but very slow. Not interested in getting ahead just maintaining the status quo. You could work here 30 years and literally never accomplish anything."
good,pay and benefits were great but you work hard for the money.  Hours are very different and work is very tedious
good,•	Created a regional GAP analysis on Ford and competitive dealerships for their best practices on driving retail. Best practices were analyzed both for their e-business interactions as well as in the actual dealerships.
good,"Ford was a good paying job with employer paid benefits. I was able to get into the trades (18 years mechanic) before plant closed because of the economy. Some people think UAW autoworkers are overpaid, and I was one of them until I worked the line. Working 8 to 10 hours of doing the same thing for 500+ times can really be mind numbing. This type of work isn't for everyone and takes a certain mindset to do it. I became a utility so I could move around and break up the monotony some and had fun doing it. Plant closed within 1 year of announcement of closure. Didn't like the way Norfolk assembly told local news outlet before telling employees about the closing. I found out on the local newscast after working night shift. In my opinion that's low and that's Ford. Ford may have not taking any bailout money this time but they have taken money from the government in the past so don't be fooled. Ford gambled and it worked out for them. I didn't want to take a chance and go to Detroit with my family the way the economy was going and get stuck there so I took the buyout. My philosophy was we survived before Ford and we will survive after Ford. I feel sorry for all the people that get jobs with Ford now at 2nd tier wages. Doing the same job as a 1st tier worker but getting about half the pay and poor benefits is really bad. People do yourself a favor and get an in demand trade or education. Don't let Ford fool you it's basically quantity not quality in the long run. I've seen it first hand. Business is about numbers and hey if we can get some quality also even better."
good,This was a good place to start working. I gain a lot of knowledge from my years at this company.
good,"Detailed vehicles, Great company to work for just wish I could have stayed longer."

good,Ford Motor Company Finance is a group of highly talented individuals. Decision making is always maintained at the top of the company.
good,Its a hard job to do for 20 plus years and I like to see the young have it
good,Tive bastantes oportunidades de crescimento pessoal e profissional dentro da Ford onde pude por em prática os conhecimentos desenvolvidos durante a graduação no período do estágio e após a minha efetivação tive a oportunidade de transitar por diversos processos na área de Recursos Humanos. Sempre estive numa posição muito confortável no relacionamento com meus pares e superiores oq ue torna o clima organizacional muito prazeroso. Hoje busco novos desafios em outra área de atuação ou até mesmo algo diferente dentro da área de RH.
good,"I had a variety of jobs there, so it was stressful. I pulled orders, delivered orders, did shipping and recieving, and warranty clerk. Everyday consisted of making sure you pulled orders and were ready for shipping everyday. Once a week you recieve a truck to replenish or stock up the warehouse. You stock anything and everything that you can think of on a vehicle so you can stock or pull hoods, doors, quarter panels etc. and that stuff arrives on the truck and you have to remove it, check it off the list that you recieved and and stock it in its correct locations in a numerical order so that you can find it when you need to pull it for a customer. The most enjoyable part to the day was going home."
good,"Commission jobs are a different animal. Get as much done as you can without hurrying so much that you have to do it again for free. I enjoyed the challenges, but I was not enough of a gear head to make it a living for life."
good,Good commission on closed loans. The company was new and relied on other financing companies for most the funding.
good,Schedule achieved hourly production line run consistently without problems.
good,I would take inbound calls from customers to help him or her to resolve issues with his or her account. I would also do outbound calls on past due account to collect on. I learned how to listen to what the person on the phone was saying. I learn how to be patient and to understand the person on the other side of the phone. I enjoyed working with my co-workers in a team enviroment. The hardest part of my job was to know that someone was in a bad place in which I had no way to bring him or her out. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help others.
good,Peformed on an assembly line and worked with others along the line to ensure bits and pieces were installed correctly. Management was easy to work for. The hardest part of the job was the repetitive motion. The most enjoyable part of the job was weekends off.
good,"A great place to work. You will work long hours, but it is worth the paycheck."
good,The location closed due to financial collapse. Not a bad place to work.
good,"responsible for leading the production team to goal achievement in all phases of auto production. Including operations, enviromental safety, vehicle processing and line efficiency."
good,"Company for networks is no more now unfortunately, got bought by nsn."
good,"-A typical workday for an heathy employee is pretty good, ""you get what you put in""."
good,interacting with car dealers throughout the u.s transferring ownership of vehicles. i learned the process of buying and selling automobiles.management was not to good. they were not receptive to employee needs. the hardest part of the job was knowing there wasnt any advancement available. the best part was my co workers
good,Empresa em mudança de cultura/local agradável para se trabalhar.
good,"Once you get accustomed to the pace it’s not that bad.You will stand for 10 to 12 hours a day.The union should move you up to top pay sooner,no longer than 3 years.Benefits are very good and top out pay is great."
good,"Empresa muito boa para trabalhar mais os líderes não davam oportunidade de crescimento  mesmo tendo os requisitos necessários para algumas vagas, falta de informações ."
good,"The work is hard, also the hours can be normal or off putting, but the pay is ok , and for the most part the co workers are ok, management is hit or miss."
good,"There is still a lot of old-school thinking in many areas.  Not as progressive as they should be in.  Good pay and benefits, but still a gap in opporunities for women vs. men.  Expect that there is a big gap in pay between men and women as well, but cannot prove.  Does not do a good job of helping employees find new assignments when their position goes away or an organization shuts down."
good,Ford's software development practices are not very strong. They keep trying to restructure and set out new processes but ultimately all processes are bogged down by bureaucracy. I would say that it's not a place that rewards good work but rather good politics.
good,You can work at your own pace but it pays to think and work fast. Quality of your performance should be your top priority. This job is equally physical and mental so be ready
good,"Days never the same "
good,"Worked with great teams/employees for 19 years, great benefits and bonus. Would recommend FMC to an intern........................................................"

good,"Employed with Ford Motor Company in Research and Engineering. Three shift work day, vacations, holidays and Family Leave time off. Benefits include medical, dental"
good,Great place to work if you have the right group of people working with you. Better to build personal personal relationships with your co-workers. The overall culture is CYA.
good,"Good Company nothing to complain much about. But Ford always kind of slow compared to GM and Chrysler."
good,A big company with limited number of professional bodies such as Engineers and  Technicians with merits. Most of the top post are occupied by people from FET Colleges and its training center.
good,"Busy and sometimes varied workload."
good,Was a busy and high paced company with training for the job you were performing. The hours were long for it was one weekend on and one weekend off. I worked night shift from 5;00 p.m. to 5;00 a.m.
good,"-Very relaxed work environment "
good,Very very fast-paced job you have to be very independent Very hard-working a varmint you have to be a team player outspoken or you have to be very dedicated to your job
good,Good place to work. People can learn corporate behavior. All accounting activities are automated. Good for people not preferring night shifts. Its a secure place.
good,"Good: overtime is rarely expected, pace is medium and when things go wrong it is okay."
good,Ford would be a much better place to work if management was trained better on how to treat workers they make the job more stressful then it has to be the money is good but I don't think it shout take as long to cap out in pay
good,"good "
good,"After 21 years, my workplace still shocks you with a lot of mishandling through operations and personal affairs day in and day out."
good,"Ford is a great company with awesome benefits, however it is very old school where they expect for you to be on-site every day. My position interacts with external stakeholders however I am expected to be in the office 95% of the time despite not having to interact with anyone. Hopefully things will change as more millenials move up in the company."
good,"I did not work enough hours in a week to cover my living expenses so unfortunately, I had to leave.  Job was not very difficult or tiring.  Lots of walking, as the place is huge.  Laid back working environment.  I met people who had been on part time almost 2 years so if you can afford the wait it's not a bad place to work."
good,"Good company to work for with good pay and overall benefits with opportunities for advancement if you make good decisions and work hard.  Working at a plant, long hours and weekends are mandatory throughout the year."
good,"Managing quality in all aspects of prodcution.  Managing supervisors and their teams to perform safely, effectively, and consistantly.  Making sure safey remains the number one objective then productivity.  "
good,"Un buen ambiente de trabajo , mucho apoyo y enseñanza en el trabajo"
good,Difficult to complete all tasks required of the job due to conflicting objectives from management. Buildings are dated and not maintained very well -- e.g. Escalators break down consistently.
good,"At ford you will make a comfortable wage, but prepare to be uncomfortable while you work. Management will try to have your neck over the smallest issues."
good,"the culture was different to me.  the hardest was wondering where you were going to be placed in the plant.  I learned how assembly doors, interior, exterior, brakes, shocks."
good,"When somebody has worked for a company for almost 3 years and still doesn't have full benefits, vacation, full representation from the union.  It is very degrading,  my family and my life have been on pause for 3 years now."
good,"Good place to work in your late 50's or 60's. Pace of work is slow, not whole lot opportunity to progress your career. Benefits are poor compare to GM & other top Tier1 suppliers."
good,"Typical at work would be downloading orders, printing out packing slips for the day, checking in the freight, then posting it in the system. Next putting away the by stock, special orders and new product. By then Fedex would have arrived as well as possibly other distributors. (LKQ, SAIA, AER, etc) Then depending on urgency make deliveries, and/or pickups to local customers (automotive shops with in the city) and from there balance and prioritize between making deliveries and checking in and distributing freight throughout they day.  Management trusts me to do what needs to be done around the warehouse & making delivery runs. Hardest part of my job is knowing that other similar positions with different dealership are paying more for the responsibilities I'm given. Enjoyable part of my job is working with good people, and the freedom I'm given to take care of business."
good,Over all a decent place to work for but there are definitely better. Management is not the greatest but you can make money if your are fast and motivated.
good,"Good company, however most finance roles are not value added. Most GSR (general salary grade) just update spreadsheets and not as much analysis as we should be conducting."
good,"You come to work,  get in do your work then you leave I was laid off so I really don't have much that I wanna talk about at this time if you don't mind."
good,"Safe place"
good,"I am working in a Green field set up in the last 2 years. Hence, there were lot of challenges involved. This gave opportunity to learn a lot. Plant has picked up a lot in the last 2 years and a great team has been developed which will ensure a secure future for the Company in India."
good,New Executive Manager that took over 4 months ago thought we just started Boot Camp for the Military and we were the rugs for him to walk all over. I have been a successful Finance Manager for more than 20 years and never treated this way.Time off and holidays with my family were very obsolete...
good,"There is a culture of following the industry at Ford. Very rarely do any of their solutions/products lead the market and the company doesn't seem to care. The upper management tries to change this culture but the older employees and middle management seem to fight it. Also, the organizations within the company seem more concerned with looking good on their own metrics than actually making a car. "
good,"Good Benefits"
good,"A empresa possui um clima organizacional muito bom, o que torna o dia-a-dia agradável de trabalhar. Possui boa oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"Very competitive and fast paced position. Was initially welcoming, however, work became stressful as I had trouble keeping up with the pace, until eventually I was let go for not being where the management expected me to be in such a short amount of time. Took a shot at the role, but I didn't make the cut this time around."
good,Typical day at work was long and repetitive. I learned that when on an assembly line there is little to no room to make errors. The hardest part of the job is the heat. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the check is coming everyweek.
good,"When working for ford, I first had to shadow a driver which gave me confidience.  I would pick parts for our customers from the large warehouse, check all against paperwork, then load my van of which I had to maintain myself,i would then go to the furthest customer first and work my way back to base. Normally out all day. I would sometimes collect money from the customer, report any problems to my manager"
good,"Strenuous work, long hours, rude management, excellent benefits.  The environment can be fun.  If you do your job most of the time the management will leave you alone. Thank goodness for the Union"
good,"Work hard in the place ..less speak and more work ...good management and well food provided and good for our body "
good,"While I enjoyed my time here, management was poor. The benefits and 401k contributions made it worth staying. Training was extensive."
good,"Answer phones and connect to person or department, do daily schedules, do deposits and six tickets, cover for cashier, make coffee and provide supplies for coffee, file and do miscellaneous projects for admin office."

good,alles repareren aan de auto's die van de band aflopen.het was geen bandwerk.
good,"Good company with good people policy."
good,"A Empresa é muito agradável de se trabalhar, incentivo um ambiente saudável, considerando os 15 anos que estou na empresa, todo o meu desenvolvimento foi baseado na cultura Ford. Aprendi muitas funções, entre Tesouraria, Transfer Price, Vehicle Pricing, e Parts Pricing. A area que atuei por mais tempo e que mais me identifico é a Tesouraria, onde atuei em todas as posições possíveis, desempenhando as minhas funções por quase nove anos naquele departamento."
good,typical day includes assembling parts on cars most of the time doing the same repetitive job. I learned that if you do just one job you will be very good at that one job. management was ok unless you stop the line a lot. co workers were down to earth people. hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness.
good,"Too often requires work on your scheduled days off, and you basically have to not show up against threats of write-ups to use any of the non-scheduled paid days off in your benefits package. This is a cut throat environment in which management plays unethical games to write up anyone to take the heat off themselves, and tries to pressure you into doing the same with your employees. The rotating schedule is brutal at times, and it sucks to be required to work so many hours and not be compensated (i.e. 1.5 or 2X, to compensate). "
good,Excessive number of layers of management at the time that I worked there.
good,"Working at the Product Development Center in Dearborn, MI is exciting. In the Design Milling Department we create interior and exterior parts for all of the models in every studio at the PDC. From wheels, to seats, to grills and even full-scale body exteriors we help bring concept to reality. Our CNC milled parts are complimented by the work of the other fabrication shops (wood, plastics, metal and trim) and our modelers to build models and full-size sample interiors that are used to develop the next generations of Ford vehicles."
good,Uma empresa focada em qualidade e produção. Produção bem corrida. Pressão a todo tempo. Prioriza horarios. Ambiente limpo e livre de ruidos. Gerentes e engenheiros bem instruidos.
good,The economics downturn made Ford a top-heavy monster that now provides too little opportunity for advancement.  The plus side is that your job security is pretty high and work-life balance is pretty good.
good,"-on a typical shift approximately 600 vehicles will be produced."
good,"Large company, experience will vary depending on your role."
good,"Technician"
good,Did package design studies for advanced model programs. Present design reviews to upper management.

good,"he otima conheci muitas pessoas influentes, aprendi muito ensinei um pouco...absouvi o massimo de esperiencias...tou satisfeito..aprendi muito que espero usar em outros trabalhos e oportuninades..."
good,"They expect way to much out of their employees. They overwork you. "
good,"Ford was one of the hardest jobs I have ever work for. Ford workers deserve ever penny they get . The heat ,the sound , the non stop running of lines. In this fast pace job you could find yourself here one day and there the next , learning different jobs all the time."
good,Quality Auditing at Final Line In Assemply shop
good,"Empresa que exige dedicação do funcionário, saber lidar com pressão e stress. Bons colegas de trabalho, o que facilita o relacionamento no dia dia. No dia dia fazemos negociações com fornecedores, Engenharia e Finanças para fechar os preços com o melhor benefício para a Cia."
good,"I would start my day cold calling customers, and setting up appointments for potential customer. I learned how to sale customers on our products, and how to become a well rounded business person. Management was valuable in me maturing as a business person. My co-workers helped me become a student of business. The hardest part of my job was cold calling customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was making a sell."
good,"It is a running assmebly line. Here is where the Ford Explorer, Explorer Limited, Lincoln MKS, Taurus, Taurus Sho, and the Police Interceptor are made."
good,"Fast pace, strong critical thinking environment were there is a strong presence of togetherness amongst co-workers. Most difficult part of job is the mundane repetition of the same job. Most enjoyable aspect of the job is having three days off a week."
good,Duties and Responsibilities:
good,Just building trucks as they rolled down the line. It is not for everyone. It could be very demanding.
good,"I review new test folders and meet with engineers for pretest meetings. I start fabricating or building fixtures or stands to run tests on. Once test are ready to start I do all pretest photos, efforts and measurements so that post test data can be compared. During tests I log and monitor the test progress as well as doing various inspections. After tests are complete I meet with engineers to review as well as completeing all test folder data and photos."
good,"You can make a lot of money at this place, but you will have no work life balance. You'll be expected to work 70plus hours a week and not balk at any overtime. Must have thick skin to survive the very cut throat atmosphere."
good,Would prefer not to work at a plant. Nothing personal towards the employer. I would like to do more with my skills and expand my knowledge in the work environment.
good,Debes de tener muchos conocimientos pero al final el sueldo no es competitivo
good,"Otimo clima organizacional, dificil de crescer. Salario compativel com o mercado"
good,"It was my first job, and I learned the heard way of on the go training. At the. Beginning, I knew absolutely nothing about cars, now the only thing I couldn’t do at my job was drive stick.(Mostly because I didn’t want to, not that I wasn’t offered)"
good,"Bad management but good pay and benefits made it worth it, lots of drive time out of the shop was relaxed and helped with the busyness of the shop it was a good mix of labor and driving"
good,"You have to be very tough to work for n the conditions of this work place. The money is very good but, the work is very exhausting ... Hope you r mentally built for this"
good,"Vehicle testing using Vector tools"
good,"My typical day at work would be starting off on a job not knowing for sure if I would be working on that particular job for the day; until they figure out who was all at work and what jobs needed to be covered. The work place culture was alright something I had to get use to since I never worked In a plant before; it was exactly how it sounded a plant (plantation) no windows, no air condition. around the summer time it felt like death, it be unbearable. The hardest part of the job was really the first couple of weeks there learning all the jobs but then once I got familiar with the jobs it was light work and became easy. I knew all the jobs like the back of my hand. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers I met so many loving, caring, funny people;people I actually built relationships with and would talk to them outside of work. Management was kind of off but that just something I got use to while working at Ford Motor Company."
good,"Company moving slowly, software engineer is doing paper work, tools are not very nice not cutting edge, hard to find related documents. Many departments to coordiante."
good,"Tirando a estabilidade que não tem sido boa aqui no brasil devido a crises. E sempre tem demissões constantes em massa. É uma ótima empresa e nível de organização, aprendizado e benefícios."

good,"A Ford proporcionou o meu aprendizado e a possibilidade de participar de vários desafios no decorrer da minha carreira. Tem uma política de benefícios muito boa, além de ser possível fazer o rotation entre as empresas do grupo."
good,"Ford to it's credit is trying to take a step in the right direction by modernizing, but is unable to trim the fat. Too many employees have little understanding of technology, and meetings are viewed as work."
good,Good company to work for. Have a lot of their ducks in a row and are doing great financially. I would recommend someone to work for GM. I'd go back if that poses an opportunity
good,"The job pays very well however, we are just a number working to hit their numbers. They have awesome benefits and we get a profit-sharing check! Its an ok job I guess."
good,"Its great to work company to work, since I am working as Contractor through Cognizant it is not good to justify the feedback/review on Ford Motors. Being said work environment is very good"

good,fun place to work met good people made great money company vehicle to drive very good benefits also some good supervisors also being able to work at other Ford locations
good,"Learned a lot from a large spectrum of sources. Friendly environment great for growing, but not extremely youth oriented. Facilities are outdated and could use rejuvenation."
good,"Career opportunities and daily workloads vary greatly by division.The common thread is that you will put in a full day's work of e-mails, meetings of all sizes.  You will often eat at your desk or skip lunch because of a full daily calendar. Most days fly by and you will be fulfilled, proud and exhausted of the job you did that day. The best thing about going to work has always been sharing the day with the best group of people one could ask."
good,"During my career, I can honestly say that I learned something new each and every day I went to work.  The opportunity to apply what you learned and more importantly, teach what you learned to others is one of the best things I loved about working at Ford Motor Company."
good,"It's a great opportunity to make a living. There are very hot days and a lot of ford politics, but outside of all of that its a great place to make some money"
good,"Ford in India more than 20 yrs and more yrs to count in India. Working culture is good. A lot can be learned while working in company. Ford itself having a history of more than 100 yrs in automotive field. So for an individual it can offer a lot."
good,Ford Motor Company provides excellent work life balance and benefits. But the management is  poor and the structure makes progress slow. A typical workday is quite boring

good,Es una empresa muy buena en donde aprendes mucho de todos los departamentos
good,"The work place is quite traditional. Employee benefits are limited and  career growth trajectory is not that fast paced. However, in analytics there is scope of good projects. Perks are having the chance to work  with the onsite team and develop projects proactively."
good,Sempre fui funcionário exemplar e super pro ativo sempre cumpri minhas metas com antecipação não chego atrasado não saio mais cedo nem nunca deixei um problema para outro resolver .varias promessa e nada foi cumprido nos colocou no lay off e prometeu que não ia mandar ninguém embora mas assim que os cursos acabaram fomos todos demitidos sem nenhum aviso .

good,"Ford is a great company to work.  However, it's not a place to consider if you require any sense of work life balance.  The hours are quite demanding, but you are well compensated for it."
good,The Ford Motor Company is a great opportunity for a young person to start a career in the automotive business.
good,"Build parts for transmissions in busy manufacturing environment and assembly line production. This was a Union position and I learned a great deal about the pros/cons of Unions as well as the history of Unions in the U.S. Mandatory overtime and working many hours, though well-compensated, was the hardest part of the job. I enjoyed the structure and having production goals, being a team leader, and working to solve problems with the engineering teams."
good,"Variation settlement with contractor"
good,"Work outsourcing is common, management is looking to outsource work to full service suppliers.  Some groups thin down thru attrition and never replaced.  Hard to move around in job skill.  Job security is very good. Layoff not frequent.  1974 oil crisis,  2006-2009 Housing bust."
good,"There is work to get done everyday"
good,i worked on assembly line putting on rear brakes to axles 10 to 12 hours a day standing
good,"Well paid and solid experience, though can get dull and uninspiring after a while"
good,Challenging workload. Very diverse workforce. I have dealt with thousands of individuals during my worklife.
good,"Ford Motor Company is a great company to work for with regards to compensation/benefits and work/life balance, however, there is less opportunity for advancement based on performance.  "
good,Start by checking my station for debris and other things. Then i would fill all bins that need it. After that i began my shift.
good,My typical day at Ford is rather fast paced and very detailed. I've learned 7 different jobs on my line and it's nice to learn new jobs and have more experience.The co-workers I work with are rather young minded and gossips alot. And that sometimes can make a person uncomfortable on the job.
good,"my day is always hectic and we always work under pressure because we must make sure that the parts are good to be supported to the line. Most enjoyable part is we meet different people from different supplier. I learn drawings, communication skills."
good,"This plant location was poorly managed and has long since been closed. Production quality was very poor, as was management and culture at this plant location."
good,"This job was a very physical job. Long periods of standing , walking and lifting of heavy products and materials. Mostlty mechanical work. Training was not too good , however , the right person with the right attitude would be able to learn quickly."
good,"TPT's or STS's are temporary workers. As a TPT you will work no more than 30 hours a week. With having said that, as a new hire you can be in this status for up to 3 to 5 years. Which means no profit sharing no cost of living raise no Christmas bonus."
good,All are good.food are not too good.management also not good.it is us culture basic.thats why work on us culture.and salary increment is very good but post preference is not good..
good,"Fun steady job but the pace changes rapidly and not good for a person still trying to figure out what they are wanting to do, aside from that it was a great place to work"
good,Just not a good job for me some people enjoy the heavy duty jobs. I dont mind the fast paced but tje labor nearly killed me and the people in the factpry are so angry all the time!!
good,"there was a clique, in order to get easy work often time where seniority should rule, relations mattered more.....union shop, the rules should be followed. often times things couldve been resolved on the floor and shouldn""t have to go to labor. Management should have a specific standard for addressing adults. Rules should apply to them also. No phones on the floor, sexual harasment etc....pay raises are slow......compared to cost of living....4 days on 3 days of work schedule was excellent."
good,Everyday I was put a new job. It was hard work and very stressful. Depending on the team leader they could make the job a great learning experience or very difficult. It was very exciting to build a Mustang and Lincoln. The money was good and the benefits were fantastic.
good,Great experience and great company to work for. The work-life balance was a culture that Ford embraces. The team cohesiveness between most employees and employers worked well within the environment.
good,Employee benefits are less compared to other companies. Recognition for the work you do is less. Management politics is high.Good for career development and senior employees do not move out of the company.
good,"While working in the Ford plant may have felt like working in the death star, complete with flying sparks and robots, it was a satisfying job. The pay is good and the hours are set ."
good,This work place is very busy working environment. The job here is very challenging. Everyday will be having new tasks. There is time frame for all the job which given. Must complete the job on time and follow up accordingly.
good,"TL;DR: I worked as an hourly employ at Ford. It's an over payed fork lift job with no education required. Perfect for people that are uneducated by paper and enjoy labor work/going to work and coming home. "
good,"constant pressure and challenge. Daily tasks and future planning must be constantly reviewed and aligned. "
good,"Good place to make a career, nice people and you can make alot of money over the years with bonus. They have great benefits. And there is alot of room for grown. There is also alot of room for advancement"
good,Great pay and benefits if you can work 10 to 12 hours a day. I had no problems with the supervisors at all. Co-workers very friendly and helpful all the time.
good,Ford Motor Company is a company to work for. I would recommend to anyone who apply. Great hourly and pay and benefits. A great company to retire from.
good,"Solid company that offers great opportunities for employees, especially those looking to get exposure in multiple areas. Traditional organizational structure for a large, old school company."
good,"I worked on the line assembling car parts. This I found to be very repetitive and not enjoyable. Also the drive to Oakville was quite far. the most difficult part was the repetition, and most enjoyable was the pay was good."
good,"Good workplace to start with, lot of learning opportunities, encouragement and support from fellow workers, positive culture, one ford behaviour"
good,A typical day at work starts off slow and ends in an orderly fashion. Even though it was very diverse it was a great learning experience coworkers welcome with open arms. The most challenging part of the job would be dealing with some customers that wasn't quite satisfied with some of the quality of what they were purchasing. What i enjoyed the most would be the different guest and their accents when requiring about purchases.

The management was a little hectic, but there was a lot they had to worry about all the time. The people were great, and everyone knew their job, and did it correctly. The hardest part of the job was the schedule. I worked the swing shift on the weekends. Getting your sleep schedule back on track non-stop. I felt accomplished while I worked there. I knew people were going to be driving Ford cars and trucks for a long time, and we were doing the world a service."

good,"Fun work place with co-employees, good place to learn basics. The most enjoyable part of job in my life. provided us the good food and other stuff."
good,"Expect to have minimal advancement opportunities and little to no bend when it comes to personal requests. Based on your position within the company you will have a fantastic ability to work on your time, but with that freedom comes the 50+ hr weeks. I have enjoyed the perks of a company car in my job role. I really enjoy the collaborative nature of the company, but the lack of power distributed down to entry level employees inhibits your effectiveness."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,The most important part of the job I had at Ford Motor Company was being able to interact with coworkers through teamwork. When you work on an assembly line having good communication skills is necessary.
good,"To be fair, I was told in my interview the job would last less than two years (which it did) but contract engineers there are always treated like second rate.  Other than that it is a good place to learn some things."
good,Ótima empresa para se aprender a trabalhar em ambiente corporativo.

I learned how to enhance my customer service skills and use microsoft word and excel. Management weren't as professional as some of them were suppose to be, but my co-workers and I still did our jobs and remained professional. I felt like the job was pretty easy as long as you followed directions and stayed on top of your work. I enjoyed going to work every day and working on the computers and telephones."
good,Time to move on. Want to do sometihing new. I have worked for the big 3 since 21. It would be nice to work in some air for a change
good,I love working for Ford however starting after a launch of a vehicle is the most stressful time. The supervisors make you feel at fault for the problems of the fast launching. The coworkers aren’t very welcoming either and the plant has several employees whom call off on a regular basis.
good,Oportunidade de aprendizado e acesso ímpar a conhecimentos técnicos
good,"Was good working for FORD. "
good,"Aprendí a trabajar con personal sindicalizado, supervisores, seguridad e higiene, etc."
good,"Ford tries to create a great corporate culture, but is known in the past for abusing and using up employees and discarding them.  They've tried to change that, but unfortunately there are still a lot of bad bosses.  No matter how good a culture the company tries to create, if you have a bad boss, it's a bad job.  There's still a lot of bad bosses at Ford which leads to a huge difference between departments whether it's a positive or negative workplace.  If you're in a bad department, with a bad boss, it can be a very bad company to work for."
good,"The paycheck was nice and i had a decent job there but the shift I was on (midnights) didn't give me much of a life with my fiance.  When she got home from work, I had to leave.  It became too much and the commute was an hour one way.  It was taxing on both my fiance and I."
good,"was a good place to work but had no benefit's  and little or no room for advancement "
good,Workplace culture was good. I learned both inbound and outbound customer service. Hardest part was evening shift which used to end after 11.00 pm.Management was ok.
good,Ford Motor Company can be a great employer if the work is suited to your particular lifestyle. Assembly line work can be extremely physically taxing though financially rewarding.
good,"Lots of money to be made in selling vehicles! The hours were demanding but overall it was a good company to wok for. I learned so much about people skills. I thought I knew it all before, I was a server prior to this position. The most enjoyable part about working for Ford Dealership was building a relationship with our clients and the satisfaction of helping them get into their dream vehicle."
good,"Quand il y'a beaucoup des clientèle et qu'on a tout les pièce nécessaires "
good,"I learned a lot, I came here at ford know nothing about finance but my co-worker took their time teach me work. Now I know how allocate dealers and panel beater payment"
good,Good overall company but it has many process and ideals that are outdated and need to be changed. The management discourages movement to other areas of the company.
good,A day at Ford must be planned and prepped. The jobs at hand a five year old could learn and execute. Its the repetition of the work that could be stressful on your body. It's definitely a forever-learning type of career.
good,Good Pay and Benefits . Its a good place to start from the bottom and work your way up. The attendance policy is strict and they have a lot of opportunities for growth
good,It's a great place to work if you can last and become full time.The work really isn't that hard. Pay could be increased. The hours I work are atrocious because I work split shifts on the weekend.
good,"Great learning experience.  Very political culture. Need to forge past the ""not invented here"" syndrome which often stifled or killed ideas.  When you do find leaders willing to try new ideas, its refreshing."
good,"Long hours, sometimes 7 days a week 12-14 hour days, pay is good, management over you is tough though, no pat on back when doing well but if your teams mess up you will hear it.  Tough baby sitting people on line and dealing with union and write up and hearings can be time consuming,"
good,"The company seemed quite well to work. They had great employee involvement in team building and activities. They tried to be a positive company, but certain employees skimped in the fair process of compensation."
good,Falta mucha metodología y procedimientos en la Factoría de Valencia
good,Tive uma gerência excelente até o meio de 2016. Infelizmente não há muitas chances para terceiros.
good,"You are required to be at work even if there are family issues, It is hard to get off for emergencies, the best part of this job is the paycheck and benefits. this is a very fast pace environment."
good,Ford Motor Company is a work performance and customer loyalty driven company. If your work quality is consistent and to the company specs you will go far as to aim for excellence in that field. The work load is primarily customer driven and the customer is always right without them no one would have a job.
good,"-Many meetings while trying to get job done."
good,Didn't really get a chance to explore the option since I was there a short time.
good,Tough place to work. 10 and a half hour shifts. Lots of overtime. Management just cares about numbers not you unless you're a favorite. Some co-workers are all that keeps you going sometimes. constant repetition every 38 seconds. No real enjoyable parts of the job.
good,"Years of below average performance have resulted in minimal raises, depreciating stock awards, and reduced annual bonuses.  Retention tools are not motivating."
good,No real job security. Best to keep your skills sharp. Sections are very hard to switch from. But mostly you are left to do your work. And work conditions are good
good,"a typical day required team collaboration."
good,Ford is a good place to work. I do enjoy going to work everyday. This job is not for everyone though. It is the same work everyday. If you do not like change this job is great for you.

good,"Good place to work, Practical working culture"
good,"I loved working as a service writer. I am a Ford car enthusiast. I am very good at listening to what people are saying and figuring out what they are actually trying to say. I am good at working with people and technicians to come to an understanding of the problem and the work needed to fix the problem. Ordering parts from the parts dept., and then scheduling the work to be done when the parts came in, getting warranty authorization for payment, -(or customer payment authorization after preparing a cost estimate was not always an easy thing- telling someone that  a part and the replacement costs are several dollars is Never easy) was all part of the day."
good,My career is starting in this company.Productive and seniors are friendly.I get more knowledge about safety and quality.Trainers are friendly and his giving more knowledge.
good,Global perspective on international healthcare and UAW experience.  Multi union experience and experience writing 15 benefit booklets for both active and retired salaried and hourly employees.
good,"a typical day was 8 hours"
good,Poor planning and management lead to extreme stress buy pay and benefits and the way management treated you made the stress worth while. Management is scattered but knows their jobs well
good,"Worked for a dealership that was owned by one man. The employees were good people. Management was poor. The way they spoke to certain employees (not myself, but others) was unprofessional. Career advancement was poor and compensation was very minimal for all of the tasks each person was assigned."
good,"Pretty good work life balance, laid back workplace with friendly workers and managers.  I strongly disagreed with certain decisions made by management and other project directors on a regular basis on a macro level"
good,"The same repetitive motions all day, not to stop the line and that attention to detail and safety is very important in the workplace."
good,Not much to say typical large company with lots of chimneys though they say it is supposed to be one Ford.  It is getting a little better but the effects of years of empire building are still there.
good,"long days with decent breaks and holidays and weekends off i was only there for 2 months, safety and production seemed important to management and staff"
good,Ford was a very interesting and surprisingly fun workplace to be in due to getting to see all the new vehicles and working with a great group of people.
good,Everything was pretty good here not to many opportunities for job advancement the manager at this location was not easy to work for most of the guys in the shop were good to work with.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, excelente horario, y buenas prestaciones"
good,This was the first time i have ever been a part of such an amazing group of people. The atmosphere and bond between all of the union members. In all it was a great experience working at the Kansas City Ford assembly plant.
good,Never know when you will get off until after lunch. Not family friendly but awesome benefits and pay. Stressful at times and fast paced. Brotherly atmosphere.

good,"Good working environment where people treat each other with respect at all levels."
good,"I you couldn't look at a picture with alot of parts and put them together in your head with in a couple of seconds then you are not the one to work there. Its hard on your body and long hours and great pay and great benifits."
good,"Empresa multinacional"
good,"Highly subject to prioritizing deliverable s, managing production-to-Service part release for Dealer/Customer/Supplier timing per Vehicle Production in stock."
good,"A avaliação que posso tirar da empresa ao qual trabalho durante esses dois ano é que é uma empresa nova no mercado, ela tem cinco anos, cujos sócios estão também se desenvolvendo juntamente com a empresa, e com isso tem suas dificuldades na administração, pois o quilibrio entre trabalho e vida pessoal quase que não existe, mas como falei é uma pempresa nova e que está em fase de crescimento, os beneficios é de acordo com o sindicato, promoção só em caso de necessidade, ou seja se a empresa necessitar de contratar um novo colaborador para a area necessitada, para a empresa é mais viavel promover um colaborador que já esteja com ela, e acho viavel dessa forma."
good,Dias de trabalho calmos
good,Great company to work for but I am on a 6 month contract with no job security
good,I think the hardest part was knowing that the plant was going to close and there was no way to stop it.
good,"It was a contract and the reason to leave Ford is that there is no possibility to be hired internally. The environment is very relaxed, but there is a lot of routines to follow"
good,La dinámica del día a día muchas veces supera a las buenas prácticas y la filosofía de trabajo que caracteriza a la empresa que todos conocemos.
good,"I work in an engine plant based in Bridgend,  South Wales."
good,"Hot , long days very hard jobs. Management was proficient,  enjoyed the money, it is hard work, not many people make it, just have to work threw the pain and getting your body use to using muscle your not use to using. Hang in there job pays good."
good,"It's a good company to work; it has excellent benefits as for as major medical. As an hourly employee, on has good employment security due to support of the UAW."
good,"Ford Motor Company is a good job, but systems that run it are badly used. And management just checks boxes and moves on."
good,"In fairness, I worked at Woody Anderson during a recession and just after the government ""cash for clunkers"" program took a lot of decent used cars out of the market.  I sold vehicles, but it is very difficult to sell new cars with much profit built in.  There are so many online resources now that customers enter the dealership armed with the invoice price for the model they are hoping to buy. You could sell a $60,000 vehicle and only receive a $100 commission because you were unable to build enough profit into the deal."
good,Terrible job and bosses but it provides for my family. Long hours. Dirty. My personal job is very physically demanding and takes a toll on the body. I have a bad knee and both wrists have carpal tunnel in them and I still have 20 more yrs to go
good,"Correria e muito trabalho, porém pessoas maravilhosas e dispostas a trabalhem em equipe."
good,I loved working at Ford Motor Company it was something I’ve always wanted loved what I did but management had their favorite people even tho I frequently ask how I was doing still got fired for something I didn’t do
good,This was a supplemental position..worked only til it was time to close shop or shut down which is what i did...Enjoy working there but did not want to relocate.
good,Sueldo acorde al trabajo. Bueno. Malo en ergonomia y calidad de trabajo
good,"Gran empresa para comenzar tu vida profesional, mucho aprendizaje, muchos cursos"
good,"Flexible hour to start and finish accoplishing the 8 hour per day"

good,la mayoria del personal es contratada por empresas externas
good,"Interesting place with low chances of development without a support from within. "
good,"The employees you work with are amazing people. But the GM wasn't professional by any means. And if the women in accounting office don't like you, you won't be employed there very long"
good,En cuanto a salario está muy bien pero no hay muy buenas prestaciones. El horario es extenso no hay mucha estabilidad laboral.
good,"As a field employee, you are allowed to be in control of your time management and work schedule. Something new every day, and opportunities to challenge your skill set occurs often.  Management never fully understands your value or skills.  Not much opportunity to advance or even stay secure in current job."
good,"At Ford, every day is going to be a Challenge."
good,"Had 3 contract assignments at Ford.  Two assignments were great;  third assignment had poor management, too much work for 1 person and a lot of chaos."
good,"This position was always a contract position.  During my time with Ford Motor Company they were never hiring direct hire.  Therefore, there I was never going to be a Ford employee."
good,"take the job and learn, leave to get the money you will need to live on.  most managers are good but stress levels are high as well as demands on hours to work"
good,It was a great company to work for.With high safety standards and easy to follow work practices.Good training standards with some small benefits until near the end of its demise.Ran longer than expected but sad in the end knowing it was the end of an era.I enjoyed working close to where I lived so was very easy to walk or ride there.I did learn to work with different people form different places and diverse cultures/ backgrounds.Safety and Quality where high ion the agenda to keep a clean safe work place.The hardest part of the job was maintaining a high quality product with tight schedules and old equipment but we got through it.

good,"long hours, hard labor troubling management no job security bad health insurance."
good,Its a good job but just know if you have a family it will be hard to spend time. you spend a lot of time at work. But you become a lot close with your employees that surround you. There are days that you want to quiet and there are days that you want love working. Benefits don't kick in right away so when you get hired make sure you have your own till you receive fords.
good,Over the 6 + years I have worked at the Ford Executive Office I have gained significant amount of high level experience in the Motor Industry sector. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work itself as the work varies from customer complaints to county court claims.
good,"Empresa de grande liderança no mercado mundial, através de um trabalho em equipe para tomada de decisões estratégicas."
good,"FORD is very good company, being part of this company was very good. loved to work at there. The team and other employees were very polite and helpful.

good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, bons benefícios, salários,  o que estraga a empresa é ter muito envolvimento com sindicado, isso esta destruindo a empresa."
good,The auto industry is a high stress place to work. It is not a place for the faint of heart. But if you know how to make it fun and look for opportunities to grow and enjoy yourself then it will be a rich and rewarding experience.
good,"The pay and health benefits are great, but the factory is filthy and hot in the summer with no air conditioning. The company is very strict with regards to attendance, you can easily lose your job if you AWOL too often, it doesn't matter if it's family emergency or illness or transportation issues. Leaving early is not an option if you have an emergency or become ill"

good,"If you can get in permanent, its a great job For those with out a education. Pay is good but work is hard. No lifestyle but it pays the bills.

good,Otima empresa para trabalhar bom salario mais outros beneficios bom ambiente
good,"Foi um aprendizado, la aprendi  a trabalhar em equipe e trabalhar com segurança e qualidade."
good,There were many opportunities to engage in global process and international meetings.  I had the opportunity to live locally and yet take part in a global business environment.
good,Overall Ford was a great company besides all of the mass layoffs. There should be more options of opportunities for employees who were laid off for long periods of time.
good,Overall good but little chance to advance the corporate heirarchy the way it is structured. 95% of engineers stay as engineers throughout their careers at Ford but at the same time a lot of people end up staying at Ford once they start working because they like working there. So it's up to personal preferences.
good,"Good company for middle level managers, and fun to work. Great work life balance and feels like Family. Salaries are on par with Industry standards. Lot of learning opportunities."
good,"Our daily work we supported  production "
good,una empresa donde se dan oportunidades de crecimiento

good,A good company to work for good jobs good pay good hours great chance to move up in the company fast past and keeps you busy overall a good job to work for
good,A typical day at work consisted of performing mechanical tasks in a repetitious and expedient fashion. I learned how to operate slightly ominous power tools and heavy machinery with dexterity and adroitness Workplace culture was solemn but also casual .The hardest part of the job was the tedium as well as the grueling physicality required to complete repetitious tasks. The most enjoyable part of my day was conversing with my manager or fellow assemblers while still being able to perform the necessary duties of my job.
good,"ruthless once in trouble, learned alot, saw some of the hardest working people ive ever seen. union is friends with labor, at expense to workers and creativity needed to evolve."
good,"The reason I continue to work at Ford is because the weekly pay is manageable. It’s friendly work environment, and it also a great experience in the automotive field ."
good,"The hours you had to work made it very difficult to have time for a family and friends. The benefits were amazing and the salary was a plus, but nothing can replace time with your children."
good,"Great place to work good people , good pay anx benefits. Overall good retirement plan , fast passed lacbor intense factory work but good pay I would of stayed but relocated"
good,"Bonne entreprise , travaille agréable , je recommande l'entreprise"
good,"Productive and fun intern experience. Provided interns with ample opportunities to learn about different areas of the business, network across the organization, and tour Ford's different facilities."
good,This place can be stressful but as long as you come to work and do your job then you have no problems. The union works really hard to represent you as well. I would of never left if I didn't have personal family reasons to handle.
good,"Ford is a secure to company to work for, however if you have aspiration for advancement it is exceedingly difficult to get noticed. If you have that go get em attitude, this company only rewards the few. Very biblical in the sense that many are called,  few are chosen. There is less emphasis on hard skills and more on soft skills (after work activities, cronyism). You will find this at other companies, but it is widespread at this one. When you are out of the inner circle, you not only know it, you feel it. Now if you have no aspiration, and you just want a job with no autonomy (lots of rules and decisions being made at high levels) this is your place to work. Great for someone coming out of school that wants to learn. Great American company, but very adverse to risk (115 Years does not come easy)"
good,I worked there for over 22 years.  Over all it was a good job.  Very good benefits.  Some job advancement.  10 years working on the engine line.   10 years working doing inspection.
good,Balanced work life and personal life. Excellent training programme when joined as a fresher but they tie you in condition to work at least for 1 year and more otherwise they will cut from bonus.

good,"From my perspective, FORD is the best company to work and join among other vehicles companies, they have plenty vehicles types you can work on so that you gain experiences not in only one type, but multiple, teamwork was like a family to me , we were sharing our ideas about any thing difficult to understand in order to make it more easier, also the management published a competition for those who working so hard to gain 500$ as an award for accomplishment."
good,"Enjoyed the environment. Able to be accountable for my own work, and able to work alongside other employees of Ford. Equal work loads and fair compensation for work."
good,"For the most, a good job to have. Once you finally get hired full time. I was there a year an some months an still wasn't hired. Such a disappointment, but over all good workplace"
good,"Nice culture,bonus & over time benefits,yearly annual leave benefits, good & safety  working environment,yearly cultural programs,over employee friendly."
good,"I enjoy working at Ford Motor Company."
good,Ford is a great place to work with good benefits but job security is not the best they are very unpredictable no matter how long you have put time in there.
good,At Ford you will work in an environment where there is no expertise or desire to educate the team with a general level of digital marketing knowledge.  There is a heavy reliance on the agency partners to do the work and lead the way.
good,I learned so much about automotive ECUs and Testing/Validation (Automation and Manual) of these ECUs
good,"Greeted customers entering establishment. "
good,Typical day at work is what you learned and management and workplace culture and filler words here and blank this and that and the hardest part of the job is filling surverys when you don't wish to share your experience online.

good,"Ford is one of the best places to settle if you are above 35. But sadly i am 28 now and just realised i need to do more out in this world."
good,I had a week of work experience in Ford Motor Company. Whilst being there I worked in the IT Finance department where I became familiar with working on excel and using data to put into various forecasts.
good,You'll make good money for what you do.  Plan on extremely boring days with repetitive work. Management is relatively decent and the benefits are incredible.
good,"typical day at Ford used to be from 9am-6PM"
good,"Uma ótima empresa, centenária, entre as maiores do mundo no seu ramo. Literalmente colocou o mundo sobre rodas. Talvez por ser uma empresa tão grande, tornou-se pesada, lenta à mudanças e extremamente burocrática. Ao longo dos anos, perdeu a sintonia com o mercado, e com o que seus consumidores esperam e valorizam."
good,"A big company with a lot of processed in place and in my opinion too much management and not enough actual engineering. However, the hours are flexible and the work place relatively relaxed"
good,Ford was a good place to work. But it was only temporally. The Company shut down the plant here in Indy and relocated. After that all us temps were out of a job. But we knew that was going to happen. We all just hoped that it wouldnt had
good,Good leaning experience. You have to be quick on your feet on break downs to fix and find the problem. Work in a safe manner with a lot of different machinery.
good,"Ford is a place to learn and develop new skills in a nice environmental"

good,busy environment. on the computer all day. limited breaks. hard to switch off after work. phone calls all day. little help from management. no organisation
good,Ford has done an excellent job at refocusing efforts on making cars capable of competing on value and not just resting on the domestic dominance that carried them through the majority of the 20th century.  I expect a continued stream of quality vehicles to come out of Ford for the foreseeable future.
good,"Buena, aprendes muchísimo y desarrollas increible potencial. Muy recomendado para ingenierías, no para licenciados"
good,"A Ford é ma empresa que preza pela padronização e uniformidade dos processos, busca constante pela qualidade e zero tolerância a atos inseguros."
good,"No work life balance with the current shifts that workers are subject to, especially C-Crew. There is no way to get proper sleep or to have a family life with those shifts."
good,"- Good working environment "
good,"too many layoffs, hours up and down, you work crazy hours with no AC in the summer. hard on the body. ..................................................."
good,Very well paying job with benefits. A little rough on the body but worth the effort. Job placement is also a tough spot until one gets seniority under their belt.
good,The team that I work with at Ford cultivates a good team culture. Each individual is willing to help when a conflict comes up and multiple teams involvement is needed.
good,A typical day starts with a meeting and giving out the assignments for the day. Manage was good on some days and really bad on others. The hardest part of the job for me was to constantly find things to write up employees for.
good,"Good easy and good atmosphere easy to have help when needded and always someone to help,not a good option if havent got any intrest in the cars buisness of things"
good,"Good workplace and environment, wide range of product and locations. Opportunity to grow professionally and personally. Moderate compensation and benefits level."
good,"Trabalhei por 13 anos e foi muito bom, só sai porque o salário já não estava mais me ajudando na vida pessoal, estava muito abaixo do mercado e muito baixo para tantas responsabilidades que assumi ao longo dos anos, então precisei sair para buscar novas oportunidades de melhoria."
good,This is a place to go if you want to work on building cars. generally I wouldn't recommend for anyone who doesn't like to work. this is a medium to high
good,buena empresa con un buen ambiente laboral........
good,"It has been a great place to learn and work, but changes are being made where the environment is not what it used to be. Overall, I've been happy with my time here, but looking for more opportunity to grow."
good,"Stressful environment , bad for ones health. Great pay... Not much of an enjoyable lifestyle. Not much room for growth and advancement. Fast paced cut throat production environment. Once again Great Pay!!!"
good,"I was the Lot Attendant. It wasn't bad at all. Honestly, if they would have offered me more pay, I would still be there. I left because I wanted to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration."
good,Amployee is no happy. There is a only stuggling. This company have good cultur but Amployee have not satisfied with of this company. Any time thay will close the our training...
good,"Nice place to work."
good,Most of the jobs are majorily uncomplicated. There's a bit of heavy lifting but for the most part youre just by yourself loading steel into machines. Easy peasy. The medical department is a joke.

And there are problems with upper management really doing their job like they're supposed to. But as far as stability and great benefits, this company does have that!"
good,"Good pay you can actually live off of. Bonus come in handy 1,200-5,000 twice a year. hours are not too bad but young mans work over 40 forget it, Hard work but will pay off with just high school education."

good,I would sometimes enjoy my job and sometimes I would feel somehow. I had dreams to full fiĺl but couldn't because of retrenchment that took place. During my time there I believed I was under payed until now when am no more working. I see now it was enough for me to survive another week and so on. Since I wanted to become an artisan there.

good,Its a very good and secured place  especially for women. Working across the culture with diversity. Good work life balancing. Good exposure working in various departments
good,"I had studied unions in college and it was interesting to go from a white collar environment to a blue collar environment. When my shift was over, it was over. Mentally, I didn't take the job home with me which was awesome."

As a temp to hire you get no time off, no sick leave, and no incentives like profit sharing or 401k. Only when you become an permanent employee do you began to benifit.

good,"Ford is out for them selves. Yes they pay great, excellent benefits and bonuses. However the strength of the union has gone very weak and that allows the company to walk all over the employees. You are not valued here and it will break your body down and once you can not physically do the work you are gone and no good to them."
good,"It was a great work space and I loved going to work each day. The only issue was my manager he let me go after 9 months cause ""it's just not working out""  He then left the company his self a few weeks later. I would love to work there again."

It is a very capital intensive business and very competitive. Employees feel the pressure when they they cannot control effect the business.
good,"A remuneração alta vale o ""tempo parado"" a qual o colaborador é exposto, infelizmente a empresa, mesmo tendo tal porte não investe em tecnologias e nos raros casos onde as áreas tentam evoluir, são barradas por executivos de mentalidade completamente ""antiquada"" tentam barrar isso."

good,Good place for Senior management level staff. They can settle down and work here and retire from this company. The IT jobs are volatile and are prone to be axed.
good,"Excelente empresa, extremamente ética e que proporciona oportunidades de crescimento profissional."
good,It was a good learning curve for me but my Internship period was at the time of peak productivity and hence I couldn't speak a lot with the workers which was the only catch.

You had to fight to get your voices heard and found a way to be survived for any mistakes made. However, it is a good place to learn your engineering skills and moved on for a better job."
good,Ford Motor Company is a diverse company that has one goal which is to put out vehicles. You are treated as a robot doing the same thing every day for 10 to 11 hours per day.  If you show weakness in anyway shape or form they will replace you. Your ideas to help the company or make your job more proficient and efficient or no way shape or form listened to.

good,Working at Ford was pretty cool when i started. As the years continue i started to see how it really is. Typical day at work 10 hr shifts. A few breaks but not to long. I learned how to become a better leader as a Team Leader. Co workers was ok. No work life balance. I never seen my family. Most enjoyable part for me was learning new jobs.
good,"overall, it makes a good starter job, they are flexible with your hours. Very friendly staff, its almost as if working with friends."
good,"Empresa que paga aos funcionários um salário digno que ainda inclui vários benefícios. Tem um ótimo ambiente de trabalho. Empresa que faz qualquer funcionário ter orgulho de vestir a camisa."

good,"Fast paced, countless of skills to learn and excel to enhance opportunities within the company."
good,Much needed work has been done on improving the quality and brand image. Great negotiated discounts with many non-automotive industries. Strategy is sometimes short-sighted. Not such a great relationship with their dealers which can make a Field Manager's job difficult
good,"Boa estrutura, clima ok, qualidade de vida com horários bem definidos."
good,This was a job that I really enjoyed. The job was demanding but the overtime was excessive. Due to the overtime there was good money to be made but it was taxing on the family.

good,"I unloaded semi trailers in receiving Dept. it can get stressful at times when semi's don't come in on time, due to weather, or traffic. That's when you have to work through breaks or stay a little longer after shift, I learned a lot from that job on how to work efficiently and safely. co-workers were always fun to be around, and we help each other when needed. The most enjoyable part was working with my co-workers seemed like we had each others back, that's what I missed the most. And I miss driving forklift."
good,"Trabalho repetitivo nessa área de atuação. Aprendi bastante sobre as Ferramentas de Produção.Colegas de trabalho sem muito objetivo de crescimento pessoal e profissional.Parte difícil do trabalho, a repetição dos movimentos.

good,My work day was 10 hours plus
good,lots of fire fighting. too many chiefs. too many internal customers. lots of hours with no comp time
good,You will not have a life! The hours are long and drawn out. You work like a robot. 2nd tier employees do not recieve good health care coverage and this job will hurt your body. Its not an ideal job for everyone but if this type of work is for you then good for you!

good,Learned a lot of CAD and design knowledge during my co-op with Ford.
good,"THey have a really worker friendly environment. I was never stressed. However, I had few opportunities for advancement or projects to work on, so I moved on."
good,"They afford you the opportunity for advancement into higher positions and wages. The opportunity is there for you to take with help of school tuitions, and skilled trades trading programs."
good,"Benefits of working for this company is the paid days off, vacation pay, personal time off, and being union. People there really do work as a team so be ready to be team player"
good,I loved working at FMC and the company benefits/ paid time off/ bonuses/ pay rate/ and relaxed dress code. Work/ life balance at my plant in Memphis Tennessee was pretty good. The only problem is the Poor Communication Skills between the direct management and employees due to having a union the management doesn’t want to follow proper protocol. Union Jobs are great!
good,"Empresa séria, responsável, segura e ótima para cursos de capacitação, e de fácil acesso aos superiores."
good,I was never laid off in 32 years I retired to early I should of stayed 3 extra years. I will support Forf thr rest of my life. It is a great place to work a d raise your family

good,"They started us at $15 and hour and gave a $1.50 raise every year. Wasn't bad and I would recommend it if you needed a job. after 5 years I grew tired of the same thing every day and there seemed to be no opportunity to move up, so I decided to leave and see what else was out there. Moving to Colorado would be a dream come true. I hope there will be opportunity to move up in this business."
good,"It's a great place for the older employees but you need higher wages the cost of living I steady going up , so if it's hard for the senior employees I would imagine it's harder for new employees with no job security and lower wages and overtime is almost nonexistent for most employees...we need the overtime just to make it"

good,lamentablemente el ramo automotriz esta teniendo bajas lo cual repercute en la oferta laboral al ser mas baja su remuneración
good,"TPT/ STS are two levels of being a temporary worker at Ford motor company. TPT= you work 3 days a week, STS = you work 5 days a week. Plus your able to get over time. TPTs get no overtime."

good,"Very competitive environment with really intelligent people. Because its such a large organizations, career advancement is challenging in certain areas and things can move extremely slowly / indecisive."
good,"Great company with less competitive benefits"
good,Ford starts u off as a TPT and u move up from there to an STS then full time. The pros for Ford is the hrs are great and you are offered the overtime on the daily basis.
good,"Good Work & Life Balance. Good Learning environment...company’s core values, including honesty, integrity and humility — along with a strong work ethic and a good attitude."
good,"Great company to work for that supports work life balance, diversity and inclusion. Gives its employees latitude and autonomy in day to day decision making."
good,"Todos los días eran muy similares, cuando estas encargado de una operación no hay muchas cosas diferentes solo mantener la maquina produciendo, hacer revisión de calidad a las piezas, y mantener 5s."
good,This is a great place to work if your just starting to get into the automotive field or if your going to trade school they work around your schedule to get you the most hours as possible while your in school. The people there are great to work with and very knowledgeable also there are a lot of young co-workers. donut expect to have your own bay there though you usually are sharing with 1-2 other people at a time.
good,"A typical day could be very repetitive.  "
good,"I had an excellent time working at Ford Motor Company in Oakville, Ontario. the structured shifts were incredibly well organized, i was amazed by the level of efficiency that was maintained on such a large scale."
good,"just show up and stay in your lane, mind your own business and meet production requirements and the work day will go by fast and simple. just do what is required."
good,"This experience is what you make of it. You need to be able to find your own work-life balance in an industry that would otherwise ask very much of its qualified personnel. You will meet all kinds of personalities and you have to be confident in your own skills to succeed. It isn't for everyone, but Ford has a lot to offer."
good,"Fast paced job, had to able to react quickly to issues and make the correct call to meet daily task. I was able to learn several useful task that can be used in manufacturing industry,"
good,It isn’t for everyone. Family work balence is terrible. They say there a family company but keep you on 2:30 till 11 shift for 20 years while you miss your kids growing up.
good,"As an intern, sometimes work was scarce but the knowledge gained was more than amazing. The exposure to the automotive world came quick. The timekeeping system could use an update for interns."
good,"A good company to work, learned about many departaments, several cultures with different countries."
good,Journée très diverse selon les productions et besoin client
good,Was constantly challnged to work cross-functionally and find innovative ways to approach problems and define solutions.  Worked closely with all levels of the company to engage in defining the future.
good,The company can be better if the communication is forwarded to the correct parties to correct issues that exist among the workers and management. I believe that diversity and sensitivity training should be stressed more.
good,"En Ford, aprendi sobre finanzas y el dia a dia laboral. Creo que es una empresa muy linda para trabajar, con valores interesantes pero un poco vieja en cultura."
good,"long hours, high temperatures, got along with most. driving the high low was good job. clocking in and out was done by the honor system, they were trusting."
good,"Most of the things are done under pressure due to short time frame. This made me work long hours to ensure i submit quality work by doing necessary researches which would normally take more time. Exposure to different field of engineering was huge and i'd be allowed to also learn about other departments or aspect of the business hence i know quiet a lot about manufacturing processes, industrial engineering, quality, power tools, process engineering, facilities and project engineering"
good,There are opportunities to work from home or part time. There are also opportunities to move between different groups so that you can gain a better understanding of what occurs in different areas of the company..
good,"All aspects of working with corporate and global teams for new lands projects, involving procurement, project management, new product installations and overall OHS geared towards zero lost time, and full coverage of issue resolutions with all levels of the workforce, (in plant skilled trades, contractor, OEM's, controls engineers, requisitioning engineers, program leadership, and corporate officers). Very rewarding to install a new product line for a truck or vehicle engine, from the ground up. Completing sign off for review, design, run off and launch programs, leading to completion of a 2 year project is rewarding, especially with zero harm."
good,Ford is a good place to work good money with fantastic insurance. With any job it has its draw backs working up to 7 days a week sometimes you feel like you spend more time at work then woh your family.
good,"The company has a positive, inclusive culture."
good,I worked as a supplier to the Ford Motor company and cannot speak to the inner workings of day to day activity. I did however work closely with brand managers and attended numerous meeting in the Ford office buildings.

good,"Fast paced job."
good,My first working experience was at Ford when i was post graduate. Really good working staff and eager to teach you with lots of new things and very helpful.
good,"Es una buena empresa, con una gran variedad de departamentos y posibilidades. Inmersa en la mayor incertidumbre del sector más competitivo del mundo."
good,A place where you can have a good relationship with all employee and still improve your skills and learn every day a new thing. The hardest part of the job is deal with the lack of information about the company strategy.
good,Ford te possibilita a desenvolver seu próprio plano de carreira
good,I assembly on engine components and tcf and body shop at various location. I can do a work. May be proper handle tools and variety of tool handling. Proper  maintenance can be done.
good,It is a company with a good working environment and a good structure for the development of all the functions of the employees and promotes the companionship and internal cooperativism.

good,"Highest degree of professionalism from all of my management team, right down to my colleagues and support staff. The ""let's work together to come up with an innovative solution"" attitude pervades the company."
good,"A typical day was steady afternoons for most of my time there. We had a busy atmosphere either putting inventory in shelves by hand or with a forklift, or picking parts off shelves for delivery. We often worked solo or in a team environment. I liked the people I worked with and enjoyed my job. I worked with the company for 17 years until I left to return home as I commuted to the GTA area and I returned to school."
good,Working 10 hours a day and 8 hours on Saturday was a lot. I learned how to build a truck. Some managers did not know how to talk to people. Workplace was horrible
good,You either start work super early and get off at 4pm or you start at 530pm and get off at 330am. The hours are awful but the pay is great. You are on your feet all day but the place is a very laidback environment but stressful when it comes to work and having a life outside of work.
good,"1. Takes too long to convert temp employees"
good,"Most days you would waste time trying to figure out what to do and/or if your work was actually going to end up useful."
good,it was a pretty good place to work i just never got to see my family especially my daughter. My time there was ok other than that i just wasnt able to drive the two hours to come visit my family very often
good,"The most good benefit of working at Ford Motor Company is the advantage of being able to balance family time with work time, however, the pay rate is not  a competitive compare to the market."
good,"Lots of day to day work. Kept busy. Travelled around to plants and suppliers to deal with issues and correct problems. Lots of valuable experiences, and easy-to-access training opportunities to further my skills."
good,"Well I worked in three to four different departments, but my last position was pretty cool. Management was fair. Workplace culture was real cool. The hardest part of the job was adapting to the different personalities. The most enjoyable part was the money."
good,Utilities round have to perform as positions when needed and full that spots is employees they didn't show up to work. Long days and even long weeks too.
good,"Working at Ford as a contractor is a perfect place for a professional to work.  The expectation to only work 8 hours per day as a contractor is watched very closely,"
good,A very secure place to work if you have a family. The pay is pretty good but theres a good chance you'll lose a lot of social life as the hours can be long.
good,Empresa dinâmica proporciona grande experiências aos empregados
good,"This company has a family run feel about it."
good,"Finance careers at Ford Motor Company offer you with a wealth of opportunity and experience. It's rare within one company to be able to get experience in manufacturing, product development, marketing, purchasing, treasury, and a host of other areas. Most financial analyst jobs generally have good content and are fairly well structured. As you work your way up into management, the job content broadens and you get an opportunity to manage teams. However, with such a large company, the bureaucracy can be particularly frustrating at times, as it is difficult to be empowered to make any decisions (even some that may seem more trivial). The culture is one of family and often collaborative. Overall, it is a great place to get a range of finance experiences and broaden your knowledge and skills."
good,Hours are not sure....safety is always an issue on the job... must be alert and clear as to your surroundings.  Be always alert for danger zones that promote accidents such as leaky roofs and puddles of water on the floors from the rain... gas fumes and dust are issues if you have breathing problems ...i suggest wearing a mask to cover nose and mouth.
good,"There are to many Managers that are not on the same page"
good,Fun to work if you love Fords only left for personal reasons that involved family along with a heavy conflict of interest with ownership of the company
good,"Empresa boa com oportunidades de melhorias. Poderia ter o cargo de trainee, pois o estagiário já entra com o propósito de ser um Analista Júnior depois do término do contrato (se houver vaga). Apesar de o estágio ser puxado, o estagiário aprende muito."
good,"worked there a long time ago but still somewhat loyal to Ford. I worked on the plant floor and it was a pretty hectic environment, definitely for the faint of heart or thin skinned"
good,"working on a production line assembling vehicles. can be very boring and repetitive.worked with a lot of good people.the benefits were very good. pension,healthcare etc."
good,"Had variety of positions during my career.  Enjoyed both staff assignments and Plant manufacturing experience,  Learned hands on manufacturing systems"
good,"I am working between 8am-6pm and i am responsible engineer currently for the customer claims and identifying root cause of them. I have an experience about engine cover, gears, and lack of FIE systems and Turbo systems. In generally, i am so busy at company due to meetings. Hardest part of my job is convincing my manager.The most enjoyable part is working with people who have same social-cultural character as well as i have."
good,Ford motor company is one of the best part in my life.i learned many things and peoples.first time in my life I earned my salary it's precious.i successfully finished my training in job knowledge.

good,"Only job.. nd i concertrate my job , job is my ego and ego showing my atitude thats it!  I am very hard person but i love my job and i will try my best* thankew"
good,"Good place for learning  new things and technologies, well processed and procedure followed work place."
good,Ford is a great place to learn about big organizations. Also they do invest in their staff skills and talent development. Climbing the corporate ladder is very challenging as priority is given to seniority staff and not only reliant on skills and talents of those who deserve advancing based on their knowledge.
good,"Dedicados aos funcionários, atenciosos, competentes."
good,I was a temp at Ford hoping to get hired on but they laid a bunch of us off (600+) Good place to work for but they need to hire people as workers not temps.
good,"Good Company, Friendly Atmosphere, good job culture. Good place to work."
good,"As I stated in the review summary I went in as a temp for CBRE to move their departments to other buildings. The short time I was there was fine and I met a wonderful supervisor who was a full time supervisor. If he was an example of the workforce/ culture there, then I would love to work for FORD"
good,Fast paced work environment and lots of things to do. Creates reports for status of launch for management. Resolves issues across multiple functions of the vehicle.
good,"Trabalho muito dinâmico, pois havia a necessidade de resolver problemas de engenharia que na sua grande maioria não tinham um procedimento."
good,Constant fighting for top jobs leaves lower level employees feeling lost. Marketing Management often promotes based on diversity of company experience not quality of contribution.
good,Best part of the job is vehicle testing.  Test facilities are top notch.  Working with future vehicles is exciting and interesting.  I enjoy working in the garages and at the test facilities.
good,Ford is a very good company to work for in many ways.  The complexity of the automotive business offers many diverse challenges and opportunities.  Employees are largely empowered to drive the success of their area of the business.
good,"Primera experiencia laboral, pasantía que me ayudó muchísimo ya que me acercó verdaderamente al desarrollo teórico práctico de la carrera de ingeniería, ayudándome a enfrentar realmente el ambiente laboral"
good,Local de muito aprendizado e crescimento no que diz respeito à trabalhar em equipe.Empresa muito aberta em conhecer e se inteirar dos assuntos da Fonoaudiologia Ocupacional.

good,Ford was a great job. The few people problemsthat I had with them was that my union rep didn't fight for me and the medical staff didn't do their job and upload my updated medical paperwork.
good,A typical day of work is test driving a new years model car to test how the consumer would enjoy diving it. Testing everything from how the engine runs to how comfortable the seat is. I learned how to be very concise about how I do things and to be very good at time management. The most enjoyable part of the job is to drive the newest models on the market and drive them around testing them to make sure they run perfectly for the consumer that will eventually buy them.
good,You have a variety of things you can do working for this company i started off as an order picker which is someone who picked out parts specifically for a vehicle then i worked my way up to an dock worker driving a forklift.
good,The pay and the benefits is what keeps a lot of people. Assembly line work can be very monotonous however Ford allows you to bring a stereo or use 1 headphone. Ford is a multibillion dollar company that is reactive instead of proactive. You can complain for several months about job conditions and they won't resolve an issue until something breaks and stops the line.
good,"1. good company standards."
good,There is so many aspects to the company that you can change carers without leaving the company. The stress level is high and the work is fast-paced but you adjust quickly because it is throughout the company and not in just a few areas.
good,"um bom ambiente de trabalho, refeição feita na própria empresa, atendimento médico de emergência"
good,"Union Protected, great benefits once hired on. The hours are very long but that's why they pay a lot more than other warehouse/factory employers. Paid weekly."
good,"All over company's very good "
good,If you can handle loud noises even being supplied with ear protection and far walks to even make it to your job assignment.  Being treated like a man and your a woman. Absolutely no one to inform of you of changes until something is affecting you. Lack of communication between management and UAW members.  If you can deal with this on a daily basis then Ford Motor Company is the job for you.
good,"Good people with a common goal of how to run a company."
good,It is a leading MNC company in the world and also leading car manufacturer in the world. Here each and every employees are respect to each other. Safety is a first priority
good,"Overall OK. But contractor vs full time employee, is quite different. Company culture is typical American company's culture."
good,"Aprendi muito nessa empresa, ela fui uma boaescola pra mim. Entrei jovem e com os anos aprendi quase tudo sobre a a´rea de minha especialização que e´a Logística.

good,"1. Typical day at work:"
good,"No two days are the same here, there is always a challenge or a job issue that will need your attention to the fullest.  Management will always support you and guide you where needed"
good,"Work entirely depends upon your manager. Dont join as a contractor. You are stuck with your manager that way, restricting your options."
good,"I learn about Receiving process, Where house activity, FIFO, LIFO, Martial handling system, Stock counting, Martial Flow to line,"
good,"Very fast paced and hard work. I managed to understand the culture quickly and its all about your attitude towards hard work and willingness to work hard. many opportunities are present, but one must look for them,"
good,"I am in a constant chase for customers and Market Share."
good,My particular experience was not good. But I think in general the company and my particular experience was unique. I don't believe the position which I applied for was new was very well thought out. So it was a mismatch of my experience and their expectations.
good,"I was a long term supplemental employee in Dearborn Stamping West. I was a operator responsible for the assembly portion of the stamping. The raw aluminum is run through the blanker and cut then stamped/pressed. We would feed the aluminum through Valiant automotive systems to be riveted, hemmed, etc... by Fanuc robots. As a LTS, (Long term supplemental), I assembled every aluminum exterior part of the F-150, save for hoods and cabs. Those were assembled in Dearborn Stamping East.We were responsible for inspection of parts, diagnostics of the robots,(operator level only), and proper disposal of parts that did not pass inspection. I learned how to use the diagnostic computers and find problems and get the line started by myself often. Other times, depending on the severity of the issue, reported issues to skilled trades so they can keep us running. I was in application for a process coach/supervisor position, my resume was accepted, but, the position was filled by one of my team leaders."

good,"I was hired and worked relentlessly for this company.I found out over time, I'm not a cubicle type.  I was laid off eventually.  There were many things that happened in between.  Some good, some bad, but overall I was not impressed.  But hey, if you want to stress out to impress and advance, only to find out your supervisor is getting promoted for stealing your ideas and taking credit for your had work,  You can apply through manpower."
good,"A typical day at work was never the same. We met  with different customers with completely diverse personality types which was a huge learning curve on how to deal with clients. In addition to the notions behavioural psycology learned onsite, a great deal of information was conveyed to us about the technicalities of cars and the general automobile industry as a whole. The fact that the staff was a contingent of young people made the working environment a fun and thriving job site. Management always maintained an enjoyable and highly professional environment which ultimately led to the smooth running of business and meeting of set goals."
good,"une journée de travail typique : Reunion avec le client pour etablir les transport supplementaires a mettre en place pour livrer les concessionaires et discuter de la performance."
good,A typical day I would go threw the line to ensure there is proper stock and tools for all operators. I stated as an operator and was promoted to team leader after a year. I worked with management very closely to ensure that we were producing a quality product in the proper amount of time in a safe work place with all proper PPE. I was in charge of making any and all repair from my work zone and ensure that there made correctly.

good,"This is a great company to learn from, but may not be a great place to have a career at."
good,"Ford works on meeting a timing basis and day to day my task is dependent on meeting the timing at hand. The automobile industry has many milestones that need to be met per program (vehicle line), from program start, to prototype builds and up to mass production. It is very busy at work as everyday a new assignment is expected of me, a task I signed up for from the get go. The amount of experience I have gain, and still am gaining, is phenomenal. After work, I enjoy going home and not having to worry about it until the very next day. My co-workers are supportive and have many common traits that makes us more than just co-workers."

good,I start work at 6 a.m. get I now get off at 4:30 p.m. I learned to wear comfortable shoes due to me being on my feet for 10 hours. The management needs better understanding of what we go through instead of always catching attitudes with the employees. My co-workers are always a help when someone forgets something or in pain and lends a helping hand. The hardest part is sometimes being in pain while doing your assignment giving to you. The most enjoyable part is that I get to listen to my music while I'm working and also talk to my co-workers as well so we will not be looking at the time.
good,"learned about time management, also how to act ethical, dont allow any personal things interfer with your work, sometimes you work under pressuer but most important thing is to work hard."

It was a summer job and my co workers seemed to be of use being that I was new. There wasn't really anything hard about the job, except for standing up the majority of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to work with the automated machinery."

good,"Pros"
good,"I’m a part time temp (TPT), I’ve been there for almost a year now. I see a lot of mixed reviews on here. I’m 19 years old, the work is relatively easy, every now again you’ll get on a harder job which we call “busy jobs” due to constantly having to be up and moving. But lost jobs are simple and easy to do. As a temp your job isn’t secure obviously, just make sure you show up and do your job right, which ever they split you on. You’ll be train properly. Management is okay, you’ll have good and bad supervisors."
good,Used to be a job for life and could be an excellent place to work. Great pay and good pension  but moving work abroad and reductions in cost are costing peoples jobs. There's no job security.
good,"Dependable work, great benefits, and good pay. Full time hired employees have job security, but if you hire in as an LTS or in temp status, the feeling of instability can be somewhat difficult to deal with."
good,"Salary not preferable at that time, unless it is a good working culture & facility available for environment & safety oriented.good food & superior training activity are also good"
good,Overall it’s a good place to work with great benefits. You get frequent bonuses and paid vacation time. The environment isn’t bad but management can become a hassle
good,Nice place to work Good transportation & Other facilities to employ . Opportunity to Grow is more. Challenging work. Good interpersonal relationships .
good,"It’s a great company to work for, amazing benefits. Medical, vision, dental, 401(k). If I decided to stay in Chicago I would have continue to work for them."
good,"The job and company are wonderful but I was warned against submitting to the Golden Jail. The safety of a decent salary and benefits is hard to escape once you become comfortable. You can also listen to whatever you want (""one"" headphone at a time)."
good,"1-Not so busy environment"
good,"Constantly walking and moving on feet, bending into cars and reaching above cars. The hardest part of the job is your muscles adjusting to different body movements and positions."

good,"Lived my job, and the people I got to work with, were amazing that they trained me and helped me with my job, I was able to pick the shift I wanted which was a huge help, because based on the shift I choose I would never be late or missed work because of the time they allowed me to pick"
good,"I love Ford Motor Company.  They treated me and family extremely well for my 26 years.  The work is challenging and you never stop learning.  Also, the people are unequaled and the compensation is fantastic. I always felt empowered to make local tactical decisions. There definitely is a wonderful family feel that starts with Bill Ford. The history of the company is also inspiring and fascination.   The problem is upper management starting at the Chief level.  They  change their minds constantly and  start most programs late, usually without adequate staffing. To top it off they have layers of people tracking your every move. They often minimize bad news and prioritize timing and cost over quality.  It's a yes man culture with draconian bureaucratic requirements.  Over the years the trackers, the paperwork and the uncertainty have taken the fun out of working there.  They fritter away billions by proceeding with troubled programs then relentlessly hound the workers to save a  nickel. Process ""improvement"" trumps product work.  Management has no conception of what it takes to do the job right and often doesn't really care. They run the business using staffing models that have no connection with reality and the way the company is run.   They pump resources into autonomy and electrification at the expense of current products and forward model even though I've never seen a coherent customer  ""why buy"" for  electric cars.  Lastly, like Mark Twain said, ""The reports of the death of the Sedan are greatly exaggerated"", especially when it's your #1 hybrid platform."
good,"puntualidad"
good,This was a hard job in a dirty plant. The work was very physical and dirty. The compensation was not equal to the work required. I worked on second and third shift.

good,"Lot of opportunities to learn and work."
good,"Ford is generally a very nice place to acquire new skills and knowledge. You have plenty of training either online or face-to-face. The hardest part of the job is that there were way too many meetings that you don't have time to do your work, and sometimes you need to stay late to call in a meeting with colleagues from other time zone."
good,"Great company and crew to work with. A lot of room for growth. Pleasant company with a family like feel. I would tell anyone looking to get into the field, that Ford is a great place to work"
good,"The work environment at Ford Motor company is very cool and the work life balancing is good."
good,"I was in Purchasing at Ford for three years and have zero complaints on my managers, however advancement is very slow.  Big company that is struggling to lose the old culture.  Length of employment seems to outweigh hard work from the younger employees."
good,Great pay and benefits. Can be super tough on nightshift if you have kids. Hardly any freedom regarding bathroom breaks and such. Can get really stressful at times.
good,"The work is repetition and depending on where you are placed it can be fast or slow paced. Management spoils certain workers giving out easier ""work"" and leaving many people with jobs they struggle on due to stress and fatigue. The problem is small management doesn't have enough guts to go upstairs and make any change on job cycling because they are content with the paychecks and small work they actually implement. Work is work so if you need the benefits this place will have it for you and your family."
good,"very secure job industry. good company good benefit package. I learned to adapt and learn new skills.fast paced assembly work. great union, and depending who and where you are placed it can be a fun work environment"
good,"Working as an intern in the Public Relations and Government Affairs at Ford Motor Brazil made me accomplish many of my goals during the university, because I wanted to work in a big company. Once there, I was able to be a shadow of my manager and supervisor which helped me see and practice the daily activities of a communications employee."

good,Corporativo muito bom para aprendizado e desenvolvimento pessoal e profissional.
good,"A typical work day includes reporting to work on time and ready to make production numbers. This is repetitive, physically demanding work which can be boring and difficult for some people. The management and co-workers are what keeps you motivated throughout the day. The hours can be long including weekends but the benefits far out way the cons."
good,i work in the RDU section in product development.  I am a part-time co-op still attending school at LTU in Southfield and I learn everyday when i am at work.  I love what i do and there is never a dull moment at work!

good,"A FORD era uma empresa concisa , porém sem muita oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"Great work/life balance, provided you're willing to live in the southeast Michigan area. Work culture is a little dated, but there should be a switch in that in the next 5-10 years."

good,"Cool place to work and make good income with great benefits,the benefits ever,if your a full time employee,paid holidays and if you work holidays you are paid double time to work, plus you get your 10 hour holiday pay as well, our committee men are great help when in time of need most of them, it is a union place if you dont mind working hard for your money then this will be a nice fit."
good,"Great flexibility with work schedule, management is very supportive of new ideas and encourages team building.  The workplace culture is very inclusive and diverse."
good,"I am line quality"
good,"Stay to yourself and work hard, management needs more in-depth training as well. The environment is very toxic lots of people are dealing with depression"
good,"I enjoyed my first rotation very much - engaging and demanding work. The culture and type of work vary a lot by organization, so experiences will vary as well. Advancement out of college feels slow."
good,A good place to work.  Provided training in many areas which were beneficial to the company and the employee.  Was proud to be a part of this successful company.

good,"Ford is a great place to work for an individual who seeks to make a career in the automotive industry. Unfortunately, as an hourly based employee, there are not many opportunities for my career aspirations of management or administration.  Ford has a great employee benefit package, and their hourly pay of a two-tier system is progressive. The working culture is production driven, which can often induce a little more stress than a normal working environment. Ultimately, I believe Ford motor Co. is a great place to work."
good,Ford is a great job opportunity. Especially if you're young with no family. They also have great discounts. The company has great progression. But I also have a problem with race
good,"I enjoyed the challenges and felt a sense of pride in the fact that, at that time, Plant 'A' in the complex was the only plant in the country that was producing the Mustang and Cougar automobiles.  The assembly line turned out 1300 cars per day on 3 shifts."
good,Ford is a great company to work for. They have great benefits. Which is great if you have a family to provide for. Also pay is good. With many different options to move up.

good,"I was a contractor for Ford stationed in the NPC. Changes are slow to occur and process are slow to change. Job security and benefits are AMAZING. However, being a young millennial looking to advance and grow, it was not the ideal location. The work was fun and the people are great there. If you are looking for job security in a consistent place located conveniently in downtown Detroit, I would definitely recommend."
good,"Working a ford motor company was a great experience but I do not like the way they lay off people with no notice. Overall I liked the job, but being payed off was always on my mond and management had no right answer for any question I asked of my fellow employees had."

I installed the weather strip on each off the 550-600 trucks that came down the line each shift. We could listen to music in our head phones so time passed by pretty quick. The management were very in touch with what was going on around us, since it was a somewhat dangerous place to work.

I learned more about excel, powerpoint and how industry tracks progress and issues. The management was very nice and helpful but at times seemed unorganized.

good,I love the benefits at Ford Motor Company and would refer my family and friends to work here.

good,"Ford Motor company deliver an outstanding product which has made my job more enjoyable in delivering satisfaction to customers. My working hours are very suited (business hours) and I have learnt a lot since starting there. In selling vehicles to businesses, I was taught how businesses are formed and structured, and how they benefit from purchasing vehicles and other business related items from a tax and VAT point of view. In learning these calculations, I am able to show customer's a brief description of the savings they can make not only from the discounts on the vehicle, but from running a business as well. The culture is very fast pace in my place of work and the targets are often difficult to meet. The hardest part of the job is dealing with Ford themselves when chasing updates for customer as I feel they lack in certain areas of support to dealers. The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers when they receive their brand new vehicles."

good,the KTP plant is always going to have the best job security but the work schedule is never set in stone. we dont even know how long the shifts are until were 8 hours into the shift.  the management is random. some supervisors are great others are uneducated or down right terrible.  it always hot and the contract between the UAW and ford motor company is regularly ignored. but the pay is good so most stay.
good,Company gives very good salary even for the fresher. Very good work place for operations and not for accounting team. So many politics in  regards with rewards and recognition.
good,"I worked as maintenence for the conveyor belts that ran throughout the factory at Ford. The work consisted of welding, pulling wire, panel work, painting, and much more. We replaced sensors and the belts themselves. The co-workers were all hardworking and the managers level-headed. The work was great but the pay was not due to the plant being in Mexico. A single 8 hour day on a minimum wage here makes more than I did working a whole week there."

It is a very solid and reliable place to work, where workers are well looked after, but it can also be a bit stifling as its work practises are long established and it takes a long time to take for the business to take on new ideas. They very much want to look after their workers, and actually discourage long hours, and in the IT world I think this is quite a healthy thing.

good,"A typical day at work is doing maintenance and prevention of future problems occurring from the equipment to keep production flowing."
good,"our management are very supportive to introduce new ideas, implementations of new safety equipments and very transparent in terms of the state of the company,e.g profitability,plans of the company(short and long term plans) to its employees.Our management's belief is that a happy employee is a productive employee.As employees we all believe that if we produce and deliver the best quality to our customers,our company will stay generations to generations in the business.The most hardest part of this job is when an employee loose his or her life just because I didn't explain anything about safety compliance in his or her working station. The most enjoyable part of this job is that everyday of my working life I save lives,jobs and ensure long term existance of our company."

good,"A typical day was  an average 8 AM to 5PM 2 days a week, 3 days 12PM to 9PM with alternating half days on Saturday. I had several opportunities in the best training available on site, which included, Customer Service, Sales Support, Account Maintenance,  Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. Management was driven by statistic, however there was continue effort to foster an open door policy. My co-workers were team players. we often rival with each other through departmental contexts, which help to keep the morale up."

good,"I started out as a cashier, then switchboard operator/title clerk, then trained as an administrative clerk in the auto reference department. Company decided to re-locate this office to a call center in MD. I was not able to re-locate, so I (and others) were laid off in 1992. The entire office was a team. We all got along, there was about 25 of us."
good,"Start day with review of previous 24 hrs activities and action pending issues. The best thing that Ford has taught me is that the team is bigger then any individual. Diversity is not just about colour but far bigger then this. Co-workers becomes family, cause the company nutures team building."
good,a changing work environment. The handing of production and quality floor concerns to the union members. Management lacks the knowledge of needs to train new team leaders and often expects those with the abilities to accept more responsilities. A Good Ole Boy network still exists.
good,This was a great place to be employed at. Family environment. People pleasing people.
good,"You are very conscious of the importance of quality. Management, co-workers and customer expect quality in your work. It is a reflection of Ford Motor Company and the people that work for Ford.

good,"I worked at Ford Credit for 20 years. The atmosphere for the majority of that time was great, minus the last few years when the financial problems started and job security was a major concern. The company's training program was second to none. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sense of family not only with fellow employees, but also with the dealer clients. It would be great to see the company get back to where they were in the early 90's, I believe they were at their best then. I would welcome the opportunity to work at Ford Credit again if it presented itself."
good,Comapny in trouble
good,"otimo local de trabalho com muitos beneficios e otimo salario, pessoal de trabalho muito legal"
good,This was a great place to work. The only thing with me was I got custody of my grand daughters and the last night work hours did not work for me.
good,Ford was an excellent company to work for. The jobs I obtained during the years were easy to learn. The management was fair. My co-workers were great and I enoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job was the early hours.
good,"A fast paced job. Where a person had to be able to think, and move quickly. Also, had to work well with other people."
good,"aprendi a ser dínamico e pró ativo, aprendi a trabalhar com auto-controle e qualidade a direção era aberta a ideias novas e a parte mais agradável do trabalho era o prazer e a satísfação de ver o produto acabado e ver que eu ajudei a fazer."
good,"althought the work was the same from day to day it was a good place to work, the only thing was the carious lay off from time toi time"
good,"I had worked for Ford Motor Company for 19 years and it was a good company to work for. The time came for the company to cut-back and lean down. I left only because of personal reasons of not wanting to leave state of residency. They are a highly engineered, productive company that is constantly looking forward. My hope is they continue to strive to greatness."
good,"A company in transition in North America, but at the same time continuing to grow globally."
good,The working environment and fellow employees are lend to enjoying the day at work and being a productive employee. There are times that are very busy but are balanced out by the slower days.
good,"When I started working for ford I had just moved to the United States and didn't know a lot of people, but the staff over there was very welcoming and helped me in getting used to the work. I mostly worked from home but the staff was very supportive when I had work-related problems."
good,"Der Ablauf war sehr stressig - weil die Produktion immer vorrangig war , in dieser Zeit musste man die Anlagen auf Neu umrüsten-produzieren und nach ein paar Stunden wieder Rückbauen"

good,"For the first year it can be stressful because you can't miss any days of work. Your not backed by the uaw 249 until you complete your 1 year. Most jobs on the line are pretty balanced, it does take time to get used to contorting your body to complete some of the jobs. All is forgotten on payday. You go in give them 40 hr a week and you get 1,000 $ on Friday."
good,"My experience in Ford family is very excellent every one respected to me & supported to me & supported to financial problem also "
good,"Desculpe, ocorreu um erro, tente novamente mais tarde"
good,I learned the process of taking an automotive engineering concept to production using Ford Motor Company's unique process. The engineers responsible for showing me the ropes were very experienced and excellent teachers.
good,"Culture at Ford is best described as family, a lot of camaraderie and good attitudes. Decision making culture could improve. Slow, archaic approval processes, currently undergoing restructuring aka shuffling. At times there does not seem to be a method to the madness, the unfortunate are simply in the wrong place at wrong time. Other than the cyclical chance of losing your job, fantastic place to work and one of the best companies you will find in the area."
good,It's hard starting off to the strenuous work your intended to complete but once you get used to it and gain a groove for things the job opens up a bit and becomes easier to maintain.
good,"Ford is an excellent place to work.  If you work hard and produce, they appreciate what you do, and share their profits with their employees. I would love to work there again. If you’re looking for a place with long-term future prospects think about joining the Ford Motor Company team."
good,"Ford Motor Company is a fast-paced competitive environment with many opportunities to get involved in cross-functional and global projects.  Overall, I consider it a very good company to work for and would recommend it."
good,"Bureaucratic like any 200,000 person company. The recent management strategy hasn't been communicated clearly, but salaried employee benefits are competitive for the auto industry."

good,"-                                                                                                           Was a good and meaningful work experience that benefited my career."
good,"Ford Motor Co. is a family owned business and for me, treated me like family. I would recommend. Plenty of growth. The most enjoyable part was the workers and managers who became like family."
good,Ford is great to work with however some tasks involved some imbalance on work-life
good,it was very hard work but was good pay and good benefits as well. i ran very large presses and boxed very big parts. i learned how to spot weld and put car parts together as well
good,Ford has many opportunities to work on interesting projects and contribute to a brand you believe in (if you like Ford cars/trucks). Job movement is very opaque and is more about who you know in that department. They are more likely to add job responsibility to someone than to fill a vacant position. Everything takes longer than you would expect and your direct supervisor will be in meetings constantly.
good,"Mi estadía fue corta, pero ha sido una de las mejores experiencias de trabajo que he tenido."
good,"Great balance, lots of travel but a bit outdated. Kinda get tired of the monotony and lack of career progression. I was in Supplier Technical Assistance and enjoyed my time there. Absolutely amazing bosses and some of the best people i worked for as well as some of the worst. I got lucky when i first joined as i had the best boss ever then they transferred me to a really bad boss. I was also on contract and it is pretty difficult to get hired on full time even though i had worked for Ford in South Africa and had all the experience."
good,Ford is a non stop moving job where you stand on your feet for a minimum 10 hours per day. It gets very hot in that building where staying hydrated is a requirement.
good,Great company to work for. Very laid back environment. People in the office are fun and excited about their projects. This is not a tech company. They do not operate like a tech company. Lots of hoops to jump through in their tech stack.
good,"Ford is an old company which has long standing history."
good,"Boa gerencia, bom ambiente de trabalho, tecnologia intermediaria."
good,"It was a good job with great Tool and Die workers, but the Team Manager kept a hostile environment that made the easy work of the job almost not worth it."
good,"it gave good experience working in ford, good working culture, good atmosphere, compatible timings .learned so many things .good working experience, good technical skills"
good,"Sempre mostrando interesse por seus funcionários, ótimos colegas de trabalho e uma gerência muito qualificada; um ótimo ambiente e um local facilmente acessível. Aprendi muita coisa com o pessoal lá dentro, tive dias complicados, mas sempre pude superar as dificuldades com a ajuda e o ensino de todos os colegas que tive."
good,"Great company to work for, Advancement opportunities and the ability to put your intelligence to work on tasks that needs solved, Excellent pay and benefits including retirement"
good,"Satisfaction de travail"
good,"great pay, mind numing work.it now has a tim hortons in the plant.if you can do the same thing over and over for 10 hours for the rest of your life its the job for you."
good,I lived maybe the happiest years of my professional life at Ford Motor Co. People there is always in good mood (Brazil) and collaborative. The work environment is really good.
good,"* A typical day for me revolved around the prep for the weeks Director meeting"
good,"Uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, o melhor tópico é Equilíbrio entre Trabalho/Vida Pessoal"
good,"I have worked at Ford for 5 years and the work life balance is great when you are not on the road. When one is on the road it can be 24/7 of work or at least feel like it. There is always a high level of stress and working with the Union can have its own obstacles as well. Many of the Ford systems are outdated and difficult to use. "
good,"Todo dia é dia de aprender"
good,Typical day is doing the same thing two times every minute and 30 seconds for ten hours a day. But at the time just out of high school with no 4 year degree counting heath insurance because ford pays for that I was making 72.50 a hour take away the health insurance it was more like 31.50 a hour. Hard work some of it really takes a toll on your body over the years. Pretty night walking in the plant just the size of the place is amazing then to watch a truck start from nothing then about 3 hours later it's actually drive able is neat. By far I would say the pay is the best part of that job hands down.
good,overall this is an ideal place to work if you are into working alone and on the line the hours can be long at times but the pay definately makes up for the hours
good,Overall good place to work.  Just needs to be a hourly shop and not flat rate. Management is great and the employees work well with one another. Would recommend to other people
good,Ford is a nice atmosphere and has a good corporate culture. It is in need of refreshing as the offices have changed since the 1960s. A new campus update is in the works and should help improve the working atmosphere.
good,"Great place to work, good environment, good opportunities for career development."
good,"Diverse company holding all accountable to improve the business. "

good,"Opportunities are provided to work in different areas of the company both on a geographic and functional basis.  Human resource and management practices are very open and fair.  Compensation is competitive, benefits are excellent.  As Ford is a larger public corporation, it can be bureaucratic and cumbersome at times."
good,"i started working for ford as a delivery driver, 6 months later i was promoted to a parts sales man, and it was a blast. I loved all of my coworkers, and enjoyed working for the company."
good,"Ford Motor Company is a great place to work if you enjoy working with people from diverse nationalities and backgrounds. There are many daily challenges and you need to be a self-starter in order to succeed."
good,"You are forced into a very specifific role as with all big companes, pay and benefits are great, company takes care of you, very cyclic nature of work, months of no work and then everything needs to be done yesterday. drawback of the design cycle."
good,.Great place to work and learn new pathways.Relaxed but can be a fast past environment depending on the project.Friendly workplace.  They have great positions to choose from.
good,"Very good work atmosphere and job culture.Focused more on employee learning and development."
good,"Its a very good organisation to start your courrier in sales,here you get the tips and training that how to behave with customers and how to deal with them,its an organization were if u work for a long term period u will get good settled in your life."
good,"Good place to work "
good,"Solid company, but the career can be slow compared to other industries (e.g. consulting, banking). Ideal place for a smart candidate who seeks a good life-work balance, and a stable and predictable work environment."
good,"A good company to work with for everyone!"
good,"Ford is one of the best places to work. They provide good a good environment for you to thrive, a balanced work life and a handsome remuneration. Ford is very process oriented and has a flat organization."
good,Great place to work.Work life balance and people policies are excellent. There are a lot of training opportunities.Good Salary benefits and twice salary Hike in a year.
good,"Ford is a great place to work for employees who want to settle in their career and not have to worry about job security.  This comes at a cost, of course.  Many middle managers and lower level managers are complacent.  Pressure from managers at higher levels is the driving force for vehicle production at this company."
good,Great place to work with great flexibility and people friendly policies. The benefits policy is geared to support the employees with work-life balance
good,"Tendo como atividades: suporte nas áreas de medição, auxílio"
good,"If you work hard it pays off, very demanding and requires alot of common sense and hard work. However will equip you in fantastic ways to be able to move on in your career"

good,"Work started on time, had weekly staff meetings, management was great with communication and listening to concerns or ideas, and management made sure that employees was okay. it was a diverse work place, making sure that parts was corrected and put on corrected was hard, and the pay and hours was great. also being able to take off when needed was enjoyable it kept me wanting to come to work refreshed."
good,"Overall, Ford is a great company to work for, the organization is often very flat, and this is my biggest downfall. I would prefer an organization that encourages upward advancement based on more than years of service. If you've earned more responsibility, promotion, or opportunity it should be awarded."
good,"Ford is an excellent place to work.  Great work/life balance, and good benefits.  However, it can be very difficult to gain promotions, and the cyclical nature of the automotive industry can create some doubts in job security."

good,Excellent place where one can find time to balance their life and career aspirations. Enormous learning through on the job assignments along with adequate internal and external trainings
good,"Advantage Resourcing/Ford Motor Company was a great learning experience.  There is room for advancement, but the day to day can get pretty blurry as it is repetitive work.  Co-workers were phenomenal, and overall management was great, but as with any job there will always be workplace challenges to overcome."
good,"People are friendly and they use advanced equipment's for there automotive parts production. "
good,"un dia tipico en la empresa es llegar a la linea saludar a tus compañeros y agarrar tus herramientas nesesarias para hacer el trabajo. aprendi mucho en uso de herramientas neumaticas y electricas,a manejarse a gran velocidad en la linea pudiendo tener mas vision en el area de trabajo o si era nesesario ayudar a un compañero. la direccion y colegas muy buenos. lo mas dificil era los cambios de puestos pero lo pude llevar adelante con gran desempeño. el ambiente laboral y el comedor.."

good,Uma empresa que possibilita o crescimento do profissional.
good,"No dia a dia ficava a vontade para fazer qualquer tipo de negócio pela transparência que eu tinha com o proprietário, porém ele estava sempre a par das minhas decisões, aprendi a tratar funcionários como funcionários e não como amigos, pelo menos durante o horário comercial porque se não as coisas tomam outro rumo e você não controla mais, a parte mais difícil do trabalho era manter a mesma equipe por muito tempo pois este Shopping não oferecia um giro grande de clientes, mas em contra partida a parte boa era que  quando algum vizinho não tinha o carro para oferecer ao cliente sempre nos indicava e eu fazia o mesmo."
good,"Great leadership and team oriented experience. There is always something new to learn, and it is a very enriching environment."

good,"A typical day at ford. It all depends on assembly line you are working and what type of people you are dealing with on that line. I've learned How to work at a very fast pace. They managers are great, you just have to deal with the right one. I get along with everyone of my co-workers. The hardest part might be standing and bending for a long time. When we have down time meaning (When one off the assembly lines goes down) and we can just sit and do nothing."

Every day can be different when talking about work volume, but that allows you to learn how to deal with certain circumstances. I have learned many different operations with the company from the computer system, to how to operate different machines. Management can be a bit hectic at times, but it's their job to keep the facility running at top performance at all times. There are not many difficulties about the job. If I were to pinpoint one, it would have to be having to deal with the small, minor inconveniences that can occur on a daily basis.

Hardest part of the job is an over-abundance of work, leading to excess stress. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and the things you learn about them."

Böylece şirket, sürdürülebilir bilgi ağını yaratıyor. İş yerinde harika bir arkadaşlık ortamı var. Ekipler arası gelişim yarışı var desem yanlış olmaz.

good,"managrment is so good and helpfull,my work is also very very importent in my department,i have so much learnd from my is company"
good,"Very good relations with co-workers, managers... Relaxed"
good,"No I take my work very serious and make show that my target is met."
good,worked 3 shift swing in maint dept.could be slow or very busy.
good,Need to be able to work fast and efficiently on the line in order to keep the line running smoothly.  The pay reflected the hard work but very repetitive.
good,"Team members are friendly and support each other well. Management does a great job in cascading the vision & mission of the company including organizations business objectives. Workplace culture is full of mutual respects and treat people with dignity. The hardest part of the job is meeting times and keeping the agenda as per plan. Disruptions happen but, things are addresses that takes more time. Teams do other team building events in and out side the departments that are lots of fun. The charitable work done by the teams are also very satisfying."
good,"I can’t complain at all,The job is definitely one that I can take care of my family with. I wouldn’t mind retiring with the company, with all the benefits and the good pay I could never see myself leaving"
good,I am still depressed from not being able to stay at Ford.  I learned so much in just the three short months I was there.  I would go back in a heart beat.
good,Best company to work for .made a lot friends and like to stay in touch all. i was the group leader for 30 person and was controlling and problem or anything group needs BEST WORK
good,Ford is a place you can retire from as long as you don't mind the heat in the summers. Benefits were fantastic and  they offer a good retirement plan.
good,"yes every day new thinging about that job."
good,"I was employed by G4S and had a contract with Ford Motor Company as a Fire Prevention Officer. This was a 12 hour shift days and nights and included daily checks of all fire equipment, issuing hot works permits, liaison with ford management on all safety issues and keeping logs on our daily occurrences via the computer"
good,"Ford motor company is a great company to work for. Working for their franchise on the other hand is a different story. When you start working for their franchise stores, expect to have no life. Because they will work you to the bones or until you break down they have no consciousness of your personal life. They have no care for you. When you’re out the door there’s another person in line and that’s just the way the car business works. If you work for Ford directly then they do have a little more conscience about you and care, your human. Which your body needs rest, needs to be around positive people. And expect you to have a life outside of work. When working for their name distributed dealerships they expect you to work 80 hours a week, not give you any time for yourself or for your family. They don’t care, they treat you like a number."
good,FORD is one of my dream company. I loved to work there.  Fun at work is minimal but we still enjoyed working. Working hours is 10and a half hours which was very tough for a mom like me to maintain work life balance . Employee benefits are minimal.
good,If you have any type of health problems that is not the job for you they don't give you enough breaks. When they call 10.7 hours all they care about is numbers. They unions are really no help
good,"It's not like how we used to be. I was always laid off at least three times per year. The pay is great, but when you know you're about to be laid off you cannot buy that big boat or take that lavish trip that you want to go on. Is a community inside the workplace. My advice to anyone that is applying for this company is to keep to yourself and do your job and be on time like I was told when I first started. Stay in your own lane and don't tell people your business. Don't be afraid to stick up for yourself when need be."
good,Ford is such a great job but was so stressful and busy. People at the job are so judgemental and don’t understand how stressful it is already being there.
good,I worked there for a couple months then it got a little unorganized so I had to leave and now I’m looking for a job with a little more organization and a better work environment.
good,"Ambiente agradável, boa relação com colegas e chefia,empresa estável."
good,"Durante o tempo que trabalhei na empresa, pude ver que não tive oportunidades para conseguir progredir por motivo da crise que o pais enfrenta estava muito otimista em ficar muito tempo, não foi possível pois a empresa quebrou o contrato que era de um ano."
good,High senior employees did not make room for the new hires and made it very difficult to advance.
good,Working on the line in a union environment was a new experience that I did not enjoy.  I felt that laziness was encouraged and that the employees took advantage of overtime.  Seniority date was paramount and held back any opportunity for advancement because work ethic had nothing to do with promotion.
good,I enjoyed working their. But it’s best to not get involved with all of the drama and other non sense that can take place at times in the plant. Go to work do your job and go home. That’s really the best advice I could give anyone seeking a job at Ford Motor Company.It’s a different world with management who only cares about numbers that’s it period. Everything is a fight and struggle to get anyone to listen or even act like the care.

good,"I would come in and make sure all my people had stock to build cars,check all of the tooling and make sure the the line was ready to run. When the line starts I went to every one of my people to see how things were going. I would ask if they had any issues with their job and solve those issues. Ihad to answer call lights and make repairs."
good,You live for the next sale literally.  Your paycheck depends on the next sale! You work 24/7. I learned how to sell ice to an eskimo! Hardest part of the job is finding a new deal. This is high stress sales job! Coworkers will steal deals so they can make their money! Best part of the job is driving all the new vehicles!
good,"If you enjoy being lied to and dismissed as a liar, thief and hegemond then this job is for you.  The benefits are a fantastic amount of pay for a couple of hours of work,  The down side is that you don't do anything of value until you are doing that couple of hours of work.  Mostly, you sit around and leave messages on peoples answering machines or send inane texts to people who only want to know you long enough to take advantage of your good nature."
good,"Go to locker room get coveralls on to start the day. Get headphones ready to start music ready for the day. Ford is a fast paced, co workers are about what they can do for themselves not how they can help you. "
good,I love there cars and the whole history about the company. Mercury and Edsel are companies under Ford of which I admire. There is nothing like fixing an old broken car and putting the pedal to the metal on the freeway. Its definitely instant gratification.

good,"Launching a product on a different continent from the lead engineering office can be difficult. With only 3 hours of workday available for correspondence, communication relying heavily on CAD and voice communication, and long lead times for prototype and tool shipments, the position of a 'single point of contact' on-site integration engineer has its challenges.

Which is a shame"
good,"A empresa e muito boa trabalho, bom salário é pouca estabilidade"
good,"I had been a manager for many years and I just wanted a job without huge responsibilities. What I found was a career and a new way of life. Working in car sales can seem scary especially when you consider that most pay 100% commission. Most people want to work for an hourly rate. I was one of those people but I took a chance since they told me that at the very least I would make minimum wage, I never made a minimum wage.  Month one I took home a $4,000 paycheck, that was the smallest check I ever made. I never had to worry about my check, all I had to do was show people how cool and reliable FORD trucks are.

good,It's an ok place to work. Money makes it better. Corporate policy to hire foremen/women with degrees. It's ok in production but causes problems with trades/maintenance.

My least favorite part, would be dealing with customers who have poor attitudes and/or entitlement issues.

Our service department is a close-knit family, and we are becoming even more of a family all across the dealership."

You put the same part on the same engines day in and day out but the money was good and the camaraderie on the engine line was great and made the day pass by quickly. I learned how to put a car engine together from the block up. It enabled me to fix my own vehicles. Management on the whole were a bunch of back stabbing low lifes. You had to watch your back around them. "
good,"Trabalho sempre muito agradável, que nos dava oportunidades de aprender coisas novas a cada dia , a direção sempre procurou tumultuar o trabalho,não sabendo separar o lado pessoal do lado profissional e com isso causava desentendimento entre os funcionários e os encarregados, fazendo com que o clima do ambiente ficasse pesado e os colegas sempre prontos para ajudar a realizar as atividades diárias, e o trabalho num contexto geral é muito agradável de se fazer."

good,"The culture at Ford has really opened up over the past several years,  It is a much more respectful, casual environment.  People at Ford are highly talented and well paid but you must deliver.  The hardest part about working at Ford is that it is still very political.  Now, with that said, it is significantly better than when i started at Ford but they still have work to do.  additionally, I believe that there are still too many meetings and required paper word and presentations.  I realize that there is still a need for it but would like to see a culture where people take a calculated risk from time to time vs. talking and meeting about it."

good,Very conservative. Resistant to change. Management objective is to keep head above water. Too many Business processes which do not provide value. Money and time wasted. Unwilling to innovate. Other than that it is great place to work. Friendly management.
good,People are the best part of the company. The family concept exists but it is a corporation. The work allows you to grow but always be careful with protocol and bringing up ideas at the right time and to who.

I have acquired a lot of sense of responsibility and work in team. The management was generally really good, with a nice treat toward the employees. Of course there have been some negative exceptions. The hardest part was the heavy machinery handling, in some cases it was unhealthy. Since I was young and in good shape, really heavy and repetitive duties were assigned to me from the first day. On the good side, I had a lot of benefits, such as free lunch, a decent salary, and health care and medical services. A lot of prizes were given as well like a retribution for my punctuality and perfect attendance."

good,Foi a minha primeira experiência de trabalho. Ate o momento foi a melhor empresa onde trabalhei.
good,"After 20 years it's difficult to define a typical day at work, but here's a quick glimpse. I might spend part of a day in a cross functional team meeting to determine which parts will meet timing for durability or corrosion tests and the rest of the day making sure that it happens. Some days were spent trying to find a durability vehicle that may have been down for one reason or another and to find out if we could install a part before the vehicle ran again. Another day might be spent meeting with the homologation engineer trying to understand how a Korean performance test procedure applies to a high performance American vehicle which Ford planned to export. Several days were spent in a high performance driving class with a Roush Mustang, Mercedes Benz, Ford Focus with electric steering, etc. Other days were spent going through the design and release procedure for wheels and wheel ornamentation. Often I'd spend days reviewing warranty information or meeting with the part supplier to determine fault. I've spent days scheduling vehicles and parts for MCR (material cost reduction) trials. The list of a typical day could go on and on."
good,Learned to work at a fast pace. I learned to problem solve. I like knowing I had a set schedule.
good,"A typical day for me at FMCC was no different than being home. They were like family there. I learned many things with work and life that will always be with me. Management was good, they treated us well. We had fun while we worked. The coworkers were helpful to one another and we all got along. The hardest part of my job was having to part with the company in 2007 after 9 years of dedication, because the company relocated to other parts of the world. I thought I would have been with the company the rest of my life. They moved to several parts of the world, like Nashville, TN, Tampa FL., Greensville, GA, & Irving,TX. I would have loved to go to Nashville, TN, but I was offered Tampa, FL. instead. I would have taken it if it werent for the bad hurricanes always threatening Fl. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work I did, and friends I made that are still part of my life. If FMCC came back here, I would apply again in a heart beat."
good,Loved this job and had I not had to relocate back to NC I would have stayed with Ford Motor Co.
good,"Picking part for different companies, mostly work by myself, really wasnt no hard part or easy part, really easy job"
good,"The task was simple. The line started at and certain time and stopped periodically according to mistakes to be fixed, lunch or clock out. I learned the value of hard work thanks to the management team as well as my co-workers. There was no hard part to the job in my mind, I just got it done. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work. If I succeed, we all succeed."
