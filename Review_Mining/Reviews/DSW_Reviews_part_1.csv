rating,review
bad,"The management was a total joke, made a couple dollars above minimum wage in exchange for an absolutely crushing workload. The managers are stressed and the company treats them like dirt"
bad,"It was a very non inclusive work environment.  It was favorites are promoted and the worker bees ignored to keep them in their places."
bad,"Typical day at work: Come in and get belittled by management as well as customers (Since Day 1)."
bad,there where the managerial staff that would do nothing to help you and are always changing the schedule and putting you to work the days that you are in school even when you give a set schedule.
bad,very overwhelming. regional directors are clueless and turnover is really high for upper management. pay isn't ideal and management as a whole doesn't really work together.
bad,"Poor management contributes to terrible store culture. Manager leaves store to interview with other companies. Manager does not keep store up to safety standards. Manager ignores/covers up"
bad,"When working here managers were constantly late, I worked opening shift meaning I couldn't get into the building, and when late would yell at me and my co-worker for being behind schedule. Schedule was made 3 weeks in advance but had the possibility to change 4 hours before your shift was supposed to start. went two weeks without having a single shift when I was scheduled all week when the schedule was made. Terrible workplace."
bad,"The expectations are immense and head office throws more on as the day goes, so you can never get it all done.. customer service is not the priority even though that’s what the preach. Upper management expectations are unrealistic, but they get a huge bonus and you don’t.. they only care about hitting targets and you as an employee do not matter"
bad,"I was hired as a store manager for this company. My training was pathetic, the first week was a bit of product knowledge, and store routines, the second week I was used as a cashier so the  ""training manager"" could work on her snake flow.  I was then placed in my store while the existing store manager was still there, and bitter to be leaving, so that was very uncomfortable.  I then took over this completely broken store. I had to hire all new staff, so at that point everyone in the store was brand new, during their busiest time of the year. The DM was pretty new, very disingenuous, and either had no idea about the condition of the store or was dishonest about it when she hired me. At first she said that we just needed to get through bts and then we would worry about getting the store cleaned up and the standards in place, but then she found out that there would be a corporate visit. Two weeks into my time in the store she told me that I had to have the entire store 95% cleaned up and all standards in place by her visit the following week. We did try, but with it being back to school, everytime we would get a section completed it would get completely destroyed again, and with all new staff, they were not trained on the standards, because there wasn't time to do so. There was also a huge focus on the rewards program, the expectation was 70% and anytime it would drop I would be told that I needed to take over on cash to get the score back up,  so with that said, it is impossible to clean up a store from the cash desk. I was let go exactly one month after taking over the store,"
bad,"very bad place to be there, bylling is real there, brainwash is there as well, management is a so bad to you and very good to themselfs, you have been treated as a slave in DSW EVERY DAY"
bad,overworked and underappreciated. I was a college student while also working and I would get off close to midnight and then have an 8 am the next day. The managers did not communicate well about the schedule.
bad,This is a ok job for a younger person part time to make some cash and gain some work experience in slow motion environment it can be good retail experience.
bad,Horrible place to work.  You will barely get any training and they expect you to know what you are doing after 1 week of self learning.   HR and the District managers are all  corrupted and most of them are from Townshoes which is no longer here and you wonder why.  They won't support you in anyway what so ever.  They will just blame everything on you even when you ask them for help or advice.  This job is good for people who just wants the 30% off shoe and don't care about working only 3 hours a week.
bad,"The managers were very rude and unhelpful. Barely received enough training to handle the register. Manager was too busy on their personal phone to help out when needed. Store manager even yelled at me in front of a customer. Never felt so disrespected in my life. Very unprofessional, would not recommend working here. Also I’ll add I had open availability all day all week and only worked 4hrs a week."
bad,"The only good thing about this job is interacting with your co workers and customers. They work you extremely hard with little hours and barely any breaks. Restrooms are filthy and they're to cheap to hire a cleaning company, so they ask the employees to clean it."
bad,"The Kendall Gate store is the WORST store to ever work at. The manager is the rudest, most condescending and inconsiderate person I have ever come across. They have unrealistic expectations and boss you around like a slave. If you’re confused because they don’t give clear instructions, the manger will talk to you like you’re an idiot in front of the other employees. The assistant managers are also clueless and inconsiderate and have poor communication skills. This company doesn’t care about their employees at all. Working here was the most awful time of my life. The only pro was being able to call out without any consequences because the managers are just THAT dumb and permissive & the 30% discount."
bad,"Job was stressful other employees just screamed and talked to each other instead of helping customers on the phone, Could never get ahold of a manager for help or questions just was not a good place to work."
bad,"They only allow certain people on cash. While others hustle all day cleaning up the aisles. They don't know how to divide the work fairly. So many people come into the store look at shoes, but not all of them buy shoes.  People in the aisles are constantly working and people in cash are just standing waiting for customers. And, its all about kissing up to your managers to get more hours. Before I would get 30+ hours a week, later I would get 3 hours a week. I don't know how it is there now (hopefully better) but when I worked there, it was awful. My coworkers were nice though, management was a joke."
bad,welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur nk
bad,"No one listens to associates in the front line "
bad,"The company does not care about the needs of the employees. After working there there is barely any raise. You can make more working anywhere. They use dayforce to track shifts which is nice but they never look to see if anyone requested days off, so it makes it difficult to take days off for important matters."
bad,"The store manager at the Cumming, GA, location was unimaginably crass and unprofessional. She was ultimately the reason I left DSW. She would always belittle my immediate boss (the Warehouse lead). And when she started thinking that I was giving less than 100%, that's when I said adios! And on top of that, the pay was dreadfully low, and my hours would end up being cut far too often and drastically just to look good for corporate. Ugh! Thank goodness I left!"
bad,This is a terrible company to work for. The management is completely unorganized. The workplace culture is filled with extreme amounts of stress due to the lack of support from the company. The customers are extremely rude and verbally assault employees daily. The best part of the job was getting paid on a day off.
bad,"Your typical retail, customer service job. They really drive their free membership program, and associates are punished if they are unable to get customers to sign up. Managers have no concept of work-life balance for their student employees."
bad,"There is no advancement. The only thing this company is good for is the discount. i would only work here if you're 17, 19, 20, 21 and in college. do not work here if you have family,"
bad,"If only this company cared for their employees as much as they did the customers. Terrible management causing everything else to fall apart in the store. "
bad,"this was not a good job. my least favorite. not a good environment, too fast-paced with no structure. did not feel like the company cared about its employees."
bad,"The minute you walked in to work you would be getting yelled at about what was going wrong e.g SLR, conversion majority of the issues were out of our control. We would have to nag customers even when they did not want our help. Management was unprofessional. Bad mouthed the sales associate on the floor where the shoelovers could hear. Usual day would be associates on the floor alone while the managers went on a 1 hour smoke break or both managers would go on their break together. For them to come back yell at us that the floor was not handled properly. If we were supposed to work both manager and sales associate they should have payed me for both."
bad,"it was welcoming,  nice co workers,  organized sometimes ,barely any shifts, bad training , undetailed training , bad scheduling , bad shift times, no notice"
bad,"this was a terrible job. I was constantly pushed into customers faces even if they had already said they didn't need any help. I learned the do's and don'ts of proper customer service. Management was absolutely terrible, intact the hardest part of the job was getting yelled at for no reason about 5 times in 1 shift. The most enjoyable part was leaving work everyday."
bad,"Retail requires way too much, first of all. The only thing I really liked about working at DSW is the massive floor space. I stayed slim and trim working there."
bad,"Helped open a new location a year ago, and it was one of the worst work experiences i've ever had!"
bad,"working with a whole group of dominant females when i am a dominant female was not a great idea, rude management, rude employees, and stupid rules to follow."
bad,I would compare working at DSW to being in high school. The manager had a small group of employees that were her favorite and she would assign hours and shifts according to her preference.
bad,"I don't even think they care much about customer service because they're too busy pressuring us 24/7 to sign people up for rewards membership. Honestly if you ask me, that's enough to drive one person crazy and completely never come back to work here. Management is poor, we're constantly getting new managers so it's hard to get to know them as a person, and the work hours are horrible. If you care about your personal life, do not work here. Only reason I would recommend working here is for the 30% discount, other than that please look the other way."
bad,Assist customer's on finding the right shoe for that certain occasion and helping them purchase it. Greet customer's call other stores if we didn't have their size or the shoe they were looking for
bad,Management is horrible managers don't want to work. They changed the discount back in may 2017 we used to get our discount off sale items but we don't anymore.
bad,Worst Job Ever the manager was the worst and the fact that I was a minor at the time they would want me to stay past 1 am to work although they knew that it was not legal to do so.
bad,"Not a very good company to work for.  Management does not care about the employees.  The majority of the employees are 18-25 so you know what the atmosphere is.  The DM's are lazy and only give the best hours to the employees that they like.  Poor training, poor pay."
bad,"The managers at my location were incompetent and rude. They never properly changed associates so a lot of them would do the job incorrectly. As an associate you had to do everything even clean bathrooms. They expected  too much for such low pay. Managers did not communicate, and had poor management skills."
bad,I worked at the Richmond Bc location they opened recently and it was the most terrible place I ever worked for. I applied here thinking it was going to be a good place to work cause the dsw stores in states seemed pretty awesome but I regretted working here ever since i started.  Everyday coming to work was horrendous the managers were rude and dumb. The atmosphere was awful just waited till when my shift was over every time i came in for work. Half the ppl that joined this location left cause of the management there was awful. Idk about any other dsw stores but this richmond location was a nightmare.
bad,"I will never work for this company ever again. management is poor, training is poor, treatment is poor, and the breaks are only 15 minutes. There is everyday micromanagement and the managers do not do their jobs."
bad,Was one of the worst job ever they only kept me for a couple of days and let me go because of family emergency wouldn't recommend this job to anyone..
bad,This is the worst job I have ever had. Zero practical training and no consistency in management and expectations. I would not recommend this company to anyone
bad,"I have worked here loyally for 4 years. I have been full-time, part-time, and an assistant manager.  This place used to be fantastic to work! Loved it and the people.  We have went corporate over the last few years and all of the benefits the sales associates received were taken away- to fund a trip for head office.  They will ABSOLUTELY not work around another job and will either force you to leave your other employment or to leave them.  Management is extremely disorganized and you will never be appreciated for the work you put in.  This was a hard job to leave since I was there for so long and the time I had beforehand was great but the company no longer cares about their associates and they make that very clear."
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for.  The managers and upper management are more concerned with furthering there careers and pleasing a bully."
bad,Was not a good place to work. Management was very careless and did not like to address issues. Only there for some part time work during school. Would not recommend.
bad,managers are awful and treat staff as little ants. Very condescending and rude. Customers are sometimes too demanding. The hours were long and it's a lot of labour. Head office is extremely demanding and would never work here again.
bad,Managers do not adhere to their staffs needs or have any regard for the wellbeing of their staff if it does not benefit themselves. They are not willing to work with a staff member regarding advancement or transfer throughout the company. As a staff member I was treated very poorly and unfairly by new management due to oversized egos.
bad,"Hardly any hours unless your management,  you stand around and hope for customers, your forced to sign people up for rewards even if the customer says no, your told no eye contact just get their info! Worst customer service ever!!!"
bad,They dont pay you for your ability its about  favorites in the company the change policys to not pay you. The discount sucks. no incentives. no peps just stress no advancement
bad,Work life balance needs improvement. Hours terrible and job expectations are too much for little opportunity for advancement.  This company is experiencing too many changes too quickly.
bad,"Everything about that job was bad.. Employees,  management, the job itself just everything I would never go back to that company. I also would not at all recommend to anyone to work there at all"
bad,"The work was very monotonous. The management was not supportive of their employees, and there are not many opportunities for advancement."
bad,A typical day at work was walking around picking up trash from the aisles or putting back boxes left on the ground. The management was quite horrible and unreliable. The only enjoyable part were my coworkers.
bad,"I applied for this job because I was a long time ""shoe lover"" shopper at dsw and thought it'd be nice to work for a company I loved and loved to shop at. Had I known how terribly they treated their employees I would have never shopped with them as long as I did (since working there I no longer will shop there). On my interview I was not told I would be their cleaning crew including vacuuming the whole store, dusting, mopping, window cleaning, bathroom cleaning ( with as large of a corporation they are can't they afford a cleaning crew to do a thorough cleaning of the store?). I was also not told I'd be lifting 50lb boxes of shoes to be stocked at 6am. Management was horrible always cut your hours, changed your schedule last minute with less than 24 hour notice and sometimes no notice at all. A lot of times worked double shifts for employees who did not show up for work and not given breaks for lunch. Bathrooms were broken and backed up with raw sewage settlement for a week and a half and we were told to use the bathrooms from another retail store next door. I am a employee who likes to stay with a company for awhile and when asked by district manager how long I've worked there I told her 6 months she sounded ecstatic and said oh! You've been here forever! I was so shocked by this response, but after workig there for 6 months I can see why people don't stay much longer than that. Very high turn over of employees."
bad,very unprofessional management. made it very uncomfortable to work with managers. would take about and do things that were no where work related. i would not return to wrok for this company
bad,"Different expectations for different employees, in other words management didn't hold everyone accountable for the same standards. Management always gossiping. GM always late, also very passive agressive. They also have you almost harassing customers when they enter the store, when they enforce customer service. I had an experience where all of the managers were up front and greeted the customer and made me go customer service him right after and he was irritated and asked if he could just shop? There was always so much drama going on, by the end of my year and half there I dreaded going in to work."
bad,"TERRIBLE. You never get any hours, literally the only thing good about working there is the discount. Avoid this like the plague is if you want a job where you actually make money!!"
bad,"•	customer service, selling, up selling"
bad,"I recently worked there and it was the worst experience ever. The management was rude and didn't care about what you were going through. The pay on the other half was great. Lots of favoritism. Horrible when it comes to training people. They expect you to watch a video and have everything in your mind and ready to work the next day. Very forcing to get ""Rewards"". If you don't, management ""bans"" you from the register. They need to have Corporate come out and see hows this place is ran. Lets send in some secret shoppers."
bad,"If you are looking for a low company to work for. DSW would be it !  I contributed ten years of hard work into this company, worked on their projects out of town and even out of state. Until recently new management came in, decided to pick out my flaws ( like is that even work related) also tried to tell me I wasn't doing my job right. So your telling me I was trained wrong ? Then basically its your own Companys fault. Lord knows if the Manager even knew what they were doing. They sit on their butts expecting you to get the job done.  The district manager basically smooching up to the managers butt. Bet to trade places these ""managers"" I talk of wouldn't be able to do half of what I did for that place. I  had quit my job with them. At the end, the hard work i put in was never taken in for consideration, instead they wanted to lower my pay. What a joke ! They don't care, these are people who sit on their butts and do nothing but tell you you're doing it wrong when you're the ONLY one doing all the work !"
bad,Company Values are not up help especially by upper management.  However discount is fantastic. Benefits are great. Excellent shoe selection.
bad,Worst company to work for. It is all driven by women. The managers are not open and can do things that you never expect. Management is poor. There is no work/ life balance. People are really unfriendly.
bad,"I was told they would keep you after the Holidays as long as your calls was 75% or higher mine was 100%  and never missed a day my whole 90 days  ..... they hired so many people they had to send people home to make room so the 2nd shift had a desk to sit at  you only got one week of training then was put on phones and was told to put on hold and raise hand if you needed help! there systems were  set up to make you fail or make  the customers mad to where they was yelling and screaming and managers said  to just give 10.00 off and that would calm them down !!  also the managers would interrupt your calls if they walked by and over heard  you and they thought you needed help!  no other call center would  interrupt your calls !!"
bad,"I would never recommend this company to anyone. I had the worst experience of my life. I was with this company for a year and over time, I only grew to resent this company. "
bad,"Hated it! Poor management, unorganized and no one to speak to at head office. Had to hound them for about a year to get my benefits set up, they missed pay days for the entire company (canada wide... one of which was boxing day) pay you very little. too much stress, not nearly worth it"
bad,"GM for DSW (Townshoes). Head office likes to call itself.. Support Office. There is 0 support from them to the stores. They say they want your opinion to grow the company, however if you give feedback that is true but upsets head office.. Be careful! There will be retribution from them."
bad,"Please do not go by the positive reviews of this Company. The positive reviews are coming from the higher management or mid level management that get pad very well. They are giving you bells and whistles that are all lies. This is by far the worst Company to ever work for and I will tell you why. Like one of the other reports stated that 90% of the time you are trying to get people to sign up for the DSW rewards membership. You get no commission for it and are among your colleagues to challenge each other like a race or something because your names are on the board. They want every employee to haggle customers and force them to sign up. Second, you are to organize the shoes, put shoes back and sign up rewards. This is only a part time position. Only supervisors and managers get full time. The turnover rate is extremely high. They work you to death. This is a good wok out if anybody want to lose weight because you're always moving which is not a bad thing, but you have to deal with helping customers, moving the hotel looking dolly, moving boxes, shifting shoe boxes around etc. Discount is great on the shoes but forget about benefits and full time work. This is the worst company to ever work for. All they care about is their stock market and how much revenue they can make."
bad,"Clock in"
bad,"Terrible training program, no advancement available. There was supposed to be a 3 week training program for store managers, but they try to shorten it to get you into the store. There is a huge management turnover due to lack of training and development from upper management. Very political Company that plays favorites. They do not like to hire minorities and they have no life/work balance,"
bad,"terrible its like working at a high school, i was given a position with no training. we would get a escalated call and would get a sup and they would just tell us to take care of it"
bad,"Town Shoes has a very HIGH turn over rate. They are always hiring."
bad,Catering to the public by helping them find shoes that best fit their needs. Receive incentives for signing them up for email coupons.
bad,there was no discipline and authority in the store.. managers had less of a clue of what to do then the staff did..
bad,"It's just like high school management, upper management and district manager its all about who your supposedly friends are or you will never move up. Shoplifting happens all the time with no support from DSW to stop it .  They don't support creativity, or change. There is such pressure to enroll customers into the rewords program."
bad,Wasted more than 5 years of my life in this dead end job. The quality of the work atmosphere is horrible. The pay is dreadful and just not worth the terrible abuse from the management team. Perfect job for a college kid with no bills to pay. The discount isnt worth it since the merchandise is damaged and stuff that's defected.
bad,Lack of advancement opportunities. You will not succeed within this company without being there for many years. The management team is old and needs to be replaced due to being inclusive and unprofessional.
bad,Hard to get a promotion. The management is run by an old team that isn't going anywhere. Hardest part of the job going in for shifts. Most enjoyable leaving!
bad,"Micro managed to a tee, ridiculous script and processes to ensure customers are ""delighted"". Customers sometimes take advantage and walk all over you. The company does not care about their employees and do the absolute bare minimum for them. "
bad,"A typical Day at DSW for me is usually a eight hour shift. I learned to have lots of patients working at DSW.  For the most part there are pretty good mangers. I think I have one of the best store mangers. The hardest part of my day is when the store is slow, I like to have a steady flow of traffic in the store. The most enjoyable part of day Is when I assist a customer and I find them a beautiful shoe that they are going love."
bad,"DO NOT WORK HERE!!!"
bad,This is a horrible company to work for. Management does not treat their employees right. The other girl who meantioned that bullying goes on is completely righ. Everything started well and then it deteriorated.
bad,DSW can not manage friendship relationships and a managerial relationship. They seem to have difficulty separating the two.
bad,I would assist customers that needed help finding shoes. I was also responsible for making sure the isles were clean merchandise was always stocked and always looking to help any customers in any way.
bad,The compant taught good work ethics and it was the easiest job for my first job
bad,"I literally walked off this job!!!!!!!  I have never done that! The customers are rude, The management  staff has no respect for the associates, or customers. They hire a lot of people & barely have enough hours for the associates they already have! You  this job was will drive all the way to work & when you get there they will tell you its too slow & they don't have enough hours & they will send you back home. Most of my co- workers were nice, but the management is a bunch of backstabbers. The only thing I enjoyed about this job was the discount! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!!!"
bad,First off the Store Managers in Chicago South District are all thieves and cheats. I know way to much about most of them and I'm sure I could take them down.
bad,Worst place to work. Managers are corrupt and get away with EVERYTHING. They do not value their employes what so ever. Way to much Drama from everyother store within the district. For one stores in Chicago South are at the top of the list for corrupt Store Managers. DON'T WORK for DSW in Chicago area at all...
bad,This is a bunch of fake people preaching values and behaviors. Most of the managers are as fake as they come. We can't have phones but 2 managers have there husbands or wives call all the time. We know because we have caller id. They tell us to not talk then they stand and talk for like 30 minutes. Fake a&s people who talk about being real but ain't nothing but fake
bad,Worst place to work. Managers are corrupt and get away with EVERYTHING. They do not value their employes what so ever.
bad,"I worked for a few months. The Store Manager was lazy and way too pushy unlike anyone else I know. Too much drama as its all female workers that stinks. If you are looking don't look here hours are given low and pay stinks. As a sales associate you have to work on register, clean up after peoples mess of shoes thats a pain. On top of that push out freight and fix shoes on the floor that’s pain as customers mess it up by the minute. Too much labor for low pay and lazy managers. My store manager was always in the office 90% of the time and everyone talks about that in our store. Don't work here please. I just left this job within a week ago because I couldn't take it anymore."
bad,aced my interview got the job and had orientation. trying to get my schedule was absolutely impossible.
bad,I disliked working at DSW shoes. The managers were not friendly at all. They would not give you any hours to work and the only days you would work they would send you home early.
bad,Store Manager does whatever she likes.  Spends most of her time in the office and radios to make sure us associates are doing our jobs.  She bad mouths other employees to us to make herself look better.  Little to no training and then complains we don’t know what we are doing.  Barrie location - not the best.
bad,"I worked at the shoe company for about 5 months. I was very excited to start my first part time job. my first shift was simple, do some work in the over stock and clean up. After my first shift i didnt work for another month. I signed a contract on the day of my first shift saying that i would need to work at least 15 hours a week including a weekend shift. During my time at the shoe company i never got 15 hours a week but i did work on sundays. I always went in to work if the manager called me to see if I was available and i always was. The one time i got called in to work a 4.5 hour shift and i said yes... they didnt pay me for that shift. The managers are the worst part about the job, they're unprofessional slobs. The back room is disgusting and filled with garbage to the point where you have to walk sideways. It smells horrible too!!!!! They started taking shifts away from me and only giving me the '' on call'' shifts, it was very rare that i went in to work and they needed me. Then i noticed i was no longer on the schedule. i waited a month and a half to see if I was getting a shift but nope. One of my friends who work there told me one day after his shift that they let me go. How can you fire someone and not tell them. That manager deserves to be fired, I also never did anything for her to fire me. And the same day i found out that i got fired... i found out they hired an old friend of mine who is an idiot while he works and doesn't care. I think they should get new managers who are actually qualified for that position."
bad,"I felt as though I should have made more as a supervisor at this company. I was constantly working by myself, or with one staff member who was between 14-17 years old. Management was catty and mean to all associates, and there was no proper training procedures."
bad,"I’ve started working there since August, some people in the work place are nice but the managers treated me very poorly and don’t really care on how good of a worker I am.  2 weeks after the beginning of October, they secretly kicked me off of the team and they deleted my Dayforce user account and I can NO LONGER view my hours."
bad,"The current Store Manager was rotated into this store as a favor by the District Manager, not because of her leadership ability. She is best friends with the current District Manager which means everything that goes wrong due to her incompetence is blamed on the part-timers. Worked as the Freight Team Lead, long hours with little to no help. Was once told to ""come in earlier"" when I asked for more assistance with freight."
bad,"Do yourself a favor and just don’t apply there. On your first day they will give you an iPad and send you to the break room where you will train your ownself for 4 hours straight and the next day you are thrown on the floor with no knowledge of anything but locating a shoe box. No info on signing people up for rewards, no cash register, NOTHING. Managers expect you to do everything while they stand there and stare at you from far when you ask for help on the walkie. Basically  its a stressful job because you have to bend a lot and walk around the store 400 times to put away a shoe box. This job isnt gonna pay your bills trust me. Find a BETTER job than this."
bad,The reward program is required if you work here and you are unable to get or use any of the rewards that come with it. The only rewards we can really use is the ones that we earn. Which does not help considering that the store never has any good shoes.
bad,"I felt like I was lied to when I got hired, my manager told me I would be doing stock but somehow I got stuck being a cashier. Managers would talk down on you and they put all the workload on you and just stand in the middle of the store gossiping or on their phone. Nobody seemed to know what they were doing half the time. Another thing about DSW is their stupid VIP program and you have to ask every single customer if they are a member and if their not you have to harass them about joining. You can never get a no and if you do...you have to announce it to everybody.  I've never felt so worn out in my life with only 3 weeks of working their. NEVER AGAIN.... be warned its the most horrible place to work at."
bad,"Don't even apply.. it's not worth the hassle. You start out with lots of hours and then they gut them to maybe 8 hours two 4 hour shifts. They only good benefit was the shoe discount.. otherwise it's not a great place to work, their training video ""company work ethic and atmosphere"" is total BS."
bad,"Too many issues to deal with, poor infrastructure (focus groups voted worst e-commerce website), poor marketing campaigns, not enough GWP items available, too many shipping issues (management aware but they just shrug their shoulders), software programs timeout too frequently while IT team stands around not fixing problems, training inconsistencies so almost every CSR does their own thing..seems to be no defined way to do anything.  The Quality Assurance team is an absolute joke. I won't even start down that rabbit hole."
bad,overall management for this company does not care about their employees as well as they are very unprofessional. work is often left for associates to do by themselves while the manager is using work hours to complete personal errands. there is nothing enjoyable about this job.
bad,"hours are very very limited. not many hours at all, they scheduled very poorly. under staffed like mad and have favorites. it doesnt make it easy to work when you are the only one working while all the managers and the favored employees are in the office just hanging out."
bad,"Not the best job i worked at, management wasn't good, they had unreal expectations when it came to stocking and rearranging shoes. The enjoyable part of the job would be the other employees."
bad,"Fast paced "
bad,"Sales associate are poorly compensated. Sales Associates are lucky if they receive 10-12 hour work schedules, and if business slows a Manager may call and cut your shift 1-2 times per week. Zero incentives for hard work, other than their ridiculous bravo awards that Managers hand out to associates and post on a wall in the break rooms. Sales associates are lucky if they receive a 15-20 cent hourly raise each year. Managers will write up associates for the smallest of infractions such as neglecting to remove an ink-tag from a customers purchased item. Receive 1 point per write-up, 7 points in a calender year and you'll likely have your employment terminated. Sick days, excused or unexcused, qualify for 1 point, more than 5 minutes late for shift, receive 1/2 point. Associates are rarely promoted into management. I was once told by a Manager that if an employee wasn't hired as a Manager, then that employee should not be a Manager."
bad,"Poor upper management. Little staffing in the store. Corporate had unrealistic expectations of unloading a truck and getting all product on the floor with minimal labor. Poor pay and lack of hours for the team members meant constant turnover and call outs. "
bad,"Very good when I started working there. Lots of everyday theft.. suprise meetings with head office. Rude customers, overall a fun job but not worth it at all."
bad,"Poor upper management. Very high expectations for the tasks at hand with the massive payroll cuts. My store was cut hard, despite being one of the highest volume stores in BC. Challenging  to keep up to the enormous shipments, promo changes every weekend, tagging, merchandizing, condensing, web orders, etc .. Despite everyone being completely burnt out... Despite the unrealistic sales targets, if you don't make target, your store will be cut hours the following week. Which creates MORE stress for everyone in the store. Part timers leaving because they cant get hours, and management burning out due to lack of payroll hours and increased workload."
bad,this job is a down grade from all of my other jobs the pay sucks for all the work that i do alone the team is no on the same page at this job i only stay here until i get a better job offer
bad,This is probably the worst way I have work in the past 20 years of retail.   Favoritism and nepotism you name it the disrespect was blatant and the workload ridiculous.   The money and benefits were comparable with other companies but there was no compassion or empathy at the higher management level .   They used fear and intimidation and threats instead of motivation and teaching.   Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,I repeat do not apply here . Management lacks communication . They never know what they're doing.  You tell them one thing then when you remind them they say i forgot will get back to you .
bad,"You are hired as an assistant manager but you have no say in conference calls or any aspect of the work environment "
bad,Management was not understanding at all and very cut throat. Hours were not given fairly and management was rude and sarcastic when it came to questions being asked or asked to reschedule a shift.
bad,"horrible district manager. manager had no backbone. could be the hardest worker and would still make it seem like you do absolutely nothing. no respect and appreciation. complain about your work but wouldn’t offer proper training. district and above fed on your fear. uncleanliness store, always looked like garbage."
bad,When you have a manger that's literally forcing out who she cant stand and shows that shes power hungry doesnt make for the family environment your always promised in the beginning.
bad,"Worked not even a month and ended up quitting . Some Management was rude , mean, co workers same thing. Pay was extremely low, discount sucked. Managers tried to get me not to take my breaks... also would embarrass you and check you for stealing in front of customers at the store. Would only check certain employees. Worst job / management I’ve ever worked with. On top of that, had to come in extremely early for shipment. They also had you ship out shoes like you were the shipping / handling department. That’s not what I signed up for. Awful place. Avoid. I will no longer shop here because of their discrimination."
bad,"Despite the amount of work in location that I worked at, it was bearable since I worked with some nice people (except the manager). Perhaps, not every location was like this, but I just did not have a good experience working here."
bad,"4 hours on your feet, in fashionable but uncomfortable shoes, on a cement floor with thin carpet. Sales associates are expected to clean toilets, mop floors. They are also expected a minimum number of rewards members to sign up per shift regardless of customer reluctance to do so. Could not get more hours, because company does not want to pay for 15 minute breaks."
bad,"i enjoyed my experience with the customers and would recommend to someone looking for a casual job. When i was hired i said yes because i was told i would be getting 10-20 hours minimum. i worked there for 7 months and only once did i get a work week over 10 hours. the manager was not someone i felt comfortable with. When i explained my situation and how i needed the extra hours she explained that the store was not in a position to give me more than 5 a week, but then proceeded to  hire more staff. Overall this company would have been a lot more enjoyable if my manager was not like this."
bad,horrible attitude towards part-time and full-time employee's. Management was not understanding of the staff's needs and ignored multiple cries for improvement of the work environment.
bad,"Retail is a terribly hard business to work in. Policies and procedures are constantly changing.You will be held accountable for things beyond your control. Management will not stick up for you even if a customer is swearing at you. Thefts occur and you will get in trouble because you did not see it it a huge store with not enough people on the floor. You are like a maid service for them constantly cleaning for 2 hours after the store closes and treated like slave when doing the truck, it is a back breaking job."
bad,"Disrespected by buying teams and management, too much gossip and favoritism. Highest turnover I have ever seen. I was so miserable working there."
bad,WORST PLACE TO WORK! I would rather work at a fast food place then here. They force you to try to force people to sign up for rewards. They literally make you hound the customers down. If you are looking around for to long they make you follow the customers because they think you are stealing.And they check all of your belongings to make sure you are not stealing. Management is horrible. You tell them your problems and they make it like it is all your fault. They are all backstabbers trying to work they way to the top. They give part timer almost 36 hours a week but no benefits!!! During my time working there I seen more people quit then I seen at any other job I was at. If you don't HAVE to work here DONT!!!!!!!!!
bad,"My location in the Prestonwood Center has terrible management that is always trying to break labor laws by making us work longer then 5 hrs before even thinking about taking a lunch. The GM is always changing hours around in Dayforce. Serious lack of communication between upper management and associates. The company quotes that they are suppose to be America's Favorite Place To Work, but do nothing to back this statement up."
bad,Management has you hound on costumers asking them 4-5 times if they need help when they say no each time. Costumers get irritated and walk out. Break schedule sucks because its bare minimum they want to give you. Never had a worse job. Only pro was the 30% off discount on everything
bad,"This is by far the worst company i have every worked for. The work life balance is non existent- you could be in the hospital and your boss will still call you. Managers are expected to get a district managers approval when hiring full timers- clearly we are all incompetent ;).  District managers only concentrate on negative- there is no co-develpoment on how to improve. Rules are made up by DMs as they go. You cannot win with this company."
bad,"The only positive aspect of my particular DSW store was the discount.  This review isn't for all the stores as I know for a fact other local stores were completely different. "
bad,"DSW boasts that they strive to create a culture centered around 4 core values: passion, accountability, collaboration and humility. While store associates are coached and motivated to uphold these values, higher level management consistently lacks all 4. Coaching and communication is very limited, which paired with unrealistic expectations makes DSW a miserable place to work. Management tactics include minimal training and development, preferential treatment based on personal relationships outside of the work place, lack of confidentiality, and accusatory and demeaning coaching. "
bad,It was a very bad environment for me and others. I like working I love driving forklifts but the management was very poorly and there was no room to grow
bad,was a great place to work and new management in the company doesn't care about customers service the way it used to.  Employees cant ring even if theres a line to pay your payment so they could cut payroll.
bad,No work life balance.  District and regional managers treat you like garbage and expect you to work like a dog.  District and regional managers give mixed direction.
bad,"This company will take advantage of hard-workers. Since the sales floor at every DSW is so large, employees are tasked with just about everything. Selling, cleaning, helping customers, running cash registers, put away shoes, etc. So, if you are a dedicated employee and are willing to do all of the aforementioned tasks, then management will, WITHOUT A DOUBT, exploit you for all that you have. You will be leaving the building everyday overly tired, drained, and dumbfounded. However, those who are not willing to do everything, and who slack at work, WILL NOT be punished. I strongly believe that management at DSW takes advantage of employees whom put in hard work, and will just push the slackers to the side."
bad,"This job was extremely stressful, you do not want to work for this company having to pick up after people every 3 minutes. It’s an environment that you don’t want to work in."
bad,Don't  communicate with drivers.  Just a number.  Company leased to swift. Essentially working for swift.  Terrible communication. Repeatedly waiting for a response from dispatch. Long waiting periods.
bad,The expect you to complete a full days worth of tasks in 4hours. The stock Manager was THE LAZIEST manager I have ever worked with. The stock team was often blamed for not getting shipments down by the stock Manager while she sat in the office doing nothing. The retaliation at this location was horrible. They would cut shifts just because you weren’t trained properly. The store and co Manager were pretty good but for them to do nothing aboht the stock Manager was Bad. We were only getting 12hrs a week which was good as a part time but to know your manager is getting 30+ a week to do nothing while you were only getting 3 hour shifts was a slap in the face.
bad,"I applied here thinking I could get a set schedule to work with my school schedule, but I was wrong. The first week I noticed I hadn’t been scheduled hardly any hours (8-12 hrs) I reached out to my manager and she completely ignored me over the phone. So I asked her at work the next day if I could get more and she said “oh yeah for sure”. Sure enough the next week I was scheduled even less (2 DAYS FOR ONLY 8 HOURS!). The way it works there they schedule you for 5 hrs or less so they dont have to give you a break saving them more money. Next was the “VIP spins”. Pretty much every hour my manager would have me do these “VIP spins” which basically consists of employees walking around the store and asking customers to sign up for our rewards program. 9/10 people dont want to be bothered with this while theyre shopping, so it was basically pointless. This felt like I was almost a salesman. She would tell me: “lets try to get those VIP numbers up!”. She had to meet some dumb quota or else her manager would probably get mad at her. Dont work here I promise you its not worth it."
bad,Thought they had a lot of potential with the new buyout from DSW Inc but it feels like they lack proper direction or at least they don’t know how to successfully trickle the information down to store level.  Too many changes that don’t make sense or just aren’t articulated properly so it leaves ppl wondering about job safety.
bad,"I’ve worked retail previously and never been so dissatisfied with a job. My managers were gossips and didn’t care about employees. Coworkers were competitive and would feed into the gossip over walkie-talkies. I was pressured to harass customers into joining the rewards program, or sign them up without their consent. I felt so awful the entire time I worked here, I’m so glad I was a seasonal hire."
bad,"The management here was very disrespectful, not caring or compassionate for anyone. They favoured specific employees and made it very well known that some employees do not fit into the ""clique"". Felt bullied as an employee."
bad,"very slow business, management was a joke, co workers were wonderful people and deserve better, no raises were ever given, even to associates who were working there for over 3 years, associates were treated with blatant disrespect by manager and those in higher positions, manager was completely inflexible with the schedule and we would consistently have to miss events we had told the manager about weeks in advance."
bad,"Typical day: Customer service, too much stress by management is put on employees to sign customers up for loyalty accounts. This in return reflects on how your raise is calculated. "
bad,"The most horrific job I have EVER had. The manager is so incredibly rude to everyone. She likes to yell at staff infront of costumers, swear at them, call them names, and be in the worst mood possible 24/7. The boss at the shoe company CLEARLY hates her job. The assistant manager straight up called me and several other employees ""obese"", ""b*tches"" and other hurtful things, and once reported to the manager, she DIDNT EVEN CARE! She didnt do a thing about it. I tried to report these incidents to head office, and head office straight up told me they didnt believe me."
bad,I was not able to more up in this company. Lack of realistic management.
bad,Horrible place to work. Everyone is in each others business and the loss prevention managers goal is to find any little thing to fire associates that have been there for a while. No appreciation for their associates what so ever. Stay away.
bad,Worked there for almost 5 yrs had personal belongings stolen from asecure room where only few employees had keys. Was fired immediately after reporting to police and security. My collegues which I had helped on many occassions and covered their workload as well as mine were the cause of me being let go with no just cauae. Not well managed and no supervision of staff. Poor quality salesmanship when my former regular customers are calling and complaining about waiting half hour with no service and I dont even work there anymore so not my issue.
bad,"This job is for teenagers who don't have life responsibilities. The hours were horrible because the managers are scheduled 10 hr days when the employers on a good week might get 20hrs a week. The managers claim hours are given by the amount of sales, but that is bull because every single time i worked we made our sales goal plus more! The company is too cheap to pay for a cleaning service, so the employees have to do all the store maintenance. Ridiculous! Seriously unrealistic to think an employee will be happy and motivated when you are scheduled for 6 to 8hrs a week. DSW GET A CLUE!"
bad,"I worked at Designer Shoe Warehouse as a part-time associate. This was my first job and my tasks were primarily to distribute stock throughout the store, and make sales on the floor when I had time. Multiple times OHSA regulations were dismissed, and I have sustained many injuries. The new manager that took over wasn't fluent in either French nor English and therefore hindered communication."
bad,By far the worst job I have ever had. The management micro manages and are overly pushy with signing customers up to the loyalty program. They encourage you to not ask the customer to sign up but just sign them up without them agreeing to it. You don't get any breaks unless you work more than 5 hours so you leave work starving because they will never schedule you for more than 5 hours. The first 8 months of me working there they didn't teach me how to do anything but to walk around the sales floor and to do cash. They favour employees who have been there a long time and treat new employees like trash.
bad,"I worked for DSW in West Nyack,NY for only 3 months last year! I was laid off a week before thanksgiving & the store manager who was not nice at all & didnt make the job fun at all. He even lied to me when i got laid off telling me to apply again in february & he'll take me back. Well come february I applied and never got a call. I do not recommend the dsw located in West Nyack,NY at all. Yeah i love shoes but for the most part the managers were rude except one who was easy going"
bad,Manager On Duty lacks in the fundamentals of management.  Poor at planning and time management.  Very disorganized.  Managers show no leadership and are more like slave drivers.  Unable to deligate and insist on micromanaging.
bad,"A typical day would require basic customer service skills as the job itself would entail, but as it concerned the transitioning store, management was poor in this location at the time."
bad,"A typical work day consists of walking up and down isles of shoes and turning shoes to be a 45 degree angle. it is extremely boring. The only thing that I can say I learned there was how to work a register. Managers are awful. They do not care about any personal issues you might have going on at home. And if you are deathly ill they do not accept doctor notes. Every time you can not come in you get ""a point"". When you get 7 points your terminated. Co- workers are treated extremely differently by managers. It is made very obvious who is favored. The managers have to be the worst part of the job. The Co-workers are extremely slow. It is like they were never trained. Who hires these people?! The only thing I can say I enjoy about the job is the pay. I started off with $9.75 with no previous work experience. But is being treated terribly worth it?"
bad,"The Shoe Company brand seems to think that they're a designer store, not a wannabe fancy warehouse. They'll work you like you're getting a commission when you're just getting a minimum wage and thats it. Unless you're full time don't expect to get more than 3 shifts a week."
bad,"A typical day consist of selling shoes and pushing the DSW rewards program to anyone who walked threw the door. I learned that people get annoyed if you bother them while they are shopping. The management was clueless and not great to work under. co- workers were the best part of the job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management, the most enjoyable part were the people and co-workers."
bad,"nothing comes out of working for DSW, the company doesn't care for its employees. they are much more concerned with VIP than anything else. No benefits come from working here either."
bad,DSW is a good starting place for entering the retail scene. Most of the store is shoes so it is easier to remember all of the brands and styles as well as where they are located. Management was helpful and patient. The hardest part of the job was the fast-past and seemingly understaffed days where you feel overwhelmed. The most enjoyable part was the slow days where you didn't have to do much and the store wouldn't be too messy.
bad,didn't like it to much job was very not  secure and co workers were not friendly 
bad,"-Pros:  DSW pays well especially if you have a background in retail"
bad,"Coworkers turn into family. However, that makes it difficult if wanting to have a social life outside of because you'll feel bad if you cannot take a coworkers shift. Also the workload is entirely too much for the pay."
bad,"Worst company to work for systems are stupid they make work harder for themselves cant even have a single piece of paper at your desk , Very unprofessinal when dealing with an employee , training was rushed just a unorganized company its sad"
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for. They do not care about their associates . If you want a job where you work extremely hard and are not appreciated at all, then you should work for this company."
bad,"This company is the most ungrateful company ive ever worked for. They pressure you and customer over the rewards program and I've even witnessed an employee cry because our manager was getting on her so hard. They are so worried about people stealing but have no detectors or lost prevention in store to stop them. Plus is you catch this you can't say anything regardless. Then when boxes come up missing its because your not ""customer servicing"". Perfect job if you like staying unpredictable hours when your schedule says you get off at 10 but you leave at 11:30. So working 1:30 til 11:30 is almost unbearable. Also if you like cleaning restrooms and vacuuming because they don't want to hire cleaning services, to much work for the pay. Harder workers get more work. You come and help out and the next day its like it never even happened. Highly untrained staff which was my reason and 9 other associates reason for leaving in a 2 month span. My co workers and the customers were the only reason I stayed as long as I did. Management calling corporate on other stores employees for doing things once that there horrible customers do on a daily because its to keep them happy and they won't get a complaint sent to corporate. Management team was  disgusting."
bad,"Manager lies, is bias, judgmental and prejudice. Appears to be a team leader,  with a pure honest disposition, yet she isn't at all a team leader or a considerate person. Only cares about company numbers and herself."
bad,they cut hours where you work a 4 hour shift.. whats the point of an open availability? who can live on a 4 hour shift for $15 an hour? i would not recommend this job for anyone who have responsibilities. only perk is the discout you can get for shoes which basically all your pay check will be able to purchase or maybe pay a phone bill lol
bad,I also enjoy working at DSW because I love shoes and I love to do customer service retail this one of my favorite jobs I said that I see some of them closing down out here in LA but it's ladies and gentlemen if you like shoes and customer service it is a good business to be linked up with and most of all it has a constant clearance.
bad,This company is very biased and does not like to be told they are wrong. They could care less about their employees and only do things that will benefit themselves. Please stay away!
bad,They don't put any money into anything  besides their pockets. The technology here is from 2000 and I am surprised they don't have tube TVs in the conference rooms.
bad,pays not worth it job is boring pretty much describes the place only nice thing was the discount on shoes
bad,I brought my expertise from companies and positions held at the likes of Best Buy as Product Process Manager(Assistant Manager) and Lowes Administrative Manager. DSW had little to know growth training and development
bad,"To work effectively with others in a team environment to accomplish company goals."
bad,"If you have back problems this might not be for you, you’ll be on your feet with no breaks your entire shift. The only people who get breaks are the managers or staff working a full 8hr shift. The managers are pushy and rude, if you don’t push every single ‘shoe lover’ to sign up, you get talked down to and scolded. All that matters is sales and conversion rates, not the customers. Maybe it’s for you, but it’s definitely not for me."
bad,"it was not fun, I dreaded it every day. All they do is get mad at you when you ask a question and when you expect to be a cashier, you are wrong because you have to work your way up to a cashier, they are overstaffed and I barely work."
bad,"Management doesn't protect employees, pays minimum wage but has a large workload, benefits are not worth it, rules are becoming stricter. Everyone takes their job too seriously for a shoe store, and are extremely greedily invested in sales."
bad,"I worked as a cashier most days but there werer times when I worked on the floor helping customers find shoes and restoking. Didn't learn anything I came with experience from working at Stride Rite and Ralph Lauren Shoe stores, The hardiest park of the job was getting the store ready for visit by upper management, The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers."
bad,"Associates are typically treated well, but management is overworked, underpaid, held to positively absurd standards, and the work-life balance is a joke."
bad,"The work life balance was horrible, always had to work late.. never had weekends off even though I was promised shift rotation. Salary was TERRIBLE, expected to do so much as a department manager but was paid minimum wage."
bad,Working part time but they don’t give u enough hours. Put you on on-calls which is silly as it’s retail. Keep hiring people and there is not enough hours to go around. Management is unorganized.
bad,"DSW focuses mainly on their VIP Rewards Program. We cannot force people to sign up, but if we don't sign up a customer, we get called out for it. Sometimes, I don't feel comfortable working there."
bad,"This job itself is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. The hours are flexible, the pay is meh, and the customers are annoying. But I would've still been working there if it wasn't for the store manager at the Kendall Gate location. There's no other way to put it, she's just rude. Condescending, treating everyone like they're stupid, undermining even the other managers. Her expectations for the store are completely unrealistic. It is just a bad work environment whenever she's there. All of the other associates who work there are really nice though, it just wasn't worth it for me."
bad,"I was fired over being in the hospital, even though I did inform them that I was there and would be unable to call in everyday. My manager took a dislike to me for no discernible reason and never talked to me or gave an evaluation."
bad,"dont expect much , Just managers boss you arround , hours are ok , no benefits , very low pay , Micro management to sell their rewards , only half hour break for 8 hours shift standing . managers are always rude and angry , workers not really happy , but again , If you got nothing else , take the job but not for a long term ."
bad,Was told that I would be advanced in the company for close to year which never happened. It was very drama filled store. It was a lot of empty promises with nothing that came of it.
bad,The store was fast paced to work in. It was challenging with no payroll hours. The associates and management were pressured  to get customers to sign up for rewards program.
bad,"The company is a locally owned company in Montgomery, Al. The employers aren't worker friendly they will talk to employees like their aren't anything. I got fed up and finally decided to leave the company due to differences."
bad,Great company when you first start with them.  When you need support from the leaders at head office no one is available.  Constant gossiping who is sleeping with who at what store as well as head office.  Super unprofessional! Underpaid for the work you do!  Don't get me wrong some of the leaders were helpful but others are teamed up to get each other out.  Bullying is always going on and goes unnoticed by upper management.  My suggestion go to Browns! Good luck with your job search.
bad,"I unfortunately did not have a good time working at DSW, I felt very unstable due to the lack of hours, and the constant cutting of hours. To give an example, I've only worked 8 hours at MOST in a week and I was there for three months. I'd always start off at around 12 - 15 hours to begin with in the week, then suddenly the manager will call and say we cut two of your shifts. "
bad,"I Worked at the sherway location. The place can get really busy especially on weekends. In addition, the company has changed a lot the discounts are not as great again and Management micromanages you. In addition, the management at this location did not like the general store manager nor the district manager. Always gossiping behind each others back. In addition, the general manager was lazy and hardly recognized you for your accomplishments."
bad,Everything seems to be good at the beginning and then you are ask to do management work for a supervisor pay which 13.65. Not a lot. Manager is always at the back sitting while us associate running the store. If manager does not like you too bad. Others sucking up just to get on the good side of the manager. Lack of actual training. Cleaning up shoes just to look new is something we have to do in a daily basis. Too much work for minimum wage.
bad,"A district manager who really did not care and was completely fake and unprofessional. Manager that fabricated  and never really took  a stand with employees, she liked to talk behind associates backs, high school drama. They would still make it seem like you do absolutely nothing. no respect and appreciation."
bad,There was a lot of talk about the store closing. They were still hiring people but new hires were getting minimum hours while old hires were working overtime.
bad,"a typical day at work, nothing much except attending customers, clearing shoes, price checking , cleanign at the end of the day and closing up for the next day"
bad,"Depending on the management, it was a fun place to work.  Unfortunately my manager was horrible. Very stressful and never sure what was going to happen"
bad,"No communication between employees, or management. Any signs of advancement are blocked by drama amongst the workers, not much else sucks you gotta write so much just you heard, be happy I took the time to write this any way could a just skipped it"
bad,"I've been with this company a long time and not once have they showed appreciation for that.  My co-workers who have been here for a year or two have been given thank you certificates and the managers stuck them on the wall in the breakroom for all of us to see.  I have worked through family members on their death beds, I have worked through funerals, I've been in a bad car accident in which I am still getting treatment for and this company didn't give me the time off to try and recover  without giving me a point on my attendance.  My manager has changed my shifts without notifying me and when I was late cause of it he would mark me late and give me a point.  I'm up to 8 hrs and 30 mins of missed breaks and I'm not talking about 30 min lunches I'm talking 15 min breaks because the manger(s) are to busy chatting to give me one or have someone cover me so I can take one.  I have been scheduled 8 1/2 to 9 hr shifts with only a 45 minute break that's a 15 min break and a 30 min lunch  when I'm supposed to get another 15 min break.  I been scheduled and marked a no call no show on a Sunday which I have no availability on that day and the manager knows that. That's just some of what they have done to me. The store I work in everything is broken except for the tablet if the tablet breaks it's fixed in less that 24 hrs but the rest of the store nope Dsw won't spend a cent on fixing anything else."
bad,"Monotonous. Typical routine. Pretty easy. Co-workers were nice and easy to get along with. Some managers were good, some were horrible. Hardest part of job: Trying not to be bored because it was the same old routine all day everyday. Dealing with horrible managers. Slow business times when you are getting your hours cut when you just walked in for your shift, or when you are on your way there, they're calling you not to come in. I once went through a stupid Blizzard that took me more than an hour to get there and then was two minutes away and they called me not to come in because they were closing down the store due to the weather. Helloooo you would think they would have shut down to begin with knowing there was a Blizzard!!! I'm still Angry about that! Most enjoyable: Helping people find exactly what they are looking for. Working around your school schedule. Great job for students. Wished they paid more though."
bad,Company never really offers much for advancement or wage increases. Manager has difficulties understanding requirements of their associates and their other commitments. No benefits or rewards/approval and very double sided expectations.
bad,"I explained to the manager previously that I have a medical issue and I still was hired. When my medical issue began to surface, she was upset at the fact that I had to stay at the hospital for a period of time. I had to follow hospital guide lines and couldn’t communicate with my job. I came back to the job with phone calls, a letter, and a doctor’s note to show why I have been absent. She fired me. I contacted Human Resources and they have never reached me back."
bad,you are not appreciated at DSW. They don’t care about the associates at all. They just need bodies. No matter how hard you work they give ZERO appreciation.
bad,"The training here is horrible. And the managers and the GM are constantly telling you what you're doing wrong but never help. There was certain things I needed from them to do my job, (login info to actually use the register!) and they were contantlt putting it off. It took them over a month of me working ,for me to get finally get the info I needed."
bad,DSW don't care about family and work balance. It's harder to get promoted from with in then an outsider. They schedule horribly with makes other people late within there own life schedule. Same rules don't apply to everyone
bad,"Called in a few times due to being sick (definitely got it from all the sick employees) but when I called in, manager stated it was fine. One day I really didn't get the chance to call, due to a family matter, so I emailed the manager and apologized and explained the situation and told her I'd see her tomorrow. She emailed me back and told me that I would no longer be working for them. Mind you, she never gave me a warning or final, she seemed understanding each time and fine with the situation."
bad,"A typical day may be spent entirely on one particular task to the point of exhaustion, or running around to cover every spot on the floor, depending on whether there was a manager on duty who felt like being involved, or just sort of sitting back and watching the employees work. When management would take long personal phone call breaks and we were understaffed, the understanding was that time would stop and if anything needed a manager's assistance we'd be up a creek with no paddle. Hours were inconsistent and would be cut or rearranged without explanation, we were expected to make broken cleaning equipment functional and if we were unable to vacuum the floor with a broken pushbroom that was somehow the employees' fault."
bad,"Although, I know DSW could be a great place to work, a lot depends on the manager you're placed under.My manager experience, to say the least, has not been the best experience."
bad,"We switched managers about three times when I worked there for two years. One was fired about money fraud lol I honestly loved the store and working there and the overall customers. However, I quit because I was getting no hours, as the manager decided to hoard all of the hours for people who couldn't sell but she was friends with so I guess that didn't matter. I would be forced to not talk to any other employees and was sent to stay in one part of the store, while the manager and all of her minions chat at the cash. It overall became such a toxic environment."
bad,"Management here is ridiculous. One manager in particular always seems to get an attitude with associates if they don’t know how to do things and ask for help. This manager also picks favorites and treats others poorly. There have been multiple occasions where me and another person will split the sales floor and then the manager and the other person will sit there and gossip about absolutely nothing meanwhile the manager tells me to make sure I’m keeping up with customers. I also can’t tell you the amount of times my schedule has changed the day before I am supposed to work. For example, I worked until 9:30 one night (was supposed to get off at 9) and then expected to go back into work at 8am and work until 12:30pm because that’s what the schedule said. When I got home that night and checked the app that the schedule is on, I saw my shift for that next day had been changed to 8-3. And to make it all better the manager had changed it at 9:40pm. They waited until I left for the night to change it. What if I didn’t check the app that night? Also aren’t work places supposed to give you a 24 hour notice that your schedule is changing? Cause apparently they don’t care. There were also times where I would only get 4-8 hours a week when during my interview process they said I would be getting 15-20 hours a week. Oh and I can’t forget that it took them a month to get me trained on the register which means all I was doing for a month straight was walking around straightening shoes. So boring"
bad,They did not provide associates with enough hours. The managers do not recognize my contributions towards they company. Also I have worked here for 2 years and still find it hard to get hours.
bad,"You're normal day was spent cleaning or moving the entire store, with no real reason. Or for a specific reason, which was then reversed, and the moves had to be put back. Asking for time off was a hassle. The hours were very inconsistent, and the stores always seemed to have the heat on even during the summer. Being one of the only men to work there, management had higher expectations of me, treated me unfairly, and gave me more to do than others."
bad,"All of the reviews given are true, both the good and the bad. Yes it can be fun, getting discounted product is great. But the politics behind it all is awful. Poor management.  Way too much staff turnover. Poor training. Your personal/family life doesn't matter at all to them. They expect you to make them your #1 priority.  You are expected to work way too hard and put in way too much for the poor pay you receive. "
bad,"This is an outlet store located in N.E. Calgary. It is also a very big store with a very large stock volume. A typical day was customer service is always number 1, and run the cash register, also I was responsible for completing the web orders packing it up and send it out by Canada post or contact the customer for pick up. In down time I was responsible for putting new arrival stock on the floor and replenishments."
bad,"When I first started working for DSW, it was fun and enjoyable. I wish it had stayed that way. Unfortunately, when you work for a manager that is manipulative and passive/aggressive, it is next to impossible. This, sadly, filters down the the lesser members of management and into the sales staff. The manager at the location I work at is not at all sensitive to the needs of the employees. It is all business. Do not expect any understanding or friendliness. If you enjoy being a robot, then DSW is the place for you. There is no work/life balance as a PT or FT worker. You are expected to give up your free time, work extended hours, work beyond your shift, sometimes not getting the breaks promised. Feel blessed if you don't have an emergency. Because if you do, be guaranteed there will be no compassion to your situation. Having talked with many coworkers, it is apparent they all have issues with the manager. I can understand why. I would gladly transfer to another location (I like DSW as a company) but of course, the manager will not allow this."
bad,"Nice place to work if your a shoe lover, but to think that your going advance not a shot. It's not about your performance, it's about who you know. Too much of a revolving door. No motivation or understanding."
bad,"Pressure on Managers for sales, KPI's was unrealistic. You don't perform to their standards they let you go. You associates don't perform you write them up."
bad,"Started working for the Shoe Company in January.  The training seemed to focus more on greeting and regreeting customers rather than actual shoe knowledge or customer service. How many ways can I say hello? It's a mouthful what they expect you to say and comes off scripted and not genuine. A customer could ask me a question about a shoe and I'd have no idea. Because my training was focused on how to say hello 5 different ways a shift. I had to do training videos on my own time not paid for... This doesn't seem right to me. The training booklet was exhausting, and to fill it out I had to literally just copy what the main binder says. I've worked retail before, this is not effective training. I never received the shoonies I was supposed to get for completing training along with the customer service I provided. None. If I didn't do the work I was supposed to I wouldn't get paid so how do you get away with not giving something to an employee that you promise them upon hiring? Also found it odd how much attention was placed on vacuuming and mopping the store. As in, actually being graded on it. I applied to sell shoes and give customer service, to be honest vacuuming an entire store is not something I should have to put 120% effort into. The doors cannot be locked until ten minutes past closing, and you cannot tell a customer you are closing. That's having a lot of respect for your employees! My time is precious to me, I have other things planned with my own time, there is a reason you have a closing time and it should be stuck to. That one purchase won't make or break your sales."
bad,"At work you were unable to converse with your fellow staff members under any circumstances unless management needed you to tell them something, which generated a very secluded and unappealing work environment. The standards of customer service were exceptional and I admired their approach to customer satisfaction. Management was very indecisive when it came to decision making."
bad,"While working at DSW I learned that if I need something done I need to do it myself. The company as a whole is very unorganized.  There is only one driver manager that was helpful.  I learned how to manage my time and how to drive safely. My favorite part was driving on the open road. I got to see 35 states multiple times.  The hardest part was sleeping in a moving truck, I was in a team truck."
bad,Good job if you like having to harass customers and being harassed by your managers constantly. having to annoy every customer to sign up for rewards to the point that they get mad and are yelling at you but managers see nothing wrong with that. better pay than most sales associate job. managers play favoritism.
bad,The pay is not good and I have worked there for 2 years. Stock  associate does everything and more. WE get the same pay as the other associate even though we do their job and our job! I only got a pay increase ONCE. Management is horrible and when good managers do join the company they leave within 5 months. Some  people that worked there would rather leave even when they do not have no other source of income.
bad,"fun workplace, easy to get along with other co-workers, good for a part-time job."
bad,"I have found it very difficult to work for this company. Our district manager is unhelpful and intimidating. The company is burying itself in paperwork which leaves little time for actual customer service. I find the company overall very difficult to work with, although I do enjoy my coworkers at the store level."
bad,Overall the labor was ok but the management did not respect their employers.
bad,"There is not appreciation for managers not matter all the hard work, dedications, and tears. Regionals come one or twice a year to stores and even if you are making numbers and living the value's doing company expectations  they always going to make you feel useless. They always said take care your people, appreciate associates and they don't do what they  are preaching."
bad,This is an okay first job if you need something to put on your resume but this is not a career job management picks favorites on who gets the most hours the company doesn't listen to its employees the benefit sucks which sucks and the company is constantly changing its rules in regards to employees. balance is just terrible they don't care about your outside lifelifandexpect you to put DSW first alway
bad,"Today we need jobs that are inspiring and engaging.  This has been lost somewhere along the way.  Too bad because it is a well structured business."
bad,it was way too stressful for the insufficient amount of pay. I dont have anything else to say nor do I want to be taking this survey so now im just trying to reach the word count.
bad,"As far as retail goes working at DSW is very simple and straight forward, you job consists of, restocking, cleaning up, customer service, and changing out the marketing materials to reflect sales and promotions. The part i hated was not getting enough resources and support from upper management, it was always a blame game and they would cut our hours constantly, they don't care about customer service, they just care that you repeat what they want you to say like a robot, they used to force us to say the words I am here for you, and if you didn't say that to every customer nothing else mattered, also they would rather you pester and annoy your customer to sign up for their rewards program instead of providing good service, all in all I would never go back."
bad,A good place to work for someone who is looking for a part time job with short  hours. It is not an environment that requires a lot of attention to details.
bad,"The store manager  is an unbearable, condescending, rude, and lackluster leader and will make your position a grueling struggle. Anything you do will be seen as a mistake in her eyes. She has a superiority complex and rarely ever listens to the opinions or suggestions of others. Stay away from the Kendall Gate location (it is extremely busy, filled with unrealistic expectations) and this company (they would rather invest millions of dollars in marketing, over paying their employees better or providing more hours)."
bad,"This is a good job for a high schooler, or college student. There isn't room for advancement. You will work with others that don't put in effort leaving other associates to pick up the slack. Management doesn't all put in the same amount of work, leaving a lot of the load on those who show aptitude with the day to day tasks instead. Like all retail customers will be both the best and worst you've worked with. When everyone does their part to keep the store running this is a good company to work for, but unfortunately that doesn't happen the majority of the time. If someone asked personally if they should apply, I would tell them if you just want a part time job to get you through until you graduate then this is an ok choice otherwise you might want to pass and keep your job search going."
bad,"Okay, where do I start? I have worked here at the shoephoria! call center for 18 months. The only good thing about this company is the benefits, employee discount, and paid time off. I do not exaggerate when I say they play favorites with who they decide to promote. If you need anything, Management is usually clueless and the most common answer to a question is ""I don't know"". They worry about numbers more than people. When there isn't work to be done, they have sent me home without an option to stay."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid staff. My 17 year old coworker was given manager duties and still being paid minimum wage. When there had been some safety issues regarding a stalker the manager told my coworker and I that we were being ""silly girls""."
bad,The shoes I was forced to buy in order to wear to work gave me 3 blisters on each foot. They weren't doing full time work yet and I am unaware of any plans to start. Not enough hours and a terrible location if you're bussing.
bad,Its not bad when you're up at the cashier just handling payments however when you're out on the floor it's kinda stressful dealing with both your customer and you're managers who always micromanages.
bad,"at the beginning the employee discount was really good. "
bad,"Base on location, sales associates jobs can be either fun or boring and repetitive. Management can be less engaging with employees and there's too much favoritism within certain location. Having too much assistant managers can cause lack of communication and competitive outcomes. My store manager lacks knowledge of effectively viewing her employees hard work and always discourage them, even me. She got personal with me and for that, I quite. I think that this store job can be fun, but needs work on allowing employees to engage in projects and in having more knowledgeable management. Also, please allow employees at register to at least have bottle drinks. It gets hard for employees to constantly talk and have to make sales, when they are dehydrated."
bad,"DSW is a good company to work for but upper management (District Manager) does not care how their employees are treated, even if you do complain about how management is treating you. The pay is alright and the shifts aren't that bad. It's not really easy to move up and they'll hire outside the company for management positions before hiring internally."
bad,"before i start let me say i have worked at dsw for over a year and a half and am still working here now, just trying hard to find a better job."
bad,"u do the job of 6 people, lunch breaks given very late, never leave on time,"
bad,"I came to DSW after deciding that I wanted to step up my game and start a career. I picked shoes because it was the first thing I felt passionately about since making that decision. Over the course of my employment, I learned that I could excel in any avenue and shoe search a little bit further."
bad,"I learned a good deal working at DSW and managing one of their stores for a few years. I value the experience and don't regret working for a ""big box"" retailer. However, they are very much bottom line driven and there is a lot of pressure on store managers. The culture and environment is to be expected when working at a large discount retailer. "
bad,"DSW has the worst customers I have ever encountered in my 20+ years in retail management.  The company does nothing to support their managers. No payroll means the managers are constantly on register,  constantly putting out shipment, constantly cleaning up the trash left on the floor by the customer. "
bad,"The company doesn't give enough hours for the work they expect to be done. Their visual directives are a joke. From my experience district managers do not visit the store enough, but expect perfection without any direction. Some Assistant managers are not only expected to help the Manager, but are also expected to run a department as well, but are not paid to do both jobs. There is no hours given for consistant staff meetings, when hours are alotted they do not come close to what you would need, so you are expected to also cut hours from other areas while continuing to give the same service. Staff are expected to do a training manual but are not given the training hours so they generally do not get completed causing a landslide of problems with the staff in the future."
bad,"Greeted customers as they entered the store."
bad,"Helping customers find exactly what they are looking for and helping people be confident in their purchases always put a smile on my face. However, the pressure and expectations by managers is a bit too much for most employees to be comfortable with."
bad,"I was a basic sales associate. The work was repetitive and mind numbing, 1/10 would not recommend.  You have to meet certain sales goals to get promoted (like $1 dollar more). I did it because I'm a student and I had no other experience."
bad,"I hear they have changed their working model, but this company was very punitive and big brother seemed always to be around.  The manager I worked for never seemed to trust her employees enough, and head office seemed to always be seeking out new ways to cut down on perks to the job."
bad,"Very few hours If you want more you have to be consistent"
bad,This company was a great place to work but the change in management has left it horrible. This company and new district manager always talk about the importance of internal promotion but does not show that in their actions. In my nearly 2 years I have only seen one assistant manager be moved up to a store manager position and only a handful of associates be moved up to key holder/supervisors positions. Most of the managers in my district/area have been with the company for less than 2 years. There is no communication and absolutely no consistency among the stores. This has turned into a horrible job and company.
bad,"Store Management and coworkers are fantastic. Treatment or customers and employees by upper management is terrible. High workload expectations for bare minimum staffing. Not enough labour hours provided to get tasks done and serve customers as head office desires. Not a lot of upward mobility or raises available, job is secure but hours are not"
bad,The real problem is management and pay. The other people working there do a great job and are great co-workers. This is a very fast paced job and they really push sales.
bad,cool place to work at.Cool discount.Location does not have a lot of hours to give employees.Hard work for little rewards.People are friendly.No room to move up.
bad,I would show up for shifts and they would tell me to go home because I wasnt scheduled even though they are always under staffed. The management is not very understanding of personal matters. Everyone there means well they just have some kinks to work out
bad,"A company with a driving focus can sometimes forget to focus on their people, though that may have changed. The overall incentive plans that were available were nice but some of the direction at the time I was there was inconsistent."
bad,"The people who worked there were friendly enough, it was the constant pressure of making sales and stalking customers that I had a hard time with. Other than that I have to be honest and say that the atmosphere was nice and the customers were always friendly to me"
bad,"On my first day they pretty much just threw me out there. I wasn't really trained on how things worked in the store. Sales associate jobs are pretty basic, but different from each company. So here I am getting told that I'm not doing things properly according to their company, when i was never trained in the first place. Oh and make sure you sigh up for our rewards programs though because that's what customers want to hear all the time."
bad,Underpaid and lied to by management about advances in company. Worked here over  a year and never got a raise. Did the job of my boss and never got recognized.
bad,Management changes during my time changed frequently.  Immediate manager left and did not hit it off with new one.  Job changed without notice. No help in acclimating to new position.
bad,"managment was awful. always scheduled on days when i couldnt work, said being in a hospital wasnt an excuse to switch shifts, i got rude texts from my manager all the time, managers had no clue what they were doing"
bad,the managers didnt treat me the best nor did i have a good relationship with the other employees. the store is well organized tho and everyone understands they job and perform well.
bad,"Management is not accomidating to personal needs  "
bad,"I really hated my time working here. On top of just the normal crud you deal with in any retail job, the management was really inflexible when it came to scheduling (I was a student, so this was obviously big for me). Furthermore, you were heavily pressured to pick up open shifts, even if you've already let them know you will be busy/gone/otherwise unavailable to pick up said open shifts."
bad,"Very traditional, no work/life balance, managers don't have leadership skills, don't appreciate staff's extra effort or over hours work. There is no established culture. Very high workload."
bad,Your fellow sales associates are amazing but the management in most stores as well as HQ cares very little for the staff. Little to no opportunity for advancement. Company is concerned with push sales not customer satisfaction.
bad,"Should be an easy part time job however, the work load is often stacked due to under-staffing and quick turnover. Corporate lives in the clouds while individual stores suffer."
bad,"working at townshoes was great at first, its a small group of associates so we got to know each other pretty well. Unfortunately management is horrible and would put unrealistic expectations on associates. The manager at this location was the main problem, she had her favourites and she would generally ignite a lot of drama within the store which would distract employees from focusing on sales. there is a lot of flaws to this company and especially this store. its a pretty simple job but was really mentally draining from the management side of things."
bad,work  there as a seasonal employee they gave me no hours was working 1 every 2 weeks and they were hiring more people. they also pay biweekly definitely not work there again.
bad,the first manager I had was great. the second manager I had was terrible she would be so rude to customers with disabilities and tell the associates to leave the floor and go in the back
bad,"This store claimed to be ""family"" like but its really not. The store manger is mean and likes to play favorites. They claimed to not pressure associate to get in sore rewards sign ups but thats all they care about. You cant call in sick even if yore dying they just give attitude. PLEASE DO NOT WORK HERE the one in Fresno, ca not worth it at all and if youre not available 24/7 dont expect many hours. oh and dont even think about making plans on weekends they dont give any days off but weird weekdays"
bad,"Everyone is as friendly as can be when you first get hired but start to get mean and nasty when you get comfortable. There is no room for advancement here. I would only recommend this job for people who need extra income or typically, high school people. Management is horrible. They cut your hours while at the same time hiring more people. The job is pretty boring."
bad,Working at DSW has been a fun place to work however the pay doesn't help me to support my self and therefor I have to work a second job to make ends meet. Also I have been working here for almost 3 years and have only had less than a dollar raise even after getting endless accolades and perfect performance ratings. Management and Coworkers are fine but the job duties can be a bit taxing such as running a store acting as loss prevention and also having to clean up afterwards. The most enjoyable part for me is the customers and coworkers and the relationships built with clientele.
bad,"-stocking and restocking material"
bad,"DSW has changed in the past several years. I had enjoyed my job with this company and had a great experience with them. When I left there was a huge shift in management, and I saw my position hired out from under me. They had a different direction they saw for the company and none of the managers that were there  before were part of the direction they were going to go. I was part of a very successful store that was only down 1.5% in the area where other stores were down 7 or 8%. We were against a 15% increase so we had kept most of that increase during troubling economic times. We also had the highest conversion rate in the Dallas area,and reward sign up conversion. Clearance was a huge part of our business, and we had the cleanest well managed area. Once the Old Navy crew came in, they had a different focus which we all were behind. They decided they wanted their own managers and hired them in our positions."
bad,you were not allowed to talk to anyone unless a customer has said something to you. you had to walk on eggshells because you didn't want to go in to trouble. they take everything so seriously. you  are not allowed to stand up for yourself if you do be prepared to get penalized. the co workers are amazing just the management team is horrid. no way to move up even if offered.
bad,"There is never really a typical work day, some days are busy other days are not. The amount of hours granted to the associates all depends on whether or not the store meets their daily goal. So if the store isn't making any money for the day they will cut peoples hours. One of the hardest things to deal with would be when we do not have enough people to cover a shift. For example there will be three people for the closing shift when there really should be at least six. The pay isn't all that great and the yearly raises aren't more then a few cents. There isn't really much room to move up in the company. The way that management decides who gets a promotion is based on favoritism. If the store manager likes you and you suck up to them then you'll get promoted. They do not really go by who has the right skills just more so who they like."
bad,"A typical work day entails providing information about product to customers, and helping them find what they need."
bad,"At DSW the lack of hours is what made me unsure about working for them. With only one day a week at 8.00 per hour, I was unhappy."
bad,"assisted customers with finding products/merchandise"
bad,"stocking, not knowing when your breaks were. mangment yelling at there employees."
bad,- Stock
bad,I must say that this is the worst job that I have had. The management was horrible. The stress level was high. The co-workers were the only thing that was acceptable.
bad,"fun place to work mostly with co-workers, very little hours and managements creates an unethical environment, and their is less than no security"
bad,"Designer Shoe Warehouse was my first job. I wasn’t trained correctly, I learned as I went. Most customers were very rude and so was the manager. I don’t regret leaving."
bad,its okay but the management is not great and the hours are bad.
bad,This place has so many issues with it's management on multiple levels. Store manager and regional manager can't agree to one thing ever. Policies aren't abided by management but expected of associates. Be prepared to push it's membership program as it's really the only thing they care about. Doesn't matter if you signed up 60 people that day if you miss 3 people out of 63 you will be called out for it. Very negative.
bad,"They only gave out 4-4.5 hour shifts, and then would only schedule people 2 to 3 days a week so you're getting usually 8-12 hours a week. Pay was $9/hr to start, which isn't bad, but is not enough money when only getting 8 hrs a week and paid every other week. If you asked to stay late they always complained that ""you're wasting payroll"" even though managers got as many hours as they wanted. The store manager sucked at scheduling. She would either schedule too many people during slow hours/days (Sundays/Mondays/Tuesdays) or wouldn't schedule enough people during busy hours/days (Friday/Saturday). Also, right when you start you are REQUIRED to sign up for shift extensions, so that if it gets busy towards the end of your shift, they can keep you for up to 2.5 hours after your scheduled end time. Times that they did this, they wouldn't ask you if it was okay, and tell you last minute, so if you had any plans or other obligations you were screwed. The management at my location absolutely sucks. The store manager would tell everyone to ask questions, but then would talk down to them like they were idiots. She even would talk down to workers in front of customers which is rude and unprofessional. The work was easy, but could get annoying with some rude customers. Maybe this job would be alright for someone's first job in high school, but definitely not if you want to make $100+ a week and be treated like a decent human being."
bad,Management was not organized and did not have respect for their employees. Had a health condition but did not care and made fun of at times. Don't waste your time.
bad,"The manager of this location is extremely clueless and out of touch with modern times and his assistants are worse. They're extremely gossipy and childish, speaking your mind only gets your hours cut."
bad,Fun people but little advancement beyond key holder.  Little to no transparency when dealing with promotions or availability of such. Little work life balance
bad,"This company asks a lot of there employees with little to give back in return. They are more concerned with their customers being happy with coupons than the work environment for there employees. The manager felt that we work based on the companies needs and not our needs, meaning we do not care about your personal life."
bad,Some managers were awesome while others just made everything stressful and a poor environment to be in. Very competitive work place with trying to get people to sign up for rewards.
bad,"I only worked part time, but every shift I was always running around the store. Managers were always bothering us with something and everything had to be absolutely perfect, when it seemed like it had been done correctly the first time. Employee rewards policies weren't very rewarding. Being forced to wear aprons is annoying. The pay rate is nice, though, and duties of a representative at DSW are routine and easy to do. Top supervisors were a pain to work with, but assistant managers were awesome."
bad,Its a fast pace envirment. Specially being at the MOA. It requires being physically fit to work there and do freight. Having a creative mind to do merchandising. Which I really enjoy.
bad,"Although working at DSW was mostly easy, I would not recommend DSW to any of my friends. The managers rarely showed appreciation to associates, and hard work often went unnoticed. Assistant and store managers often feel pressure from district or regional directors, so they are often stressed out which translates to a tense work environment. Whole company is focused on cutting costs anywhere possible."
bad,It was a goos beginning however everything started to fall apart and with so many loopholes in the store it was quite depressing to work there. Also their salary wage is quite ridiculous for the amount of work one would do.
bad,"First impression, thought it was nice but the longer you're there your opinion may change. Was hired as a temp, was told that they're looking to keep temps. (Not true). The website has way too many issues(slow, lags, glitches) and so does their shipping service. Reps are left to deal with really angry customers whose orders are screwed up thanks to the not so user friendly website and awful shipping service. Some of the people here are unprofessional and the whole place just gives you the overall high school vibe."
bad,this place is great for something slow pace. they focus more on cleaning.
bad,"Long story short. The job would be great if they didn't try to turn it into forcing costumers to sign up for rewards. Most don't do anything to qualify for rewards anyways. The main issue with the job is that the management argue constantly. Would be nice if cooperate and in store management talked about anything other then just complaining about each other. That being said, being full time I get great vacation days and think that I'm paid alright for the position."
bad,"You would be told one thing and then told another thing, which did not make sense. Advancing in this company is not what you expect."
bad,"I worked for the company for almost 2yrs as a part-time employee and I feel that I did not take any positive experience from the company overall. There are times when management does not communicate efficiently with each other thus relaying mixed instructions to the employees. They will have you working endlessly by adding hours to your shift, taking away your personal life outside of work. There are very little chances to move up in the company and they will hire someone outside the company before they promote from within. Besides desperately needing the money, the great discounts and fellow coworkers are the only reasons I stayed as long as I did."
bad,"Walk the floor, customer service, and recover products. "
bad,"my coworkers were great had fun on the job, work was easy enjoyed meeting new people, no training in management not a lot of room to move up"
bad,"It would be a good job if not for the unrealistic expectations on their employees. The sales goals are outrageous, and there is no reward for meeting them, most of the co-workers complained too much, and my bosses only cared about getting high numbers."
bad,"The management sucked and too many people in charge. The guy to open the door was late a lot and no you didn't get paid for it, if he was late. The store I worked at wasn't always organized. There is so much more stuff."
bad,DSW allowed employees to purchase their products at a 40% discount from label cost regardless if the item was on a clearance or it was an new that just arrived to the store
bad,"When I worked at DSW I was so excited, the first few weeks were amazing, but once problems began to arise, management didn't really do anything--and I'm not speaking for other locations, because I've heard from others that other locations are well organized and quite civilized. Meanwhile, where I worked, it was basically a blood bath, everyone was in cliques/groups, and gossiped about eachother... it wasn't even pleasant to work there anymore, so I had to leave."
bad,"There has been a large disconnect since the company was purchased from DSW. And it's too bad! It was once a great place to work. Great environment with values that were lived. But in the last couple of years, things started to change. Communication was all over the place, never consistent, always changing their minds. Stores had to be looking at messages numerous times a day to stay up to date with what was taking place. Now the value are just words. No longer living and breathing from the top down."
bad,"I interviewed for the assistant manager position and after telling them my background and expertise was in selling and driving sales results, they put me in a new role as Warehouse lead. The job was VERY demanding physically. There was not one day I didn't sweat at work, and they were still worried about me working faster. Since my role was new, the managers couldn't get on one accord about my responsibilities, and that caused a lot of confusion. I had to confront the manager twice about his lack of communication skills. I only enjoyed the times I got to be on the sales floor interacting with customers. Since that wasn't what they hired me for, it caused conflict."
bad,I didn’t really know some of my co workers that well. Management kept the place clean and we always had to be doing something whitch is perfectly fine.
bad,"The work is typically easy but made stressful by the inconsistency of taking expired offers or not. This leads to unhappy customers getting upset with you and having to call for a manager far too often. This inconsistency spilled over into things such as dress code as well. Certain people were allowed to do things that others were not. The managers that remained at my store were uptight and condescending, which made going to work a burden in itself. Reward signups were another hassle."
bad,This is a ok compnay to work for. They have the goods and bads that come with this company. In my experiance it may have a had more bad then good.  Also to me it is a big high school
bad,SM would never close the store or work many weeks (although required by policy). This caused a major issue and all other associates and Assistant Manager's Work Life Balance.
bad,"A typical day at DSW would very. Some days are slow, and some days are busy. Some days I would be stocking, some days I would work the floor, but most days I was head cashier. "
bad,"Although the reason I left this company was to pursue education, I would not work there again or suggest other people work there simply due the toxic environment and lack of work-life balance."
bad,"I got hired on the spot during the interview, which is a bad sign that the company is desperate. While that may sound good to the unemployed, it backfires. They have terrible and unstable hours for employees. There are people working there who work 4 hour shifts once a week. There have been weeks that have gone by, when I didn't get any hours. They literally hire anyone and have a habit of hiring more people than necessary. There's also a lack of organization and management which results from the rampant favoritism among the managers. There's no where to go in this company. I was told I would be trained on the cash registers after 6 months of working there and it's been a year and still no training. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Do yourself a favor and avoid this company. There is better out there."
bad,Great job to learn about fashion and trends. Lack of diversity and immaturity from management. Lack of competitive pay wages and low pay raises. Great discount to employees. Lack of benefits and associates are limited to only part-time positions. Not a long-term job unless your a manager.
bad,"I worked there for 5 years. I got promoted twice. I was the assistant manager for 2 years. I have never had any coachings or been on a probationary period in the whole 5 years I have been there. The DM hears one thing about how I communicate with associates. Instead of interviewing with associates, and further investigating this accusation, they fire me."
bad,"The Shoe Company is an ideal place for a student to work, being they only give around two shifts a week and the shifts are maybe four hours each. Management was okay, they have good training programs but they seem to more monitor you than actually help out."
bad,"All I ever heard about at this job (for the very short time I was there) was rewards. Even those of us who weren't register trained and were only floor associates were expected to make rewards sign up goals. A coworker counted once and they nagged everyone about rewards 4 times over the walkies in one hour. Managers would sometimes call cashiers out over the walkies if they got a no from a customer when asking about rewards program. Working at a very high-volume store was impersonal and the management didn't seem to care that much about the employees. My hours were okay, but coworkers would complain that they were consistently getting scheduled more hours than they asked for while in school. The company also does nothing about shoplifters, but holds associates accountable when items are stolen. All associates are supposed to call customers ""shoe lovers"" all the time. Closing always took forever, and they would schedule shifts with ""extended hours"" so you didn't always know when you'd actually be off work. The only things I liked about this job were a lot of my coworkers and the pay, which was okay for a new part-time hire."
bad,"No opportunity for advancement, only part time available. They teach you just what they want you to do, meaning the workloads are often distributed unevenly and you have people who do harder work and more of it for more or less the same pay. Management makes thing unnecessarily stressful by giving you impossible time limits when they are unaware of how much work there is to be done."
bad,"DSW tries to be a cheaper version of Nordstrom, and what they are is the penultimate retail job. You get no benefits, raises are miniscule, and there is NO chance to advance from inside the company. I worked there for 3 years, and during my time there I went through 12 store managers, and was never offered a management position, despite training the managers as they came in."
bad,The management really does make a difference. When I first started there was an amazing manager and then she left and the manager that replaced her wasn't good.
bad,There is no life/work balance. They take advantage of managers at all levels. At one point a store manager was forced out of her berievement leave because other stores needed coverage after the company fired a bunch of people.
bad,everyday was utterly boring and the manager makes you scared to come to work! the mods are quite nice and make your job tolerable ; some nutty customers once in a while. okay place to work if you're looking for something very temporary.
bad,"Log in, check the targets for the day, create desired goal. Learned the basic necessities for managing a store, but most came from my schooling. Management was inadequate in providing proper training. Modules that needed work was not provided after the first day. Hardest part of the job was dealing with management. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the smiles of satisfied customers and returning clients."
bad,"The company really doesnt care for the workers, we are just numbers to them, that can replaced. They cut back on the workers benefits, twice. The schedule is rarely given two weeks in advance so you cant schedule your life. The higher up managers don't really notice all the hard work that goes into running the stores on a daily basis. Its never just fun to come to work. The most enjoyable part of the day is when you get to have cool conversations with customers."
bad,"Great first job. DSW culture does not value client/ employee interaction and will not work you over 17 hours a week in order to keep from having to pay benefits. If you are looking for a job for just a little spending money it is great, but very hard to make a living only working at DSW unless you are a manager."
bad,The company is a great place to start for a first job if you're set in the right location. You're given an efficient amount of training. The hours are not there to keep all of the staff happy or to stay with the company. Really good shopping and working environment.
bad,"For anyone who likes to be consistently challenged and want to learn how to creatively solve issues in the work place, this is not the job for you"
bad,ik vond toen jammer dat ik daar weg moest door omstandigheden.
bad,i would great customers and help them find what they are looking for.
bad,Great place to start off in retail this employer help me to develop my work ethic and learn how to deal with customers in such a setting.
bad,I loved the environment. Has a strict policy on attendance. Very horrible on giving hours and always cutting hours. Management was horrible very unorganized
bad,"i learned all about food ,how to give best customer serve and find the best food for them "
bad,"There's lot of part timers and our shifts only ranges from 3-4 hours.They also change your schedule on the day off which is really inconvenient if you already made plans before or after."
bad,they push you to sign people up for the rewards program. it stressed me out. SOME PEOPLE JUST DONT WANT TO SIGN UP! I CANT FORCE THEM. but the good part is that they play good music.
bad,"Horrible management, boss got arrested for embezzling money, very boring and poor pay..."
bad,"Good selection of shoes, sandals, boots, bags, socks and shoe care products. Good staff to work with. Main problem is the high rate of theft by local shoplifting rings. Unfortunately the high rate of theft shows no sign of abating and is in fact escalating."
bad,"This company allows store managers to sit in the office all day instead of being on the floor like they should be, helping the team. They hold people accountable for things that they do not provide them the tools to be successful at. Not enough payroll to even begin to accomplish all that needs to happen in a day."
bad,"Don't get very many shifts, some times did not have a lot of people on floor which was difficult, on call shifts were not paid, lots of information to contain in not a lot of time."
bad,"Above store managers did not live the culture they preached and demanded from the stores."
bad,"Customers were always right even when they were rude and wrong. But the managers always gave them what they wanted and made the associates look like they couldn't handle the situation. We have policies and rules with the coupons but no matter how much the customers use and abuse it and the associates, the manager will always bend their backs for the customers despite some of them not deserving it."
bad,"If you are a college kid and want a retail job, there is nothing wrong with DSW. Management can be a brutal headache and flexibility is not always rewarded. All in all, not a terrible place to work."
bad,"Employees receive a 30% off discount however that no longer includes clearance. To compromise they added special sales just for the employees as well as the employees can now become rewards members. Pretty simple job overall, mainly just keep the store maintained and help the customers."
bad,"work is great, great benefits it is interesting, customers are very nice and it is a lot of fun to help them specially if you are a woman. management is okay i would say, some of them have no idea what are they doing though, but job is very laid back so i guess it is whatever. promise raise before hiring me but after 90 days never got it."
bad,It was fun to work there because of the employees but the Store Manager made it the total opposite when she was on shift. The customer service was good but the cleanup of shoes and boxes at the end of the night sucked.
bad,I would not choose to work for this company.  They claim to be a family oriented business but their practices show otherwise.
bad,not enough hours small pay and 3 hour work days equal out to small pay check. but the 30% discount is a plus.
bad,The DSW I worked at was not in a great location. Shoplifting was a big problem and upper management expected us to risk our safety over shoes.
bad,"Co- workers were great"
bad,"The location I worked at was slow paced, and had little customer variety."
bad,Work here was okay. It was a job I got what i wanted from it which was to gain more knowledge about the types of shoes and being able to sell the product to different customers.
bad,DSW was a typical retail environment. A lot of involvement is expected for little pay. They tracking how often you sign people up for mailing lists but offer no incentive for doing so.
bad,"Had a significant problem with theft, both by customers as well as fellow employees."
bad,"A typical day at work would be walking up and down the aisles helping people find shoes to either match an outfit or just a desired style. If we did not have it available in our store, then I would call different locations and/or order it on our online shop. I learned how to be open and versatile with styles and combine texture with a funky pattern. The management wasn't so great, because they had problems confronting the employees about issues. My employees were wonderful they were all strong believers of team work. The hardest part of my job was dealing with inconsiderate managers. I most enjoyed seeing the customers, I helped, leave happy"
bad,It was hard working there because it was crowded and had to take care of a lot costumers.
bad,"I currently work at the Little Rock DSW. I am fighting for my job, one of the other associates and I noticed how our manager seened to marj down shoes and then buy them instantly, then we realized that they were only in her size. I confronted a different manager hoping she could help me, now if I mess up once I am fired. The manager realizes that I and another associate caught her stealing and we are both under interrogation all the time now. The only good thing about the store is the few good, hard working friends I have made there. Management is horrid here. Do Not Apply Here."
bad,"I enjoyed working at this store because I enjoy retail. I had some experiences that weren't so great, but I still performed my duties to the best of my abilities despite it all."
bad,cashier inventory replenishment mark down accessories floor set and prices
bad,"Long days , little pay. What else could go wrong? I was getting used to it for a while till I realized I would spend my whole check the same day I got paid."
bad,"i was pregnant at the time which made things difficult . workers were really nice, the customers are kind of snotty. they have different types of shoes bags and winter things."
bad,the job was a nice job the hours was nice until the seasons came around and they slowed down. there were all types of different culture there. there were no hard parts of job.
bad,"I would've liked to have worked there longer, however I wanted a position that would allow me to work more than 20 hours a week.  Sometimes I didn't even get to work that many hours."
bad,"DSW was a great place to work at first.  The managers were awesome, your coworkers are fun, the discount was great, but the working hours are terrible.  It was terrible when I first began working there, got better, then got worse before I ended up quitting.  As a part time employee with a very open schedule, you would expect to get many hours, but that is not the case.  First your shifts become 4 hour shifts per day, but on top of that, getting cut & being sent home early is regular here.  Even on a 4 hour shift you’re sent home early.  Imagine seeing you’re paycheck after two weeks of about 16 hours total at the rate they pay.  Don’t even waste your time here!"
good,"It is retail so I do believe it was the type of manager I have. A lot dishonesty. I was hired as an ASM, when implementing any changes or improvements my manager is on my side cheering me on : loves the improvement. Then on the other side of it turns around and tells part timers she hates it all. When confronted she denied it and make you feel like the crazy one for having those thoughts. It was a repeated offense. Staff in turn adopted a non respectful attitude as I would hold them accountable and she would let let get away with a lot. It was the typical bad cop/ good cop game. It's exhausting! If you are wanting to apply here don't hope for change. Just be a 'yes man'. This job is not well suited for the motivated go getter. Training has yet to be provided, and I'm currently going on 5 months of employment. Very passive aggressive treatment from direct manager. The company as far as I can tell with my own research seems like a great place to work for."
good,"DSW is a beautiful place to shop but not so much to work. The training process needs a lot more attention. When I started, I was just thrown everywhere without knowledge of how to do things"
good,I worked here full time for a while . At first the staff  was super nice but it would get so busy and messy that we would spend at least 2 hours cleaning the store and not to mention its super understaffed.
good,"Great place to work, if you are looking for under 18 hours a week.  No room for advancement, and raises are small. There is a lot of tasking required, while the staffing is light."
good,"They do not have job security, and their management team does not like actually training you, just expects you to know what they should know. The job itself is boring and unproductive as well since they never promoted properly."
good,"A typical day on the job consisted of employee's getting yelled at, consistently being told what we're doing wrong, but never showing us how to resolve the issue. A very racist women. I never felt welcome on the job. The store manager never helped clean up, she always bossed people around, and had a bad attitude. She would even talk bad about costumers to other employee's and would talk bad about employee's to other employee's. I would never work there ever again."
good,"Their follow through is off.  Poor leadership, and too many unwritten rules.  The leadership team is often promoted through a popularity/fashion contest, and not based on education, experience, or skill set."
good,"Working long shifts with only 1 x 30 minute break even if the shift is 10+ hours, management constantly couches you on items that you have no control over/ did not oversee/ did not do/ they did, constant feeling like you can never do anything right within the company"
good,"Everyday, we have a target sales which we need to meet. The day starts with going over promotions or sales which is going on in the company. Once shift starts, you greet customers whom come in, and try to meet their needs by bringing them their choice of shoes, boot and etc."
good,met a lot of customers out there. the job environment is just like any other retail store
good,A typical day included helping customers and dealing with any issues that arised.
good,"Unreliable hours, some times I would go a month without a shift because the management would hire so many new people that there wasn't enough hours for anybody. Everyone was very fake."
good,"If you like retail and interacting with people then this is the job for you. If not do not apply at all, I made the mistake of working in retail and  I hated it."
good,"It was not worth the minimum wage. The people were amazing and that's honestly the only reason I stayed as long as I did. However, the tasks I was asked to do, like unclog the toliet or inhale mold which made half the employees sick just was not worth it."
good,"A typical day would be cleaning up shoes and ringing up customers. Some of the managers don't really care much about you and are usually lazy to do anything, they rather have an associate do the work. The hardest part is probably dealing with rude customers. The best part is building good relationships with your co workers."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Shoe Warehouse. A typical day would be walking in, opening the till, making sure the store was clean and tidy for customers to start shopping. The management was not the greatest which then lead me to resign. The hardest part of the job was being alone for the morning and having 20 customers in the store, which lead to constantly being stolen from because I couldn't possibly watch all customers. The staff I worked with was great, I just wish they managed it better."
good,"A typical work day, come into work looking forward to another exciting day, Meeting new and different people is what I always look forward to when coming into work. Engaging with customers is always refreshing and makes the day go by better and faster."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of the manager pushing you to meet unrealistic sales targets.I learned quite a bit about shoes and all the brands. My coworkers were almost all pleasant, the hardest part of the job was meeting the sales targets, the most enjoyable part was helping the customers finding what type of shoes they like, and the discount was nice too."
good,"If you want to work for a place where the customer is always right even if the customer is abusive or threatening, then this is the place for you. It is a typical retail environment with corporate rules and regulations that must always be followed. It is also an environment that breeds very competitive ladder climbers, however, promotions for management positions are usually filled by outsiders, so don't hold your breath. Many people have been with the company in upwards of 8 years and have still not received a promotion beyond an hourly supervisor position. If you are a student in need of some part time work, this is the place for you. If you are career-ready and looking for quick advancement....look elsewhere."
good,Most enjoyable part is helping a customer find the right type of shoe for an special occasion.
good,A typical day at work would proceed of me walking around the store greeting customers and the manager taking up all the work including webs and stock.
good,it was ok at the time - I needed work - It was great until new management came in - i would've been there longer i think if the management remained the same
good,"Management is not good. There is a lot of call outs, which sometimes causes the current work to stay a longer shift than scheduled. Store manager is not really considerate of associates and the times they are supposed to get off. They are sometimes kept until 12 am  when they should be leaving at 10 pm."
good,they gave me a chance to get some experience in CSR but they management does not know how to communicate and the management picks and choose who to promote or put more time into.
good,"very little room to advance, terrible pay for how long you are walking around and dealing with rude customers. the discount on shoes is the only reason i stayed longer. management likes to suppress you and micromanage. the job is easy but they are constantly checking up on you to make sure you know what to do. I transferred through several locations and they are all like this. you will never make more than $9.50/hour unless you are a store manager or assistant store manager."
good,Love working for this company but associates are under appreciated
good,I have been working at DSW for five years and would like to work in my field of Social Work. I want a job that I can learn from and grow in.
good,Management definitely doesn't care about your outside life and expects you to pour your life into this part time job. A lot of drama that management loves to partake in.
good,"I worked at DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse Company. Specifically the shoe Company branch."
good,"Decent work place, but no real opportunity to advance/get promoted/get a raise. That may have been due to my area (Redlands) not being one of the most profitable branches."
good,A typical day involves greeting and helping customers in between dealing with daily tasks as well as leading the sales floor as MOD and supervising/coaching staff.
good,I would recommend this as a starter job as one cannot grow within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates as they made it easier to work within the company.
good,"Very unorganized establishment, unsafe work practices as well as managers who didn't understand what was going on "
good,"You work really long hours, and during peak season we were required to complete overtime hours. The hourly pay was nice, but I was so tired and never had any free time I don't know if it was worth it. Management was inconsistent about rules and favoritism was really bad. The offices are dark and gray, it was just a very sad environment to work in for 10+ hours a day."
good,"They would never give 5 hours shifts because they didn't want us to get 15 minute paid breaks, co workers were extremely rude and when i spoke to the management team nothing was done and i was told to just ignore them"
good,"While working at DSW I found it hard to schedule appointments around my work. I would have multiple shifts a week and would be on call for the other ones which means that I am not technically schedule for that day and would not know if I would have to show up until 2pm. The environment was okay the people there were nice and the management was okay as well. There were no breaks for shifts that were 4 hours and 45 minutes which was alright, but I would always work well over 5 hours and not get a break.  Typically the only shifts anyone would get was 4 hours and 45 minutes but they always turned into 5."
good,"DSW is such a fun place to work when you have the right staff. However the store manager at the Kendall Gate location makes it impossible. If you enjoy being talked down to and overworked this location is definitely for you. Also if you enjoy random hour cuts and no floor coverage ever, this is for sure the place for you."
good,it was a retail job you are over worked under paid disrespected not heard the company matters more than the people its all about numbers not about how hard you worked
good,"Managers have no clue what is going on, half the other workers do not even do anything. Meetings are poor, a lot of miscommunication between managers and employees"
good,"A typical day at work would be constantly doing the same thing every shift, assisting customers when needed and getting shoes for them if needed from the back. Time Management has become a big factor during the job to keep everyone happy, but can be hard at times when you try to convince your customers to sign up or to purchase something."
good,Do not count on them to give you a solid amount of hours. The management will work you like crazy and they do NOT pay well enough for what they expect of you. Beware of them overworking you.
good,Being a part-time associate has very little benefits. I only get an employee discount and the hours are not good at least for me working on average of 8 hours per week isn't cutting it.
good,fun people but not very friendly to others. main goal is to make sales. wish to provide great customer service but very unorganized. i did not learn much besides do not wear heels to work.
good,This company is good for those who are just getting into work.  For them liking to do promotions with in tho I feel they are poor at it.
good,"customer interaction all day."
good,This specific Shoe Company is located at the mall. You meet different people every day from different parts on the country and world.
good,I had the opportunity to work at DSW and could not make it an entire year. Management is rude and inconsiderate. Your hours are dependent on the store's daily numbers. Oh and as cashier you are required to sign up customers for  the rewards program even if they don't want to.
good,The pay is excellent but the hours are horrible. You really have to stay on top of the managers about breaks/scheduling. Many managers have a set group of favorites and its noticeable.
good,"Like many companies they have been trying to cut corners. Many days i did not know when i could leave. Not only did i have to do freight, i had to put up signs, prepare for sales and clean the entire store. Management at this particular store was ok. Although the district manager and her boss would come in and make things extremely difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the women and men find the best fit for them."
good,"I enjoyed my tasks, and had no problem reaching goals. Does not have a team environment more of a Warehouse vs. Sales feel. I enjoyed the company and their views, but management staff was not efficient and did not coach."
good,Arbitrary scheduling of work hours based only on short term fluctuations in sales numbers makes it almost impossible to get enough work hours to make your position a permanent one enough to obtain any employee benefits promised when hired unless you have a bachelor degree in business.
good,Management isn't the best and there's little support from corporate. Expectations are high with little pay. Lazy coworkers. Environment can be stressful
good,"They could treat employees better.... and can make better shoes. Store could be more organized. Nicer staff and nicer managers."
good,"Perfect for it being your first or second job. You learn a lot and depending on the location, you might move up or not. Flexible with hours especially if you have a second job or school"
good,"The culture has become toxic by the pressure and negativity that is disseminated down from corporate to the management team. "
good,"I was with the company for 17 years. I was promoted from a store manager to a district manager, then to a regional manager. At the time I was laid off, I was a field manager, covering the USA. I went through many supervisors, all with no issues and always received great reviews. My last supervisor was very biased and created a hostile work environment. I was laid off due to organizational change and received an average severance package."
good,In the beginning it was fine. But after a while I discovered that DSW does not have very good organization of their time management. Unfortunately can't move up very quickly in DSW. If you would like to be promoted then DSW is not for you. Also it is part time. But if you are a student and in need of flexible hours then that is a good starting job.
good,"I love shopping at this company but that is only because DSW will do anything to make a customer happy. The employees are held to a strict code of policies and procedures, however if a customer is upset we were encouraged to do anything to keep them from complaining. The work model is changing and the labor hours are being cut so I can't speak to their model any more. If you really love retail, and being a jack of all trades, go for it."
good,Fun place with the right management.  Systems are great and opportunity to make benchmarks are numerous.  The right teams can soar.  The employee engagement program is awesome.
good,The problem I had at DSW was that I was not getting enough hours as expected but I learned how to have better customer service skills and to reach customers needs when asked.
good,"I loved the team I worked with and the job wasn’t terrible, however they cut hours drastically. It’s a good part time job but don’t expect to get a lot of hours."
good,at my time at DSW it was bittersweet. the employees are catty and spread gossip and the managers are not good at managing. there was always frustration and confusion while there I'm ready for a more structured work environment
good,"I would say the only reason I still work in DSW is simple, I have two of the greatest managers in the world. However, I also have two of the worst managers in the world. The four managers do not communicate very well and I believe that is what causes this job to become stressful at times."
good,People are great that worked in the location in Toronto when  was there.  The salary was not good and the benefits were not good either.  The people are the best there and the customers are very diverse.
good,It was a okay job to be my first job. I didn't like how they cut down the hours terribly. I was use to making 400 every two weeks. For a college students that enough to make sure I have gas and food in my home. The management wasnt the greatest the head manger was mad annoying and would fuss about any and everything. The hardest part of the job wasnt the customer but it was the mangers. Some mangers were standoffish and others were great. They added more people to the team and it seem like my part time hours got pushed back.
good,"Management was great. They really cared about the workers. It was nice interacting with the customers. However, in the day they lacked enough associate´s to cover the floors."
good,Hours are unpredictable. Management needs better training. No room for advancement. High turnover rate. Better suitable for high school students.
good,"My experience with this company was absolutely horrible. The manager of my store was immature, uneducated, and unfair. The manager let personal feelings get in the way of scheduling shifts (i.e. if you weren't a favourite, she would give you 4-4.5 hours a week and usually sent home early), would hire more people when she couldn't give out more hours to the staff she already had, and did not train us at all. The company itself is cheap. The main thing we read in the handbook is KEEP THE CUSTOMER HAPPY!! If they want a full refund for a scratch you can only see with a microscope, give it to them; if the price on the tag differs with that on the computer when it scans, honour the tag; the associates at my store were discouraged to do so, and if they did it anyway, reprimanded harshly. The manager only trained us when the DM was supposed to come in. The manager told associates that she would give shifts based on sales per hour of the previous week: she never did. The company itself is cheap, unreliable, and poor quality. The dye from the leather bled onto my feet from wearing them all day long. They did not stretch the way they were supposed to, nor did they stay wearable for long. My pay was horrible (probably because the manager never scheduled me for money making shifts). Near the end of my employment, I gave up on selling and just stood around for the number of hours I was there. I had no incentive to sell, nor did I particularly care if I met my daily sales goal. Incredibly unimpressed with the company, and my old store. I'm so happy I left."
good,"I hated working at DSW. I worked incredibly long hours and was subject to the ""extended hours"" program. When I was first hired I noted on my paperwork that I did not want to be in the program but was later guilt-tripped into it by the store manager. The extended hours program meant that I would be scheduled to work a shift from, say, 9-4, with the extended hours being from 2-4. This meant that if we were slow, I would go home at 2 and be done for the day. If we were busy, I would have to work until 4. It was frustrating not knowing when I got to work how long I would be there. This made it difficult to make plans and have a life outside of working. When I finally asked my manager to be removed from the extended hours program, she made me feel like I was being inconsiderate and a pain (which is ridiculous). "
good,"A typical day consists of shoes, accessories and the register. I learned patience is key ! you deal with alot in retail, management was okay some were terrible others werent. co workers were great. hardest part of the job is looking for a shoe that says online its in store but nowhere to be found. most enjoyable part were the happy customers"
good,Typically a day at work is not vexing. I enjoy my coworkers. The environment is relaxed to a point. The hardest part of the job is mostly being on your feet all day and dealing with upset customers. But being able to find a pleasing solution and making the customer happy and smile is certainly the best part of my day.
good,"Because it was holidays season, there was therefore more work and had demanding hours of work, which put a stain at the end of the day, however, it was a great experience because it taught me time management and how to deal with difficult situations in a short period of time, it has also taught me to multi task. co-workers were fantastic because they helped me adapt easily as it was my first serious job. the hardest part of the job had to be dealing with very ''know-it all'' customers with a very calm and collected manner, which was rather a bit difficult at first. the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people and meeting with celebrities"
good,Didn't enjoy the work environment. Liked do the tasks at hand. But never felt comfortable working there.
good,"A typical day at work would be steaming and vacuuming all floors before the doors open. Performing activities associated with shipping, receiving and placement of product within a three floor flagship location. I've learned a lot since working here like how to supervise and help employees on work and safety procedures, amazing customer service, how to maintain positive company image during difficult situations, etc. The management could be better on communication. The hardest part about my job would have to be the time I have to be at work since its so early in the morning. The best part would have to be my co-workers and what I've learned from working with this company."
good,"Working with customer is the greatest thing about this job.I love customer servicing and working with people find products for them as well as solving their problems one customer at a time.I enjoy building relationships.A little stressful when it came to management, but loved all my co-workers they made the job very enjoyable."
good,"There is not any grow within their company, its always outside and you can not grow much."
good,this was my first retail job - as you can imagine wasn't the best but i learnt from the mistakes i made & grew from it!
good,"DSW is the least stressful retail environment I have worked at. However, extreme importance is placed on the rewards program. I understand that there are business assets to protect, however, you could have one thousand reward members and no sales. Where does that get a company? They should focus more on sales."
good,"During a typical day, I would help customers on an on-going basis, and during quiet times, I would either remerchandise, price markdowns, clean, accept stock, manage paperwork, call different stores for shoe checks, add new product to the floor, and either open the store on a day shift, or close and balance till on an evening shift."
good,"A shoe retailer who is trying to be someone that they are not. They seem to think that most of their customers are there purely because of the love of shoes. they miss the point that the majority of their customers are looking for great shoes but they want them at a great price, and the customer service is not the priority."
good,There's always something to do. Whether its from being at cash register or making room for new shoes. Peak season especially during boot season gets tad messy. It's a self service store but you will get customers who leave behind messes wanting you to clean up their mess vs. the one who needs a personal shopper. Everyone pretty much get along making a hectiic day at work more relaxed and laid back.
good,"I was able to completely escape during my break while at work. The break room was in the far back of the store, away from customers and not easily noticeable."
good,Company doesn’t care about the employees because we are not the ones spending money in their products. Little chance for advancement within the company. Extremely poor management. Extremely stressful
good,"A typical day would involve help[ing customers, cleaning, performing register duties and/or markdowns. "
good,"If you're a student or just need a part-time job this is a good place for that. "
good,Nice place to work. The co-workers make it worth coming to work every day. Hours are horrible but working with great people make it bearable. Benefits are horribly over-priced and the store managers/district manager want you to work your butt off in order to get higher bonuses.
good,I use to love working for this company. They have change for the worse. They dont appeaciate their worker and some of the manager have their favorite. They dont have the same rules for everyone. They dont listen to what u have to say just shrug you off.
good,management is okay. the hours could be better. salary is low for management position. promotions are notified to the store in a very tight time line and needs to be changed which is a huge headache if we are less staffed for the day and it is busy.
good,"Town was an amazing place to grow and thrive while the company was lead by the Simpson Family, Since the sale and acquisition by DSW, Town Shoes Limited has become a cold dark place."
good,"While working at DSW I was always on closing shifts due to my days being spent at college classes. I was only scheduled until eleven every night but expected to stay until 2am to finish cleaning the store. As a college student this put a lot of stress leading to me breaking down in the back room after the end of a supposedly four hour weekend shift turned into an eight hour weekend shift. I was classified as part time and being paid part time yet I was working full time hours. It was exhausting, and I found it hard to balance school and work. If I wasn't studying at the time it probably would not have been as bad, the managers were really nice and the pay was decent."
good,"a typical work day consisted of signing in and helping re-organize/re-locate misplaced merchandise/missing merchandise. I learned about leather authenticity and was happy to assist customers choosing their right fit and style. the hardest part of the job was the management, the most enjoyable was tending to customer concerns/questions"
good,"Not exactly your typical sales associate job - very fast paced environment.  A lot is expected of select associates - not every associate is held to the same standard.  Some associates get walked on, worked too hard with very little recognition.  Atmosphere is sometimes stressful when not every associate is trained to do everything or when the store is short staffed."
good,"I enjoyed it at first, but management went downhill fast. Our lead manager had no idea what she was doing. Then the mold in the stockroom made me sick, so I knew it was time to leave"
good,"No advancement opportunities. The culture was fun, but the pay was low and raises even lower.  Managers expected to much work for the pay. And never offer worthy incentives to expect more. When you gave me you would not receive worthy compensation."
good,"Management isn't the best but it is a great place to work, very relaxed and a good mixture between fast and slow paced at times. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with customers that have a set mind on nothing you do will be good enough for them."
good,"It's just like your regular retail job. It's very micromanaged, which is frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job was the associates that I got know, and some of the managers. Most customers were great to interact with."
good,"This my very first time working in retail, and the DSW that I work at needs a bit more work on their management. They love micromanaging people, and some of them do not have the best attitude. Working there is a bit overwhelming for me since there is so much to do. They are tons and tons of shoes. I never have problems with any of the customers. It's great meeting people from all over the world."
good,Huge store with many employers. Very boring place to work. Lots of arguing. Lots of upset staff members. It's at a mall so lots of traffic on weekends
good,"No breaks if you work a 9 hour shift, just a 30 minute lunch. The Management was terrible. You will be on your feet all day, no chance to sit down at all."
good,This workplace is a good environment with decent hours but was unprofessional and did not fit my criteria of serious work and i did not  a future staying their
good,"it's has a healthy work environment. nice place to work in general. The hardest part of the job is having to stand through out your shift no matter how long, but you have a 30 minutes break if you work over 5hrs"
good,Not something I would recommend if your looking to move upwards in a company. If you have another main job and you want something on the side to make a little extra coin I would say this is a perfect job for you! Or if your a college student (or a highschool student) they are very flexible with hours. Two out of three of the managers there are the best managers I have ever had the pleasure of working with. The other one not so much but I won't talk to much on that. I was a great worker even stayed behind to help close for 2 hours because the majority of the workers called out. They don't really know how to time management so I was usually stuck cleaning up morning crews mess by time it was time to close. And I never got overtime. They are very flexible when it comes to working parents or students but the pay is so low there is literally no way anyone 25 and older is making a living out of 9.00. I worked there for 11 months and had to walk away because it just wasn't worth it plus me and one of the managers didn't get along. Overall it was an okay job I would recommend.
good,not a very stable place to work too many management changes throughout the company staff didn't get on experienced staff being let go while keeping the most inexperienced staff who really don't know a thing about retail
good,"Not that we all do not work hard, but when you are working overtime by 10-15 hours every week on a salary that allows you to live paycheck to paycheck, it is very easy to get burned out when there is no reward for your hardwork. No promotions, no work life balance, no pat on the back. However, this is not true of every single department.  There is not a good balance between departments and no one is treated the same across the company.  It's tough to see other teams get all the rewards and perks while they play and you struggle to get  ahead. I wouldn't say do not apply here but just know that DSW sells and talks a big game about being a favorite place to work, but they have a LONG way to go before the even come close."
good,This is a good job for a person just entering the management field.  It gives you a basic overview of entry level management skills.
good,standing around selling over priced shoes with bad quality  not enough hours. Management stood around like it was social hour
good,"Everyday is a different experience working will all customers to fit their needs and create an enjoyable shopping experience"
good,I currently work at DSW. The environment is respectable and so is the franchise as a whole.But I am unsatisfied with the the wages especially since they are average compared to other retailers which are less demanding. Also employees are constantly reminded of how many customers were signed up and are pressured to sign up more with little to no incentive in return for the employee.
good,"A typical day at work would be to do shortlots and be at the cash register. Co-workers were nice, but not much of an opportunity for advancement at all."
good,"when starting at this job it was very live and suitable for a person who enjoys a lively and upbeat place to work. when you get into the job first they out you in a huddle and tell you the goals for the week. the hardest part about the job is when you ask for more hours they give you the ""cold shoulder"" and deny your request but the pros to this job is that the brand of the shoes are well qualified as a brand shoe and the fact that you get a discount on it."
good,You are given training in diverse tasks and work with other team members under supervision of lead to recover store.  The most enjoyable task is talking to the customer. The least enjoyable is the heavy lifting and moving of boxes.
good,"pretty easy job, not much room for advancement. Sometimes it's who you know not what you know. co-workers are awesome. easy overall job."
good,There is not a lot of room for advancement within the company.  Departments can get silo’d. The very strong personalities can get toxic at times.
good,"Wasn't a hard job at all, actually pretty easy. But with the demands that management put on you it does make it seem like you're doing rocket science. other than that its ok."
good,"During my time with DSW I experienced bad management. The manager definitely played favorites. More than half of the employees there had open availability, myself included, but were only scheduled for a few hours per week. Then the ones who kissed up to the manager were scheduled all the time."
good,"The store was a fun place to work, the music was always playing and the customers were great. There was no rotating weekends, you worked every weekend and holiday. The management staff tried to be nice. I thought I was doing great there but I never got an evaluation and was just let go, I was told I couldn't be kept due to lack of hours and because I was seasonal"
good,(Union Square Location) Management is the problem. Everything else is ok. The 30% discount is great and you can use it on clearance items. You don't feel appreciated working there and management won't have your back. They are quick to think that the associate is the problem rather than the manager. Head store manager isn't as involved like how he used to be but acts as if he knows what's going on. Co workers are great and it's not hard to move up. They are known to give you more responsibility but no extra raise.
good,"Customer Service, working the register, connecting with our customers."
good,Working for DSW was a learning experience but the policies on what is returnable and what is'nt needs to be adjusted.
good,"There wasn't a typical day at work. It was always something new to do. My co-workers were great but that managers wasn't all that great. I've experience the managers cutting other employees down just s they could get ahead. No job security, no benefits and no way to work your way up"
good,"A typical day at work is tiring and makes you feel heavy."
good,"Everyday was something different. I learned performance and time management. I loved training staff and truly enjoyed the customer service. The hardest part of the job was dealing with staff that had very close relationships with my DM, there for making it impossible to execute action plans regarding performance. No support in these situations."
good,"Typically in retail, your job is just that, a job. I am just a cog in the machine. I am replaceable, and thus compensated as such. But I still I give my customers and managers all that i can."
good,The other associates were extremely nice and friendly however management is biased and there were few hours to go around although they are constantly hiring new paper making it harder for those who have been with the company. It is hard to become full-time and I wouldn't recommend for anyone providing for a family.
good,Liked working here for my 1st job but quickly noticed that management was up tight & nit picked at everything
good,"Forced to sign new customers up for rewards, being harassed to sign them up. Dealing with rude customers, on a daily basis. I learned to work with a diverse groups of individuals, but majority of employees did not care about their job. Management was mediocre. Management showed favoritism, and if you were not one of the favorites then you received the worst shifts. There was nothing rewarding about this job."
good,The hardest part of this job is if you want advancement also you need to be up on your business acumen.
good,This large and always growing company is fast paced. There is always something to do and the product is always changing. Come to work with a positive attitude and your days will be great. The company is really meant for SHOE LOVERS.
good,"it’s very stressful and busy on weekends, you don’t get off when you’re supposed to cause of cleaning and online orders. people are cool just management make things hard"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the wonderful people that worked there."
good,"My day starts off with either opening the store or coming in the afternoon for a closing shift, where i either prepare for the start of the day by handing out tasks for employees or checking in with the other management. As a supervisor my job is to watch over the employees every move and call them out on anything the company does not approve of all the while I have to stand up near the front of the store and greet every customer coming in to the store as though I am just a greeter. "
good,"Management seemed to never know what was going on."
good,"When working at DSW, I was constantly mistreated from other co-workers and taken advantage of. The leadership was good, very helpful. I was promoted very fast and loved it. I quit due to the environment and hostile co-workers."
good,"getting customers to sign up for the rewards program is more important than anything; you're always being pushed to berate customers and get them to sign up, not the most flexible schedule, get barely any/not consistent hours (8-24 a week generally), very little opportunities for advancement or promotions, good for someone who doesn't want to work a lot like kids in high school or if you just want something small"
good,"I was a full time student putting in almost 30 hrs a week, management was nice but we were always short staffed. Upper management is a bit unrealistic and push hard on store management,  which trickles down to the sales associate."
good,The only thing that was nice is that you did get a pretty okay discount on the merchandise. The management was pretty okay there. The customers were not usually the best. It's a good part time job for if you are a college student and need a flexible work schedule. The actual pay isn't that great.
good,"I   loved  working  at DSW , I  just  didn't  like  how one bad apple made working  there  so stressful  to the point  that I  had to leave."
good,Very hard to connect with the community outside the district. General direction given that did not work for all stores and difficult to get assistance and clarification on certain matters.Little attention paid to repairs and aesthetic but high expectation of appearance.
good,"Town Shoes Limited, owned by DSW Inc U.S. is a struggling footwear retailer that is trying to find it's niche in a changing Amazon dominated retail market. There main challenge is delivering consistently on projects since collaboration with the U.S. team is not as tight as it needs to be. Management is not top shelf. Nevertheless, it is a good opportunity to learn a few new skills, coping with chaos, and then moving on."
good,the typical day at work would be me and the other sign holders meet up and stand by the road with a 6 foot sign and hope it doesn't rain hardcore while standing out there.
good,"Retail hours are rough on anyone but they are what you would expect. "
good,Management was not very helpful. I guess you are just cleaning shoe boxes. I wanted to work my up to something more but it didn't seem that was possible.
good,"I was hired immediately which was great, job was a seasonal position. My only issue is that they had me work in clearance the whole 90 day period that consisted of mainly closing, a few days early morning before opening 6AM-11AM or 6AM-9AM and only three-four shifts during the day from 2PM-6PM or 4PM-8PM.  I told them I needed maximum 30hrs/week but I only got between 8-16hrs if they didn’t decide to change my schedule last minute (cut off hours). They didn’t train me on cashwrap (cashiering), didn’t train me on proper closing with working on the floor (men’s, women’s and kids).  I was strictly clearance. I was trained on collecting trash, holding items for customers and cleaning the bathrooms lol. They didn’t care if someone stole shoes from our store, even though they knew who the culprits were. We would have the same 3-5!people come in every other day and were successful in stealing our products. They said they’re about communication which is doubtful, considering they didn’t let me know what needed to be worked on with communicating with customers, and the manager didn’t even tell me they were letting me go after my 3 month trial , an MOD (manager on duty) did, but luckily no disappointment came from it which I guess they were expecting,  I am currently looking for a better job anyways. They wanted me to promote the DSW VIP even though I was always in clearance, never working cashier to really get a feel and become used to asking people about our program and during the days I worked they always had me doing multiple tasks at once so I couldn’t just stop what I was doing"
good,"Great experience, good colleges, flexible hours but extremely rude management. Was a good first job experience and also worked at another location with good staff. Worst part by far was on calls that almost never need you but you still hav to free your schedule for no reason just incase and find out 2 hours before very last minute."
good,"Many perks of the job were affected once the company started to undergo ownership to a corporate. Learned many ways to orient customer interaction through different types of training. Management had structure from brand manager to operations manager, which made it easier to distinguish who to go to for problems. Overall, enjoyable"
good,"Good company to work for if you are single, young and dont have any children. Room for advancement within the company if you are serious about growing with the company.Good incentives."
good,"its a good way to enter the work field, it taught me a lot about merchandising stock and customer service. if your looking into working in one of the bigger shoe stores like footlocker this is a good place to start"
good,"A job is a job and that is why I stayed at DSW shoephoria! as long as I did. You do not have an assigned desk so you would have to come in early just to find a desk and set up your computer for the shift (also you would have to clean the desk which takes up time). For the pay, I do not think what we have to go through on the daily basis was worth it. There is a high call volume everyday especially on Saturday and the customers are angry because they waited on the phone for so long. Fortunately, I had a great supervisor, however most of the supervisors/managers are lazy and simply DO NOT CARE!! I did not feel valued as an associate so that is why I left to find a new with more valued and better pay."
good,Worked at the Beavercreek Locations and the managers there were disrespectful and lazy. The environment was great and the other associates are okay. Good and easy job for a High Schooler though.
good,"Corporate rules are the reason why sometimes working at DSW seems unbearable. On a store level, things are pretty great but employees and managers are basically handcuffed by the corporate structure and unnecessary rules that are handed down by someone who has never worked in a store. Customers are permitted to verbally abuse the workers with absolutely no consequences. In fact, if a customer complains, no matter the situation, the employee is at fault. The company can't seem to make up its mind on what it thinks its employees should be doing. They create needless tasks and to top off regular duties and cause the managers and employees unneeded stress. The only reason why I enjoyed working there was the people who I worked with at a store level. Otherwise, it was clear that everyone up the ladder didn't give one thought to our well being."
good,Job was very boring and sucked the life out of me. Would not recommend to someone who is young. Dealing with constant poor management decisions and rules.
good,Not great.  Not here for associates and employees. Takes away certain discount. Doing what they can to make every penny as possible. No advancement. Store manager was horrible.
good,"I worked at DSW for 3 years, I loved working there. until my last year. They were flexible with my school schedule. Loved my managers and my job. After a new CEO came in 2016 the company changed drastically. They changed a lot of policies including wearing an apron and a less employee discount.  New policies made managers more stressed and it would reflect on the store. My last store manager was a mess. A total of 4 employees quit because of her. They only gave me 4 to 5 hours days a day. I did have opportunity to grow. They don't give health benefits to part time employees. They do expect a lot of you. If you are a cashier, the rewards system was one of the worst parts of the job. Managers would push you to force customers to sign up. They would constantly talk to you if you didn't get enough sign ups. They would favor the employees that got more sign ups. I did enjoy talking to some great customers about shoes, but you would get a lot of rude customers. The company was amazing when I first started in 2014 but sadly it changed so much I had to quit.  I would recommend for a seasonal job or a first job to get experience."
good,no one ever did anything to stop how other coworkers treated me. The manager sat with me to discussed why I was late sometimes even though I would show up 10 to 15 mins before my shift.
good,"At DSW Shoephoria the days vary. You never know what you are going to get. There are fast days and there are slow days. The good thing about the job are the people you get to work with. Everyone there are pretty friendly. Hardest thing is the schedule at the job, They go by their needs. Mandatory 3 second shift days out of your work week."
good,"The typical day was easy but fast paced, packing shoes and sending them down the line. I learned how to move at certain speeds and communicate better. The hardest part was standing for a period of time"
good,"I enjoy interacting with my coworkers and look forward to seeing them, but the company does not pay enough for everything us employees do and there are minimal extrinsic rewards."
good,"You're on your feet 24/7, The management is terrible right now except for Kenna (it was way better back before January), The pay is decent ($9 per hour), and the employee discount is 30% but you can't use it on clearance. Oh AND they have never given me a single promotion or raise. On my one year I got an extra 10% off one time use discount card with an expiration date, what a joke."
good,"DSW has really been struggling keeping people. The DSW I worked at lost about 4 people since I had worked there in the summer because of people quitting.  The pay was not worth what the managers put us through.  The managers never seemed to be organized together, they each had their own plans so it was different each time I came in.  Half of the managers micro-managed and made you feel like a child.  If you need a summer job and you don't have any other options, then sure. Apply. But I would suggest finding another job elsewhere."
good,"I enjoyed working here, however like most retail part-timers, hours were up and down and if you are looking for something reliable, this is not the best choice."
good,The job was a good environment but just did not have the right management to take the store to the next level as well had no room for improvement and opportunists for employees
good,"My time at Town Shoes greatly benefitted my retail expertise however the store I worked in was never busy enough (except at sale time) to make it worth while. We were given the option of minimum wage or commission if we met the quota however the store rarely met its own quota as a whole let alone for each individual employee. However, the staff was wonderful to work with and the store offered a wide range of different shoe brands which broadened my shoe knowledge and allowed me to use the employee discount without a second thought."
good,"i hate retail, maybe thats why i didnt like it but they will surely overwork you especially if youre a good employee.  i found myself working every single saturday unless i took it off.  management was not fair or considerate in that category.  being a young girl who works hard and comes into work just about everyday should be considered a saturday off because i work it every single week."
good,"Mostly they loop you in with a company culture, meanwhile upper management only cares about themselves - not the associates in the building who are actually interacting with the customers every day."
good,"After 4 years of working for this company I have seen a lot of changes, additions, and improvements. The past year my work experience there has gone down hill. While the types of managers you encounter vary greatly, as well as the associate staff, it ultimately can depend on which store you end up working in. The customer base can be quite temperamental and rude in one store, then can be courteous and kind in another. Higher management needs a decent amount of tuning and improvement, they need to start listening and helping the associate and assistant manager staff. They fail to listen to the needs of not just their employees, but also the customer at times. The constant change in policies and procedures makes working for the company very difficult. The constant cuts in payroll make correctly staffing a store very difficult too. Scheduling in general is also very inconsistent and broken. Should you work for this company, all I can say is do your best and don't let yourself be stepped on."
good,"If you're looking for a job for some extra $ in your pockets while a student, it is a great option to work here. But if you are trying to pay your rent, provide for your house etc. I wouldn't suggest working here. They make you do more than you're paid for, honestly. It's really not worth it unless you're working for the heck of it. Barely any hours, when given hours it'll be either super early in the morning or at night. Nobody ever likes to help out, just tells you to do a bunch of stuff while they sit in the cozy office."
good,"It had its good days and bad, just like any other job. Some incredible people, and some people I never want to see again. The job can definitely be stressful at times considering we had so much to do all the time, but in the end I made some wonderful friends. It was just time to go."
good,great everybody work together and get along well. They work schedule is flexible. They need working on better shoe policy and employee relations to better service the community they do business in.
good,"Professional workplace that requires long work hours and excellent customer services. "
good,I loved the discount but hated working in retail. It is not my thing. I love to shop but hate to work here. It was an interesting place to work and I built alot of friendships here.
good,"It was okay. Fast paced, but gets repetitive and boring after a while. There was too much pressure to sign up customers for rewards so it made it into a bad working environment in the end. But my coworkers were awesome and managed to make some new friends, so I was happy with that."
good,It is a high-volume retail store. You would have to be able to multitask and get things done. A typical day would be customer servicing while trying to keep the store clean and neat.
good,"A typical day working at DSW is a fairly laid back environment. The hardest part of the job was ensuring everyone that came in the door had a pleasant experience, Not that it was hard, just wanted to do my best to please everyone."
good,"Customer service is one of the most rewarding occupations that exist which is what you learn at this position. It is so nice to make other smile and being happy about their purchases. On a day to day basis, the sales associate had to make each customer smile, present the products in details and made sure the store looked presentable. The management team was friendly enough to take recommendations into accounts. The hardest part of the job was seeing a customer leave without finding the right product for themselves; and the reverse of this was the most enjoyable part of the job, having a customer so happy with their purchases that they would give the sales associate a hug."
good,Decent place to work.  Management lacks developmental qualities that you would find elsewhere in the retail industry.
good,Nothing really bad to say about company other than it needs to have more culture for assoc to flourish. I feel there is also a need for more assoc to advance and currently they don't have that
good,Best coworkers but unorganized company. It's a fun experience working there but you feel discouraged because the company does not seem to care about the workers. You can get fired from literally anything without a chance to explain.
good,"DSW is a great place to work. The fact that they are very customer centered makes the issues that arise with customers go that much smoother. However, I do feel that the company practices ""bait and switch"" techniques. They tell you they will do one thing, but do a complete other! If you can live with that kind of job, then you may be able to work with DSW."
good,The company really focuses on customer service and making sure that the customer finds our store to be an enjoyable place to shop. On a typical day I am usually on the floor executing our 4 essentials for customer service and engaging with customers. I also checkout customers at the register or with our tablet device which provides for a speedy check out. An aspect that is stressed is to get reward sign-ups on the floor and on the registers to keep our customers coming back to our store with coupons and discounts. The work environment is friendly and very easy to make friends and work with peers.
good,DSW is an okay place to work for a college student. That's about it. You get paid just a little more than minimum wage. They are flexible on the scheduling that's why I believe it's a good fit for a student in college. There's really no incentive for anything. It's possible to move up into managerial positions as long as you're good at kissing butt. I've been there for 2 years and I am ready to get out.
good,Working at DSW was a great time. Everyone got along very well and the management was great.
good,"The discount was the real reason to stay. The managers were also forgiving and flexible with the scheduling. The corporate values were a bit off though- the head of the store where I worked suffered from a heart attack the day before Black Friday and was dismissed from his post shortly after by the Regional Manager. Turnover of employees was high and although I stayed for quite awhile relative to this, there was no opportunity to advance whatsoever."
good,Its all about customer service but they forget about their employees.
good,I worked as a sales associate at DSW and spent most my time on the register ringing out sales. I also learned how to unload truck shipment and stock the sales floor. The one negative thing I have to say about DSW is the inconsistency with management. In the year I worked at my store I had 10 different managers who would all retrain the employees to do things their way. I really liked my fellow coworkers and loved being able to connect with customers.
good,Enjoyable
good,"Its a great company to work for dont get me work, Ive worked there for almost four years but sometimes its very hard to manage school and work. The management before were great which is why I stayed for so long but once changes begin thats where it fell apart."
good,Easiest retail management position. Company focuses on their cultural values and attempts to promote fun throughout the entire organization.
good,"DSW is a great place to work ,but it lacks respect . Employees are not treated as part of a team. I would describe it as Managers vs. Employess. I learned how to keep my cool in a lot of situation. The most enjoyable part of my day is helping customers."
good,Great place to work if you are looking for something part time.
good,"working for dsw was something i did for fun, the enviroment was for the most part a fast paced one there were days where we had down time and also the managers were great sometimes the pay was minimum wage and the manager recieve commisson for the sales u made but overall it was a good fun job."
good,"constant micro management of how you deal with customers i.e. using their phrases like ""shoe lover,"" ""if you need anything let me know I'm here for you."" they prioritize getting customer signups so you'll be forcing people to sign up when cashing them out. the less sign ups you get, the less time on cash which means less shifts. other than that, the people are good to work with and the atmosphere is good."
good,"Typical retail work not overly demanding"
good,"I've been at DSW for over a year now, and the best thing about working there is the other employees. They quickly become your close friends and I look forward to seeing them when I go in. However for the work you are expected to do you are not paid enough. This job is best suited for a summer job, or for people who don't pay rent. If you pay rent, have bills, or have other expenses every month I would recommend finding another job. The hours can vary wildly from 30 one week to only about 10 the next. plus getting paid bi-weekly makes it hard to save. The managers are nice and mean well but don't always take your life outside the company into account."
good,"The truth is that it is very typical of retail here in Columbus. Retailers here tend to be stressful, and challenging places to work. It is no better or worse than any other place. For me at that time in my life it wasn't a good fit. But it isn't a bad place. It isn't a great place either. I wouldn't recommend anyone relocating for a retail job in Columbus, it isn't going to be anything that you expect. I will say that they pay you well to deal with the stress, long hours and sometimes unreasonable expectations."
good,"I have worked at two different locations now, and both have the issue of managers trying to have a power distance with the associates. Many managers have been at the company shorter than I have but put all my experience down the drain because they do not really care to learn from others. I love the people I work with though, although they tend to be cliquey with managers which is highly inappropriate for a job."
good,"You'll spend the day (as a sales associate) cleaning the floor, putting out new shoes, shifting shoes to create more space, helping customers find/try on shoes, and ringing up customers. "
good,"I worked there for about a year during my senior year of high school. decent pay and hours, but only if the manager was willing to work with you. They were were very rude when it came to scheduling and it ended up costing them many of the employees due to early resignation. In the end the store ended up having the management being completely restructured."
good,"Fairly slow, I generally worked in the mornings (9-5) and maybe saw 20 clients at most in my 8 hour shift. They demand a lot from you considering your pay."
good,I loved working with shoes but the managers didn't communicate and caused a lot of strain on the employees and very little guidance. Was doing all the stores merchandising and wasn't be paid extra or more to do more work.
good,"-sell shoes"
good,"There were good and bad things about DSW, just like any other job. I found DSW to be disorganized and often felt like i was being overworked and not recognized for it."
good,Need to do better at advertising and clienteling. Most customers are not loyal. Very quiet most of the year. Never get a good amount of sizes. Management is always changing. Doesn't help employees when constant changes arise.
good,"Training is taken seriously and skills (customer care, merchandising, cashiering, store operations) are taught early. Most days are spent on the sales floor dealing with customers. Employees are open and welcoming. Customer service can be the hardest part of the job but also the most rewarding for an individual that likes meeting new people each day."
good,"DSW as a company strives to attain customer satisfaction through discounts, lenient return policies and customer service. Yet, for it's employees, employee satisfaction is insignificant. The turnover rate for how often employees quit upon getting hired is high. Accountability often falls on associates instead of management, when oftentimes associates are doing what they are told to do by management. Additionally, associates face heavy pressure to enroll customers into the company's loyalty rewards program in which some associates feel the need to commit ""rewards fraud"" by creating fake accounts for customers to avoid being reprimanded for their failed attempts at new enrollments."
good,"DSW was great over all. Very easy going job. I ultimately left because they gave very short shifts (no more than 5 hours at a time), asked employees to go home early if it was slow, and paid nearly minimum wage."
good,"Either very busy or lots of down time"
good,"During the weekdays, there were certain hours where it is super slow and certain hours where it was super busy. During the weekends, it is always busy and crowded. The hardest part of the job was the lack of staff because during the weekdays, there would only be like 2-3 people working at a time and sometimes you can be the only associate working so pretty much everything was on your shoulders and you have to do everything on your own. The management was poor because it was very unorganized and they don't train you well because you either learn from the online training or other associates like pretty much you are being trained by another sales associate and not a manager. Working there was very stressful and very unorganized."
good,"it was my favorite place to work until one of the managers left and he was replaced by someone else. the new manager was very rude! never seemed to be happy with anyone's work. I think some more of the original managers have left and every time I shop there, there seems to be a decline in customer service and overall friendliness."
good,"Working at DSW is learning how to keep a workplace clean and presentable. The hardest part about the job was that it seemed that the managers didn't really care for the employees, but more of how the company represented it self. Other than that, everything is good for a first retail job."
good,Its your typical retail job you come in do your work and punch out. If you do a good job you get hours if not then you don't. If you are looking to move up you just have to be lucky and have someone leave. Right now they are cutting back a bit.
good,Fun fast paced work place. You get good discounts on shoes. Can be very stressful at times when we’re super busy. There is always somthing to be done. Never boring.
good,"A typical work day for morning shift is to clean the floo,r putting shoes back in the right place, finding the other shoe to make a pair, cleaning mirrors and windows, going to get shipment and put up to 80 boxes of shoes out in the right spot. putting out new accessories out everyday. Then when the store is open helping customers, ordering shoes, finding the right size. "
good,"It was fun when I worked there it was just extremely hard to work with managers about scheduling, I earned $9.50 an hour starting as seasonal and then transitioning into part-time."
good,"- discount on shoes is amazing"
good,"After working there for 2+ years i had went through 4 different store managers so there was never any consistency with managers, each having different ideas on how to run the store. Also the hours were horrible because they would give the same people closing shifts and leave a messy store for them to clean up."
good,"The lead manager while I was there was very sexist. She only liked males. If a male worker did anything, she would let it slide, but when a female worker would do the same thing she would flip out."
good,"A typical day at work involves greeting and assisting customers. The hardest part of this job is dealing with difficult customers. I learned that each person has their own version of common sense, and it might not match your own."
good,This job is great if you want to stay as an associate. Once you are promoted its a whole new level of exceptions and stress. The work environment isn't bad all of the employees are really friendly.  This job is very demanding with little reward in return.
good,"Although head office seemed unenthusiastic when it came to supporting it's employees in stores, The Shoe Company provides excellent training, is willing to go through positive policy and system changes for the benefit of it's employees, productivity as well as it's customers and gives their employees great opportunities to thrive as a team."
good,it was my second time working at DSW. when I left the first time my manager said that if I moved back to NJ and needed a job to come and I have a job. and when I left for a new job that offer still stood.
good,Management challenges staff but does little to empower their decision making skills. Payroll is tight and expectations are high with decreased foot traffic.
good,Didn't enjoy working here. My hard work was never noticed and I got in trouble for things that weren't apart of my job description or things I had no control over. Very gossip filled environment.
good,"Cleaning, organizing, and sales."
good,"It's a generally happy and positive workplace. It is hard to advance within the company and they salary isn't as competitive as you'd hope. But, you do get free shoes so that's nice."
good,Hard work and a fast place environment is rewarding. Great co workers that help in every area of the warehouse. I enjoy my lead he works hard and willing to give a helping hand as needed.
good,"Many of the other co-workers and I work efficiently and complete tasks as a team and individually. Being employed at Town Shoes has furthered my customer service skills. As I enjoy shoes and fashion, my workplace has furthered my shoe and product knowledge."
good,"It was usually busy but the teamwork was poor. There was a lack of communication and organization. Managers would make me perform tasks out of my responsibilities, or distract me to talk about their personal life. Sales associates had too much pressure to make customers sign up but I learned ways to speak with customers and make their shopping experience more convenient. The best part of the job was not always being watched by all the managers."
good,It was cool with cool management but too strict when pushing credit cards or other customer benefits. They work with your schedule. Great co workers and love to talk to the customers. Hardest part was moving and cleaning since I was the only male there. but overall not bad of company
good,"This place can be fun, but it is also a lot of work. It is not just selling shoes, it is also cleaning up after the customers who don't seem to know how to put things back. It is also dealing with a lack of professionalism from management, and always having to train new employees for that reason. It seems to be that every manager has their own set of rules."
good,"A typical day at DSW included; getting into work and receiving my work area for the day, as well as my daily goals. Greeting and servicing customers. Promoting membership sign-ups. Merchandise locator via web and telephone. Cashing out customers, assuring their satisfaction with their service and purchase. Merchandise pricing and restocking. As well as maintenance of the store. As for the management, it was very good at first, but shortly after became very unstable with managers constantly coming and going. DSW was a very diverse place, with employees of all ages and races. Which was great. Everyone got along and worked together very well. The hardest part of the job for me, I would have to say was also the part of the job that was the most enjoyable, and that was the product knowledge. It was pretty challenging to learn so much about hundreds of items, but at the same time it was fun to learn so much about things that I had a specific interest in. DSW was a pretty decent place of employment. Certainly a good place to work if you're trying to extend your customer service skills."
good,"My manager was terrible. The job was quite boring and no one was helpful with training. My experience was bad, but I'm pretty sure it was just my location"
good,"The job I did was fun and busy. I worked with a team of four people which requires us to transport freight from loading dock into store. We broke down freight and then loaded all items on to sales floor within four hours before store opens for business. Once the store is open we are to clean up and help with customer service, cashier, shoe checks, and any other issues that arises."
good,"*Great staff"
good,Great company but should broaden the spectrum of managers they have. Can feel as if you're at a sweatshop. Your coworkers and your customers are usually the bright spot of the job.
good,It was a good job where I developed excellent customer service and develop comfort with explaining and informing customers the products being sold.
good,If the right people are there it can be really fun and pretty easy. bringing out new shoes and taking back the old ones. the main thing is keeping the store clean while helping the customers find what they are looking for. what sucks is it felt impossible to move anywhere. you were always stuck at the bottom. but it was a cool second job with easy scheduling.
good,A typical day at work is attempting to make the customers as happy as possible. I learned that making other people happy is the best thing that i can do in my life. my management team are helpful when they want to be. My co-workers are some of the best people I have ever met. There are no hard parts of my job I aim to make every experience a learning experience. The most enjoyable part of working at DSW is making sure my customers all walk out happy.
good,Typically I am placed at the register to carry out POS transactions.  I've learned how to check for credit card fraud with customers in addition to ensuring that the customer has purchased the correct products.  Management stays on the sales floor along with associates and are always on hand to assist with any problems or concerns. The hardest part of the job is keeping areas clean after customers shop in a specific area.  The most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer smile from a kind comment on their choice in shoes or genuine interest
good,"great place to work  while in school. Mostly greeting and helping customers, Managemnet is good, the hardest part of the job dealing with angry customers but hardly ever happens, the most enjoyable part is the shoes and helping customers."
good,"I love working at DSW, however I wish they would Allow Full time employees to attend school."
good,"The flexible schedule is really beneficial for college students as a means to earn some money while in school. Advancement is not very easy and if you are promoted, you are usually moved to a new store. It's a good part-time job."
good,All daily aspects of running a retail store.
good,"Worked on the sales floor and cash register. I had great co-workers. The job was enjoyable meeting new people and being around all those shoes. However, the retail work environment is not for me."
good,"A typical day at work was providing customer service, straightening,putting stock out, working cash register occasionally,and cleaning mirrors and bathrooms at the end of the night. The management always made sure everything was done by the end of the night. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the mirrors. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with coworkers and interacting with customers."
good,Must adapt to standing up for long periods of time. Product knowledge will be to taught to further enhance engagement and sales. A very friendly environment were one is capable of interacting with associates and customers which is the fun part of the job.
good,"DSW Shoes is one of the leading discount designer brand shoe stores. A typical work day consist of providing great customer service to all shoe lovers. Enjoyment comes with the success of finding the right shoe for the right occasion and knowing that the customer made the right choice with your assistance. Patience and appreciation for the retail customer is learned with every work day. At times it could be difficult understanding the expectation with the lack of consistency in some areas as well as the lack of leading by example. Overall with the right leadership team, it is a good place to work if you enjoy retail."
good,"The job is pretty much laid back. You greet customers most of the time and assist them if they need assistance. The store is self-serve so a lot of the time the customer can find their own shoes, they just want your opinion."
good,I do alot of hands on with the customers.
good,It was a fairly easy going job. The most demanding part was customer service but overall good experience.
good,competitive wages depending on sales. with great sales skills it's easy to make more than what you expect. friendly staff and management. customer service and satisfaction was a priority at all times.
good,"There are a ton of shoes that this company has up for sale, but sadly their are better deals online so it is hard to help people in person who wish to just by given shoes online instead of purchasing them from DSW."
good,I worked at The Shoe Company. To be honest the people I worked with were fantastic. I There’s not really room for advancement at all. It’s a decent job for anyone in high school though. Also corporate puts way too much pressure on loyalty conversion. training is done poorly and you pretty much learn as you go. Not enough staff for the amount of things needed to be done and there was no motivation to drive sales.
good,"DSW is a decent job. If you like variety days and a constant changing work schedule then you will enjoy it. They are not focused on promoting from within (for management). You will find it difficult to network with other mgmt as everyone stays in their own locations. Best strategy. Get in, learn some new skills and move on."
good,"I work there for 1.5 years and rotated through both entry level position from sales and stock. It’s a standard retail job, you just do this to get through school or to put yourself in a better position. But I wouldn’t recommend doing it full time, the burnout is rather quick. It’s really hard to get a promotion in your own store, you’re better off interviewing for a higher position at another store. They give you so many tasks that you feel stretch way too thin, but get penalized for not completing all tasks. Management has hard time communicating with each other so you’ll get a lot of mixed mixed messages. They also have a hard time communicating with you and can be very rude. They only pro is the schedule is very flexible amongst most retail. And you ge your schedule at least 2-3 weeks in advance which is very nice. More retail stores should follow this policy."
good,"Can be fun place to work with right crew, fast paced and a need to think as you go to keep on top of things. Different levels of management so you can come and grow into new roles."
good,Helping customers throughout the day made the job enjoyable. The hardest part was cleaning up the messes that customers made. The most enjoyable part was working with great people and meeting people.
good,• friendly co-workers • great working environment • higher up/management/CEOs made it seem like your opinions and complaints mattered • the company it was ok
good,the environment at dsw was okay. the hardest part of this job was being acknowledged for your hard work. most enjoyable was i got to meet nice people.
good,"Good place for a part time job, flexible with your hours. Alot alot of dealing with customers. Pretty laid back job. Good discount for employees, and if you love shoes!"
good,"This was a relaxed workplace, casual attire. My typical day included assisting customers with finding correct shoe sizes at our location or another location, ensuring aisles were clear of shoes, putting shoes back in their boxes and back on the shelf... Ringing out customers on the register..."
good,pay was too little. the only training i recieved was watching video they provided on an ipad. Managment had no idea who I was when I got there on my first day. they had no idea that their GM hired someone new
good,It was a cool job for its time but it gets very hot in warehouses an it was hot. But it was fast pace so the days would go quick an i was good at my job so it made it fun
good,"My experience with Shoe Warehouse was an interesting one. When I worked there I learned a lot about how to do retail. It really helped me when I moved on to other jobs. However, when working, there are just a handful of workers including the store manager that knows how to do their jobs. From my experience, there were some employees who were lazy when working. You are on your own when it comes to working there. Management is difficult because they sometimes don't listen to your availability or when you book things off. I had to work back to back shifts while studying for back to back exams, and management did not care. You are on your own."
good,"As far as retail goes, it could be a ton worse. I would recommend it to someone in college looking for part time work. I like everyone that I work with but there is little room for advancement and the hours are not consistent. Register for me can be stressful just because of the pressure to enroll people to the VIP program. Sales floor and clearance are more relaxed. All the tasks you preform are easy to learn and pick up. There is nothing actually ""hard"" about this job except for pleasing everyone around you."
good,"A very nice place to work at. Management was okay, but could be improved. The hours were very flexible especially for a student. However, they continued to send workers home after working 2h sometimes if they were not busy, which was not fair for some because they were travelling far and were being sent away after working a few hours."
good,"The main points of being a sales associate at DSW is to meet your daily sales and help people on the floor and phone. Overall, it was an ok job, but didn't like management."
good,"Good retail store to work for. Had the opportunity to take challenges."
good,"daily the task at hand was very stressful, staff was unpredictable,"
good,Nice enough environment with co-workers. Managers using fear as a reinforcer for behaviours Improper time management for employee tasks leaving most of the tasks rushed before closing
good,"enjoyed my time there just wished there was more opportunities to advance in the company"
good,Could pay an experience driver of 16 years more money than a trainer. Was promised top pay before orientation but when started working only received trainer pay. And still 7 months later I'm still at trainer pay.
good,Good company to work for. Flexible scheduling. Mall setting with emphasis on children's happiness. In the Port Charlotte Town Center with separate doors for later hours.
good,Overall great culture. The pay could be more for internal promotion.  The managers picked aren't always a fit for the store they are chosen for. A bad manager can ruin a good team
good,Worked at Shoe Warehouse while I was pregnant. They were accommodating for when I needed to take a break and sit for a few minutes. I was able to multitask with shipment processing and customer service.
good,"DSW was extremely fast paced, especially around the spring time as multiple sales were going on simultaneously. Overall it was an easy place to work in, I easily caught on to the fundamentals."
good,"Stock associate, not many hours, but good job. Greeted customers and assisted with retrieving and suggesting shoes. Organized and maintained clean and orderly shelfs, sorting shoes by design, size, and gender."
good,DSW is the type of job that is great for supplemental income or as a seasonal job.  It is a typical retail job which includes learning about the products we sell and day-to-day operations and sales goals.
good,Townshoes Limited is a great company to work for with good benefits. The company stands behind their values and helps you work towards your own goals.
good,Senior leadership plays favorites.  Company direction confusing and last minute.  Seems disorganized at head office.  Good people in store have to deal with lots product movement and cant focus on customer.
good,"Great opportunity to work with a new platform."
good,"The job itself is nice, calm, and easy. Some of the managers would not leave you alone and endlessly nag at you. One of them is a leader and is more of a friend which makes working there nice."
good,Only worked here for a month.  Not long enough to review.  Loved the discount.  A girl can never have too many shoes.  The drive on weekends got to be long.  The product was good quality.
good,Was a good job I enjoyed doing flexible hours easy going there was plenty of opportunity to move up and I enjoyedd selling  shoes and also wearing them
good,Good enough of a job for a high school graduate trying to pay for gas money and the occasional night out. It was an overall good experience and humbling to say the least.
good,"great work environment, solid coaching from management, good overall atmosphere, poor salary and benefits good job for a part time employee going to school."
good,I learned that time is everything. You always stay busy at any job which was a good thing. Working together and as a team no one failed at DSW. The management team and team leads were very understanding and helpful.
good,Fairly relaxed company. Management is fairly helpful and wants you to succeed. If you make a mistake you are not condemned for it. Unfortunately calls are back-to-back for the entire shift. Customers have to wait hours for a call back and are always complaining about it.
good,Working environment is very friendly. Feel very comfortable to learn new staff and never hesitated to ask if I am not sure. Enjoying dealing with different types of customers. Feel bad if I cant find the thing client is looking for.
good,"I loved working at DSW. I learned a lot about how to work together as  a collaborative work team. The managers were great with welcoming me to the tea and showing me my way around the job. Everyone was kind, caring, understanding, and fun to be around. There was not really any hard parts of the job. It's truly a great place to work."
good,Good first job. It was my first PT job and I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I fit in. The location I worked at closed due to undisclosed reasons.
good,"A typical day at work consist of having a gladiator/or a rf gun and you walk around the warehouse scanning items with barcodes,like shoes and accessories."
good,"There are certain managers that don't help out at all but there are ones that help out to get out early. Fast paced and a bit stressful, lots of work."
good,I enjoyed working with people there but that job was not meant for me. I did not enjoy fixing shoes all day long. I did my work and got the job done in the end of the day.
good,Pretty much was one of my first jobs that I applied for to get some spending money. I learned how to deal consumers and how to make management's job easier by being the best I could.
good,i haven't worked there in many years but what i can remember is that they do stress you into getting people to sign up for the free rewards membership. That't the only thing that i didn't like about working there.
good,"It's a decent place to work, and flexible. Plus, discount!"
good,"It was a very simple job. It was ok to work in but not something forever."
good,This company is very busy. Only good thing is the discount and helping customers. Breaks are really good. Flexible with hours.Hardest part of the job is having to clean up after customers for four hours.
good,good company lots of customer service and cleaning after customers tablet allowed easy access around the so store important to let customers know shoes can be shipped from other stores
good,"This was my second job at the time.  It was really just temporary for me until I could find something more steady.  Unfortunately, it just was not the job for me."
good,Good place to gain experience leadership and make some easy molney even though its extremely boring but its good if you want to work and read a book at the same time
good,"Honestly, retail is tough. Some people may enjoy walking up and down aisles all day getting turned down when offering help, but I didn't. On a typical day, you'd normally just try to kill time by organizing shoe sizes and/or talking to co-workers (which usually doesn't end well) while watching customers clearly need help but still turn down your offer. The management was pretty nice, they were very relaxed but a little too relaxed, never really taking things seriously, even theft... In the end it's personal preference if you like retail or not, but I certainly didn't."
good,Working at DSW was mostly fun. You are always on your feet and helping customers. I learned good time management skills and good customer service skills.
good,"When I first started DSW I was a part timer, and when my school situation changed I moved up to full time. So I was there for more than 20 hours. The Pros: DSW has an app where you can post and pick up shifts but they had to be approved by a maneger. That was one cool thing, PTO is available depending on what maneger feels like giving to you. Your co workers become family to you. And I honestly enjoyed working there because of the fun times I had. The Cons: The rewards program. They stress there employees out like crazy to get rewards from people. They dont understand that some customers just want to shop and not have associates in there faces asking them to sign up for rewards"
good,easy tasks to do but being thorough and efficient is important. Store management is very poor. Dress code is casual. Is both slow and fast pace at times.
good,"The Shoe company is a great place to work part-time, as you will learn important customer service skills. Easy to balance work while you are still in school and have other social obligations. Otherwise like other retailers hours are unpredictable."
good,Great job for getting through college. Paid unfairly. Good values for the company to promote returning customers but did not pay associates anything that they could live off of. I worked this job during my last couple of semesters of college.
good,"Its´s not a bad job to have, you dont get many hours. And cleaning up shoes every time you work gets stressful. Customers are messy. Clearance is crazy."
good,"I had gotten the job in june 2016 and only planned on keeping it for the summer to make a little extra money, i stayed until september 2016. i loved this job, the people i worked with were fun and had great laughs"
good,They are as a company trying many new things to compete with an expand and challenging retail environment. The company while I was with them had it challenges but in the end the company is has best intentions for it staff and customers.
good,Company was unorganized and unprofessional in their management approach. Management staff were constantly against each other and undermining the work done
good,"The shoe company is a great place to work, if you can handle it. They use very aggressive sales tactics and attempts to enforce it upon everyone while disregarding the way you choose to communicate with customers. Statistics are everything, and these stats literally determine if you work, and how much you work. If you are an amazing employee and your boss loves you, you'll have a great time. If not, you will be fighting for your job."
good,The Shoe Company has great potential yet still there were no customers due to poor management. staff was not motivated which effects the performance of the store.
good,"The employee recognition is not quite the best, and there is much to be improved over management style and the negative culture within the workplace. Otherwise, it's a relatively lenient and relaxed retail experience."
good,Job wasn't ideal at all. You are always being micromanaged throughout the day. Which can lead to stress and trying to over work just to impress the supervisors.
good,"Very fashionable call center , while working here i was able to adapt to other styles also learn how to place myself in other people shoes as if I was the customer and how would be the reasonable to handle an issue ."
good,Have to be good selling the rewards program to customers and I think that is the hardest part because that might not be everyone's strong point. They put a lot of effort and emphasis into their rewards program but if you can't sell too well you might be a little miserable. A lot of interaction with customers and always in movement.
good,it was a good job just alot of standing on your feed so you would need to wear comfortable shoes and the people you would have worked with was great
good,Management is willing to work with you if you have other schedules that are conflicting.  Many opportunities to train to learn other portions of the job.
good,"In an ever evolving industry, DSW tries their best to stay current and relevant. They strive to be America's favorite place to work and have made strides towards that goal."
good,"Always something to do, learned new information about shoes and how to work at a fast paste. Management was acceptable. The most enjoyable part was seeing how customers were pleased with their new shoes"
good,As my first job I felt the training lacked a certain importance due to the fact the managers just wanted things done fast. That's understandable but to ignore and just put someone who has never had a job before onto a register and assume they know what's going on is terrible. I self taught myself as much as I could and when I would ask it wasn't their priority. I felt uncomfortable and out of place.
good,"It was fun in the beginning. We were always busy because we were a new store. Once the newness died down, reality kicked in. We received new managers and things changed. I was working more than I was getting paid. HATED IT!!!"
good,not bad for a first job. good place to get job experience as a student. would never work there again but it was an easy job in high school. it was very boring at times and got tedious.
good,"When the store is busy, it's an easy place to work in, as most associates are used to fast-paced work environnements. Management is extremely friendly and likeable; not as efficient training however they look out for its employees. Perfect customer service is a must at all times while interacting with customers as well as quick and efficient tasks to be done."
good,"it was good., learned quite a bit at first and it was a good learning experience in the retail aspect for being an employee within the establishment .."
good,"they push you to sell with no commission. they expect you  to be on call twice weekly, They illegally change your payday if a holiday falls on that week. they promise you full time hours after working with them for 3 months. DSW does not hire full time unless you are a manger they have 6 in one store, lucky if you get 10 hours per week. Townshoes is the company that pays you."
good,"A typical day of work depends on what shift you have. Openers vacuum store and closing people depend on what role you were given by managers that day. There is cleaning bathrooms/break room, vacuuming back of store, cleaning mirrors, doing trash, and possibly restocking clearance or doing other put backs. Sometimes we have to stay late and check every column of shoes for any mixups. "
good,Provided customer service by assisting customers with their shoe purchases and cashiering. I also worked in the markdown area marking down clearance merchandise.
good,it wasn't my cup of tea..people that shopped their were rude and messy. too much high school drama. too much work for the little pay you got and the management weren't very good. They act like kids too when they are not so young anymore.
good,"It is a great place to work that develops interpersonal skills, builds knowledge of shoes, and provides a great deal of experience in the work field. It is a fun place to work."
good,"This job was my first job and I enjoyed it very much as a first job. Coming back to virigina, I applied again but didn't get it. Which was very annoying since I didn't leave on bad terms."
good,"Get to work , punch in and start organizing shoes and help customers. I learned how to communicate with different types of people in different situations good and bad and how to handle them in a professional manner.  Management was okay.  Hardest part of the job was being overwhelmed with the customers demands.  Enjoyable part about the job was being able to help with the customers needs and making them feel satisfied"
good,A typical work day at Town Shoes was filled with fun and excitement. Working with the enthusiastic team was enjoyable. I had a the most dedicated hard working team at Town Shoes. It was a pleasure to work with the greatest team ever. We all learned together how to overcome the obstacles and challenges on a daily basis.
good,"Overall, the job is very simple. If you love interacting with people this job is for you. This position focuses on being fast and communicating with customers as much as possible. Not to say that is a bad thing, but it personally is not for me. It's important that you make people feel comfortable and be inviting. Make sure that customers know if they need anything they can come to you. Frequently offer your assistance. It's important to smile and have a bubbly personality. Offer to check them out on the sales floor if they're paying with a card. Also offer to order products for them if they can't find what they're looking for. As I said before the job itself wasn't bad. It was pretty simple, but it's not for me."
good,"Lots of fun, very good music. Shoes from many different designers , great coworkers. Never a dull moment. Many customers order lots of shoes throughout the day. Very fast paced"
good,"Working with DSW Inc. was an enjoyable yet rememberable experience. Management was enjoyable because we got to use our own input daily. The environment was fast paced and very interactive, you could help anywhere 30-200 people per your shift. I learned that people shop with a purpose, even if they are just browsing they are there for a purpose. It is up to you as a salesperson to identify with them and find out what that purpose is."
good,"While a fun and challenging place to work, the upper management (DM's and area managers) failed to provide reasonable training, or useful criticisms"
good,"DSW is a customer oriented company, where  the customer is always the most important person. Associate are trained on all aspects of the company, with the experience we receive it makes us rounded in all aspects of the company."
good,"This was a great store with friendly people, but the hours are too much for my life. I'm a full time student and I wanted to work part time, but the hours are nearly full-time. I fell so far behind in school because I'm always working long hours. But the managers are nice, and if you want hours here is the place to work because you will definitely get them."
good,"Interesting work environment"
good,"it was not the right job fit for me. "
good,"Work environment is not well suited to improve professional skills. However, speed and attention to detail are very heavily stressed in the work environment and are valuable skills to be learned. Coworkers are always fun and interesting, and the management is too."
good,The work isn't hard at all. It can be detailed oriented but that is part of the job. It can be boring when it's slow and customers can be rude. Most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers but the hardest part of the job would be shipment days. I had to wake up at 5:00 AM and had to put out shoes within a certain time limit.
good,"Great place to work if you really love shoes, and customer service. For me I was more into the customer service portion, so when there weren't any customers I felt my energy draining away. The tasking wasn't challenging enough either."
good,"-	Achieved sales goals marketing products according to customer needs"
good,every women loves shoes and deals of course! but picking up after people who leave all the guts from a packaged shoe isn't too much fun but hey you need to take the bad in with the good.
good,"did not like how they treated the workers! "
good,A typical day at work is fun and busy. I have learned how to provide great customer service and tend to special needs/wants of theirs. The hardest part of this job is having multiple parties/tables and being able to manage and provide equal customer service to all at the same time.
good,"working at dsw was a great experience. all of the employees have great personalities, and make it so comfortable working their. the managers are great . every one is alway around when you need help ."
good,Typical day was customer service. What I learned was how open and close daily registers with appropriate monies. Some of the managers were nice and great to work with.co-workers were cool but it was always new faces. Working on the register and doing the daily opening and closing of the registers was enjoyable.
good,at dsw we strived to be best in the customer service department and we were. we had great employees who wanted to help people and management that was always looking for new techniques to draw the customers in
good,"A typical day had a rush of customers as work would end but with a fairly steady stream of customers through out the rest of the day."
good,Management was strict but they wanted everyone to succeed.
good,I like the traveling aspect. I also enjoyed the physical labor. I did not like the seasonal portion. it would have been nice to have been considered for full time labor.
good,They are an OK company to work for. Bad pay. Taken advantage of...
good,I come into work and first get a huddle. Than I get place in a section on the floor or as a cashier. I help out with stock and cleaning the store. I assist customers to the best of my ability. I also assist customers with any problems they might have.
good,"always getting new manager.Never had hours because the store never had traffic, and the shifts sucked"
good,"Typical work day: Stock Items, clean, and customer service"
good,"Hours were limited so a typical shift would be about 3 - 6 hours long. I'd come into the store, tidy up the shelves, give my co-workers their breaks, put security tags on the merchandise and assist customers. "
good,"knowledge about the truck like oil changes date , checking inspection daily and inspection daily all safe items like lights, brakes, fluids, air compressor , test air brakes, carry all documents requirements for the Ontario  law regulations..  starting my routine at time in good knowledges all the costumer , points of loads and unloads. looking for saving diesel comsuption of combustible.. schearching the principals ways and alternatives,,,using maps and gps ......."
good,"I didn't work there long, however, they welcomed me with open arms and taught me a lot about shoes and customer service."
good,I actually enjoyed working for DSW because of the different kind of people the store attracted. I met professional athletes and TV news casters at this company. I never had any problems with anyone coming in or out of the store. the only problem was the amount of hours to work I was not able to receive.
good,working at the shoe company it was a good place to work for but wasn't very busy
good,Decent working environment. The weekends are pretty hectic in the store.
good,Management needs to me more involved. Working Hrs were not so flexible.
good,Customer service oriented. The day goes by quickly as it is fast paced.  No development of managerial staff.
good,"Manager was great. A typical day included stocking the new shoes, tidying up areas that were out of order, planning with the manager for reorganizing sections, and serving customers."
good,"DSW in Washington, D.C., was an enjoyable experience. I learned in great detail about retail service, interactions with customers, and how to be a professional during a work setting."
good,The atmosphere is comfortable. Being able to provide customer service to consumers makes the job fun.
good,challenging work day never easy I've learned patience goes along way learn to work in a group to question things your not aware of even if it may not be counted for the staff was respectable hardest part time management around closing time enjoyable meeting and greeting
good,"Positive work environment, great management, and descent pay"
good,DSW was an okay place to work.  Always having managers come and go made the work environment uneasy
good,"Paid well over min. Wage, cashier, stock, clearance out, clean."
good,"like every retail store hours and pay sucks and your better off looking for a professional job, these jobs and companies are more for those who are still in school or don't care about an important job"
good,it can get quite busy but its fun to meet people all over the world
good,"My experience was generally good.  I learned how to follow strict guidelines regarding store requirements for look and feel that the head office created for each of its stores."
good,Being here was very challenging. Had to sign up new rewards customers who just want to come in and buy shoes. Had to stay professional and being positive at all time. I was the only one who signed up the most in one day. I was surposed to get a raised and move up to chasier but it never happened that was the only down fall of them not fulfilling their part.  I still enjoyed being there meeting new people.
good,I enjoyed helping customers pick out shoes and signing them up for the rewards program.
good,It's a nice work environment. Dealing with customers is the best part of the job. The schedule is very unpredictable and unstable. But if you are ok with that then it's fine. No PTO unless you are a manager because full time isn't available for regular associates. Great temporary job.
good,The best part is the discount and the worst part is trying to balance customer service and maintaining a clean work space
good,DSW was a nice job I had working and being around a lot of people must of them were Women help dem pick out shoes give them my thoughts on how they would look on them.
good,Managers are trying to keep the place orderly but sometimes can not keep up with the break times.
good,DSW is a great retail company that values customers. My experience working here was positive. 
good,"worked on computer terminal, completing customer transactions."
good,"a challenging work environment, with lacking training. strives for positivity and team work, is not always successful. Staff was driven, but company did not support much of any management decision making. salaried staff (including non-in store staff: DM's etc) were expected to make sales towards their own individual commission."
good,Great atmosphere if you enjoy working with shoes and helping customers find the right pair 
good,A typical day included helping customers while providing excellent service and trying to make DSW America's Favorite Place for Shoes. 
good,"As a guy working in a predominately female establishment one could quickly understand why I wasn't entirely enthused going to work here, but it was my first job so i wouldn't really be where i am today without it..."
good,• Cashiering
good,"In the retail business as an assistant manager, the responsibilities are demanding. I learn how to make decisions in a timely matter, work with a team, and take criticism constructively. The hardest part of the job is being able to be flexible with your schedule. You have different days off every week, not having weekends off to spend time with family, and the shift you work is never the same."
good,Learned a lot about brands and what was on trend but didn't agree with many of the companies policies.
good,Good company to help you get adjusted to the customer service field.
good,typical day would be unloading freight. i learned how to bring in freight. management was horrible and so were the co workers. i was the man of the job but the pay and distance to where the job location was and to my house was very far.
good,Sold shoes and answered phones. Staff was great but the lack of a store manager created problems.
good,"A typical work day at DSW is helping customers find that perfect shoe for that special occasion. If you love shoes and helping people find that perfect stylish shoe, then thats the place to go."
good,- Ensuring all daily goals and monthly goals are met
good,Being a sales associate is always a fun position especially in retail. Providing good customer service is a very important aspect to hold in any position in any job.
good,"Greeting, engaging, promoting rewards and friendly and fast checkout was a typical day at DSW. How to engage with the customer is what I learned at DSW. The management was highly respectful, understanding. Tt was like working on a team of leaders better yet like family. I adored each and every one of my co-workers; they made work just as fun. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to take the time to accept the rewards card offer. The most enjoyable part of the job was be able to be first to see the latest and trendiest shoes, hats, and purses."
good,"I am charged with ensuring that the clearance department is always ready to sell lots of shoes! We currently have quite a few new associates, so I am responsible for training them in operations in that part of the store. The most difficult part of my job is the disconnect between upper management outside of the store and those of us who are on the front lines. However, the associates in the store are upbeat and we all appreciate teamwork."
good,"While the job was not difficult and customers and coworkers were generally friendly, management at the store I worked at needs to be revamped. The head manager was unprofessional and placed undue strain on employees. It was a nice job to have as a college student and the pay was good, but it was difficult to balance with school when there was no set schedule for when I would work. The corporate management, however, was wonderful. Friendly, professional, and available. They provided excellent employee training as well."
good,"i really enjoyed working for the shoewarehouse,meeting different people,and helping customer what they needed"
good,"I loved working at DSW from the very beginning. They are currently going down a more progressive path, and really trying to shake up the retail world with more innovative technologies and different selling strategies. They are one retailer that will be around for awhile continuously growing and evolving with the next"
good,"overall chill job, customers are pretty good, although management is poor and little chance but being promoted within company, but coworkers are very good and easy to balance this job and a regular lifestyle but you will find yourself picking up all of the managements work"
good,"Typically, the primary tasks are having to engage with customers and helping them, as well as keeping the store neat and tidy and since the stock is out, there maybe misplaced items, in which case they are put back to their rightful spot. The workplace culture was generally positive though it is a little harder to form actual, solid relations with the other workers due to the heavy focus on store mechanics, but otherwise a great first job to get experience in how a retail store functions and what it needs."
good,workplace was overall a good experience. managers were friendly and welcoming to new employees. training was good and taken time with. overall a good place to work.
good,I had good customers alongside decent pay and decent hours. As well as got along with most people in the work place as I am a friendly natured person.
good,"Bottom line is to sell, sell, sell more shoes!  They keep trying different things constantly to drive up sales.  Management comes down hard on associates who can’t perform therefore the high turnover."
good,I love working for this company minor problems with them but always fixed . The general manager is amazing & very easy to talk to . All coworkers are very nice & inviting .
good,There are always things to be done so you're definitely kept busy keeping everything organized and helping customers. Great coworkers however there were communication issues with management.
good,"fun environment to work at, great staff and management, everybody that works there is friendly, the manager is great and is understanding and kind to everyone."
good,"DSW was a fun environment to work in and the store managers were even more fun, but the district manager was rude and disrespectful and did not allow customers to defend for themselves when customers were totally out of line."
good,Each and everyday could be very different and exciting with various challenges.  It was very nice working with a dynamic group of individuals each day.
good,"was not getting enough hours, came in two days a week for truck duty and thats it. really cool people working but that doesnt mean much when youre barely there to work"
good,"DSW is a very fast paced company. I enjoy the company and have learned alot as a manager. It is alot different coming from a big box to a smaller box store. The team works well together and my DM is very motivating and cares."
good,"Management can make all the difference in the culture of a workplace. When I started, the management was great! About nine months into my employment, a new manager started. The culture completely changed. What was once a fun place to work switched to a stressful environment. New management was only concerned with sales. Good employees that had been successful in the company for many years left one by one. Since then, they haven't been able to retain good employees."
good,"First sales job, other than a restaurant, and I found it wasn't fast pace enough for me. I enjoy being mentally and or physically busy, and with retail in West Edmonton Mall, there is quite a bit of down time in a shoe store."
good,It was enjoyable place to work because of the store management and the people I worked with but I feel as though the company as a whole needs a bit of work with their customer service line called shoephoria.
good,"lots of great learning can be done here, the work load is heavy and allows you the ability to think strategically. however, the payroll situation is out of control. they have cut several hours from every store, making it difficult to do daily tasks or help customers. very discouraging. my DM was kind of trash too. micro-managed but didn't communicate well the important things."
good,"To be clear, even when hired as a “sales associate”, as a new employee, you mostly do tasking or cashiering and very little sales, except for signing customers to the free Rewards program. Only the managers are really on the floor interacting with customers. Most managers at my store were great, but new store manager is universally hated. He is condescending, a poor communicator, and makes poor judgements on priorities and procedures."
good,"At first DSW is an easy enjoyable job but as you get to know everyone things change, as per every job. Unfortunately if you don't stay on managements perfect list, you tend to do everything no one else wants to do and it becomes high school like behavior. The pay is decent for retail. They use ear pieces to communicate across the store but the etiquette and commentary are far from professional. Keep in mind that things like this vary for every store/job."
good,The pay is very considering what a customer service representative goes through on the daily basis. You do not get your own desk so everyday you have to clean a new desk for sanitary purposes.
good,"during my time at DSW i was lucky enough to be promoted and gain great knowledge. However, the work life balance was extremely difficult. Working long hours and walking up extremely early."
good,not a fun environment to work in but coworkers are friendly and helpful. management is understanding and helpful when it comes to your flexibility. and if you strive to learn more the show you
good,"The employees at the Buford location were amazing. The managers were amazing, understanding and professional, they made me feel very welcomed. Simply a part time job. The hardest part of the job was closing multiple nights in a row and the amount things that had to be done in a ridiculous time period before closing. The most enjoyable part is helping a shoe lover (customer) find the shoe they were looking for. Sincerely, I cherish that feeling. Weirdly enough, working here helped restore my faith in humanity a bit, I came a cross a lot of sweet customers and the two non-sweet customers I came across don't even bother much because of all the nice people I met. The nice part is that you get you learn everything, from cashier to the certain sections of the floor to the online processing of orders, etc. However I felt like the pay didn't justify what workers had to put in for a typical day of work, although it was a nice that it wasn't minimum wage."
good,This job ideal for people looking to work part time as a sales associates who get by performing at bare minimum. Easiest job ever for good pay with a great discount
good,"The co-workers that I had were great, they made the day go by fast. Management was great as well. The only problem was that we were understaffed, so there was a lot of work for a few people."
good,"A typical day is organizing shoes on the shelf. I learned more about shoes and their different purposes. Management was okay, they didn't cater to any of our needs. The staff was good to work with. The hardest part of the job is trying to understand all the customers needs and find a suitable shoe that they actually like. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with everyone."
good,i don't have any review to give so i'm just going to keep typing randomness until the thing tells me that i can move on to the next thing so i can apply for jobs that i want vs. keeping the job i have. How is that?
good,"I liked this job however, if you decide to work here please do not put all your eggs in one basket. I quit another job to work here and even turned down other job opportunities because I thought I had a good one here but they literally hire & fire people with the seasons. I was here for about a month when they decided they did not need my ENTIRE training group anymore. Cool people though, mostly. Some smart as.ses here and there but you have to have the skill to kill with kindness !"
good,"In my years at DSW I have learned to never take things personal. You will come across customers who may have suffered a loss of a family member and could be shopping for shoes for the funeral. You must always be understanding and put yourself in the place of your customer.  I am very big on customer engagement with our shoe lovers. Helping them select the perfect shoe for a night out on the town, a graduation or just for everyday comfort. Collaborating with my co workers in our door to floor process in quick efforts to get new merchandise out and keep everyone up on the latest trends. Shipping shoes from our location to other DSW locations as well as shoe lovers homes. Providing exceptional customer service at the register while handling cash and credit card transactions. The most enjoyable part of my job would definitely have to be having a satisfied customer. There are often times we may not have the size the shoe lover is looking for in the store however, I will call other locations to see if they may have it or order the shoe for my shoe lover. The hardest part of the job would have to be short staff and being able to attend to all he needs of the customers at the registers as well as on the sales floor. Miscommunications from the management team also leads to an unstable work environment"
good,While at this job I have learned good communication skills and how to multitask which was an important factor of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being with co-workers and managers that had great attitudes.
good,"Help clients find the perfect shoes, bag or accessories."
good,"The company seems to be in a constant state of trying to get its balance. "
good,"DSW was a really physical job, in my opinion. You spent a lot of time looking busy but not really doing much (there wasn't much to do!) The most disappointing thing about this job was you would be promised at least x amount of hours upon hire, but you would probably get half of those. The rewards policy is a nightmare, too. On the other hand, some of the most wonderful, loving co-workers I have ever met have been at DSW. It's a great job if you aren't supporting yourself or a household, but otherwise it's sort of a waste of time."
good,"Working here was a pretty good experience, but there were very limited hours offered. The store was constantly hiring new people but there were not enough hours to go around."
good,Some people can be rather strict and everything is very fast paced on busy days which is expected of retail. Employees are upbeat and get along and enjoy helping customers and each other.
good,"A typical day at work is coaching, directing, payroll, tracking employee files,operational duties, customer service and reporting."
good,My time at DSW has been crucial to my development as a manager and have appreciated all the opportunities I have received in my career.
good,"Fun place too work at, been there for a little over 3 years now, great employee incentive, you can meet a lot of really nice people, some who become good friends."
good,"Good job if your looking for a career,Good beginning pay,Co-workers are very helpful"
good,"I always had a great time working with them, and they treated me great throughout my whole pregnancy."
good,"Dia tipico era divulgar em pouos classificados , aprendi a otimizar sites e divulgar , aprendi a ter rapidez e foco , muito boa a direção nao tinha gerente empresa nao muito grande , os colegaas de trabalho muito bons , ajudavam e aprendiam com muita facilidades , parte mais dificil muito longe de casa , trabalhar com alguns amigos em um escritório arejado e muito bom"
good,More growth opportunity would be beneficial for the company
good,easy enviornment to work in cant complain. management is nice and layed back
good,"this company is awesome at working around a school schedule. its a very basic strait forward job. mostly you ring on the registers, walk the sales floor, straiten the product, clean, sign people up for there free rewards points program, and sometimes pull product to the floor for sale and do mark downs. not to hard, normal work. "
good,"it was fun, coworkers were great, we usually hung out after work, the enjoyable thing about working was gaining the experience and getting to know the clients."
good,Some days very busy i always liked that. New items coming end everyday being the first to see what was new. Friendly people to work for. The hardest part of the job for me was not to buy every other purse we had. The managers were great. The most enjoyed part of the job was helping people find the perfect shoe or purse.
good,A day here was very much the same every day. I would put my walkie talkie on and organize the floor. Put out new stock and move old stock. Answered phones and assisted customers.
good,"It's fun to work at first, but there is no real work to do. Everything is busywork if you're not cashing. Good hours during peak season, however afterwards hours range from 0-8 a week."
good,"I strive to put my best foot forward everyday at work. I take my responsibilities seriously and I always try to the best of my ability to assure our clients have a wonderful shopping experinece. I work with a pretty good team on my designated floor. We collaborate to get the task(s) done effectively and in a timely manner. The best part of the day is making the client happy and leaving them satisfied with their purchase. Everyday I learn something new, whether it be another method to help the client or to maximize my skills as an associate. I'm open and willing to learn every and anything...I'm big on cross training to get a better sense of how other departments work."
good,I really enjoyed working here. I had great co-workers and really great managers.
good,"I currently work at the Monroeville store as a Sales Associate. The managers are great, therefore the people they hire are nice hardworking people 9 times out of 10. Your coworkers easily become your new work buddies 🙂"
good,"There were a couple managers that really made this a great place, but sadly after they left for various personal reasons the workplace environment suffered due to new management."
good,"As a manager, there is always something to do. There is hardly a time that you are just ""chilling"". You are required to make sure that you manager your associates as well as lead and demonstrate the core values. The work culture was usually fast paced, especially on the weekends. The hardest part of the job was just making sure everything was done 100% and on time. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discounts and being able help customers shop for merchandise."
good,"Lots of good teamwork and management. Good balance of work and customer service. Lunch breaks are kind of short and the pay could definitely be better, especially with the new minimum wage."
good,"DSW overall had good programs in place, good benefits, and good working environment."
good,"As a part time you only get the employee discount. Management was awesome. As any retail, is expected to be able to work on weekends and holidays. Overall, it was a good experience to develop customer service skills to be able to move on with my goals."
good,"The only available hours conflicted with my schooling schedule, so there weren't many hours available. Other employees were extremely nice and super awesome to work with."
good,"I worked at the Shoe Company while attending school. They were respectful of the hours I was available and understood when school required my attention. "
good,"Very fast paced due to the volume of customers at the flagship store. Other, quieter, stores are much more manageable. Discounts are amazing! All in all, great first job."
good,It might have been the location where I worked as there were not many people in the stores. This created a very slow paced and quiet environment. Although I was still able to learn how to help clients with their needs
good,"It’s an ok place to work, all of the employees were very nice but the management was not the best. But majority of the customers were rude and it got really boring after awhile. I was part time but was working 9 hour shifts, and when I bought it up to management they did not like that I did not want that many hours. I am a college student and work another job, spending 9 hours fri-sun at dsw is not ideal. I had discussed my availability to them when I got hired and said short morning shifts and the manager said “perfect that works” obviously it did not. I’m sure another dsw is great to work for but not this one."
good,"It was a lot of fun because the staff and repiet customers made it a very friendly environment"
good,"The Job was alright. A typical day consist of, stocking the floor with all of back stock to keep the sales floor at 100% capacity. Checking for online purchases to fulfil for your customers."
good,"What I enjoyed the most about working with DSW is the fact that they incorporated ""dress up"" theme days, definitely added a fun way to interact with the staff and customers."
good,was a great job meet a lot of good people great to learn sales they have tons of benefits and incentives hours are great most of the management was great.
good,"Overall satisfied with the company. I mean, coming for retail environments that are mainly task oriented, it is nice to jump into a position that balances all aspects of what is mean to work retail. Job and work life balance is KEY! I have a life again, and am going to be with TOWN SHOES LMTD for a while"
good,"Working for DSW was a bittersweet experience. Although I had much respect for my Store manager, the day to day work experience I didn't enjoy. There were many days I enjoyed my day at work the coworkers were friendly, and sometimes easy to converse with but other days they were standoffish, and seemed to not want to be bothered. The most enjoyable part of my job was being in a store filled with shoes. The hardest part of my job was always walking in for my shift not knowing what type of atmosphere the coworkers were going to share that day."
good,"When you think about DSW, you think oh! shoes! how fun! it actually isnt. I dread coming into work. its great that you want customers to sign up for the rewards and everything but if they don't want to, I'm not trying to force them. organizing shoes and straightening them can get boring especially if you've gone up and down the aisles several times. Cleaning up is the worse but I can't complain because it's our job. I like to talk a lot but most of your coworkers don't even associate with you. they walk right past by you and doesn't even acknowledge you. but then again, they're here to work, right, and not make friends? but overall, the management is nice and i love the open door policy."
good,DSW is a great job to have when you want to gain experience and have extra money in your pocket. Co-workers are funny and are easy to get along with and same came be said for the managers. The down part about the job is that there seems to be a point where communication stops between management and employees because there is always struggle when it comes to truck days.
good,DSW wants to improve the Customer experience with every click of the button when shopping on DSW.com or with every pair of shoes tried on in one of the nearly 500 stores.
good,"DSW is a place that people do enjoy working. During your shift you are required to customer engage, clean, merchandise, and if you're a cashier you have the job of making sure the customer is a rewards member with us and if they are not try and let them know of our free membership and the benefits that come with it. Also, you will be cash handling and doing returns and/or refunds. It does help if you're a pretty good typist because some of the reasons a customer doesn't want to sign up is how long it takes. Overall, if it is around peak time you will be running around everywhere and super busy, but when it isn't the most exciting time."
good,"A typical day on the job would be consider, watching for theft, fixing shoe racks, reporting any stolen goods to manager, assisting customer needs, helping to find the other pairs of lost shoes on the sales floor, cleaning of your own area that you are assigned to, making sure sales floor is presentable to customers, helping ring customers up at the registers if called for, and that' s pretty much most of the things a floor sales associate would do. I learned how to interact with customers teaching them which shoe would fit them better. I also learned how much shoes can have an impact on your spinal chord and to the rest of the body. I basically learned how to appreciate what I have on my feet and embrace the shoe lover code that DSW will always remind me about. Great partners to work along side with me, who are also shoe lovers. I've never had trouble with anyone while working there because everyone was always in a good mood. Our store always made sales because we had customers come back to our store and our store only. The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to see all the new shoes that come in fresh off the truck. I also like the discounts that DSW offers their employees, and trust me you will not be disappointed! The only thing I didn't really like about this job is the long hours of standing and walking. You'd have to be able to withstand long hours of standing and walking."
good,Although the salary was not that good< the manager made every employee feel like they could reach for the stars if they worked hard enough. I got a great deal of experience that I will have with me forever because I truly do enjoy working with people.
good,it was a n ice environment calm collective busy at times but overall a great place to work
good,It is very fast paced environment and days can be long.  There is opportunity for growth.
good,I never thought I could have fun working with young and different people from all over the world.  I am proud to be working with this generation. A day at DSW you need to be ready and fast when all the customers come through that door.    We all come together!
good,"The culture is friendly and good place to start your career. There are opportunities for growth, but you must be aggressive."
good,"Typical week consist of unloading freight, merchandising the floor 2-3 a week. Signing customers up for rewards program, daily cleaning (bathrooms, mopping, sweeping, dusting ect,,) cashier, dealing with customers,"
good,It was easy to work there because I am a shoe-a-holic so I was able to relate to others. 
good,Dealt with customers. Had to be respectful and helpful to everyone. Had to be a team player.
good,Acquired exceptional customer service skills
good,Dsw is a good company that strives to be the leader in great customer experiences. The management team is good at genuinely reinforcing the company's values and beliefs that they feel will help them achieve that goal naturally. The job is not challenging and can be at times a bit repetitive . The majority of the employees are college students so the turn over rate is on the high side. A good place to apply for a part time job that is stress free with a positive work environment.
good,so far the typical day is ok its busy enough to keep you occupied but not over worked. still getting used to management and coworkers
good,Was once a great place to work until management changed. They don't really care about you as a person anymore and company expectations are completely impossible to meet no matter how hard you try.
good,Chill place to work. One think that bothers me however is that the company seems more focused on sales then on customer service. I found myself pushing the rewards program on people who probably would have been happier if I simply rung up their purchase and wished them a happy day. Coworkers are great and solid management.
good,I think that working at DSW is nice the reason for that is the other workers. The job itself is difficult. I get treated s though i am stupider then the managers. and i was told at the begging before i was hired i would recieve 16-22 hours each week. If i am lucky i get about 12. It is very difficult to pay rent under these conditions.
good,"This job is a very involved job. Usually all DSWs are busy, which leaves little to zero down time. I am a part time worker, but at times I feel like I am a full time employee. Management at my location are great, very understanding when it comes to scheduling. They also try to make your shift as stress free as possible, of course with retail there are always stressful situations. But overall I gave it 3 stars because its a tough job."
good,Good place to work that has a ever changing culture. The atmosphere was positive between the team and management. Every bodies voice was heard when it came to ideas.
good,It isn't bad and helped me learn good communication skills that I found helped me in my everyday life. I became very organized because I am one of the regular employees to deal with inventory and floor maintenance. They were also very accommodating with my busy schedule with school.
good,"Very busy workplace due to budget quotas, management was helpful and supportive. Great relationship with my coworkers. Company policies were dated and restrictive, overall a decent place to work though."
good,a typical day at the shoe company was signing into day force and then getting started. I worked as a sales associate and cashier so I got to interact with many people and learned great communicative skills. I was often told to do stalk as we didn't have one at the time which I was not a big fan of and was not part of my job requirements. Where I worked the store was empty most of the time so I didn't get to do much which made the job boring.
good,A typical day would be me clocking in and getting clocked in I would find a manager on duty and they would furthermore give me a kickoff (how the stores doing on goals and customers). It’s a pretty diverse working environment that I enjoy.
good,"Fun place to work. Great bonuses/compensation with rewards for good work. Lots of training, even part timers get training for leadership levels, to help build well rounded skills."
good,The company is very compassionate to its customers and I had many great co-workers. My only complaint was the store manager near the end of my employment. Many people I worked with made complaints about this manager and none of them were valued.
good,I worked here for about 5 months and it was ok. I realized i was getting paid way less than everyone else and when i confronted the main manager she just brushed me off and is overall just very rude. the other three managers are awesome but the store manager is terrible.
good,Helping out customers find the right shoe and answering their questions. Make sure the customer is happy and satisfied with the shoe they buy. Providing best service possible.
good,they should give more hours to stratified the employee. the more the employee get paid the more satisfied the employee get and better customers service that the employee do
good,"Many days the store is often dead even on busy days like Saturdays and a lot of the time we don't reach an already low goal. the management team is pretty great, there are no complaints about them, the associates are great and always good to talk to. The hardest part is being able to find some work to do with how boring and dead the store can often be but the most enjoyable thing is the amount of snacks and effort the team puts into filling the fridge."
good,"I liked my coworkers, but the shifts were long with not enough time to eat. Freight shifts were physically demanding, but I learned a lot and enjoying the labor. Meetings were productive, coworkers were good sports, but management did not know how to put theory and practice together."
good,This would be a great job for someone who is passionate about shoes and someone competitive. I learned a lot about being a sales associate. Used tablets to complete transactions on the floor. I enjoyed working with the coworkers there everyone works as a team. Management does a good job they just don't know how to manage employees without sounding rude sometimes. The easiest part about the job was wanting to come and work it was a fun environment. The hardest part was getting customers to sign up for member rewards and everyone constantly trying to help the same customers over again and they would get annoyed.
good,DSW is a company that provides advancement opportunities to grow in a short period of time. I enjoyed the work I performed daily and the environment DSW had to offer. I learned a lot during my time at DSW from a lot of co-workers and Supervisors.
good,"Clock in, and get assigned a section to watch over. Straighten out shoes, boxes, and make sure aisles are clean. Team is nice and very helpful if i have questions or need help. Once in a while i would have to go around with a tablet and get people to sign up for DSW awards program.  "
good,"There is a fair amount of work to complete, but the service model is excellent. Their choices in District Managers are questionable but it is a faily good place to work."
good,"typical retail job. walk around, keep store clean, talk to customers.can be a little boring there are hours. discount is pretty awesome"
good,"The title is basically an everyday goal among tasking. Sure, we were to make sure that supplies and merchandise were in order and present but our daily goal is to make sure people leave happy."
good,"I am there to help customer get the best shoes for their needs, I go into the back and get the size they are looking for. Then I watch as the customer walks around in the shoes and ask what they like about. Customer service is a huge part of my job and I love being their to support the client and get what they need."
good,"The day to day functions of the job is filled with repetitive rehearing and manual labor after a while there everything becomes routine. Id share shoe stories talk about the benefits of membership and sell shoes all day the great thing about it is meeting people from other countries. we get competitive in who could get the most sign ups but over all I feel happiest when i make someone else's day. I learned that people actually do appreciate my determination and that many others will take advantage in a negative way ( some customers and be a pain)."
good,"DSW is an ever growing, evolving company which welcomes experience from across the field. There is a lot of opportunity to be heard and recognized for work produced. Fun, exciting, welcoming work environment."
good,"This is a job that is perfect for a teenager, not much too it."
good,"I mostly enjoy working at DSW because the coworkers and majority of management is fantastic! I really enjoy helping customers when they need it, but dislike when customers just grunt when I ask them how they are today. I am employed at a mall location which isn't all that desirable, no one is shopping, everyone is browsing, this makes very difficult to make a lot of sales as everyone is just passing by. I have learnt how to effectively deal with customers and make sure I get exactly what they need! Managment is very nice, there is a new general/district manager who are making changes (mostly for the better), although a supervisor at my brach bullies those below her and is very specific about who she loves and strongly dislikes. The topughest part easily is there are no breaks in shifts 5 hours and less which is really taxing and you get very tired by the end of your shift. The best part of my job is my coworkers, they are very kind to each other and very welcoming at first."
good,"Worked as a Manager for over 3 years, assisted opening stores, worked at other locations to cover for management vacations. SM are only out for themselves and will throw anyone under the bus to get what they think they deserve. DM  never spends any time with his assistant managers let alone his associates. I miss the discount and my loyal customers that visited me everyweek."
good,Working at DSW I was able to learn about different styles when it came down to shoes and was able to make friends with some wonderful associates in the store
good,A place to work if you are a shoe lover! They offer great compensation and benefits. strong company so there is a presence of Job security
good,"When you work the day shift you come clock in, and get started on everyday routine. At the end of your shift you need to make sure all your things are done before the next shift came on."
good,Enjoyed my self working there. Coworkers were excellent. I loved my coworkers they were really cool
good,"My experience at DSW has been odd. It began with the managers placing me on the floor as a sales associate, and then moving me to the freight crew after a couple of weeks without warning or training. They never told me what ""department"" I would be in (at DSW, there are usually identifiable ""freight"" members, ""floor associates,"" and ""cashiers""). I love working on the freight team because it is the only area of the store with more than 10+ hours a week when the store is not in peak (Oct-Nov, Apr-June). However, there are only a small number of full-time positions with benefits only offered to that position. Hours are typically based on sales numbers for the week, and one can be ""extended"" at any time during one's shift. Finally, the constant shifting in ""departments"" makes it difficult for me to become a complete expert in one area. Even as a freight member, I still need to backup the cashier when there is a line, and it is hard to remember what to do correctly when you're on the register so infrequently. Also, raises are yearly, with very little movement towards management."
good,If you are in school and looking for a part time job thats good with availability well this is the right place fo you! Staff members are really nice. The best part of it all is you learn a lot about product knowledge.
good,Not somewhere I would want to work again. The days would go by very slow.
good,the pay was great but i am not cut out for lifting huge heavy boxes
good,"Proven leader that develops talent, fosters a positive work environment while driving results"
good,The overall is good. i love helping customers so that's the most enjoyable thing at this job.
good,"It hurts when putting everything in the company you put a lot of hours too, forgotten and kind of gave up everything that you put towards. It was more harder to see my hours get cut in front of me and promised positions that i never actually received."
good,"A typical work day is usually pretty busy if there is enough coverage. I learned that you really have to know your clientele and information of the products you sell. There is a very wide selection so knowing your brands are important. As for management, I feel they overall care for employees and our well being. Especially with them (employees) being the face of the company. The employees are rarely well trained and struggle to latch on to the basics of their job. The most difficult part of this job was advancing to a higher position. Management completely disregarded me for a higher position that I was available for time wise and more capable of handling with the proper training. The most enjoyable part was the shoes of course, but also my coworkers. We all balanced each other out very well and possessed great team work."
good,It was a pretty easy going job wanted the customers to come in happy and leave happy at all cost.
good,"Was a good starter retail management job, although was very unorganized and had poor management, "
good,"It was okay. Kind of micromanaged. But it's retail, so I don't really know what people expect exactly. If your young and looking for a part-time job while in college I say go for it. But it'll never be a career."
good,"The typical day at my workplace includes meeting the required set goals while working harmoniously with team-members to generate positive results. Greetings customers, making sure I give them above and beyond service so that they come again and again to buy one of the finest collections of shoes that we have."
good,"learned alot about the products sold and trends, very fast paced and professional. co workers were fun and friendly hardest part of job would be recovery of sales floor at end of the day. easiest part would be working the cash register"
good,"Overall DSW was a positive place to work. A typical day at work was simple, helping customers with finding shoes with special occations. I had learned alot about recepting my co-workers and the management staff. The hardest part about the job was making sure every customer was taking care of because there were a lot of people. The most enjoyable about working with this company was all of the great co-workers."
good,"good job if its your first job, alot of miscommunication from management. good benefits for customers but not the greatest for employees. will definitely help with public speaking."
good,I enjoy working at DSW because of the great energy I receive on a daily basis. I am glad that I chose DSW as a working place. I have learned so much!!
good,very cold place to work in winter has very short breaks and not enough heat in winters very poor food but will help when u didn't bring a lunch. a ok start off job
good,"I think Dsw is a very good first job to have, it is an extremely friendly place to work. I love almost all of my coworkers and the managers are very understanding and helpful. They are always willing to get their hands dirty with you."
good,DSW is a good first job for a high school/college student. The pay is not very good and there is no commission like many other high end shoe stores but there is a nice employee discount.
good,"This company is not very family orientated. They do not allow for parents to be parents and still do there job. Management really babies there employees, not allowing for abilities to shine."
good,"It's a good starting off job. The people most of the time are amazing. If you plan on having it as a career, try it out, see how the people are and then make a decision. Every store is different. "
good,"A typical day consists of customer service, helping customers find the perfect shoe for there needs. The store has a large variety of shoes so it is fairly easy to help someone find the right shoe. I enjoyed working with the customers and helping them out."
good,"As part of your work you learn new things everyday. Some previous managers and co-workers were really helpful. Sometimes your good work get unnoticed. Getting lots of customer compliments directly and through mystery shopping results were really enjoyable and boosted confidence to do work with 100% . ""Cutting shift hours and salary part'' was little hard . But great place for shoe shopping no doubt."
good,Every store should have one associate full time on how long they have been with company should give person the chance based on experience or how long with company.
good,"spent nearly a year here and left because I couldn't take the poor management. we constantly had changing managers, whom couldn't keep composure for work. it was annoying to deal with people like that, and I felt more capable than the management at times."
good,"Typical day at work is fairly consistent day to day, but the management doesn't like to reward those who go above and beyond. "
good,"Basic retail work, I made some friends working for this company, but overall an entry level job, good for a student or a young person looking to make some money."
good,"Less stressful than usual retail jobs. Fun environment, great culture. Average pay and little to no benefits under part time, but decent discount. overall nice."
good,"DSW is a good company to work for. They provide you with annual raises, the discount is pretty decent. I am a part time employee so i am unaware of the benefits. They could work on the things they view as important. For example the rewards program is pushed on employees, which causes them to push towards customers making the work shift even more stressful. Corporate could communicate better with employees versus managers to see what it is truly like for an employee in a single shift between task and customer service. I do enjoy working with co-workers who are willing to do there part and are open to criticism and change. Due to a change in management hours are terrible right now."
good,"Fun workplace, most definitely enjoyed my customers. There's so much to learn here and its even more fun when you get to know other associates and members of management at other locations!"
good,"A typical day at work is pretty easy, keeping the store clean and customers happy. That being said there will be bad customers like at any store. Management can be cool, but also there is a huge possibility you will hate a couple of your managers."
good,"Best group of people you could work with. Fun, energetic bunch who are willing to work together and have fun. Management can make it fun as well."
good,"Start out early before the customers get there to do the shipment, as soon as the store opened it was a big rush to finish up to clear out the place for the customers. "
good,"There was customers that were like family as well as the associates. I actually had customers that preferred me to wait on them and would wait until I was free if I was with another customer. The atmosphere was fun paced, we would only have 15 minutes to a half hour to clean after closing, this included finding lost shoes because sometimes customers would try them on and not put them back where they belonged. What the associates would do is a race to compete in finding the most pairs."
good,"from working this job, I learned how to handle a high volume store and still be able to deliver great customer service. increased my ability to multitask, working with great associates as a team player."
good,"A typical day at work requires one to be in a great mood. You learn how to deal with multiple customers. One must keep the floor neat and organized to the best of their ability. Co-workers are very helpful and teamwork is a key thing when working in a big shoe store. Whether you are on the floor or at the cash wrap, one must be able to get customers to sign up for the rewards program. It tends to be the hardest part, as well as, trying to notice people who are stealing. The best part though is just meeting new people from all over the world."
good,"The Shoe Company was my first step out of clothing retail so it was fun learning the footwear end of retail."
good,"Fast paste work enviorment, got a chance to test how fast I could work under pressure, and under lite supervision"
good,"My time there overall was ok, I enjoyed working with my co.workers. Today I, even consider them to be good friends of mine. The biggest issue with DSW in Worcester, was the management team. There were times, where they seemed unorganized, and not all on the same page. They had conflict with each other, and when it came to life outside of work, they seemed to show little consideration. But overall, DSW has a good enviroment, and can be a fun place to work. I would not suggest it as a first choice of employment however."
good,i love my job overall. But like every job it has its ups and downs but i have a passion to help others.
good,"A typical day at work was fun stocking shoes on their correct display i learned how to work a R'F Gun to price shoes,My Co-workers was fun to work with their was no hard part to this job and the most enjoyable part was the checks."
good,"I mean, you're working in sales... what more do you need?"
good,I was mainly in charge of setting inventory each day and had to deal with the entire delivery process. Sometimes the management expected too much inventory to be put on the sales floor when the store was already at capacity.
good,"The work itself isn't difficult, but I found the management to be not all that compromising. One day I was on shift, got very ill and threw up, I told my manager and asked if I could leave to go home, at the time I was an hour and a half, maybe two hours into my five-hour long shift. I was told no, that I had to stay. Neither I nor my parents liked that because I was 16 years old at the time. There are some other negative experiences, but there are too many for me to go into right now."
good,"Daily communication with customers, assisting them with any needs.  Maintain store goals daily/weekly.  I made sure every customer went home satisfied.  I was able to do store inventory and helped all customers with purchases and returns."
good,"I learned freight/restock, did overnights, cash register,  and customer service. It was a fun job, but not temporary or long term."
good,"Depending on your team you can have a great experience or a stressful one. Besides that they are a understanding company with good family beliefs, very relaxed with schedule switching."
good,"I am currently still working here. I have learned that I am not cut out for retail. Just received new manager, so it will be a while to adjust. Everyone is laid back and not a lot of stress. The hardest part of the job will be dealing with customers who want to use 3rd party coupons (as that is not allowed). Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to have great customer interactions with good customers."
good,"The management that worked their kind of played by their own rules. NOW I'm not sure the change, however they didn't much have cohesive answers for customers. People had gotten to the point that they just would ask for the manager to get what they wanted. The type of people they hired wasn't up to standard so a lot of transfers and call backs had to be made."
good,Good at first. Can become annoying. I don't like that they have extended shifts that you have to stay for (sometimes you're not told that you have to stay until the day of)
good,"The management was not bad, had a manager that really went above and beyond. The pay is what forced me to leave. At our store we were usually very slow and the days dragged on, but the employees were welcoming and nice to be around."
good,"It was a great place to gain some experience. I met many new people and learned many important life values. The management was not the best, and it changed too much it became a disturbance on our work."
good,"it was a proffesional day to day job. the workplace had a some culture from the employees to the customer, friendly atmosphere. clean and organized workplace."
good,I would have to try to get as many reward members as possible. I learned more about what customers want. The enjoyable part of the job is seeing a satisfied customer with their purchase. It's a nice feeling when you were the reason they bought the particular item.
good,"Clock in, put on your walkie talkies and name tags and help customers either in the aisles or behind the counter (customer service and cash). "
good,"I have learned a lot of things working here. Management here is okay use to be better but over the years the location i was out has gotten worse. I love my coworkers like family, they are the ones that kept me going.The hardest part of the job could sometimes be the customer issues but at times some customers make my day as well."
good,DSW is a great and fun place to work. The associates are super friendly as well as management. Our staff participates in fun events to keep the liveliness of the staff going and fun. Management is OK but has changed dramatically within the last two years and can also be non organized. Definitely would recommend to anyone who is looking to further their experience in retail.
good,"Over all its a good company to work for but like every job it has its pro's and con's, customer service is never easy but this is retail."
good,"Large retail shoe warehouse, great prices on shoes, and accessories. Greeting customers, and help them with purchases, help in making  recommendations when requested by customer. Loved customers!!!"
good,"Fun and engaging company to work for. Management is very personable and provide a competitive, yet friendly work environment."
good,"Now granted, this was my first job in retail. Although I was part-time it was an easy job and a nice experience for me. I'm a male, so I did the freight/stocking. Management was pretty fair. Hardest part for me was learning the register. Other then that I enjoyed the job a lot."
good,"The job is very simple and pretty self-explanatory. Everyone you work with is mostly pleasant and therefore making the shifts bearable. The hours are flexible most times if you keep in touch with the person in charge of the schedule. Overall, it is a good place for students to work because the tasks are not that demanding."
good,Been working for DSW for close to a year. Working in Retail has been a learning experience. The culture and working with the public has been a life changing experience and has helped me grow better in my career and also learning strong key elements of sales.
good,I love my job but i need a 2nd job for more hours so i can save money.
good,The manager is a hard worker and leads by example. She doesn’t just tell people what to do. She provides an atmosphere of compassion and fairness. She looks out for her employees and makes sure they know the tasks at hand.
good,Great job and teaches you so much about managing a warehouse. As well as finding the perfect place for you. You can work in many different areas at a warehouse you just need to try and see where you fit in most comfortably.
good,Dsw has a good work environment and is a comfortable place to work at. They are flexible with scheduling and work around school for students who need it
good,"Strong knowledgeable teams and department leadership who are dedicated to success and support a culture that values associates, teamwork, and camaraderie."
good,"typical day of work includes interactions with customers, assisting customers in finding shoes, and mostly cleanup/ recovery of store.  Can be very fast paced and management can push you to high levels of physical activity.  Most enjoyable part of day was management, they were very collaborative and had good personality.  However, didn't have consistent hours which is understandable in a retail environment."
good,"Pay was too low compared to the amount of labor. "
good,"very organized place, managers were cool and fun to work with. not too stressful, you just have to be good at talking to customers. i learned to be organized and open."
good,"This job is good if you want to be guaranteed 25-30 hours with the occasional option of picking up shifts. Management doesn't do much to be flexible. A good job for if your in school or a second job. "
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading shoes where they needed to go, check inventory, make sure shoes were in the correct locations, and help customers with any questions they had. I learned a lot about retail, and how to better communicate with customers. Most of the people who worked here cared a lot about their jobs, and showed that through their work course. They work well with any outside schedule you have. Hard part would be on busy days where the store is low on staff, and you have to juggle doing many things at once"
good,"Good discounts, good job to work in college. Fun environment, but they keep you busy. They give you pay increase for being good employee. Mostly moving boxes and register work, keeping store clean"
good,"Friendly workplace. Has you moving a lot, there was always something to do. Enjoyed working the stock room and preparing packages for shipment to customers."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with and help customers find what they were looking for. I learned more about shoes than I knew. The work place was kind of the same every day. was willing to learn new things but they restrained me. I didn't like that.
good,I loved working there I loved all the people . It was a very easy job ! I would recommend people to work there . I loved that you got 50 percent discounts .
good,"friendly, easy to talk to, flexibillity, gained register and cash handling experience, gained customer service experience, great  co workers, good environment"
good,now when i started working there it was cool..then slowly ppl started quieting the job then ALOT of the wrk load fell on me because i never backed down from more work..but it got to a point were i was doin MOST of the wrk..and that waznt fair to me so i left
good,"The company no longer exists because we were purchased by DSW for them to dismantle the company. Before that, it was a great place to work. DSW has great reviews from their DSW employees, but none of the people from Shoe Metro would agree."
good,"Good job to introduce you to core retail skills. management is nice. great position to gain lots of experience in different roles like sales, cashier, stock etc"
good,"It was a fun and up beat atmosphere. Really enjoyed the managers, and the company treats its employees well. Always enjoyed going into work and felt like my coworkers were like a family."
good,My time there was great. It gets busy at times and constantly picking up after people. Quick paced but also has some slow time. Great place if you’re into shoes.
good,At DSW I mostly answered phones and handled customer service issues. A lot of the job is just about handling potential shop lifters. I thought my salary was okay until I learned that a new employee was already making as much as I was after I had already been there a year.
good,I learned a lot from DSW I have greatly missed everyone I worked with. I made life long friends that I still confide in. the culture is very collaborative
good,Town shoes was a pretty great place to work at however my location closed without warning from a dispute with the mall so all my fellow employees were out of the job too.
good,"DSW was hands down the best job i had good discounts okay pay for a first job not many chances to grow but its a good company to work for, they don't offer full-time."
good,DSW was my first job. I came in there not knowing anything about how a job works. 
good,When I was hired I was still listed at part-time but getting 32-35 hours a week. I was very happy that they came through for me and fulfilled all of their promises. DSW as a company cut all payroll hours which brought everyone down 10 hours a week and became more fast paced and competitive.
good,Everyday is different!! You are moved through the store to different areas and helping different customers. Managers are always available to help!!!!!
good,"Usually as a Sales Associate i watch out for customes on the floor, ask if they need any help finding their type of shoe and then i help around with the store by putting away boxes and shoes into the right places"
good,"Working or DSW was fun. It'll definitely get you out of your shell. It is fast paced, requires attention to detail and discipline. The hours are flexible and one should definitely be a ""people person"" to work here."
good,I was part of the Business Intelligence Team and responsible for developing complex reports in the company-adopted tools. The team was very supportive in offering any help needed to pick up the newer tools and in case of tackling complex scenarios.
good,"this job is easy but hard to stand on your feet all day.some managers are okay, others not so much, pay is good, and the coworkers are nice. it is not a hard job to learn."
good,"Although I did enjoy working at DSW, I hated how essential it was to sign customers up for the loyalty program.  It was as if you were not enough if you did not meet their requirements"
good,They are continually bringing in they latest styles and at an affordable price point. The staff are always happy and great bunch of girls to work with.
good,"fast pace, organizatin stratagy, friendlt staff, enjoyable work place, helping people find comfortable affordable shoes, lots of bending over causes back pain"
good,"A typical work day consist of making sure the store is clean and organized before opening."
good,Nice discount on shoes. Only worked part time so don't know anything about benefits. If you love shoes shoes and more shoes this is the place for you.
good,A cool place to work. The environment is fast pace so its a lot of multitasking. The management staff is very good. They will help you with whatever you need.
good,Learned a lot about customer service and support for the rest of my  co-workers. Learned  a lot  about  shoespecially. From boots  to athletic shoes. Truly helped in understanding the customers  personal  needs.
good,"Management is nice and are easy to work with. They work around your schedule, but if you don't want to close all the time then make sure to specify that."
good,"Great people to work with, decent pay, good discount, flexible with schedule, nice work environment."
good,Job was fun and easy. Manager's will promote if they see the potential. Attendance Policy sucks! Very laid back and great atmosphere to live in. Would definitely work there again!
good,"I learned about current fashions, how to deal with customers in various situations, and how to work with others to reach a goal. There are many people you get to work with that come and go but it is expected at a retail store."
good,DSW is very employee oriented.  Many employee and family activities.  Benefits are good.  Basically a very good place to work.  The facility is very modern with a very good cafeteria.
good,The best part of my job was my staff and the customers. I learned a lot about what style of management I wanted for myself when dealing with employees. A typical day at work would consist of opening the store making sure marketing was out for the current sales we were having. The hardest part of my job sometimes was work/life balance.
good,"DSW was a good place to work. The work is not hard, tedious at times but not hard or stressful.  Management was very respectful and helpful. Co-workers were chill and easy to get along with for the most part. The only downside is if you are scheduled to close that could mean you do not leave the store until two to three hours after the store has actually closed. This is because no one can leave until the entire store is cleaned completely; not just the section you work in but the entire store. This was the only down side as I have a three year old at home amd several times I didn't get home until after one in the morning. Unfortunately, I had to resign becasue of an internship opportunity or else I'd like to have stayed on much longer."
good,"fast pace environment. love weekends because it was non stop tasking. Also, the co workers are amazing ! really enjoyed my time working at DSW. Management was ok"
good,It was a okay job and it was fun at times but beacuse of the business being slow they would hardly give us any hours and we had no security system so every time something would get stolen from the floor our hours would get cut
good,"Provide customer service, serving +50 customers a day, accurately manage register transactions, maintain stock, and organize marketing displays, in addition to collaborating with multiple employees to execute larger projects efficiently."
good,DSW is great to work for if you just need some extra cash in your pocket. They are completely flexible when it comes to scheduling. One downside is how crazy they are about rewards signups.
good,Great place to work with flexible hours and a great discount. They are willing to promote from within. Good work does not go unnoticed.
good,Organized environment with fun people to work with. Worked according to duties that were expected of me. I learned how to work with people and co workers as a team.
good,no two days are the same. You never know what awaits you when you start. customer are great as well as the staff. great selection of product. reasonable prices for the quality of product.
good,I had an amazing work experience. I learned how to use a phone more. My co-workers were amazing and very helpful and I was always willing to help anyone whether it be a customer or a new co-worker.
good,Enjoyed having the control to organize the stock room and kept it running efficiently. Felt like a decent work out everyday. Routine was the key.
good,On a day to day basic different task are assigned to the stock workers. Few Involving heavy lifting and organization . Make sure the flow of the store is moving swiftly and accordingly .
good,"Good company to work for that appreciates its people. If your looking for retail this is about the best retail in terms of schedule, stress, skill, etc."
good,customer service is key!  coworkers are great!  anything can happen in the every day to day!  I've learned a lot over the years!
good,There was never a dull moment when working at DSW. Each task given was presented in a fun/entertaining way to keep employees motivated. Each manager provided a different leading technique which enabled new and creative ideas.
good,My co workers were a great work family. We all were apart of each others learning journey.  Our store was so successful because we all enjoyed working together as a team and helped each other get promoted.
good,"Overall great atmosphere to work in, attractive benefits, and fun co-workers. There was a lot of variety in what I did each day. This company stresses rewards enrollments so at times I found the focus selling customers advertising and not selling them shoes and other merchandise. Company expects high values from every employee within the company. I would recommend this company to a friend."
good,"I would make sure that customers were finding the shoes alright and cashing them out at the end of their visit. Also, I would make sure that the store was up to company policy and was clean and organized at the end of each night so people could find everything they needed with no problem."
good,"Worked at Atlantic terminal location, worked as a cashier and sales associate, some weeks hours varied, co workers were cool hand brand meetings every quarter to discuss new trends and company values."
good,DSW is an amazing place to work hands down. A typical day at work for me is just getting to my work. I already know what my place is and what work needs to be done. As soon as I walk into the building I clock in and meet with the manager on duty. I ask what needs to be done on top of what I already know what needs to be done. I need to know what goes on at all times. I have learned a lot about multitasking actually. It is the most important thing working retail or any place involving customer service because you need to drop what you're doing to tend to your customers and then get back on your tasking. The co-workers are awesome. Truly amazing and I never have a problem . Really sweet people and great team players and helps us all get what we need done. The hardest part of the job I would say is actually meeting our goals throughout the day. What I mean is selling our merchandise. You know we all work together and do what we can to sell shoes but if the customer comes in and just doesn't buy and is just browsing. There is only so much you can do. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with including management. You know everyday we work as hard as we can with one another and to work some place where the employees and managers get along is awesome!
good,"As an employee of DSW I thought the job itself was pretty simple, as long as you bring charisma to the environment then you're set. "
good,"Working at DSW, you learn how to deal with different types of customers and how to handle an array of personalities. A typical day there consists of helping out peers with different tasks, and be ready and willing to make sure the customer is as comfortable as you can make them. Also, while working here, you learn how to multitask and get jobs done fast and efficiently. In addition to that, you also gain knowledge on how to look at situations more positively instead of coming from a place of ""no""."
good,"You generally will be assigned to a section (mens, kids or womens), walk around to make sure everything is clean and tidy. If a customer needs help you can go look for the size in inventory and answer questions."
good,"Overall good environment, could be more organized. Time management could be improved on, as well as efficiency in every task performed."
good,You either do register or work the floor. On the floor you talk to costumers about the products help them choose what works best for them. Fix the stock on the floor or in the back. Keep the store presentable.
good,nice place to work. Employees get discount. Pay raise is hard. you could work for several years without pay raise and the job is not secured
good,ok environment at the time I worked we had a district manager that treated people wrong and had no respect for associates. I don't know how it is right now.
good,"-five to eight hour shifts"

good,Well-Mannered people Business day can jump from fast to slow in a matter of minutes. Very uptempo
good,"The Store Manager is amazing, he's a treat. He makes work fun, and added the feel of Family amongst all the workers. The most enjoyable part is helping customers cause you get to see all the merchandise. The easiest part for me was the rewards program which most people found challenging and annoying."
good,"Sales, stock, display arrangement, customer service. It can be competitive and alsoo it can hard when trying to reach certain daily goals. Its alot of team work."
good,The shoe discounts were the best.  Management was great and my co workers were the best.
good,"I've been a sales associate with DSW for over 3 years now and it's a decent place to work. Even though the turnover rate is pretty consistent every couple months,  I still happen to work with a pretty cool group of people. And of course the 30% discount, even on top of clearance items, doesn't hurt at all. But for someone whose heart isn't in retail, it can very quickly become a repetitive lifestyle."
good,The working environment was always positive I was always looking forward to working with this company. The managers were awesome and also energetic.
good,Good place to work. the people are nice and are always willing to help out when needed
good,"I was promoted from a sales associate early on due to my hard work, work ethic, and dependability. I learned through experience how to properly provide exceptional customer service and how to empower my staff to provide the same level of service."
good,i was part of the shipment crew. i would organize boxes then take them out and put them out on a sales floor. i worked with 2 or 3 other people as a team. it was difficult trying to make space for new shoes but we always would figure out a way.
good,Friendly and easygoing work environment with a focus on customer satisfaction.
good,"its a great company to work for,they keep the truck moving with load for there customers. Its a small sister company to Swift transportation."
good,"Merchandising the floor"

good,While working at DSW I learned time management skills and how to work efficiently towards meeting a specific goal. Overall the management was respectful and understanding. The co-workers were very nice. The overall atmosphere was quite pleasant. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a smile while being harassed by a customer.
good,"A day at work at DSW was a long day, a lot of walking, on my feet 8 or more hours a shift, very organized store. I learned that it is not easy dealing with different customers but you have to be positive and smile anyways! Management was awesome, they were laid back but trained for customer service very well. The co-workers kept to them self and did there jobs."
good,DSW was a fun place to work because you're able to be yourself and work with a diverse group of people.
good,DSW strives to be Americas favorite place for shoes and also Americas favorite place to work. Great company to work for.
good,I loved  workin here bc of the shoes. A girls best friends is shoes.
good,same as when worked at Kmart in helping customers out and checking paperwork associated with it.
good,A typical day at work consisted of cleaning the store and keeping it clean throughout the work day. The management at the store was good. The managers always made sure that you knew the knowledge of everything so you can help the customers. My co-workers were easy to get along with and made working there easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and helping them find exactly what the were looking for.
good,Very organized company with great products. This company really gets hot to run a business from start to finish!
good,"When i came into work at DSW, I knew it would be a long but interesting day. I would usually start out by cleaning the floor of shoes and helping surrounding customers in my area. If needed I would assist my friendly coworkers at the appropriate times. I learned how to really hone my customer service skills and my attention to detail. The hardest part of my job would have to be marking prices down for the shoes. My most favorite part of this job has to be talking to all types of people all day."
good,A fast paced workday but the down times are slow and the hours are few and far between.
good,Enjoy working with the managers. Everybody is very nice and helpful. The company is very team oriented. The schedule is always very flexable.
good,I learned a lot about shoes that I did not already know.  The typical day at work was mostly about customer service; assisting those that needed help in finding the shoes they were looking for.  At times I would be doing tasking which was anything from cleaning to inventory set up or throwing new freight onto the floor.  My co-workers are pretty amazing and always willing to help when it is needed.  It is a family sort of environment between the associates so we all like to hang out outside of work as well.
good,"lots of benefits and events with co-workers. lots of food and pot lucks"
good,This was my first real job and I was really happy they gave me a chance. They treated me with respect. I had great coworkers and managers. I was reliable on the sales floor and as a cashier. The hardest part was the unpredictability of closing time especially when the sales floor is a mess but I didn't feel like that was too bad.I was an enjoyable experience.
good,"I enjoyed working here, I like fashion so it was nice to help people walk out with a great product that made them feel good about themselves."
good,It's very busy you have to be able to be good at multi tasking. Typical day at work would be cleaning area your assigned to. Help customers with what type of shoe they want. Co-workers are friendly and understanding. Hardest part is closing its a big store so it takes time to make everything perfect. The most enjoyable part is seeing the customers happy when they find the perfect shoe.
good,This place help me expand in the world of customer service. Great experiences.
good,A typical day at work would be to come in and get right to work and recover the sales floor and ask customers do they want DSW Rewards.
good,"Great place to just personalize yourself with the customer base. Giving feedback good or bad honestly goes a long way. Overall the company gives you a lot of opportunities, but you have a wait your turn if you are not noticed."
good,Good job for the ultimate multi-tasker. Can become overwhelming with the amount of things that are needed to get done in one day.
good,I enjoyed communicating with different people on a day to day basics.Some of the management wasnt so polite but I made the best of it.
good,"Loved working there, but could never advance due to management."
good,"Coworkers were very nice and so were the managers, however the ability to stay on the force or advance was never given."
good,Typical day at work involves basic store mechanics while maintaining strong contact with customers.
good,"I loved working here... The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, made me feel like I was in a home setting. I enjoyed for my co-workers, and some of the perks."
good,"My experience while working with DSW changed over the year due to many manager changes which resulted in the frequent change in work flow. The most enjoyable part of this job were some interactions between me and the customers, and getting shoes packaged and ready to ship all over the US."
good,"Solid company financially , a lot of changes in management and philosophy on how to move forward in the business. Work place culture was events not geared to all employees to take advantage of and participate."
good,"it was not a very positive environment , i did not like the work flow, it was always so slow, i did not find that people would come in as it is not a popular store"
good,"This is your typical retail job. I mostly did cash register or ""main"" as they call it because no one else wants to do it. There's always a lot of work to do and they do not give out raises often at all."
good,Was a great job opportunity for young individuals. Unless in management position I do not believe the income is sustainable for living in the Northern Virginian area.
good,"My experience at Corporate was enjoyable I learned a lot on the project I was assigned to and I had a great experience. The culture was lay back, but during closed you are expected to work a few hours extra to have all books ready for next month."
good,"I started working at DSW when I was 17, its an overall good place to work depending on management and teaches you some skills to carry with you to other jobs and careers. Usually pretty busy and fast paced."
good,"It was a nice place, nothing really special about it. I'm not one for lots of walking or organization or social stuff so it wasn't that great to me. A lot of really nice people worked there though, just not my cup of tea."
good,"DSW is a great place to work for, focus on customer services and also employee welfares. When it comes to management the communication can get a little difficult. Working at DSW is a very easy, clam, hectic environment."
good,"Most shifts are part-time and this is a sales job, though no commission is available. This creates an environment that is more collaborative than competitive with colleagues. Management really does care about you as an employee and discusses any problems or advancements available for you. This is a job high in customer service which has its own pros and cons."
good,"DSW is a great job to start making money and learn the ins and outs of customer service, sales, and merchandising. It provides teachable values in a persons worth ethic and I recommend it highly for a first job."
good,You are paid weekly and hours are inconsistent. Fun place to work and shop at the same time. Great discount for you and your family members. I was young at the time so it was wonderful.
good,Typical day of work for me was clock in at 6am start to unload freight for the up coming product sale of the day. That was a daily routine. Manage the floor from certain hours once freight was unloaded than proceed to giving excellent customer service until the second truck arrive.
good,"I actually loved working here and with the managers and staff and overall workload just work advancment really wasn't there. They usually hire outside, rather then promoting within."
good,"-was a cashier and I loved my job when we were busy. I was very fast and I loved to talked to people. "
good,"overall it's a great part-time job. the leading manager, while I was there at least, was rude & unpleasant but, the assistant managers were amazing!!!!"
good,"DSW is an easy company to be a manager for because all expectations and tools are located in one place. "
good,I enjoyed working here for the most part. My collegues were great along with my managers. I left due to the lack of shifts available which was beginning to effect my personal finances at the time. I was also returning full time to school.
good,dsw is great to work at because there is a 30% off discount including clearance items. the people are fun to work with and the managers are always flexible with scheduling.
good,I really wanted more out of them. I would like to see more job opportunities. I know they need better management. My co-workers were great!
good,Fairly easy job. Management and co workers are friendly. hours are decent. There isnt anything extremely hard about the job.
good,Typical day at DSW starts with putting on a headset to communicate with co-workers.  Responsibilities involved putting out inventory and keeping floors clear. Sales Associates receive 40%
good,"Good work environment and easy work load, tad boring during long shifts. Managers are easy to work with and scheduling is easy."
good,"energetic staff, room to grow within the company, flexible hours, easy overtime, good pay, as staff supervisor i maintained the cash wrap managed 5-7 associates per shift, the hardest part of the job was trying to right someones wrong."
good,"Typical retail company that does things a little weird and backwards, but you catch on. The categories make no sense and management gets frustrated when you've only been there a week and have trouble making their slightly ridiculous time requirements. Also if you acquire 7 points (due to coming in late, missing shifts, etc.) you're fired on the spot. Start pay is $9/hr though."
good,It was a nice first job as I learned e-commerce and retail. Small group but definitely working together and getting their hands into multiple facets of the business.
good,I am currently working part-time and I love it here.  It's a nice change of pace from my day job.  I love interacting with the customers and making sure that the leave with shoes and accessories that they love.
good,"Fun work environment, fast paced."
good,"Every day was going in and helping every customer in the store by selling shoes or cleaning the store. Also, checking out customers in a fast pace and signing them up for DSW's rewards program. The management and co-workers were my favorite thing about the job. Learned how to help a diverse set of customers and learned to ask questions if I needed help."
good,I opened the store and enjoyed the associates that worked with and the teamwork to get the store set up and ready for the customers.  I helped customers on the floor and at the registrar.
good,"Enjoyed working here, great staff and exceptional shoes. Excellent music selection keeps the work environment positive and upbeat."
good,Cashiering transactions of sales. Stocking the floor with merchandise. I learned how to do merchandise displays and loss prevention.  I experience some things with management that I would rather not discuss.  Co-workers were fun to work with yet when I am working any job I mostly stay to myself and just do my job.  The hardest part was trying to watch everyone in the store and also assist other customers with merchandise.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting discounts on merchandise.
good,I like talking to customers and helping them find shoes that looked good and making sales.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of making sure our guests had a great experience at our store and insuring they left with what they came for and more. I learned to be more patient and understanding when dealing with staff members and guests. I learned product knowledge and year around fashion focus. As part of the management team myself, we instilled our team to be a well running machine. Team work, consistency, follow-ups and praises are always key. Creating the environment, not only for the guests, but also for the staff. Hardest part of the job was the scheduling, leaves you little room for balance and structure in your personal life. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and establishing long lasting relationships."
good,"I would get to work around 8 o'clock pm and head to the break room for our team meeting and positioning. I learned how to pack and tape boxes accordingly and take them off of a conveyor belt and stack them in rows on a pallet. My immediate supervisor was fun and interactive and worked with us during every truck unload. My co-workers were fun and easy going group of people. The hardest part of my job would be the time I left. it was always morning so I got screwed up on my days of the week. The most enjoying part of my job would be unloading the truck with 3-4 people helping, because it went fast and was a good time ."
good,"I used to open on weekends and work closing during the week. This job taught me the best customer service techniques and how to learn things quickly, it also taught me inventory and the beginnings of being an assistant manager. My co-workers were all roughly my age which made it easier to talk to them and build a better work relationship with them all making the store a happier and more inviting place to shop. The hardest part of the job was finding what the customer wanted when they themselves had no idea either. The best part of the job was giving someone exactly what they needed when the had no idea what they wanted and the gratitude they showed after."
good,Very diverse workplace.  Exciting environment all year around.  Engaged associates that enjoy helping customers and fellow co-workers.  Weekend pizza parties are the best!
good,"A designer show warehouse in a great town center mall. Co-workers and management work well together. Fun working atmosphere with high morale. Teamwork very important to maintain store. But, this is a part-time position that offers no advancement and little pay."
good,"•	Trained associates and implemented quality customer service"
good,"My typical day work be organizing shoes and bring out stock to fill clearance and the regular priced shoes. I learned to put the customers first and to help them find whatever they are looking for even if I am extremely busy. Also, I learned you have to depend on yourself. The management was ok not much to say about them. Co-workers were amazing so nice, friendly and out going. The hardest part of the job is when we had the GM's come in everything had to be in top notch condition. The most enjoyable part would be working with my co-workers they always had me in a good mood."
good,"Good company, mostly good people. Their management is iffy. I happened to have 3 great managers, and one not so great. The hours are typical retail, if you can handle the inconsistent schedule, and weekends then go for it. I had a blast.  Met a lot of great people, who have definitely helped in my career."
good,This is a good place to work if u are looking for a part time job for extra cash.
good,"Loved the management team, always had my back. My coworkers were always nice to me and overall the environment was very good. Offering the rewards program was the only con along with the hours."
good,This job was one of the easiest I've had. Would spend most days hidden in the back room dealing with new incoming stock. Was expecting to learn all trades of a sales associates job. Was left wanting. Wasn't given any chance to prove skills I have towards being friendly and helpful with customers. After a few months Manager took my shifts to work herself. Had to leave to get another job so I could afford rent.
good,"I love the people I work with and its an easy job, for a starter job there's not much more I could really ask for. I've been able to advance in the company from a sales associate to a sales supervisor and my opinion on the job itself remains the same, I enjoy going to work."
good,"My time spent working with designer brands have been amazing!  I love my job, my boss and my coworkers.  What is it they ask... do you love your job?  My answer is YES!  My boss at my location could not make my experience any better.  I have worked a lot of places and this job definitely takes a spot in the top 2!"
good,"Overall good company to work for, you get to play with shoes and see the latest trends.  Culture is good, hardest parts of the job as with any retail job is the hours and shifts expected to work."
good,"DSW is a great place to work. I have a great store manager and I like all of my coworkers. My managers really try to create a fun work environment. You get a raise every year, and the company occasionally does raffles/competitions to win fun prizes. the only thing I don't like is the discount/ not being able to use coupons. Its 30% but I think it could be higher. We also can't use the discount on top of clearance items."
good,I love this job so much. But there are times where you feel too stressed. People are awesome in general but can never take a shift yet always ask you to take shift 24/7. Managers are amazing.
good,"Dsw has been great to work at, the people I work with are friendly and inviting.  They always help when I have a problem at the front or if I need to change my schedule."
good,"Loved everything about my job.  Too bad they closed the location. They worked with my schedule. great management great employee discount. I was part time with no benefits, and there were not a lot of hours available however I had a fixed schedule which was great."
good,"Mutual respect between employees, good customer service. The store is quite big, so there is always work to be done. The management is good. The hardest part of the job is signing on new customers"
good,DSW provides a great environment for recently graduated students of individuals that want to start a career. It can benefit from additional growth of diverse individuals.
good,"This company is driven by their mission, and they live up to it. Their return policy and how the effectively listens to their costumers needs and complaints, makes them a great retail company. "
good,"Great job to do if you love interacting "
good,"Everyone working was kind and helpful with everyone around.  If there was a project that needed to be done, everyone was quick to work together to get the task done."
good,Clear work requirements.  You and your teammates together make the work day go by smoothly.  Professional without being suffocating. Great discounts and reward programs.
good,"Every day brings new challenges that can be rewarding."
good,"It may be because of the area I worked in, but the customers were always extremely rude. We also had a huge issue with theft.. daily. My managers were great and easy to get along with. However, I feel some sales tactics enforced by corp are immoral. The people that work for shoeforia (online sales reps) are often rude and unavailable for hours. I’ve waited on hold with them for over 2 hours and hung up."
good,"The shoe company is a lovely, fast pace job where you meet new people daily which helps make the longer shifts more interesting and fun filled. Cleaning the store after closing is a requirement but not at all difficult. They train you as a cashier, teach you how to place online orders for customers, and teach you many helpful tips on customer service. Working on the floor you assist customers with finding shoes as well as cleaning up the aisles, greeting customers and informing them about current sales. I truly enjoyed my time working at the Shoe Company."
good,The store has a fun and fast pace work environment. They have good communication between all employees. I enjoyed my time working there helping customers with their needs.
good,Working at DSW Inc. was the best retail experience I enjoyed for my first retail job. It gave me great insight as to how retail functions and works. I would love to go back if they offered a good rate. Management tends to be a hit or miss though. m
good,"They are trying to re-strategize their company and it is going on as a mess. They have really downsized in every shoecompany, shoeware house, townshoes & designer shoe warehouse. They have fired a lot of staff and long time employees."
good,"Good teamwork within the company, sometimes the managers were more easily inclined to giving feedback as opposed to helping with situations and showing how to better handle future occasions."
good,"I learned and gained knowledge by working with Family Dentistry, Orthodontist, Endodontist, Prosthodontist, Oral Surgery this experience helped me gain knowledge which will allow me to be an assist to any Dental practice."
good,"Although I enjoyed my work at DSW, I would have like to know the best way to be consider for advancement.  Overall the company had great management and if i would have stayed longer, possible advancement could have been an option."
good,"I enjoyed my time at DSW.  I loved the discount (who doesn't love 30% off), but even more so the culture.  It was fast paced and competitive, but left room for growth.  It was an amazing experience."
good,I appreciated the values. I sometimes felt like I was made to do more work than other associates since I was not the favorite. I did not agree with the general manager.
good,"Performing everyday retail duties as well as commission and sales reports, Conducting managerial procedures on a daily basis. Managing a sales staff and monitor labor."
good,"Overall DSW is the perfect place for summer jobs and those looking to pursue a career in managing businesses like this. The management team was solid and wanted to elevate their employees, the associate team fluctuated but remained dedicated."
good,"It's a good beginner friendly job , with the right attitude you can really enjoy working there. But lacked time to train newly hired ppl. which slowed down improvement in the store . Not being organized and being behind schedule. It was annoying. Newly hired ppl didn't know how ring customers up. When we needed more cashiers to bring the line of customers down."
good,"DSW Inc., is a fast paced working environment. Everyday was a training day, my official training consisted of three days; although what I learned online was nothing like what was actually happening in-store. At times things were stressful and hectic, there more than enough Managers working the shifts. I would get placed in four-to-five different areas around the store listening to my Managers. A typical work day would be me correcting the shoe placement in the Clearance section while helping customers with their needs. I learned how to multi-task along with prioritizing task given to me."
good,"It was a fun place to work everyone is friendly, but always got my hours cut unless i agreed to working very undesirable hours, if you like organizing this is for you."
good,"I enjoy working as a sales associate at DSW Inc. because I am able to develop my customer service, organizational, team building, and communication skills."
good,"Working here for a couple months there has been lots of changes in terms of employees coming in and then quitting soon after. Last two managers quit as well so this is my 3rd manager in the five months I've been working here. "
good,"The work is easy and the customers are better than most places. Could use more hours, but that's the only complaint I have. Overall, I would work here again"
good,"I prefer not to write about my experience with this company since everyone's experiences can be different. However, overall the company is not a bad company to work for."
good,The job itself is easy once you learn how to do everything. Time goes by fast when you have something to do. You have an opportunity to learn a lot about how the store functions and how the company functions. You also get to meet and network with a lot of the customers that come into the store. This job is a great way to meet people.
good,"when busy you have to work in a very fasy pace, coworkers help each other, same age range. the hardest part is closing the store but everybody helps each other"
good,"What can i say about Designer Shoe Warehouse? Affordable designer shoes, with a decent selection to choose from Nike, to Gucci to Mens & Womens dress shoes. Also, they sell a wide variety of accessories."
good,"Since they dont have full-time positions, mostly students and people that have another job work there. There is no stress and co-workers and managers are friendly."
good,"My experience at DSW was a seasonal position so I didn't really see much. However the work environment was great, they make sure you are a well happy and functional employee and you are always giving tasks, there never nothing to do!"
good,DSW is a fun place to work if you are a shoe lover - which is encouraged! I felt very at ease with the employees and managers and never felt like I couldn't approach them for help or advice. The best part of the job was connecting with customers and hearing their stories and bonding over our mutual love of shoes.
good,"The best thing about DSW, Inc are the workers. Very enjoyable place, although the way they push you in rewards makes it extremely stressful almost to the point you do not want to cashier."
good,"I started here as a part time cashier and left an asst. manager, pay was great, but if you didn't live up to what the company vision was becoming, you were given the boot. Great co workers, great pay."
good,"This job was well fit for its employees and made sure employees were in a safe clean environment,also supervisor made random check on its employees to make sure job was done properly and correctly"
good,"This was my first job over the summer! It was a great place to start, the managers were great. There was one that I didn't get along with that well, we clashed due to the work schedule since I was still a senior in high school. It helped me build on my time management skills and responsibility. Overall it was great! I was part-time so I didn't really have any health benefits, just benefits in learning new things."
good,"There is a culture of women selling shoes unlike any other work environment I have experienced. The management was great and they want people to like their job. Our staff meetings were fun and focused on meeting company expectations. I loved working there, and if you really want a retail job with one specialization, DSW Inc. is a great place to work."
good,"Hourly plus commission"
good,"Open and close store, accountable for up to 15 employees at a given time. Address customer complaints and questions, and loss prevention. Set tempo for staff and sales day. Adjust staffing based on hourly sales. Management within the store works together well. Outside management seems disconnected from sales floor and the people. Focus is store sales, turnover, reward sign ups and loss prevention."
good,"Great place to work, however your hours are never secured. They could work you one week where you make 38 hours and another where you only get to 12. It's a great place to work, coworkers are fun and the managers are very nice, as well as its comfortable and a safe environment."
good,"Great company to work for. However, due to the market change, and traffic decrease. Opportunities are limited at the higher levels."
good,I highly recommend working at DSW. The coworkers and manager are amazing! This job was not too difficult they are willing to help you if have any questions!
good,"Nice environment to work in, a lot of hands on with customers. Employees are fun to work with but management can have different attitudes depending on their day."
good,At Town shoes the level of work varied day by day. More recently stock associates pull double duty as both stock and sales.
good,"I worked at DSW for 4 years and started as a part-times sales associate. I have had quite the assortment of managers and have worked in over 5 stores. You would think that all the stores would be streamlined with their expectations and the way in which things are done, after all, the company provides tools and has various policies and procedures in place to ensure just that--but it is not the case. Every singe store I worked in was different than the other and the determining factor was management, the store manager specifically. Because I have been in both roles, I understand the dynamic, but often times it seems like the Store Managers forget or they seem to remove themselves from certain aspects and let their own personal preferences dictate how they run things. Although I have worked in several retail environments, I stuck with DSW because all things considered it was the best. There's always room for improvement and the company is making strides to improve. It would just be nice to have more conversations with the assistants and associates as opposed to just the Store Manager."
good,DSW is a nice company to work unfortunately they do not accept excused absences. I was hospitalized and they would not take my doctor's notes.
good,"Dsw is a fun company to work for, however the hardest part of this job is having to clean at night and the pay rate is not enough."
good,Very fun working environment to work in. The managers are awesome! Never had a problem with them in the time I worked there. I worked there long enough that I somewhat actually became like family with the managers.
good,Going into work is something to look forward to. The colleagues are so kind and helpful. The managers are quick to help with understanding. The job itself is not hard. Customer service is the main aspect of the job.
good,Great place to work just not enough room to advance in the company.  All the employees who work at this company live the values.
good,"Good work environment, fast paced, and a lot of interaction with people. Only problem that I had was their lack of a concrete schedule. You would be marked for four hours, but they could have you stay longer. Depending on sales.  Just too hard to plan when you have a family that relies on you to  be there and keep involve in your families lives."
good,"If you are just starting off in the work force then DSW will be a good fit. It is a high paced job, but the management understands that you are a relatively low skill beginner so they take it slow with you."
good,"Management is fun"
good,"It's fun to have the opportunity to travel trough the USA at the same time that you are working and contributing to the country's economy. this Company calls you by your name not a number like other big companies.                                                                                      Management treats you as a human been not as another part of their truck."
good,"An enthusiatic environment with a great support team. Everyone was friendly, and managment were very supportive. They were great in training me to assist customers with the best of my abilities."
good,"you get to interact with customers and found out what they need."
good,It is a fun place to work with great managers and co-workers. Great for students since they are flexible with your schedule and work with you to give you the amount of hours you want to work. It has a friendly environment.
good,"great job culture and team work. This jobs also help to improve my customer service skills. Help the customer to chose the exact product and seen the customer satisfy with it, make me happy. Because it means I provided a great customer service."
good,"Town Shoes is a great environment to work in. Many things about Town Shoes are really good, such as, the employees, meeting/talking with regular and new clients."
good,"Each day working on the floor is different then yesterday. Everyday something new happens and majority of the time it is exciting. With this being a new company to the area, I learn something new every shift. Just like every job you have your up and your downs and certain employee you can't stand to be around but the managers make the best of it and you make it through!"
good,Wonderful place to work if you like working with the public which is the most enjoyable part of the job.  Great merchandise incentives.  Some managers and co-workers were better to work with than others.  Hardest part was receiving merchandise off the truck and stocking the floor.
good,Over all it's not a bad place to work. Can get really busy at time. Although if you have ADHD you might feel as if you are going out of your mind especially on slow days.
good,"A typical day at work would be organizing, cleaning, and customer servicing. Everyday you need to make sure all customers leave with what they are looking for and have a great shopping experience knowing sales associates are there to help. I learned a lot of communication skills working for DSW, retail skills in general, and shoe brands. The management was good because they taught great ways to handle tough situations and had everything well organized throughout the workplace. Co-workers were nice but are not allowed to speak to one another, just to focus on the customers and job. The hardest part of the job was to stop thieves. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a real connection with customers and being able to help them and make them happy."
good,A typical day at show warehouse consisted of opening the store. Then assisting customers with any type of problem or concern they may have. Ringing customers through till. Managing daily paperwork.I had great coworkers and we all got along fairly easily and assisted each other in daily activities. The hardest part of the job would be doing stock which came in irregular proportions. It worked out when we all worked together on it. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all types of customers and making their day.
good,"It's a great place to work, there's a great atmosphere. The managers were great, and I loved the majority of my coworkers, most customers were really friendly and looked up to you for advice and help. The only things I didn't like were the lack of hours, and the fact that you were ""graded"" at the end of your shift."
good,"De meeste waardering krijg je van de medewerkers, vaak verstandelijk gehandicapte medemens."
good,"Although this is a typical retail position with rotating hours/days and schedules planned only a week in advance, the people employed by DSW are a fun-loving group that help to make the day seem to go by faster."
good,This is a great job to have as a part-time. The employee discount is awesome.
good,"Co-Workers are amazing, management had its flaws but for the most part it they made it  a cool place to work. the job was easy and a lot of fun"
good,I work as a customer service sales associate and cashier. I work with customers and sell shoes and accessories. I also worked with money as a cashier handling money.
good,"At DSW is where I've learned how to communicate with customers on a daily basis.  Helping out a customer in need is always a good feeling of accomplishment once they've found what they were looking for.  DSW has a very friendly management staff that will train you to become a great sale associate.  The hardest part about working at DSW was learning all of the ""in-style"" wear for the season that caught the customers attention.  Working with this establishment is something to always remember because of the friendly greetings and the unforgettable goodbyes."
good,Enjoyable place to work. A typical day would include cleaning up the floor and making sure shoes are presented properly while assisting customers
good,"This has to be one of my favorite jobs! I was there for almost a year, but I was also still in high school so I was trying to focus on graduating/ prom etc... There were very flexible around my schedule also . We also got pretty good discounts on merchandise as well so that was a bonus!"
good,"I loved working for DSW, unfortunately I had to relocate. It felt like I could interact with my co-workers as if they were family, and that is important to me."
good,"No complaints, just have to work a lot of hours to receive a positive check every 2 weeks. You HAVE to work a weekend day. Make plans in your life 1-2 weeks before hand before the schedule is set or just put in a request form a week before."
good,"A typical day is helping customers and sorting out shoes."
good,"It was definitely a fun place to work in, there was always something to do with a lot of great people. The only hard part was making sure everything got done in time due to the fact our store was short staffed. The only bad part about this company is the lack of respect by head office. They refused to put many workers to full time status, even though they were working full time hours. They were very slow and bad with communicating with the associates. And some workers from head office were really rude when it came to workers, making us keep workers that were constantly skipping shifts, yet penalizing the workers who would actually do there job"
good,"The management was great. They overlooked my inexperience and helped teach me everything there was to know. They were patient and very approachable. "
good,"the two years that I have worked here was fun. Always meeting new people, love the discount and all you talked about was shoes and feet but learned about of information that you would not expect.  new the differences about shoes designers, what shoes where good to wear and what shoes where bad to wear."
good,I am responsible for all office paperwork.
good,Locally owned shoe store no benefits but i worked with them since before opening so was able to advance seen alot of people come and go
good,fun fast pace shoe store co wokers were great pay was good always stayed busy witch i like customer were fun to be around i cant say to much about management they had poblems keeping a manager i had 4 with in the year n half i was there other wise i loved this job.
good,"I learned how to ring as a cashier after three months of me working as a regular sales associate on the floor. I've also learned how to satisfy my customer a little better than i did at my previous job. There was no more having difficulties with walking up to a customer and finding exactly what they were looking for. if we didn't have it, there was success in suggestions."
good,Help Customers find product
good,Overall i enjoyed working for DSW. I actually loved my job there! The only thing i was frustrated about was when some of the workers didnt actually do much work which meant more for me. What i learned from wrking there was how to actually work with people as a team also as an employee. Which was actually not as bad as i thought it would be. My most enjoyable part of the job was seeing my customers leave satisfied and to make sure they came back to visit! The management could have a been a bit more put together as a team and not so much as an indivisual.
good,10/10 is a great workplace to be in. The management is fantastic and always positive. Never any negative outcomes with them. The people that work there as well are just as great.
good,"I've been with the Company for about 6 years and the company has been very good to me. It took me much longer to go up while other new hires were offered my current position at the same rate. But, they are equipped to help you as much as they can within their power."
good,"Management is excellent, work environment is good, though lots of work and less time, minimum wage and too much work, no benefits and no job security.  Much hard working environment."
good,"Friendly associates are the best part about working here. You are to embrace different aspects of the job, whether it be cashiering, customer service, or warehouse duties with help and training from management."
good,Getting the opportunity to work at the Shoe Company was primarily a great working environment. I enjoyed the people I had worked with and helping customers pick shoes they love. Management was great for the most part. There was long shifts and Miscommunication. I really enjoyed being part of there team for time I worked there.
good,It is a great workplace and a lot of customer servicing. Engagement is the key to drive results at all times. We are always here for our customers! This vision definitely made its way for me to be a better supervisor.
good,Management was helpful and patient with me as a new driver and I was able to gain much needed experience on the road and develop the skills necessary to be a good driver.
good,The Shoe Company provides employees many opportunities to step up and develop transferable work skills. It is a healthy and fun work environment that is very accommodating to your personal life and schedules.
good,"Fun"
good,This has been a favourite job of mine. I like the people I work with. The managers are easy to get along with although the store manager could try and be more understanding. We work hard for yall. The reason I left was because of the hours. There are none but they keep preaching hours will come. Sad to leave.
good,"Teamwork is how this store runs which is nice. Management is very nice, caring, and understanding. Other employees are kind and always willing to give a helping hand."
good,"Fun work environment with managers who want to teach you everything you need to know so you can succeed.  Like anywhere else in retail, the customers are the worst, but other than that its an easy place to work."
good,I enjoy helping people that come into DSW and I enjoy working with my managers and coworkers. I have learned how to provide a quick and efficient checkout process for customers.
good,It wasn't my cup of tea but it was a job.  Typical day of stocking items.  Some turn over in supervisors and didn't stay long enough to learn a whole lot.
good,Great place to work. Most managers are easy to talk to and quick to help. Amazing open door policy. Quickly made friends and always encourage to grow new relationships. Steady and reliable work.
good,"Working at DSW has been of many ups & downs. It really depends on the kind of management you have at the store. It's not hard to learn what to do when you get hired, it just takes practice and finessing. The biggest annoyance is the Rewards Program. If you get a ""miss"" (getting someone who says “no”) to the program, you might be ""coached"" on how to get a sign-up. I understand that the rewards program brings customers back into the store, but they (the company and maybe a manger) make employees feel like trash if they get a no. Besides the ridiculous rewards program, its a really enjoyable job. I like my coworkers and don't dread going in to work everyday. I've learned how to communicate better and I have more knowledge of how things work in business. A typical day for me is either being up at the cash wrap all day or being on the floor helping customers. It's entirely dependent on who else is working that day and who is better at what. I genuinely enjoy this job and would recommend, especially if you are looking to go into sales!"
good,"A typical work day would consist of helping customers find the right style and pair of shoes, cash the customers out, and keeping the store clean and tidy. I learned to always ask what the customer wants and how to make them walk away with a smile. The management was good. They were very kind and understanding to any situation. The workplace culture was productive and relaxing, the associates were kind and nice people to talk to and yet passionate about providing the best service. The hardest part of the job was unpacking the stock since the store did not have a proper back room and thus, we had to unload the stock behind a tarp, leading to customers trying to enter. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to explore all the possibilities of shoes with the different personalities of both the customers and associates."
good,Very diverse and job friendly company. There were many opportunities to learn fast and climb the latter of success. Great management and great company overall.
good,"Excellent place to work, would not have left but position was eliminated.  2 divisions ABG and segment.  CEO is very forward thinking and incredibly talented.  Will definitely see DSW into the future of retail."
good,"very easy and steady work "
good,"I worked here part time while I was still in high school and my manager was very understanding of time off requests for school. My co-workers were great and my manager ran a tight ship. When he was transferred to another store things kind of fell apart as we got a manager that was not particularly good at her job, but the company is very well run with great staff initiatives to up sales. However if you are like me and love shoes... not the best place to work when you're trying to save money. :)"
good,"When I worked here, management was available almost all the time to see and they recognize associates over the headsets for doing great things and update us on where we were on the sales goal for the day, basically encouraging us to do better if sales goal has not yet been met. As a student, like many others we are stuck with the minimum wage and will not receive any raises until the minimum wage rises."
good,DSW is a great job if you don't mind standing/walking your whole shift and doing fairly tedious tasks. My coworkers and managers were kind and helpful and the hours weren't too bad. They're flexible especially if you're attending school.
good,I have worked at DSW for a little over 3 years and I have greatly enjoyed my time with the company. It is frequently growing and offers opportunity for employee growth.
good,working at DSW brings you out of your shell. youre constantly talking to customers and recommending whats best for them or just helping them find what they want. winter months are slow which can slow your day down but the warm weather and holidays bring in many customers. the employees there are all great friendly people and are willing to make sure you work to the best of your abilities
good,Everyone at this job was very friendly and helpful. When you needed help with something they made sure to stop whatever it is that they were doing and help you out with what you needed. They taught me more people skills and how to react with customer service.
good,"Employees were great and hard working. but managers where bad making schedules and distributing responsibilities. "
good,"Although competing to get reward sign-ups is stressful and yes it puts a lot of pressure on the employees. DSW is a really fun and lively place to work. When you work here you aren't just part of a staff, you are part of a community and a family."
good,"During my time at Townshoes, ive had the best experience with my coworkers and customers. It definitely expanded my knowledge and skills in which I can use for the future."
good,"Great work culture. Focuses on strong values: Collaboration, Humility, Accountability, and Passion. They are currently going through changes trying to survive the retail landscape."
good,I enjoy working for DSW. It is a relaxed environment. The company has great core values and really focuses on developing their employees. Customer engagement is key and this company does well with it.
good,"helps keep u style related, relaxed environment, constantly moving, standing or walkin. good employee discounts. great for part time student or secound job"
good,Easy entry level retail/customer service job. Paid the bills while going through school. Decent pay for entry level work. Flexible scheduling. Fun work atmosphere.
good,"Fast paced and customer orientated. Learn good customer service skills. Very friendly and understanding management, never had any problems when I was not able to make it to work."
good,"You meet a lot of nice and mature people that become part of a little family. The managers were really helpful and awesome, not only would they give you work advice but life advice aswell."
good,"Working at DSW, you must show passion and the strive to hit a personal goal while working with your coworkers and managers. You need to be very willing to work in the upbeat pace of retail; keeping up with the occasional customer who'll try to dampen your spirits to maintaining the bathroom. "
good,Great place to work with great values incorporated. Always looking at improving benefits for the employees. Position openings can be hard to obtain. Great place for school bound students as you can make your schedule in detail from any phone or computer.
good,"The time that I worked at DSW was pretty tricky because we were changing  a lot of management and retaining managers that, quite frankly, were lazy and useless. Not only did some of these managers just hide in the office, but when the coach you it's not helpful criticism. Aside from the management, the company itself is pretty good. The focus on the rewards program was strong and we were pressured to get sign ups at the register and on the sales floor, which not everyone is good at. I wasn't too bad at it and I didn't feel too pressured or care that much about killing my customers with the pressure to sign up. The company also set up hotlines and services if you needed to report anything like harassment or any kind of misconduct that you'd like to give anonymously which is great. Overall, the job isn't too hard and isn't too bad, just watch out for lazy managers that are fake and aren't friendly!"
good,"Employees are more like a family and we spent time outside of work as well. Organized movie nights, Secret Santa, Christmas dinners."
good,"At the time of my working at DSW i found the workplace environment fun, easy going, open and challenging. Helping customers find what they need was a challenge at times but definitely fun and seeing how happy they are to have the attention and assistance they needed was  quite enjoyable. Management was always available to us and if we needed more training or wanted to learn something they were always  willing to help and teach us."
good,"The managers are very friendly and very personable. You really feel like a family while working at DSW. If you ever have any questions about something, a manager is typically always available to help you out with whatever it is you're having trouble with. The customers are usually very friendly but you will always get the occasional customer who takes out their bad day on you."
good,"The company as a whole strives to present a welcoming climate for everyone, as the groups that I have worked with often represented a diverse cross section of races, cultures, religions and ages. "
good,Good place to work if you're into fashion and loves shoes. You should be able to help customers find the perfect shoes for certain occasions. The store is big so there should be a pretty big selection for shoes
good,I enjoyed working for DSW as a SM but feel that the compensation for SMs is very inconsistent. Internal promotions make much less than new to company hires.
good,Employees are great to work with and are very friendly. The company itself is amazing and actually cares for their employees and customers and is dedicated to constantly bettering their business in the eyes of the employees and customers.
good,"It's a great place to get your first work experience, my co-workers are really nice to me and always backing me up and also the teamwork chemistry is right on point so i strongly recommend to work here if you have the opportunity"
good,"Fast paced environment, work weekends and around holidays, opportunities for advancement. Meet different people everyday. My biggest issue was having theft through the stores. They are big on networking within the company and knowing your peers and the ""who is who"". Quality award for great customer service recognized all the way from customers to the CEO."
good,Challenging Retail Environment but Fantastic Culture -- You are expected to work hard and get the opportunity to work alongside very talented ambitious people.  You will get noticed and recognized as a hardworker.
good,"I've worked with dsw for a year and a half now"
good,Unloading truck putting shoes on the floor customer svc. Productive fun group of people to work with management are profestional being part of a team is great
good,work revolves around customer service. you must love people in order to work here. they are very flexible with scheduling so its a great company if u have kids. moving up is difficult. you need to be with the company a minimum of 2 years in order to be promoted. the pay is good. they are always reasonable with what you need from them to make you  better employee.
good,"I initially really enjoyed the job. They really built themselves around being people centric internally and externally which really resonated with me personally.  My biggest concern was the disconnect from corp partners to field with unrealistic or inconsistent expectations.  I get that Corps role is to establish goals and the field to execute, however there needs to be proper planning and communication before execution."
good,My manager/the owner was absolutely amazing. Always given the opportunity to improve and move ahead. Given responsibilities as you get ahead
good,"-fun and busy work environment"
good,"Great place to work helpful and friendly work environment but"
good,DSW has lots to offer and will allow you to step out of your comfort zone and engage with customers from all over town. A typical day consists of lots of inventory maintenance and helping solve any issues customers may have.
good,"A great place for advancement. Flexible work hours and positive work flow. Employee discount was the best ever, from any retail work I've previously done. Hard working, driven individuals were amongst my peers, which were great to work with."
good,"its a great place to work and the people who work there are great. Flexible hours. hours aren't always guaranteed, even if you are full time but the boss does her best."
good,"The work may or may not be meaningful for some, it is what you make of it. I enjoy working for the company, and particularly for my Store Manager. I enjoy going to work each day and get along great with my co-workers. The only negatives about the company is that they do not promote from within, shifts can be canceled at the last moment, or cut short. Not everyone is motivated to work at the same level of passion."
good,"Very fun workplace, great friendly co-workers and customers, great first job."
good,Mondays would be paperwork. Tuesday and Thursday would be stock. Wednesday would be markdowns/new promo set ups.
good,"I like working for DSW what I don't like working for is one of the specific managers, but I would say that is a small footnote to the DSW life. I feel like everyone that works there is a part of my family. Sometimes it can take a long time to advance even from a part time associate to a full time."
good,"I didnt mind working for DSW, but there are just some indefinite dates I was unable to work."
good,"DSWv was actually one of the best jobs I've had. The customers were great, and my peers were awesome."
good,"I worked the evening shift. In a typical day I would come to work punch in for the day greet and join others in a large sitting room,  and await with my fellow coworkers for an assignment  or manifest. As drivers we didn't always have a schedule ready to go out the door sometime you'd have to wait awhile. The room filled with voice and laughter or mild jokes from some of the fellows, subjects on any where from sports to politics.This is when you get to learn people, so many funny personality and creative people. Hardest part of the job I can't recall if a challenge came up I would know what to do. There  were people to reach if some place we simply couldn't get to or other things come up. We were always in touch with a professional dispatcher for change in route or emergency at times that would come up, or simply client cancellation. There was great camaraderie!"
good,Shoes do not sell themselves nor do brand names.  Customer service is of the highest expectation in footwear sales.  The company not as established as it is now but while employed at TownShoes profit was the main focus instead of proper training of staff and unfortunately with the expectation of expansion that never really happened and more and more positions needed to be filled this company did not exceed my expectations but truly had the potential .
good,got along with most employees but sometimes managers weren't on the same page
good,"A great place to help with customer service skills. A nice, friendly environment. I learned different values and i interacted with different people of all race."
good,"DSW Inc. is centered on customer service and pleasing the customers. It is a fast paced environment to keep up the cleanliness of the store, yet it is a very chill and relaxed environment that keeps all the employees connected."
good,"Fun place to work, love my managers, barely get any hours. My co-workers are amazing, everyone has a good attitude and a great sense of humor. Hardest part of the job is getting customers to sign up for rewards, and if you don't, you managers get mad at you."
good,It's typical retail. Everyday blurs together. Some days can be pretty fun. Environment is pretty chill.
good,"It's retail so you never know what's going to walk through the door, but you definitely get out what you put in. Don't expect to stand around and do nothing as there is always something to do."
good,"A typical day at work was maintaining your side of the sales floor, giving great customer service, and making sure you were consistent in where you were placed. i learned a lot of new skills with this job. Working at DSW helped me manage my time, be more aware of my surroundings, and helped me develop as a whole. the management did their job to hold up the stores maintenance."
good,Going to work is exciting with co-workers that are fun to talk to and helping customers and interacting with all sorts of people is an amazing experience.
good,"DSW was a pretty good place to work. Some employees definitely worked harder than others so that can get frustrating, and managers tend to have favorites and let them do whatever (easier) tasks they please."
good,"Always busy, Customer service is first and foremost. Know and have the ability to adapt to change and  work under pressure in an ever changing and fast paced environment."
good,Lots of shoes to try and buy if you are a shoeholic. Heavy lifting is required as well as being comfortable climbing ladders. Some repetitive work and lots of cleaning up after customers.
good,DSW was one of the best jobs I have had its very hard work but advancement opportunities are there managers care about there employees and there personal needs.
good,I liked working here but towards the end the management changed and i decided i did not want to continue working there because of it. that's not a valid excuse to quit but i did anyway
good,it was fun working at shoe metro. I was able to inbuilt many capabilities within me. I could come up with new skill sets. i was able to meet up with new people.
good,"Coworkers and everyday tasks are manageable"
good,"Working at DSW is great. It gives costumer service experience; however, full-time positions is not available for all employees. Only managers get full-time. Managers are nice, they are very big on costumer service and keeping the store clean. It is a good first job to start off with."
good,Overall great place to work! Plenty of room for advancement if your willing to learn! Great work life balance. Outstanding benefits and discounts for those you with family!
good,"All good things come to an end, looking forward to my next chapter .I have enjoyed my time at Townshoes, I feel like I take with me some great achievements from creating problem solving strategies to make for a successful store result."
good,"I've been working at The Shoe Company for over a year now and it was my first job, and for a fist job i would definitely recommend it. like all jobs it has it ups and downs but overall it taught me a lot. and teaches you a lot about customer service"
good,"Fun, exciting place to work.  Retail hours are retail hours, but it is fun with the staff there!  Knowledgeable group of people and they are very flexible."
good,"DSW is a great place to work however, the managers really make or break the store. If you speak to the managers it is fairly easy to get the hours that you need. Also you get a raise every six months which is nice especially for retail."
good,I really like working for dsw. It was  in a fast pace arera.  I was moved to management within 3 months of working.  I had the opportunity to meet really important people.
good,"I only worked part time at town shoes and I enjoyed it for the most part simply because of the team of people that I had working with me. There was nothing too hard about the job but there could have been better help with coaching people to help them do better in sales, and also better product in the store."
good,My coworkers made the job somewhat enjoyable. The closing process was extrememly long and tedious. Management tended to show favoritism to certain employees.
good,"The management at DSW inc. is very good. The setting of the workplace gives off an overall fun and relaxed environment, while also becoming serious and highly productive. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the chance to interact and connect with customers. This job is a very stress free position and it is very fun to work there."
good,They really gave back to their employees provided customer service was your top priority. Ensured your secret shopper reviews got good scores you were rewarded with bonus bucks. one dollar for every buck. It was nice to not have to pay for shoes and it was a great incentive to keep the employees motivated and wanting to do their job.
good,"It's a fun job everyone is helpful and supportive but under the new managment hours are cut. The managers and staff are friendly, you can give or take shift within your department"
good,"I enjoyed my time with DSW. It was hectic, stressful, and sometimes borderline insane, but I learned to work in a hectic environment with great people."
good,"DSW is a good place to work depending on your job. Even amongst associates, there are some people who are always running the front end (which sucks) and some who work in clearance, etc. There is a lot of pressure that is sometimes unrealistic to sign up people for the rewards program. However, the people you work with are wonderful and accepting. Sometimes it seems like management has lost touch with the realities of checking out hundreds of people in a day.. I.e. there’s a good chance you’ll have at least one person who doesn’t want to sign up for the rewards program. Flexible scheduling in ADVANCE— meaning, when the schedule is being made, you put in whatever days you can’t work and they honor that. If you call out, you’ll get a “point” even if you give advanced notice (certain number of points and you’re fired)."
good,Great company over all but some stores need a complete employee change! cool perks but they push you to drive rewards at register and make you call out your no's and yes's!
good,"I worked at DSW in high school and they were good at being flexible with my schedule. The managers there were understanding and nice, and worked with me. I enjoyed working there and it gave me a good first work experience"
good,I wish I stayed here. I loved the job. The employees were wonderful. Such a positive vibe. I learned a lot working there. Skill improvements for future employment.
good,"A typical day involves traditional retail customer service tasks: cashiering, stocking, product orders, customer service and store recovery."
good,DSW taught me a lot about customer service. My managers were fantastic and I really enjoyed the time i spent working for them. I looked forward to work every day
good,Let me start with the employees working there they are AMAZING they make feel like home and comfortable in the working environment. Management is amazing and free-spirited.
good,"My typical day at work often went along the lines of selling shoes, or helping customers out with anything they needed. The job taught me how to stock items properly, read online orders, associate with people and learn vital experiences to aid me with life or my next job. The most enjoyable part of my job was making sales and seeing people happy that thy got the shoes for them. I also enjoyed getting complimented for my service. Though the most difficult part of the job was the sudden rush of people around the last hour or two of work."
good,Everyone that worked at the Shoe Company was quite friendly and willing to help when assistance was needed. You could always ask for assistance if you were not sure how to do something. It was a fun work environment.
good,"working at dsw for the small time I have has been one of the most challenging and beneficial experiences I've had so far. the managers make sure you know how to do your job, that you are comfortable, and are very flexible with scheduling. the overall moral is very good, I enjoy coming in to work everyday and appreciate them for teaching me responsibility and expanding my sutomer service and multi-tasking skills"
good,Great place for development and advancement.  The company has been at the leading edge of the shoe business and consistently evolving with the retail industry.
good,I really enjoy working at DSW as everyone is nice and friendly. The staff is great and so is the environment. The assistant managers are nice but the store manager is a little strict.
good,"DSW is a good company to work for if you have a family because they understand work/life balance. It is your typical sales associate type of work environment, nothing out of the ordinary."
good,"working at Townshoes was a great experience, i learned a lot during my time with Town. managing clients, Sales on a daily basis along with hitting targets on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Townshoes Taught me various things one most importantly is how to handle and maintain a positive workplace environment, as easy as it sounds working in a commission based workplace its easier than most to step on other peoples toes, but Townshoes taught me how to be a leader in circumstances and how to resonate a positive and enjoyable fun place to work amongst others."
good,I love working at the shoe company in Sudbury  my manager is so good to all the employees and makes everyday fun .. she makes us feel valued everyday and tells us what a great job we do.
good,"This is a great job to have, the working environment is always comforting and welcoming, the deals on the shoes were amazing and I loved buying the shoes."
good,Great work place mangers were awesome! Our stores DM was very involved and supportive of our needs. The discount is awesome for shoe lovers it’s a great place to work.
good,"Day to day a routine is hard to develop when the expectations continue to change daily. The people are great and the interaction between the store and home office is constant. That is good, but can be an issue if all people are not on the same page."
good,When you can work whatever day and hour then DSW is ok. They do not have alot of room to help ypur grow or move up. They also make sellig shoes slightly top serious.
good,The management team really does listen to and take to heart the feedback of the staff. In that way the associates feel comfortable and confident in seeking guidance or support. Effective coaching is also given to help improve the performance of each associate and there thus the overall success of the store.
good,I really do not remember anything from working at DSW expect for getting experience on customers service and I worked with great people also I learned how to adopt to different people. I learned more about women's shoes/boots and men's shoes/sneakers/boots.
good,Working at DSW I learned a lot more about shoes. It was always very busy which is one of the reasons i loved working with the company. My co workers was always full of energy and made me feel welcomed. i loved going to to work.
good,Every day was a faced with a new challenge. We had our daily work with customers and providing an excellent customer experience along with properly merchandising the store according to store layouts. Leading the merchandise team to unload four trucks of merchandise per week and allocate appropriate budget and time to complete the placement of new store merchandise. Management had to handle difficult situations with customers and sales associates and motivate the sales team with enthusiasm to reach daily goals.
good,"Easy going coworkers, managers are very nice and helpful feel free to ask about whatever you don't know, and the job is easy to accomplish just learn the store outline and it's products."
good,"DSW was definitely a challenging but fun store to work at.."
good,Engagement with customers is one of the highlights of my job! Its a great place to work if you love style and customer engagement.
good,"Worked for an amazing store manager, helped make the store one of the highest profiting stores in central Florida. Had a great staff and created lasting relationships."
good,"Great staff and managers. Starting pay not great (in NYC) however, if one is willing and interested, very easy to move up in positions. Managers were more than willing to train me in anything I showed interest in."
good,"Typical day was spent assisting customers with anything they needed. Finding the right size, finding the perfect shoe for special occasions, and so much more. The other associates were super friendly and awesome. There is really nothing that I can complain about when it comes to them. There are little things that I could pick at, but everyone has things that they pick about."
good,"The Shoe Company was my first job, starting in the summer time I was thrown right into the chaos of the back-to-school rush. Starting off you're dealing with customers face to face, solving their problems and learning about the products quickly. As you gain more experience there you get more and more responsibility to handle. You'll eventually learn how to cash out customers, handle special and web orders, create visual displays, handle stock, and open and close tills. The hours will vary depending on the season, summertime around July/August and early September the store gets quite busy so you'll receive many hours. Then in the winter around when the first snow falls the store gets extremely busy with customers buying boots. Afterwards till about April it's quite slow. I learned quite a bit from my three years at The Shoe Company. It's a great place to help you gain some work experience in the retail industry,"
good,"working at mcdonalds was very fun, and paced"
good,"A typical day at work comes different everyday. There are slow days and extremely busy days. I learned a lot working here, I grew into the position of being a Cash Wrap Supervisor and I've learned to love the position.  Management is not bad, It really depends on the personality of the associate and how they interact with them. The most enjoyable part of thee job is my co workers. The hardest part is not being fully motivated daily."
good,Great environment outgoing place to work well round great place to work
good,Overall happy with my experience. The work life balance could have used a bit more work.
good,"* Organize the store"
good,"-Very busy especially on summer however i had fun working there and meet new nice people"
good,"Overall, I really enjoy working at DSW. It never feels like work because I always have fun interacting with everyone from the customers to my co-workers. The company really tries to create a unique culture of ""Shoe Lovers"". Appreciation for employees is shown through ways such as ""Bravo"" Cards and free products. The company continuously seeks for new and better ways to reward its employees and that translates to excellent customer service. As with any retail job, the most challenging part is dealing with difficult customers, but personally I take it as a learning experience to strengthen my communication skills. I would definitely recommend working at DSW."
good,My opinion designer shoe warehouse is a great place to work because I always had a task to complete which is great because I like to stay busy throughout the day. Whenever I needed help to complete my task I always had co-workers and a good management team to help me out. I've learned how to manage my stock team which brought me closer to my co-workers. Every couple of months we had fashion shows at the job which ive participated in and I enjoyed it.
good,"A typical shift at DSW, Inc would include helping customers find items requested and stocking shelves on the sales floor. I had learned how to provide friendly and persistent customer service and problem-solving skills during my time at DSW, Inc. The management at the company was helpful in providing advice for improving your selling skills. My co-workers were extremely friendly, professional, respectful and welcoming. They were very hard-working and helpful in all situations. The hardest part of the job was getting customers to sign up for the rewards program. The most enjoyable part of working for DSW, Inc, however, was the satisfaction of helping the customers find the items they were in need of."
good,Not enough hours to go around. You are lucky if you work more than 8 hours a week.
good,"Daily schedule of customer service, shipment and merchandising."
good,"Typical work day consisted of unloading the trucks, training new managers, merchandising the sales floor and dealing with customers."
good,"- helping customers what they want and ringing in sales "
good,Delivering great customer service running the register keeping my work area clean and organized.Aid customer in locating merchandize that fir their individualn taste.I learned how to work with more then one customer and keeping my store stock and organized.I have great manager i enjoy working with tham.A great tean of co-workers who work hard and we all work together . The hours are up and down some time you work 30 hours a week and some time you work 10. I want a full time job and career. My customer i enjoy service and helping tham.
good,"Great job to work at. The company truly tries to live their values and make sure that the employees are happy also. flexible schedules, the hardest part would probably be dealing with difficult customers."
good,"Customer Service"
good,"I was a pharmacy technician and so I was always on my feet and always super busy.  I learned how to do a lot of things that you would learn in the pharmacy field, this was nice considering I am working on going to med school in a few years.  Management was good.  My co-workers were very professional and fun.  The hardest part of the job was learning how to submit insurance claims and reading doctor's handwritting!  The most enjoyable part was working together with co-workers as a team and having fun at the same time.  I also liked the pay and the people I worked with.  They all had a special individuallity about themselves, which was hard to find.  VERY GOOD JOB FIELD!"
good,"Although the compensation and benefits could be better, the people and values are super great. Everybody cooperates and shares necessary information with each other."
good,"A typical day would be clocking in, speaking with the manager on duty about what tasks need to be done and start working on them. If not that then i would be assign to a register where i happily ring up customers. I learned how to work the register as well as a lot of information about shoes. I enjoy my co-workers, from the teenagers up to our elderly associates. The hardest part of the job would be not finsing the correct shoes that the customer invision. The most enjoyable part is when i put all of my effort into making sure the customer left our store satisfied."
good,"Nice discount on all merchandise, you get to dress in your best clothes and work part time helping those find cute shoes and purses. Management was nice and understanding, brought home about $180.00 a week and worked about 12 to 15 a week, not too bad."
good,Delivering and traveling cargo across country
good,"Busy from the minute you walk in. recieve the truck at 6:00am make sure all freight is out by 12:00pm, make the morning line up for the store, check sales, check emails for all new promos, set up any new pop before start of business. crucial morning huddle making sure the whole team is ready and on the same page for the day. amazing staff I call it ""the machine"" always ready for anything. hardest part of the job is making sure freight is out by 12:00pm, but like any job no question it has to get done. best part of my job is my staff and coworkers."
good,I liked doing everything there. The job was easy. I got along with everybody
good,"Very consistent job positions, friendly work place, smooth"
good,"I had a lot of fun working at DSW, I have fun coworkers and my managers were fun but strict at the same time."
good,What I learned at shoe warehouse was how to be a good leader and how to better my problem solving skills. I did not have much experience in that part of any retail establishment I had the pleasure working with and I am great full for what I learned.
good,"customer-oriented, fun place to work. Must be customer service focused to strive in this type of retail work. Nice management who looks after employees."
good,"Inshow up to work. Friendly, good attendance. Work hard when need to. Not the fastest but it gets done. Smiling even on them days when you dont want to"
good,"Everyone who works here is super friendly and sweet all of the time. We have established a great sense of family and friendship while working with each other. All tasks, for the most part, are always carried out to standard by each of our associates."
good,"This is a Good place to work. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The manager worked with availability. "
good,"Great place to work. It has an okay discount for employees and the management is great. If you are looking for a good part time job that is great for students with a busy schedule, then look no further."
good,The shoe company was a fun and exciting place to work. I made great friends and all of the managers were friendly and helpful and readily available whenever I needed them.
good,"i really really loved working at DSW for right out of high school. it taught me a lot about the job market and workplace without being too demanding or filled with drama, the videos provided by the CEO and quarterly meetings made associates feel like we were impacting the company in a vital way. when things didn’t seem to work, the “big five” seemed to listen to worker complaints and make changes accordingly."
good,We had a great management team and sales team. It was a lot of fun. Everything became friends and would hang out outside of work(Excluding management)
good,This is my first job outside out of college. Learned so much during my time and it was an invaluable experience. The company culture was great. Still am friends with many of the people I worked with.
good,"Southgate was a very enjoyable location, my coworkers were encouraging and supportive. The store manager was very kind, new how to run a store. Hardest part of the job was dealing with people that wanted to return worn shoes, or not being able to work once a week. I learned how to personally connect with customers while balancing helping many of them at the same time. I enjoyed being able to engage with customers personally and find what they were looking for."
good,sets goals for employees to achieve. \it was fun to make those goals with my fun co-workers. It was a great place to be and I made money while enjoying myself
good,"I was happy with my career at DSW. While the retail space is hard anyway, DSW made this a cool place to manage. My store was clean, we got a great discount. It was fast paced. All in all, a great job."
good,DSW was a good place to work. The team and managers were very friendly. They were understanding when it came to making your schedule and you can change your availability to whatever whenever. They put too much pressure on the rewards system and stressed cashiers to get sign ups.
good,"it was great working there, coworkers and management were great. Not many hours, having good sales attitude needed for this job. I had a lot of fun working here. My coworkers were like family"
good,"I have been an assistant manager for 3 years with DSW. I originally LOVED it. They preach work-life balance, try to make training and development fun, hands-on, and interactive. You really feel the ""work family"" value here. Everyone truly cares about each others well being. But everyone also knows there is a job to be done, take care of our customers and work quickly and efficiently. Here recently has been more stressful due to lack of hour and the company trying to do new things to drive profit which in return is exhausting the managers. There's a large gap sometimes of communication from home office to the actual retail stores."
good,"Amazing learning experience with training teams, planning for major sales events/peak seasons, managing hours and balancing budget and goals. Best part of the job is utilizing the team to achieve various goals to benefit store operations, store environment, overall progress. Its really rewarding to celebrate those achievements as a team. Hardest part of the job is balancing executing various task during peak seasons while maintaining a budgeted amount of hours and ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and on time."
good,"The Shoe Company is a great workplace that helps you gain the experience and gets you working on good habits that improve your skills. The Shoe company team is very helpful, understanding, nice, and fun to work with! The most enjoyable part of the job is gaining more experience every day, with new tasks, and working with different people from different areas. Overall The Shoe Company is a great place to experience, learn, and grow."
good,I worked here while I was in College and I absolutely loved it. All the workers were so nice and they were always so understanding when I was in finals and needed more time to study. They're very good at training you and always willing to help you when needed. You get a 30% regular priced items discount which was great as well. My favourite part of this job was definitely the people.
good,"Regular sales and operational tasking; great store managers. "
good,"i really like working at DSW it was great,  it was good sales experience I gain there. Sales experience gives me lifelong skills to make me more successful in my  future jobs!!"
good,"A typical day at Town Shoes was great, made a lot of sales, management was alright, enjoyable place to work. Learned a lot about different shoes, different styles and learned a lot about how to show great customer service skills"
good,"In a typical work day, I always have the opportunity to learn something new, its a great work atmosphere and the work schedule is alright can be better but it is good so far, the management is amazing everyone is polite and kind and fun to work with."
good,"Good place to work , just long hours , very friendly environment & good people , great cafeteria & food , customers can be rude at times though but you get what you go for"
good,amazing for a first time job and not a lot of unessary pressure to sell they teach you well enough for you to do it yourself and get better management has always been a pleasure
good,"Working at the shoe company, expands my customer engagement training ,meeting new and old customers to build the dynamic to have continuing customers to the store."
good,The job at DSW was very good because it was very social and collaborative but it was faced paced because there was a lot of people in the store before holidays and after but it was a lot of commitment and hardwork .
good,"The Shoe Company had great management and provided a work and life balance that was beneficial while  I was still in school. The job taught me how to branch out of my comfort zone by pushing to meet sales goals every week, as well I learned how to work with a team. The best part about my job was the atmosphere and great team of other employees that worked with me."
good,DSW has helped me grow as an individual and with job experience. It provides a friendly and positive environment and has taught me so much in the time I have been here.
good,"DSW isn't a bad place to work at all. I love the staff everyone is so easy going and relaxed. The ONLY issue is lack of hours, I barely work but when I do I have a blast."
good,"I liked working at DSW because it was spacious, I was assigned to a specific floor and able to know everything that what was on my floor and able to help easier because of that. Management let you control the floor unless there were any major issues going on."
good,"The shoe company is a good place to work,  allowing room for advancement ank skill development. They offer regular trainings and always looking ways to inprove the work environment. I enjoyed that I could learn and use new skills, the team was always great to work with."
good,"I have worked for DSW for 2 and a half years now, and I have to say it is one of the best job changes I made. However, there have been numerous store manager changes through the 2 years but now we have good management, ones that care for their employees. They have favorites, but everyone is treated fairly and no one is ever talked down to. The discount is pretty good (30% off) and the fellow sales associates are all nice! Everyone gets about the same hours, (4-5 hour shifts) making is about a 16-20 hour work week. All sales associates are part time. There is room for growth, however they tend to not promote people unless you ask for it, or if they really like you. "
good,The people that work here are super nice. Management will work with you if you have a crazy schedule. Good with working with school schedules. pay is pretty good.
good,The pace of work varies depending on the store that you work at but all stores are very similar in atmosphere. The company has great values and is great to work for.
good,"Town Shoes prides themselves on excellent customer service with quality products. If you are passionate about fashion this job will never get dull. Equipped with provided product knowledge and personal taste, styling in-coming shoe lovers feels more like shopping with a friend. Company contests and incentives help keep the passion alive in a safe and friendly environment. Keeping everyone in the loop, about store and individual performance, helps create a sense of purpose as your daily and weekly goals are set for your success. Town's open door policy ensures no one is left unheard and they continuously work towards ""happiness through self-expression."""
good,"Daily tasks in the morning included picking and packing shoes for online orders, arranging new promotion and receiving new shipment of shoes/ store supplies."
good,"DSW was a fun place to work. It can get hectic at times, but not overwhelming. Management was understanding and very supportive. It was like working with family."
good,Great Company to work for and grow your career. The company feels like a family business with open door policies. A very committed team who prides themselves on delivering a positive customer experience
good,"My days pretty much consisted of cleaning up after customers who left shoe parties on the floor, helping guests check out at the cash register, and replenishing shoes that were sold."
good,"never scheduled any hours which made the job really more trouble than it was worth. Boring and repetitive, but good for a first job. DO NOT RECOMMEND IF YOU NEED CASH, but excellent place to learn retail and gain experience. Management and coworkers were fun and friendly."
good,"Some thing, there is not to say about sales, you just sale shoes, you meet somebody now every day and the people you work with where not to bad and it was an okay place to work."
good,Working at DSW was extremely enjoyable. I created great memories and connections with coworkers and managers. Enjoyed connecting with guests and providing service.
good,DSW is a great place to work because the employees enjoy helping customers find their style of shoes. DSW offers a variety of shoe brands and styles that allows customers with different preferences to find that perfect fit. Over the two years I worked their I found that the customers are most satisfied with us when you take the time to listen to what they want and help them find it if they can't. It is also important to take that extra step into finding a shoe if its not in the store already. While I liked this job I found it difficult to follow through with the company's rewards program expectations. Some customers choose not to give out personal information or do not wish to sign up for the program but the company pushes the associates to get people to sign up. I feel as though the company is focused more on the rewards then the customers themselves.
good,A productive and fun working environment with decent employee benefits. Helpful and bright employees always working as a team in order to achieve company goals.
good,"All of the staff got along, we became a family. "
good,Perfect place to work for a budding fashionista. Typical day includes styling customers and becoming familiar with new trends and exciting products. It is a fast paced environment but extremely rewarding.
good,"I learned a lot about the retail business, management was very helpful and willing to train you in any area that you showed interest.  The hardest part of the job at that time was the hours, I had 4 little children at home."
good,"During a typical day at work, the sales associates and I work as a team to get our job done. Greeting customers, satisfying our client, introducing new items, and making sure the sections are organized for the shoppers. For starters, DSW has given me a lot of experience on customer service. It has given the opportunity to be more understanding with others and has made me want to continue to work with others. Working in an environment that involved so much diversity was so interesting. I got the chance to talk to people from places I would have never imagined I would meet and customers would randomly talk to me or some of the sales associates I shared the floor with and ask where I was from and speak about there culture. The hardest part of the job would be not being able to help customers with what they were actually looking for  and not being able to sometimes satisfy them, but the most enjoyable part would definitely be working hands on with others."
good,"All employees are very open and friendly; management is well rounded and works well together. Discount used to be better, but still pretty good. Dress code is pretty leniant but I wish they promited more unique/quirky styles. All in all, definetly a place I would reccommend working."
good,"I enjoyed my time at the shoe company. My co-workers were a lot of fun and great people to work with. Typically as a sales associate, I would do costumer service, clean the store, preform transactions, and assist my supervisors with closing duties."
good,I enjoyed my years with DSW. I learned a lot about merchandising and customer service. The new technologies that were being implemented were a great asset  to the quality of customer service that we provided.
good,"It was great if you were a cashier, but if you were on the floor the process was a little longer. Time flies fast the only thing i did not like was that i did not get paid for clocking in early or late if need to but your able to make your own schedule."
good,"right in the heart of state street, to work at dsw has its perks. great customers, coworkers as well as managers. Just hated the cleaning up part, but will def work there again."
good,"open and close store, manage daily activities of sales, customer service. store deposits, shipments, scheduling of staff, and merchandise of product in the store."
good,"We take in the truck and process the goods, handle customer online orders, package and ship them to their house, process pick up in store orders. Help customers find what they are looking for and make their shopping experience a great."
good,I loved working here I got too see all the latest shoes that came out .got to meet a lot of nice friendly customers . And got to visit other stores and help open
good,"This has been one of my favorite jobs so far and I've had quite a few. The environment is super chill and they only schedule you for what you put in the system as your availability. You get a good amount of hours per week (get paid biweekly). My co-workers are great, everyone gets along with one another. The hardest part of the job is putting back shoes people leave all over the store. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers and how easy the job is; also the 30% discount."
good,"Nice place to work, nice management and good coworkers. Gives great chance to interact with people and get good customer service."
good,"Pros: "
good,"While staff is well trained, and overall DSW provides a positive work experience, much of the ambience is very dependant on the management style of each of the store managers and assistant managers. "
good,"during this time, management was fairly young and full of drama. There was a high turnover with management. They also were not too great with people calling in sick. They also had a strange reward system for employees and it was not really enforced. Compensation was just okay at that time. I think it has gotten better."
good,"I absolutely loved this place! My managers were awesome, except for one and my coworkers were amazing! I would definitely recommend this as a starter job for someone looking for a a good job to start them off."
good,The job is enjoyable if you are working with the right people. The only hardest part of the job is when it is extremely busy and the checkout lines get really long and we are understaffed.
good,very rigorous with the work hours. they usually only hire people so they can close out the store  (night shifts). rarely get morning shifts because many people don't shop until late in the day
good,I loved working at DSW. The environment was great and the people I worked with were also great. I left only because I wanted something outside of retail.
good,"Helped customers find sizes, assisted them in finding the right shoes for certain activities. Processed transactions including sales, returns, exchanges, and web orders smoothly and efficiently. Managers are trained very well for the most part, and the co-workers were fantastic to be around. Hardest part of the job was maintaining the store on busy days, as it's very large and there's lots of different product. Best part about the job was the incentives that you got from the company for going above and beyond."
good,"DSW is a wonderful place to work at, it has a great work environment, positive energy though out the store. My skills have improved a lot at DSW so far with communication and multi tasking! I think my most enjoyable part of my job is making people feel great though the power of shoes."

He was constantly trying to build our skills and supervisors and improve team members."
good,"Working at DSW includes helping customers find shoes, ordering shoes and working with your fellow associates to help customers. The management is great, and they help you do a great job. The most enjoyable part is seeing customers walk out with a pair of shoes that you helped them pick out."
good,"I have worked at both the Addison DSW and the Preston Center DSW. I loved the Addison location because the management team and employees alike were all treated as family. Everyone worked together as a team to reach a goal. I learned a lot from working in a fast-paced retail environment. "

good,"This was my first job and I feel like I have gained an understanding of how it is like to work and be in the customer service business. I have learned a lot about how to handle different types of customers, and how to please them. I have gained lots of experience working here."

good,I love the fact that this company knows many great thing's about team work. Humility being productive and the flexibility they give
good,"The Shoe Company has a great work environment and an excelling place to obtain experience working with other customers. It allows you to humble yourself and understand their troubles as well as helps you develop problem solving skills, separate from those often found out of the work place. The managers are approachable and understanding, allowing for a sense of ease. The hardest part of the job  would have to be letting down a customer. The easiest part is when you have the answers ready and can assist the customer."
good,"Once I punched in for this job, I had to go to the stock room and recieve a huddle from a supervisor. After the huddle which was about ten mintues, I would look on the wall to see what my assignment was for my shift. I mostly had to make sure the stock room was organized, neat, and clean at all times. While I was on the sales floor, I had to interact with the customers and fix any displays that was out of order."
good,"My job is fun, and very easy to understand. I make receive emails and phones on a dailty base for our customers. I answer any general questions, assist with placing orders and correcting orders.  I sometimes am on Click-To-Chat, which is a ive person cht. When on click to chat, Ido the same as speaking with a custoemr via email or on the phone. I also make outbound calls,a dn emails for updates and follow ups with our customers. I also assist our DSW sores nationwide with assisting their in store customers or with store assistance. My co-workers are very fund, caring and nice to spend 8 hours with everyday. Sometimes our custemrs can be very pushy, mean and overbearing. But I always manage not to let it affect my day. I still assist the customer to mey best ability and if I can not, I am able to partner with my supervisor for questions to be answered."
good,I work at two different locations in Columbus/Ohio where the company HQ is located. I really respect company's structural training  and contemporary presence.
good,"It is hard work but a enjoyable atmosphere, co workers are helpful and knowledgable. The training program is very indepth."
good,"I would come into work clock in. I would either be a cashier for the day or sales associate or both. I would assists customers, receive payments, clean work area after my shift was done. since that was my first job I learned how to be more patient with people and wait on them. being that when u get your very first job you get nervous and mess up a lot but you always have to get back up and do better and learn from your mistakes. management and co-workers were friendly very nice very considerate. the hardest part was my first day I didn't no what to expect but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. the enjoyable part about this job was the celebrations we had amongst our team members and everyone else depending on sales we made that month but overall the people are always what makes each and every job a moment to remember"
good,"muito bom ,agradeço a DSW pelo o profissional que sou ,"
good,"Associates are kept well informed of the business"
good,I love waking up to work here. It is a very fun environment and we have wonderful customers. We are a very new store so things aren't perfect but we are working together to make a better work place.

good,A typical day at Town Shoes is to serve customers but also to make sure that the store is clean and tidy. During the Christmas season is when it is very busy and sometimes chaotic.
good,"My coworkers are amazing. They are extremely helpful and willing to assist with anything. The only complaint at this specific location is the hours. I was guaranteed a minimum of 20 hours at time of hire. At the current time I am only receiving 8-10 hours per week. I love this job but, i am unable to support myself or others on this salary."
good,Would stock and get orders ready to be sent out to the stores. I enjoyed working with everyone.
good,"DSW has got to be the best company I've ever worked for thus far. It's very fast-paced, pressuring and difficult at times but It's your job. I've gained interpersonal skills because of the amount of pressure they put on the employees to engage with ALL customers in your section. Management is awesome. They work with your schedule and are very understanding. Co-workers were helpful and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to find all empty boxes or boxes with one shoe in it and having to look everywhere to find it's match and the most enjoyable part of the job is having fun while working even with the managers and selling customers the good quality of shoes that were available."
good,Assist customer in finding products that are most suitable for them. Provide information about exclusive offers and how they can be accessed. Handle cash and search inventory for desired items. Management was flexible and understanding. My co-workers were friendly and willing to work as a team. The hardest part of the job was leaving.

good,"The working environment was great, associates and management were very in sync when it came to providing customer service."

good,I was a seasonal worker. Who was dealing with personal situations at the time so I really wasn't career motivated at the time but I would give them a second chance if they would extend the same curtousy to me.
good,I worked as a sales associate for just under a year before I was promoted to Sales Supervisor. The policies put in place by corporate are great and we were never pressured to sell credit cards or anything like some other retailers.
good,"The people at the Roseville location rarely have drama, the managers are approachable, and there is always something to do. Sometimes the customers can be a little ridiculous, but that comes with every retail job."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers find the right shoe, also to organize boxes in your area and to clean up as you go. I've learned that as a worker you need to have respect for the customer and that they're always right and to not argue with them. The hardest part of the job is to work in the clearance section because you need to find the right shoes in the right area and to clean and organize every shoe properly and to look if they are the same size and same shoe. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to help the customer."
good,"Great job for people who love being physical. Unloading/loading trucks, picking and"
good,Working at townshoes is fun. Being able to build relationships with customers is a rewarding part of the job.  I have learned what it takes to work in retail and how to balance my job with school.
good,DSW offers a work environment that is unique in the retail industry.  The leaders that succeed live the company values.  They look at what each individual person has to offer and encourage the staff to leverage their interests and personalities to create a inviting environment for the customers.
good,I loved my team with everything that's in me but the management was not very organized and had their issues. Our store went through some great improvements but unfortunately we had issues finding a team that matched.
good,Workplace culture was really good. Its retail and you have to expect it to get stressful but for retail it was nice. My managers were really cool and I never really had to take work home with me.
good,that’s good i was the time of the year that we went through a great time of the year with a good job and a good time to be in a charge of that time and then we will always look back up on the stage where we are
good,"Working at DSW was a great experience because of the environment the managers created. On a typical day, I could be seen talking to customers about shoe styles, fits, and current fashions. It was challenging, as all retail jobs are, when it came to certain customer's needs. I truly enjoyed getting to know my co-workers and learning about the shoe fashion world."
good,"Work balanced lifestyle"
good,"As a part-time sales associate at DSW, I was able to balance my work with my life outside of work, enabling me to efficiently focus on my undergraduate degree. I also gained knowledge working with a cash register, customers, and fellow coworkers. Working in retail helped me realize that I do not belong in this industry."
good,"Learned a lot about product placement. Built skills with how to up sell to customers, and learned how to communicate with customers to fit their needs and wants out of their experience at our location. Managers were always willing to help and teach everything they knew to help associates develop."
good,great to work with others. willing to help you learn and get used to the environment  and help with training. also great speed keeps you moving during the day
good,"Some days I could be running around, stocking shoes and organizing them on display if there are  no customers to cash out. I have learned how to engage with customers at this workplace and I work with different cultures of people which I like. The only hard thing about work is when we have to tear down after the sale is done, making sure the warehouse is spotless and absolutely nothing is left behind. The most enjoyable part of this job though is engaging with customers about the shoes."
good,DSW is very fast paced and fast going. I obtained many fundamental skills and experiences while working with the company and very glad that I had the opportunity to work with the company. The staff here is amazing and like family
good,A day at work at DSW is fast paced but also a lot of fun.  We truly live by our mission and our values.  Management is wonderfully understanding and compassionate towards the employees.  I love my job at DSW because of everything the company stands for and everyone that I work with.

good,Dsw was awesome company to work for and the store i worked for was great! there was only a few minor things behind the scenes i wish would of changed while i worked for them but other wise it was fun!
good,"It's place where you can begin on gaining experience if it's your first job or if you been away from the workplace. It's a vary fast pace (high volume) location in which you will learn new experience in each department. You can relay on your co-workers to help you in situations you may not be familiar with and learn from it. The management are flexible in personal or work situations with scheduling, showing the proper way to get things done in the work place. At times it can get a little messy on the floor due to a high volume store in which we are always busy with the customers."
good,A day will start off with orders that need to be packaged and sent out. Once trained you will be either at register or on the floor helping costumers.
good,This was an sales associate position that I had at the time part time 2nd job! After awhile two jobs just was way to much on me! But I am looking for one full time job!
good,"I Show up a few minutes early to be fully prepared to clock in and start the day. We then have a quick meeting where the manager assigns us which sections of the store to provide customer service or some other job that needs to be handled. I liked the job because during slow hours you are able to catch up or help complete other tasks, but when it's busy it can be a lot of walking around getting things, or tracking items, coming back to customers with verified information, and just all sorts of retail assistance.  I didn't ever find it stressful because I like to be busy and like to help people. All the coworkers were friendly and helpful and the managers were understanding. It was just a good experience learning how to deal with customers and learning about shoes and how a retail store operates. It was a lot of one on one interactions with customers so I feel very confident talking to anyone in the workplace after working here."
good,Innovative footwear retailer.  Company values are at the core of everything we do and that makes experience very special.  Field leadership is empowered to serve both the internal and external customer.  Could not ask to work of a better organization.
good,"It was fun, everyday was a new adventure. The store manager kept us updated on changes in the store and corporate. My co-workers were awesome and everyone worked as a team."
good,"overall a good environment, people friendly and you meet customers that you build a connection with witch makes it all worth it."
good,I loved the environment and the associates.  Upper management seems to be invested in your development and creating a fun place to shop.
good,"Always busy, constant engagement with customers to help them with selections  was the most rewarding part of the job. Great team, always working together to get the job done."
good,I worked at the Cumberland Location. I really enjoyed my time their. the managers are pretty cool. Work environment is fun and exciting. Just do your job and it will be fine
good,"Working DSW, is fun and upbeat. the managers are always eager to help and to make sure you are doing your job well and on a timely manner. You also work around shoes so that makes it even more fun and exciting to see what new shipment is coming into the store."
good,"DSW is overall a great place to work at. They are very flexible with your schedule and they are there if you have a personal problem. They allow you to show your full potential while being professional all at the same time. The Crossgates Mall in Albany, NY DSW employees and managers are like a family to me."
good,"A typical day included processing shipments and transfers while maintaining a clean and interesting display for customers. I also cashed customers with the utmost delightful customer service! I've learned skills including money, conversation, customers, file/paper work, and organization. The team I worked with was overall very efficient and professional. The hardest part of the job was learning and remembering so many new tasks given to me, which was also the best part because I got to challenge myself."
good,A typical day at work  is busy  what ive  learning working there is how to deal with different personality types  and different cultures people who shop there come from all parts of the world and being able to service each persons needs was a learning process. i also learn how to multitask and adapt to change  in retail you expect to  do many job requritesment depending  on the day or the lack of coverage on the sales floor
good,"Most of the average work day here will be spent either on register or walking the floor and interacting with customers. Projects are handed out frequently, as this store is not subject to the near-overwhelming rush of many other retail environments. Associates are cross-trained in many different areas of the store, allowing for any associate to feel comfortable working in any department. The co-workers are friendly and helpful, willing to answer questions or offer additional training to anyone still uncomfortable with a particular aspect. Management is quick to offer assistance and answer calls, as well as ensure that each associate knows what task they should be focusing on. The hardest part of this job would be the need to cover the store from corner to corner while assisting customers or running shoe checks. The most enjoyable part of the job would easily be the fellow associates."
good,"I dealt with customers with take orders for any occasions. I would prepare, deliver, and set up for them. I had wonderful managers and staff to work with. I learned that origination was key to success in this position. It was very high pace and keep me moving. I would take care of my orders and also work on the line preparing orders for the lunch rush in the afternoons. If it was not for all of us working as a team it would not have worked as well as it did."
good,The company has great morals and they're main goal is to please their customers. The days are ever changing as some are very busy and some are slow. I found the hardest part of the day was when we didn't have something in stock that the customer was looking for.
good,we have a nonstop enviroment and lace to work. we can start as opening manager receiving and placing the new merchandise as company direction. My role is to maintain the store standards and develop others to grow by coaching them at the end of their shifts. Driving business and know my product to maximize my sales.
good,"The hardest part of the job is product knowledge. But coworkers and management are fabulous. If you know what you are talking about, you enjoy work."
good,Great place to work.  Time usually time flies by and you get to meet a lot of people.  It is an amazing well run company.
good,Overall...I enjoyed working for DSW!! The co-workers were all ready to help the customers and management was on top of their game when it came time to sell the merchandise.
good,"All I can say is if you love fashion bust mostly shoes, this is the place to be. I worked with some of the greatest people. Its very fast paced but also very fun."
good,This company allows you to add you personality into your customer service.
good,"A typical day would start with a group huddle summarizing the previous day and what needs to be done to accomplish the previous day's goals. We would be stationed in certain areas and be responsible for helping the customers and keeping the floor and  displays presentable. I learned that in order to present the best customer service, one must have collaboration, accountability, passion and humility. At DSW, we all work as a team to make sure the customer gets the perfect shoe, size, or even just to get through the line quickly. Management is great with their knowledge and judgement of the floor and administrative things. They always have an answer for any question. My coworkers as well are very helpful. If there's any need for backup, they are always get out of their way to help. The hardest part about the job so far is helping customers find their perfect shoe because I'm always learning new things about the brands and styles but sometimes I just can't find the right pair. The most enjoyable part is when I am able to help the customer whether it be by finding a shoe or seeing if another store has their size or placing an order."
good,everyone I polite. it Is a good work to work at while you are a student going to school
good,"extreamly fun place to work, co workers are very friendly, management is very good always ready to listen and understand staff needs. Compensation is not that great. There is a lot of room for growth."
good,"Working at DSW was a great experience! My co-workers were fun and management was very compassionate. Working with shoes and fashion was fun, but working in retail at times you do not get as many hours as you would like."
good,"The average warehouse time management is key "
good,"I really loved working here, the environment was great, and i was surrounded by shoes! I loved working with people to find their wedding shoes, prom shoes, or just meeting their needs to find what they were looking for. I love customer service and this company is customer focused! Great prices, great product, and great employee discounts!"
good,Great place to work with amazing staff. Management is awesome as well as cooworkers. 
good,"Most everyone is nice, the President is very nice and laid back."
good,"Great company to work far with continuous growth. Customers are from all walks of life, from movie stars to stay at home moms!"
good,"Flexible hours, exciting deals and people. Great management."
good,"I mostly open I managed our Door to the Floor shipment flow, and supervised our merchandising team. Traffic usually picked up at 11:30 am I gathered the sales team for our sales and goal huddle for the day."
good,The Shoe Company provides excellent training programs to ensure their Associates are successful.
good,"I have been working at DSW in Coconut Point for a while now and it is a great job, 30% discount, you can use rewards as well. You learn how to work the cashwrap to sending shoes off from online orders. The managers and coworkers are nice and help you. Overall it was a nice place to work. "
good,"DSW is a very fun place to work at. It starts off kinda awkward when you start cause you don;t know the employees that well, but they will come and warm up to you; which gives off a very fun vibe and good atmosphere."
good,"Don't get me wrong I still love DSW and not because of the shoes its because of the environment/atmosphere that was created here. I did become upset with DSW causing me to leave before my resignation notice was supposed to be put into effect. I will still start with the things that I enjoyed/Love about DSW. I enjoyed the free refreshments; water, hot coca and coffee are placed in the lunch room with vending machines for convenience. I worked 40 hours a week and sat in a chair for those hours, I learned fast and took myself out of nesting before I was supposed to because I wanted to do what I was actually going to be doing the remaining time I was there. I loved that too and had no complaints. I enjoyed small interactions with my coworkers but stayed focused. I loved the employee sale in November items were 5$! (Pairs for shoes, purses ect). I was not the biggest fan of the newest update to the scoring system. This scoring system became more extensive and difficult to follow up with. I was concerned because I was meeting my expectations and exceeding the company's expectations for a call center representative. When it was changed and more requirements where added I felt as if I wasn't doing as well as I actually was. I am sure that the people who weren't doing so well felt discouraged. I didn't like that wen Id as a question to multiple people I would get different answers so how am I supposed to do my job properly and to company standards. I was going through a rough time in my life where my mother was becoming sick, father was leaving my life and we were getting evicted, I"
good,"My favorite job loved everything about it but the lack of communication on both ends due to confusion on position, job description and rate of pay after nearly 3yrs it was time to leave I saw myself advancing but more on the business or fashion marketing side not in store and not while training new hires and not getting paid for such work!"
good,I was very lucky to work in a store where the management reinforced the idea that we were a family. My coworkers & managers were awesome. Pay starts a little above minimage wage so as an 18 year old I thought I scored the jackpot as a first job.
good,"you had to provide customers with their needs and also help them with recommendations for fit, size,colour, etc. You also got the opportunity to work on cash."
good,"It a nice place to work in, the is a lot of collaboration, the management is splendid. I just need to need a permanent company where I can actually grow in. My hardest time in this company is when oracle support have to delay our project for additional 2 weeks because of bug that was notice when implementing Data Guard  I will encourage people to work in 100%."
good,Town Shoes limited was an amazing employer. Working with them taught me valuable people and life skills. I got to meet a variety of customers and really work on my problem solving skills.
good,"Fun workplace,Management are not strict. The hardest part of my job  is working 2nd shift. I get to pick up my son from the sitter late. BUt overall i would recommend this company to my friends."
good,"Overall a good place to work. Management is accommodating and kind. They have a decent culture and reward their staff for doing a good job. Plus, everyone needs shoes, so you get rewarded with something you would have had to buy to begin with."
good,ya pretty good place to worl all the people ate very nice very peaceful enviroment would def reccomend to anyone looking for a job in tje shoe indiustry
good,"This job was super easy. A typical day for me was making sure all the shoes were at an angle and all the boxes were straight. Talking to customers was fun, giving them how great them looked in a particular shoe or suggesting another shoe. Only thing about this job is that if you are a closer, that's an extra hour and a half added to your shift."
good,Overall this is a very good company to work for. They have very competitive benefits and pay. Very good culture don't ever have to worry about unprofessional behavior and you know you are valued.
good,Great place to work. Friendly environment. Helping hands whenever you need them. Friendly competition for reward. Acknowledging employees hard work through praise and recognition
good,been there for almost 4 years and its okay. its a cool place to work if you need a part time. Hours are up and down. employees are friendly depends on the location. Not hard to move up in positions.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, but also many problems associated. Sometimes breaks are not given because they are ""not required"". The management team is not very good with training and also do not have good communication between them. Co-workers are great and the job itself is also great. I learned many customer service skills and also basic retail skills. Typical day at work includes either working on the register or with customers on the floor. Answering phone calls and looking for certain shoes is also included. Best part of the job is the great employee discount."
good,"A typical day at work is is customer servicing, Making sure that the customer is always happy. My overall experience at this job had been a pleasure.My coworkers have been very humble and open with each other. At my work place it was like a second home"
good,"Working at DSW was a good experience, it was a fun environment and your working with good people.Getting the hours and advancement was something that i did not like but everything else was ok"
good,"DSW was a great company to work for. I loved this job. Our team at the store was fantastic. We had great retention. We took our store from a 3.4 million dollar to a 4 million store in just 4 years."
good,I was a cashier at DSW for roughly five years. During that time I got the chance to meet different people from different backgrounds. I learned a lot about proper customer service  and how to deal with difficult situations. Management was very responsible. Everyone was kind and genuine which made it a fun environment to work.
good,"I am a ""shoeaholic"" so working here was a blast. It was kind of slow but again, it was a blast. The CEO was very nice. It was all mainly retail and helping customers find their size. Also, lots of cleaning."
good,"Job is multidimensional, you have to be able to do many things in an instant. You must have open availability which is from 5am to 11am which is rather strenuous. The hardest part of the job is the customers because DSW is very customer oriented, and dissatisfied customer can lead to being reprimanded."
good,A typical day at DSW was fun. The best part was interacting with the customers at the register. Seeing how happy they were with their findings was a good thing to me.
good,Me gusta el equipo de trabajo.Tenemos todos un sentido de colaboracion siguiendo los valores de la compania.Reconocimientos por tareas realizadas.el equipo gerencial es bien profesional.Cuando alguien tiene duda nos ayudamos entre si para poder hacer un buen trabajo para poder dar un buen servicio al cliente.
good,I loved shoes so what better place to work where I was surrounded by shoes and bags.
good,"This company truly believes in the values of Collabration, Humility, Passion and Accountibility.  They hire and train some of the best people I have ever worked with. The hardest part of the Job I would say is the non customer.  The best part of the job is the customers and the great team experience"
good,I drove order pickers and also trained other drivers being there for 5 years a lot of people alway ask me for advice we also did cookouts there games during holidays holiday meals gift cards ect:
good,"My job was more of a leadership role and inventory specialist role, within the first year I was promoted to the inventory specialist role. I handled the stock and backroom areas and worked with the guests in the store that needed the most help with what they were looking for. I was the person on a team of roughly 3 who would work early mornings, and late nights to actually do inventory.This is a great place for students who are looking for their first job, and need to learn the basics of work ethics, if they do not want to go into the food industry which was my first job. The management team is very accommodation and when I was a part of it, we all worked to make DSW a fun and exciting place to work. Sometimes the head office will make a sudden change that makes little sense, but its never a hard change to make in the stores. Overall I had a great time working here, and everyone was fun, I have made many friends at this place."
good,A typical day working here definitely keeps you on your toes there is always something to do. The company offers exciting ways like contests to drive results.
good,"Ensure customer satisfaction and operational excellence within the store through associate engagement and implementation of financial plans to maintain and reach sales on a weekly basis. Manage the recruitment, hiring, on boarding and training of associates. Lead associates in merchandising placement, shipment processing and store recovery. Ensures all inventory and pricing directives are implemented. Opens and closes store.   Use monthly operations assessment to identify and correct operational deficiencies in the store"
good,"I loved working at DSW! Fun to have so many shoes around. Very laid back work environment.... until you get put on the register. They really PUSH reward sign ups and if you make the store percentage go down, you are made to feel less valuable in my opinion. I wish they put only the strong talkers on the register. Some people are better on the floor! Other than rewards, this is an amazing place to work. The pay ALMOST made it worth me staying, but the rewards program was just too much!"
good,Great company to work for. appreciates employees and offers great training. Really good management team. Very fast paced environment . constantly evolving.
good,If you love shoes and giving cheerful customer service this is a great place to work. Very upbeat and all around a great environment. A lot of switches between management but I think that is expected when working in the retail industry.
good,"Upper management is great, great co-workers. Typical retail job."
good,"Co-workers more like family striving to meet same goals. Learned more about balancing tasks versus service, when and where to make the changes."
good,A typical day at work would be walking around the store making sure everything is neat and in order. Also I would walk around and make sure the customers are doing ggod and if they need any help.
good,"A typical day at work included greeting everyone who came into my section of the store, helping them find what they needed, and most importantly going above and beyone for every individual customer. I loved learning how to relate to all kinds of people at all different ages. I learned how to persuade people very well, and how to know when a customer wanted help or if they just wanted to be left alone. My co-workers were very hardworking and kind. The management was very understanding and easy going and fun! The hardest part of the job was that feeling of bugging people who just don't want help. But after a while, I knew who wanted help and who didn't. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping and learning about people."
good,*Made sure customers had a pleasant shopping experience
good,"This was an excellent place to work and really let you be an owner of your own store. The upper management was fantastic and supportive. Because it was a smaller company, room for growth wasn't really present within the city if Ottawa."
good,I have enjoyed my time with DSW. There is always a new challenge. Dealing with people can be challenging but 90% of the time the managers will back you up until the customer becomes irate and then they have to give them what they want. I met a lot of cool people and enjoyed going to work most days
good,"Typical retail job. Medium to fast paced job, always on your feet, when you get your breaks you enjoy them. The job is a very team oriented place and we rely on each other for a lot."
good,"The people are friendly, management is good. The environment is so warm and welcoming, I was sad to leave!"
good,a day at work would start with greetings with customers and a smile on my face. will be running to cashier position and to sales floor to assist customers with their needs.
good,I got to meet lots of people meaning I got the chance to offer my knowledge on shoe history it was a fun seasonal job while it lasted I would have no problem returning to the company
good,"it was easy work days, in a fairly big plaza. the most enjoyable part was the waterfall when the store was empty. management was great, most managers were there if any problems did occur. it was a great first job to have."
good,Was a great place to9 work and build and establish each and every customer
good,"Great place to work because you meet good people, management was great and the wonderful discount is amazing.  A typical day was, most of the time very busy and then a lot of down time.  I enjoyed assisting the customers in their selections of shoes and accessories.  The hardest part of the job was the downtime and the few breaks you are allowed to take. What I learned from working there is the inside information I gained from running a department store."
good,The Shoe Company wasn't a very fun place to work but there were a lot of different tasks to do that kept me busy. My manager was not much help to me and expected me to just learn things on my own without showing or explaining to me how to do them first.
good,"time off is not to good during the holidays. management team could do a better job at helping others who really dont  speak the language advance, specially  when they no more and do a better job"
good,"Well dsw is more like if its your first job, getting out of high school or while still in high school, sometimes it can be stressful, but if you put the right work you can advance"
good,"Management can be tricky and hard to work around your schedule but very flexible hours. Very busy store, especially during sandals, boots, and good weather."
good,Working at DSW was stressful. The skills you learn there will prepare you for anything you may come across in life of in a work environment period.
good,It was ok. You don’t get to advance very much in the company and they make you close at least 2 nights a week. It is an ok company to work for if you don’t want to advance
good,This was a really good job. It would be even better if they hired more full time associates and paid better. I enjoyed the store setup as well as the many many shoes. Customers were mostly nice and easy to get along with.
good,"Unload Truck, Stock"
good,"The motto was ""Helping people feel great throught the power of shoes!"" Every customer had to be greeted and helped to ensure they were finding excatly what they were looking for. Tasks consisted of customer service, cashier duties, inventory, and cleaning store."
good,"Was very fun at first, but management got switched around and now it seems like nothing is in order and organized. Sometimes under scheduled and not easy to retrieve necessary items to clean store at end of day. Very weird policies."
good,DSW is a great company that has many things going for it. They need to continue to work at developing and retaining talent within their stores or many others will be leaving to pursue careers at other locations that care about their employees advancements. Overall they care about you and their customers.
good,"Working at DSW is good, currently working part time however i wish there were full time position offered for the sales associates rather than only for management"
good,It was a really cool experience working at DSW. Everyone was really nice and welcoming. It was a lot of work dealing with shoes and different departments but I liked it a lot. the pay wasn't so good but overall it was good.
good,I loved working at DSW as it was my first job in the retail/sales industry. I learned a good majority of my interpersonal skills from interacting with customers daily and associates. Managers were super friendly and I enjoyed the fast paced environment because the day went by fast.
good,This job gave me the motivation and skills to continue to progress in any workforce. Performing high-class customer services in a fast paced environment really shows you who's capable of supreme work.
good,"I love working at DSW, the store I am at is filled with fun and friendly co workers that make my day go by faster. My favorite work aspect is that we are not pushed for credit card sign ups like many retail stores."

good,i love working here  wish i could full time  its an amazing place to work and the people are awesome  and they work with me on my schedule and i enjoy working there
good,"Like any retail store, their goal is sales. Sales sales sales. Get everyone to sign up for rewards. Although daunting, their rewards program is the best I've seen. Put customers first and they will follow your checklist of what you need to accomplish as an employee there."
good,"I loved working for DSW, it was a great place for me and I'm sad I had to leave. The managers there were fantastic and the people I worked with were kind. Working retail has its problems but overall, it was a great experience, I'd love to go back."
good,"Learned a great deal about retail and behind the scenes work while working with friendly staff. Flexible with scheduling, and made it easy to work in a fast paced enviornment"
good,"This is a great starter job - I started working here as soon as I graduated. A typical work day involved checking the sales floor inventory, managing the sales floor, and completing sales transactions. I learned how to check inventory and manage a cash register. Management here was so great and helpful. Co workers and management were super bubbly and positive. The hardest part of the job was shifting and redoing the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job would honestly have been enjoying the work environment with my co workers and interacting with all types of customers."
good,i enjoy working here however i am looking for a full time job and dsw can't offer me a full-tim position because they are currently all filled but working here is a pleasure.
good,I loved working there. They really care about their employees. You get rewarded for your hard work. The discount is an added bonus. A great place to work.
good,I enjoyed my time with this company. They are one of the first retail companies i enjoyed working for. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. The job title always kept me on my toes as things were always changing
good,"If you love shoes, this is the perfect place to work in. New shoes are always arriving, especially when the seasons are about to change. You will be able to learn how to multi-task, and just new things to learn overall."
good,I loved working with my team but upper management likes to micro manage. I worked in a store that was put together better than most stores and we hardly ever received positive feedback from upper management.
good,"Great place to work for with awesome discounts for employees."
good,My first job. A very nice and clean store. Very customer friendly. Pushes credit cards and rewards alot. Great employee discount and management is very pleasant
good,"From the moment I started, everyone was friendly and welcoming. I love what the company does and the work they do for the public. My experience with DSW has been amazing and educational. I'd definitely recommend this company to a good friend in need of work."
good,"Being able to help customers find exactly what they are looking for and keeping everyone, including employees, smiling with a warm environment. Learned everything there is to know about inventory, packing and shipping. Management had the most helpful and warm-hearted people in charge and they were always around on the floor to help along with employees. Co-workers were awesome! They all had a positive vibe coming in and leaving. The hardest part of the job is getting people to say yes to the rewards program. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet people from all over and building relationships with co-workers."
good,"I enjoy working at DSW very much, the customers are great, my co-workers are awesome and the hours are somewhat flexible. There are certain things I like doing at my job more than others, but that is every job! You learn to prep, stock and customer service along with other small tasks. The hours are probably the hardest part of working here because if you are not available anytime there is a good chance your hours will not be as well as other coworkers."
good,"helping customers shop for fashionable trends. Fun environment to work in, coworkers are always cheerful. Great discounts on shoes and accessories. Management is helpful."
good,i enjoyed it. i helped customers and loved the shoes. i was a cashier and an associate on the floor ! we had tons of great people working there and i enjoyed the atmosphere

good,it was a great first job. staff very friendly. i would go back if i could to work there if there was one near my school. scheduling is very nice. flexible with availability
good,"DSW has taught me a lot more than I expected to learn working in retail. I've learned how to handle many different situations and tasks. The managers take their time to show us what needs to be done, how it needs to be done, and how much time we get to complete the task. My coworkers are extremely helpful and supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy."

good,A typical day at DSW is full of energy. All over the sales floor helping costumers Meet their needs and desires. At the same time putting out more merchandise for their to be more selection for our costumers. I have learned to observe the costumer because approaching so quickly. The hardest part about the job has been the closing shifts sometimes other team mates don't play to well and wouldn't clean up and leave everything to the closing team. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to find the costumer what they was looking for or something better. Seeing a smile on a costumers face is amazing some of them will even come in and show pictures of their outfits and even call the store to give us compliments.
good,I loved working at DSW. The managers were great and patient. I would only complain about the lack of hours. Some weeks i'd only get 12 hours.

good,"-Friendly coworkers"
good,"I loved working for this company. I had a great team of co workers at both locations. I learned more about freight and shipment with this company and boosted my confidence while employed with them. Although I was just an associate, I was given tasks to help train new members and that was a great feeling for me. The hardest part of this job for me was when I worked at the El Paso location and was not able to help the many customers who did not speak English. If we were busy, and I was running the register, I would have to call for assistance to help translate."
good,Learned the registers and stocking and loading the sales floor

good,"A typical work day would include helping customers find what they need, whether it be in store on line. We tell our customers about new offers and promotions that we have going on, and also get them enrolled in our rewards program. Over years I have learned important details to keep the store running smoothly, such as keeping things in order/neat, so things will be shopper friendly. The workers are very friendly and willing to help in any way possible. The hardest part of the job would be finding the perfect pair of shoes for someone with multiple foot problems. The best part of my job is finding something that the customer is happy with."

good,"I enjoyed working at DSW. There, I learned a lot about my character. I learned how to blossom out of my shell and take initiative in certain situations. My managers trained me very well and I could definitely tell that they cared a lot about me. The only reason I left was because of the pay. I needed more stability and something more than part time."
good,I loved working for dsw! I looked forward on helping my customers. Management was good and very helpful.and made friends working there.goof job to work for.

good,"Very pleasant work place"
good,great place to work for if currently still in school or just a side job. values are very important. most enjoyable part is working with the new friends. everyday is a fun field day at DSW!
good,I was really happy when I heard I got the job! I am a shoeaholic and I was getting to work one on one with customers. I loved working with the customers and selling them a shoe they would love until they could no longer wear them. However I was disappointed when I was laid off after working for only a month. I did not even see it coming. I had two hours and BAM! my assistant manager told me it was my last day! I was so heartbroken.
good,It was a pretty easy job for the most part but they didn't give a lot of hours to their employees which made it hard for a lot of people get the money they wanted.
good,"I enjoyed my employment with DSW.  The dutiesand responsibilitoes that were expected of me were fair.  I do belive that due to the fact I was consistintly doing stock which was a very physically demanding task that a pay increse should have been implimented.  I would unload a delivery truck by mtself lifting anywhere from 5 punds to 60 pound boxes.  This task was not only ohysically demanding but I felt that the drerss code standards should have been modified.  It was a bit difficult lifting,moving,stocking,cleaning in business attire,accessories,and not being able to keep a water bottle with me.  I was in the back of the store out of the public eye so I dont think wearing more suitable attire would have offended anyone.  The majority of the employees worked very hard.  I was not obtaining enough hours at this store to keep me there.  I wanted to learn more about the business and focus on learning management skills."
good,"Days can be unpredictable for business, but there is always something to do. Associates are all friendly and great to work with. Only downside is the company recently took away a lot of worker perks, makes it hard to work there when we need to wear the shoes from there but can't afford it."
good,"i loved everything about working there, the managers, associates, shoes everything you see is what you get able to provide you with amazing customer service and matching my skills with the customers needs"

good,Shoe Warehouse is an outstanding workplace with lots of employee benefits and an idiot-proof hands on sales guide!

good,"I cannot make a single complaint about Designer Shoe Warehouse. The coworkers are great, management is great, even upper management shows that they truly do care. Only con is they took away the wonderful discount."

One day I would be the main cashier, the next day I might be putting new freight out or even tagging markdowns. I learned how to work well with others and put customer service before anything else. I worked well with my co workers as well as my managers."
good,DSW Inc is a fun place to work. The management is firm yet fun. I enjoy the openness that we all have as a team. I can truly be myself at work.

good,Your main focus with this job  is getting customers to sign up for the REWARDS program.
good,"This was part time work; therefore, I am unable to give an accurate account of compensation benefits or advancement opportunities.  "
good,"The pay is less than desirable and there are only four hour shifts for part-time workers, but if you love working with the public and really love shoes this is a good place to work!"
good,"Typical day at work was asking, listening and answering customers questions.The co-workers was friendly and helpful to work with. Mangement was very professional but also fun to work with. Most enjoyable part of the job was enteracting with the different kind of customers that comes in the store. "
good,"Working at DSW was so fun. My managers were friendly, kind and understanding. My coworkers were always fun. Seeing shoes all day, observing people and occasionally advising my customers was also very interesting. I worked on the floor and on the register so it was very nice to do double work. There was nothing hard about the job, i enjoyed my time working there a lot."
good,"Co-workers are great, easy job, fun, and good managers. The hardest part was always remembering to sale the customer rewards card and telling a customer no on a return and then the manager approves it."
good,Enjoyed this job. Management was friendly and showed much appreciation for staff.
good,"Overall, DSW is a fun, great place to work! But you need to be sure you are in the right department under the right management team. Some managers will work you like dogs, while others are much more friendly to an overall life balance."
good,I loved working for the shoe company it was always a pleasure going into work. The job was fresh and engaging. Don't really have anything bad to say about it
good,"An easy,chill.fun job. Great for a little part-time position on the side. Depending on your store, the staff and managers feel like family. Great discount."
good,DSW is a fun fashionable place to work. Great bonding with co-workers during closing. It was a new experience for me but the environment was very welcoming.
good,"Shoe Warehouse was my favourite job by far. The girls that I worked with instantly made me feel like I was at home, that I belonged to their team. It was a place where you could express yourself through your shoes and wardrobe. Shoe Warehouse will always hold a special place in my heart."
good,As a part time associate i was not given more then 1 or 2 shifts a week but the people there are great people and it is a very good place to work. I enjoy my jb
good,"Great place to work part-time when also in school. Not very stressful, just a bit repetitive and mind-numbing. Pay was decent, but the yearly increase in pay was only $.25 which was disappointing. Management weren't hitting goals and thus had turnover every 6 months or so. But it was a easy job, would work there again if I was paid a bit more."
good,Its a good Company to work for. A typical day at work involves reviews of store KPI's and Schedules. Store walks. Planning the day with input of stock into store and merchandising. The work Culture is amazing along with the associates and managers here.
good,DSW is a great place to work. They had a time where they had some unfortunate high level staffing decisions but learned their lessons and have really bounced back in a positive way.
good,"Working for DSW gave me a new since of self; I found great pleasure in helping people find the perfect shoes for themselves or family members. Never a dull moment when men, women and children need something for their feet."
good,"We venture out going to a selected dept. store to scan the stores inventory which consist of several employees to do so."
good,DSW is an amazing place to work as you are trying to figure out where you would like to go next in life. I recommend DSW to all ages. It is one of the best retail places to work.
good,Always had fun meetings. You get what you put in! Has many ways to advance! Sweet discounts! Always growing in every aspect! Always learning something new!
good,Been at DSW for a few months now. Its a great place to work. Mangers are easy to get along with. employees are friendly fairly its an easy job. they do work with college students around your class schedule.
good,I absolutely loved DSW the managers were so cool. Great discount on fabulous shoes. Work is easy! But constant standing! You will not miss a break ever because the managers remind you on time. Which is great!
good,"Learned about:"
good,"I learned to be more at ease with the costumers especially greeting them. I'm happy that i met new friends. I learn to be more organize, sociable and open-minded."
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers and ringing them through the till."
good,"well run company, seemed that the managers and so forth had a handle on the direction of the company and the stores. fun place to work, shoes are life"
good,"Enjoyable and exciting to come into work with guaranteed breaks and a steady hourly income, management was considerate of your well being and your hours and scheduling was always done in accordance to your availability"
good,"This was one of the best part time jobs I have had. My managers and coworkers were like family to me and I was very disappointed to have to leave the job. I greatly respected my managers and they are very good at what they do! It was not an overly difficult job and with time became an easy one. The hardest part was just dealing with rude customers. If you came in and did your job/what was expected, you gained the respect of your managers. And they often worked with you if you had a scheduling conflict."
good,DSW is an awesome place to work at if you need a part time job. however the hours are not that great. I love the environment and the amazing managers. having a great management team really makes a difference on how you perform on your job. I'm not just cashiering all day I am helping customers and doing tasks that can consume my whole shift which makes time go by faster. it's a great place to work if you're a college student or if you already have a day job and just need to make extra money. very fun and easy
good,"I love customer service, and whats better than to sell shoes at the same time. The shoes practically sold themselves but I am learning a lot of how to sell my self and up sell and signing people up for our great Rewards Program. I am usually a cashier so I get to meet everyone. I enjoy customers because I enjoy making everyone's day!"
good,"A typical day requires me to set up my computer for the day and review certain marketing codes, events, and specials that we have going on in that time period. I not only learned how to manage people more efficiently, but I did get a taste of corporate world. There are many factors and pieces that go into running a company that not many people can see and understand. The ability to be flexible and understanding in every department is a big priority with DSW. The management there is always helpful and kind whenever problems arise. Everyone that works here has a sense of community and kindness that is overwhelming in a positive way. The hardest part of my job is dealing with ""trouble"" customers. It is hard to please everyone and some people are more understanding than others. The most enjoyable part is helping our customers have a great customer experience with us and making their transactions as smooth and positive as possible."
good,"Great workplace. "
good,"The store management was always very helpful and happy to ""get their hands dirty"" with the work when needed as well as delegating tasks to the staff. My co-workers were all excellent and knowledgable about all DSW policies and procedures. The customer base was quite diverse which allowed us to learn and develop customer service skills that would accommodate any customer we encountered."
good,The place was amazing it just wasn't my passion. It very productive and staff friendly. Not a high turn over. A open door policy that is not hesitant in resolving issues or concerns.
good,"I absolutely loved working with my team in Montgomery, AL. We were all friendly and understandable. A typical day at work would be working the cash wrap and maintaining organization in clearance and out on the floor also assisting shelvers (customers) My co-workers were fun, friendly, and hard working, the hardest part of the job was if someone would try to take shoes without paying and we would have to stop them and they were being very un-cooperative and nasty towards sales associates, which would happen RARELY. But it was very enjoyable majority of the time. We would have friendly competitive games amongst the coworkers. Lots of fast-paced experience needed for the major holidays, around those days. All in all its an awesome place to work."
good,I am looking forward for management position to learn more like I learn from Walmart Canada and Dollarama I learn management skills from previous retail companies.
good,Lockport and Joliet Illinois. I recently broke my ankle and when I came to Wal-Mart for the first time I was with my husband. He stopped right in front of the door. I could not put any weight on it. Then he got the Motorized cart for me.
good,Work is fun. It is very fast pace.  Given all the support needed to exceed.  It is a very good place to develop skills needed to succeed at any retailer.
good,Learned a lot working for this company. Very fun environment.
good,Awesome first job during the Halloween season. Just wished it wasn't a seasonal job.
good,"a typical day at work is greeting customers and finding out their specific needs. I have learned many different things while working at dsw like people has all type of foot promblems and different types of comfort in shoes,diiferent arches and support,customers come in to look for.I also learned names of many different brands of shoes! Our management team is awesome! My coworkers are the best they make you feel like family. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you did all you can do to help your customer and they wallk away satisfied!"
good,supervisor of all accounting activities in Havana international airport
good,"- Customer service throughout the day"
good,"being a cashier at a store like dsw takes a lot of practice, its not for everyone. you have to make sure your social and happy all the time to greet a customer with a smile. i enjoyed this job because of the hours i would get and the pay rate was great. there was nothing hard about this job it was all customer service. so i have great customer service skills."
good,"A day at DSW was just basically Greeting customers,Assisting them with purchases,helping them pick out shoes and hand bags,Increasing sales by implementing and exceeding sales goals and promotions,organizing and creating store displays."
good,"Easy work environment with friendly staff"
good,"Incredible job experience, strong open door in diversity. Great place to work and form bonds of comrades.  "
good,I work freight and the sales floor and it's never a bad day there. We have fun throughout our shifts and all of my coworkers are very pleasant.
good,"A typical day at work is helping out the customers, clean up the store to make it look more presentable, and going back and forth to the registers to help out with the long lines."
good,"overall a good place to work, cahs handling, run shifts, delagate tasks, take in truck and inventory"
good,"Who wouldn't want to work around shoes all day (smile). A day at DSW is glorious, I learned about the different types of brands, styles of shoes. How to encourage your customers and give them the experience you would like to experience while shopping there (100% customer service). The management team was phenomenal always encouraging the best and to shot for the best, my co-workers were the same. The hardest part was trying not to spend my check on shoes and handbags, but that was the most enjoyable (the discount)."
good,I love being around different people everyday. It actually revealed a lot about myself. I also loved the people I worked with. My bosses were awsome. The company itself was comfortable and clean. The work was easy and the pay was enough to help me get things done that I needed done. I even had a good amount to treat myself with after I paid all my necessities.
good,"if you have great people working there , coming in wont be a problem. the people you work with can determine how much energy you have through out the day"
good,"Great place to work. Lots of room for growth, Great management team, Hours are amazing...store closes early on weekends so you can still have a life outside of work."
good,"Working at DSW/Designer Brands was an incredible experience and growth opportunity.  The people and culture are inclusive, diverse, and dedicated to living the Company values of Passion, Humility, Collaboration, and Accountability."
good,Store manager is always available and flexible to listen to employees as well as making sure they are working a position and hours that are working well for them.
good,I enjoyed working for DSW. I thought all of my managers were nice and responsible. The hardest part of the job was understanding the coupon/rewards system.
good,"BY FAR, this was my favourite job hands down. The staff was incredible, everyone was so friendly and down-to-earth, and it was like a second family. My manager was also incredible, I learned so much from him and he always encouraged me and believed in my abilities. It was such an uplifting atmosphere. The hours were pretty ok too, typical retail hours it doesnt change much wherever you go. busy during sale times, kind of dead the rest of the time. "
good,best job I ever had. I would do truck freight if needed. process the merchandise. after I was done with that I would service customers and help out at registers if need be. I would also greet customers as they walked into the store or leave. I did pretty much everything there and loved it. the only reason I left is because I needed more money and the better opportunity came along.
good,DSW creates a fun environment for their employees to work. They also make all opportunities for advancement in the company known to all employees and encourage their employees to work towards their goals.
good,"This is such great company, with such a great work environment! Management is superb and the team overall is a welcoming and easy to work with group. I have loved my time here. I especially loved the 40% discount."
good,Its a great first job. Must be 18. You learn a lot working at DSW. I learned what it meant to be in customer service there. I also learned time management from there. You learn a lot
good,Understanding and work with you for scheduling purposes and personal matters. Duties are not complicated and associates discount is good plus the reward eligibility
good,"At The Shoe Company, I learned a variety of life skills that I will apply in any job or career that I may experience. The team that welcomed me, and the team that we built over the time that I worked with the company was supportive, co-operative and exceptional."
good,My time at DSW has been nothing but a pleasure. The environment in which we work is fun and all about self expression. Interacting with customers daily was a great experience.
good,The Shoe Company is an amazing workplace. They are very welcoming and everyone becomes a family. You learn great work ethics and grow to become better.
good,"Work hard then be firm about what you need! I did find that people were promoted to manager level (buyer, senior buyer, and beyond) based on buying capabilities instead of buying capabilities AND management capabilities. That was tough but I loved it at DSW."
good,I really enjoyed my time with DSW it was my first job and only left because of my college class schedule. I would highly recommend this company. They gave me intensives for selling their rewards programs which i thrived on and they pay above minimum wage but they also expect you to work hard so if you have a great work ethic this company is for you.
good,"A very fun and welcoming place to work at and associates are very friendly with one another, everyone is treated and accepted as part of the group. Managers are very understanding and flexible with scheduling."
good,"I have met a lot of coworkers and managers that I have come to be very close with. It is a great experience, where you can learn many skills. The only ""con"" I can think of is that working retail can be slow on off seasons."
good,I loved the people I worked with but most our products were for women so I couldn't really use our benefits. I was paid a good amount of money and they worked with me on my hours
good,"It was a wonderful place to work.  The management was very good at scheduling who works well together.  There's always something to do, so you won't be bored.  Only negative is that finding a full time position is very rare."
good,"I love working here. First job i've had where I love everyone I work with AND love the job. plus...hello... shoes. I am a little upset that they took away our discount on clearance and changed clearance percentages, but still its a 30% discount."
good,"DSW has trained each and every store manager to be their best. Without our store managers, there wouldn't be a great team. When you receive regular customers, that's when you know you're doing something great!"
good,DSW was through the temp service and i worked there for a pretty long time i made it through the first 3 rounds and didn't make it through the final round but i'm looking for a full time job with good pay and every week
good,"I like working for this company, a great place to work and be apart of a good team. a place to learn about the Industry and all shoe you cab buy, lol....."
good,"The company is amazing, and they really care about ensuring that the employees are trained well, so that they will be able to provide a customer with whatever information is needed. there is a lot of opportunity to transfer to other stores and other companies that belong to the same banner as the Shoe Warehouse, so there is a lot of security in the job. "
good,DSW was the best company I have ever worked for. The manager was amazing and my co workers were awesome as well. I learned so much from the team. Working with the customers was the best part in working with company.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management, focused on building a great product and a great culture. Strong leadership. Great customer service"
good,"its a great place to work and you learn alot, but they only offer 4 full time positions (manager, senior assistant manager, assistant manager, stock)"
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people out and assist them with finding the right merchandise that suits their needs and style.
good,"The typical work day at DSW starts with speaking to my managers and then being assign to a work station.  As a cashier and floor associate i have multiple task, first and foremost as a cashier my job is to keep a close track on the money in my cash register and reporting lost or extra money.  Being on register i do have the chance to tell customer about sales, discounts and big promotions.  As a floor associate my job is to clean, organize, greet customers and help customer find the perfect shoes and accessories.  "
good,If you like to talk to people about shoes and life - this is the place to work.  There is a lot of walking and cleaning up after customers...but it can be fun and very entertaining at times!  The management team at the Woodbridge store is great!  Newer managers are very flexible but are 'on' you to do your best and push you to achieve goals.
good,A lot of teamwork was involved with this position. I enjoyed my days working here due to the upbeat vibe I received from coworkers. My management continuously provided positive reinforcement for our team when it came to achieving goals for the day.
good,I love my job! Ive been working with the company for a year and half now I love the management and the people I work with.
good,A day at work was very busy. I worked during the holidays so we were always busy. I enjoyed it because I like always having something to do. Management and co-workers were fine to get alone with as well. I enjoyed working with customers and seeing them leave happy.
good,Great place to work and shop.My manat he time was very sweet and understanding. It was a job that i enjoyed waking up and was happy to go too.
good,"typical day of work was helping customers "
good,I loved working at DSW and being a stock supervisor. I made more knowledge of guiding and being in a leadership position.
good,Creative environment with much room for advancement depending on initial role.
good,a typical day at work is customer interaction providing great cstomer service.. the hardes part of this job is keeping the store zoned
good,Working at DSW was good as a first job while completing High School. The management was suberb and working with people all day was enjoyable.
good,"I have been working at DSW for about 2 years now and can say that I have stayed here this long because of how amazing our whole team is. They make it such a pleasure to come to work and it is such a learning experience every day. I have learned how to work as a team, how to provide the best customer service, troubleshooting problems that arise in the store, and operating a cash register. The hardest part of the job is having to multi-task, but maintain completely attentive to each item I am trying to focus on. There are times when I am at the cash register helping a customer and the phone rings and I am being talked to over the walkie-talkie, and I just have to maintain my focus and complete each task to the best of my ability in proper time. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to work with people who are my age and share similar interests to mine. My co-workers make coming in to work an enjoyable experience, as do the managers. We all relate well together and can cooperate as a team."
good,Easy going work environment with friendly management and team members. Everyone is willing to help everyone even if they are busy. Great place to work!
good,I've worked at DSW for a couple of years and I love the way managers are always willing to work with employees schedules. Most of the employees are college students so flexible hours are wanted and usually given.
good,The company is great but the management is terrible. They are unfair.
good,Working at DSW was easily one of the least stressful jobs I have ever had---this is all due to a great management team and a company with unparalleled values.
good,Working for DSW was a great job of work for him being a stock lead person there for me good place to work for people to talk to and stuff good customer service.

good,Great work culture at Bayers Lake. Very caring management. Excellent environment. Love working here. Good customer service experience. Love love love this company and the store in Bayers Lake.
good,"Very laid back environment , extends your knowledge in the fashion industry . Keeps you aware of the trends that are in and out. Lets you interact with clients beyond their needs"
good,"A friendly work environment that loves and protects its employees. A fair priced company that provides the best customer service.I would highly recommend anyone looking for a great job, that is fun and challenging."
good,"I enjoyed my time here, like every job its what you make it.  Had many great laughs with the staff as well as management.  A very fast paced environment and the customers are fun."
good,"Exciting place to work when you have the right management in place to push the stores performance and teamwork.  I also like the companies appreciative attitude towards everything a team member in the company from the sales associate all the way up to the corporate jobs everyone is obviously important and it reflects on to our customers as well.  You can’t beat the employee pricing on their shoes as well. All around, great place to work."
good,"Easy going enviorment, managment was always nice and professional. Get to meet and talk to new people everyday."
good,Very relaxed very cool and very awesome and competitive and contructive enviroment because it is cool and fun and basic and relaxed and awesome and cool.;loiuhbgvfcd
good,"DSW's culture is all about people, they realize that humans are working for them and have that ""happy worker, happy customer"" mentality. Associate discount is amazing if you are into shoes. If you can't make it to your shift it is super simple to give it to someone else with their scheduling app. It feels like a family and they promote from within whenever possible."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, and the management listened to my needs. I was able to balance work and life. The employees were nice as were the managers. Overall I enjoyed my time there."
good,Wasn't a super ideal place to work. I did enjoy my job until it became competitive and I just didn't want to work there anymore. Company policy was too focused on selling memberships and your course were completely based on how many you could get in a shift. Not worth the stress in my opinion. Even had competitions to see who could get the most in a certain amount of time.
good,"-Typical workday included working at the register, keeping sale floor organized, updating clearance section, completing online orders for customers, daily cleaning duties"
good,"had an incredible time working there, great employees, good management, physical job, but very interactive and enjoyable. customers were friendly, and happy."
good,"There was a great staff to work with at DSW and we received a nice discount. The typical day at work was helping costumers, cleaning or organizing, and using the register."
good,"This was my first job. I learned mostly all my customer service skills. How to work the register, dealing with money. I also learned how to so freight."
good,"definitively the best part-time job you can get. the management is so awesome and understanding, they never talk down to you. the workload is not heavy, I would say just right, there are peak times but never have I seen the store get trashed. the managers would assign you as cashier or someone on the floor and both are easy jobs."
good,"A typical day of work would be to meet in the hudle go over any system changes, any new products, sales or deals, afterwards we answer phone calls greet customers and help them as efficently as possible. the hardest part of the job would be during peak season we didn't have enough seats for the employess so we would have 2-3 people working on one call, that caused a lot of chaos, confusion and frustration for both the employess and customers. the most enjoyable part fo the job was being around positive engery. Everyone was willing to help everybody."
good,this job is was great. I am a shoe lover and this was the most relaxed enviroment for me at this time. I love the team. I enjoyed working with the customers and resolving customer issues. I enjoyed gaining points for the company. I would definetly recommend this job to a retired teacher or a college student just looking for some spare change in the future before graduation.
good,"Designer Shoe Warehouse, was my first real job, i'd say when it comes to customer service. It was a different experience from going to working with yogurt and then selling a customer heels that would match her wedding dress. I enjoyed working there, the environment was great, the staff and managers were great. They really challenged you to see how far and creative you could make it that day; e.g. buliding the display tables in the front."
good,"Town Shoes has come a long way since going corporate approximately 4 years ago. Its Head Office is small yet mighty! "
good,"Help everyone who is in the store find shoes, shoe products and acceceries. General cleaning is involved, rearranging of products. Can see and hear the public's personal opinion on the products we have."
good,"Funfill place to work,  like interacting with people. Always untime and ready to work , and also a team player , enjoy taking on new task and a quick learner."
good,"Management was very nice, made work fun and enjoyable. Learned a lot of retail tips. Got along with everyone who worked there, great discount. Perfect place for me to have worked at."
good,"The Shoe Company was  my all-time favourite job for many reasons. I advanced from key-holder to store manager; I even relocated to advance my career there. In hindsight, I wish that it wouldn't have taken such a toll on my family life, or I would still be employed there."
good,"I worked here part time for about 5 years and loved it. Typical retail job, but definitely had fun shopping with customers and seeing/trying on all of the new shoe styles."
good,A typical day at work for me two days out the week involved  doing freight/stock in the mornings. During other days I mainly was cashier  or on the sales floor customer servicing and doing recovery making sure the shoes were in place and there was nothing on the floor. The most enjoyable part was getting to work with others and meeting new people. Sometimes the hardest part was freight in that finding space was sometimes an issue.
good,"I love my job! My team is fantastic! My managers are amazing and my coworkers are so fun and that really makes the job worth while for me! Some days if the traffic is slow it can get a little boring, but if you're tasking you stay pretty busy! Freight, although demanding, is a lot of fun for us! I do feel corporate is hard on us sometimes with what they except and what's realistic, especially during peak when we're getting 100+ piece trucks! They need to come drop freight and see what it's about and then make their assessments! I use to hate getting rewards, sometimes I still do. There's a sense of pressure when it comes to signing ShoeLovers up, but if you put forth the effort and have good presentation, 9/10 you should be able to get the sign up so its not so taunting anymore! Hours are good! Tell them what you need and they work with you!  Our customers aren't bad either, thankfully! I enjoy helping them! When you see how excited ppl get about shoes it makes you feel like you did a great job!  Being a keyholder was a big adjustment for me! Management is no easy thing, and they expect a lot out of you, but I learned a lot in the role and by the end of my assignment I felt well adjusted. Some of these reviews, I understand where they're coming from, BUT I feel as long as your store supports you, you can do it! It's a lot sometimes, you stay busy, but it's rewarding, at least my experience has been! Come to Brookwood, you'll love it!"
good,"i just worked the cash register, helped customers out all the time. mostly just cleaned up the store, my co workers are great. management; they care a lot, they do a great job."
good,"Work days are always enjoyable, shifts fly by and the environment is very welcoming and offers plenty of ability to grow and gain new experiences through customer service and sales. The managers are all very helpful and understanding and make it easy to succeed. Co-workers are reliable and easy to get along with. Hardest part of job is satisfying every customer. Most enjoyable is the various tasks and skills I perform and learn every shift."
good,"Typically, we dealt with customers and promoted the reward program to as many people as possible. From this experience I believe my social skills, and ability to communicate with people who I had never meant and tremendously improved. My co-workers helped me learn how to benefit each other and get jobs done efficiently and effectively, and the most enjoyable thing about the job was getting to help people find shoes which is something I really enjoy and am passionate about. The aspect of footwear fashion."
good,"Working for DSW has so many perks! Every staff member is very friendly and helpful and does everything they can to make you feel comfortable and welcomed. The management is the best."
good,"Like any customer service job, every day held a new experience to learn from. Walking in with basic sales floor experience, here I learned about stock and inventory management, store organization and procedures from store to regional management, and leadership skills over newer staff and floor management when store managers were called off the floor for great lengths of time. The best part is that we all were able to count on each other when given a task and have it finished to the associates and mangers best ability."
good,"I can't quite put my finer on what it is that makes the team at DSW so likeable and easy to bond with. My peers and management have proven to be fun, compassionate, quirky, and a lot a bit sassy- there was a long period of time I considered going to work like a second home- there were days I literally dreaded clocking off! The management constantly looked for ways I could learn as an associate and how I interact with pope socially. I was a bit reluctant to accept the criticisms at first, but looking back on how much I've grown as a person and associate, I truly value the time and effort they put into having me reach my potential!"
good,"DSW is not as bad as all these people make it out to seem. But considering the benefit of the doubt, each store is different. MY store is amazing. our management team is awesome & our coworkers arent just any regular old Jo off the street. We live up to our values & welcome new members to our team. Rewards are a big deal, thats why my store is #2 in the West Region. we dont shove it down your throat- at least not in OUR store. a miss is a miss big freakin deal. we care more about the experience of the customer not rewards. we have sales goals- just like every store. its amazing for me, work isnt work. I was there for 6 months & got talked to about becoming Lead Cashier. u can advance here. overall i love it. apply & let your experience be heard, some have it better than others but it is NOT a butcher shop like everyone makes it sound"
good,Believes in customer service is the number one priority. Great associates with true retail values. The company believes in helping it associates with the community outreach.
good,the people in the greensboro store made working at dsw the best. no matter what ur day was like when you left here you were in a better mood than when you came in. they work with you and are always teaching you new things. i loved working in the greensboro dsw
good,I really loved DSW.  I mean I was in love with the job.  Sadly they were only able to keep me as a seasonal employee.  It was a super easy job.  You pretty much got to talk to people all day and walk around.  The hardest part of this job was finding the right shoes for work.  This job boosted my self confidence by letting you dress in a professional manner and not pushing learned how to use the register until you were at least three weeks into the job.  They pay a little over min wage which was great for me because that paid more than my previous job.  The work force was positive and super supportive.

good,"My co-workers and managers are positive and engaging people, passionate about our products. There is one main store manager and 4 other managers. Usually at least two are there at all times except when closing. One nice thing they implement is a group ""huddle"" at the beginning of each employees shift in which they review the previous day's sales and rewards program enrollments among other things, such as new product we have received."
good,Management and coworkers are the greatest. Willing to help and teach new things to better business. 
good,"Working at DSW was fun. As soon as you walk in you would see smiles on everyones face whether they were having a good day or not. And when it came to finding a pair of shoes for a customer, both the sales team and stock team collaborated making sure the customer got what they were looking for. Also, the managers were very hands on. Especially the stock managers. If we (stock team) needed help moving shoes or breaking down the shipment, they were right there next to us helping out who ever needed it. But what made this job so enjoyable was the fact that everyone in that store made it happen no matter what the challenge was."
good,"Working at DSW I've come across many different people and I feel like working there helped me grow up. DSW makes you more responsible and they train you with the values that you can relate to life and I loved working there. The management team their just awesome they aren't fake in any way they are like the big brothers and sisters you can talk to about anything. Your fellow coworkers are great very inviting and it’s a wonderful environment. The hardest part of the job at DSW had to be when we didn't make our goals at the end of the day. DSW makes you apart of the business; to them you aren't just an employee. To DSW you are a part of the family. Throughout the day they would let you know how much we were making and what we could do to make it better. So when we didn't make our goals it made me really sad and it makes you want to work harder to do so. The most enjoyable part of working at DSW had to be being around everyone there. From the customers to the mangers, it just was a happy atmosphere and I feel many people would really enjoy it."
good,DSW is a good place to work. A typical day at DSW is nice. All of my co-workers and managers are awesome. Working at DSW is I learned how to get a long well with others and be very helpful to my customers and help them as much as I can. The hardest part of my job is not having something that a customer wants. I like the customers to leave with a smile on their face. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I helped someone and made their day and knowing that my managers are proud of me!

good,"Overall DSW is a great place to work, management is great about communicating and delegating tasks for associates. DSW has room for growth if you desire to move ahead."
good,"Working in a high volume inbound call center can be difficult, however, I feel it was a great experience. Regular work days consisted of placing new orders and tracking old ones, notating accounts and updating them, handling refunds and payments, and answering any questions or concerns our customers had. The work environment was outstanding. I worked with a team and we all depend on each other to create the best experience for our customers."
good,"DSW, is remarkably a growing brand, and has gotten so much attention for over decades of steady customer service. Everyone makes a mistake or two, but they know how to make up for them.

good,"I have learned how to work with other staff members as a team, I enjoy coming to work, and all of us put in an equal effort to succeed as a team/ store."
good,"DSW is all about making the shopper or shoelovers experience the best possible. Honest company with great deals. A typical day consists of coming into work and getting a brief description of any new changes or promotional deals the company has. Then you'd help any shoppers that need help while paying attention to your area and making sure it is presentable. If you are trained to be on the register you may be called when needed. I learned create customer service, cashier training, how to stock inventory correctly, and how to effectively communicate in the workplace."
good,"Great place to work, I enjoyed work and my coworkers.  I was able to versify my job by being apart of every part of the management of the store.  I unloaded new freight, customer serviced on the sales floor, and worked as a key holder with management."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job. was to make customer happy, nice management, You learn a lot about shoes and other fashions items, flexible hours."
good,"I really liked working there! I think that it is perfect for a first call center job. Everyone there was really sweet. The only thing I did not like about the job was that they do not work with your schedule, other than that its a good"
good,"A typical day of work consisted of me getting there and my manager assigns me a place to go to. Most times i work in mens, clearance, and backup cashier."
good,"I've been with DSW for a year next month and it was my first retail position. I was really nervous but all of the other associates were so kind when training me. No question was ever stupid. They truly made me feel like I wasn't just their co worker but I was their friend. The management is also extremely professional. I can truly say that working for this store has not just taught me a lot, but I've made some great friends along the way. Such a friendly, positive and happy environment to work in."
good,It was a really good company with great people to send you off to work with for the day. Spend all day working at verious places doing tedious things all day but it was always a great workout
good,I love the atmosphere. Very friendly associates and managers. I love to do early morning prepped shifts but some times the amount of stuff they send us is outrageous and they expect us to get it all out before the store opens. I love doing the visual displays and hope to grow within the company. Its a great place to work at.
good,passionate and vibrant everyday experience with DSW i had the opportunity to learn how to customer service the customers by using the companies 4 engagements and values provided by the company  to assist each customer. the management team is very loyal and collaborative with themselves and the associate team we work together to achieve companies goals and standards. the co workers are friendly and show humility when necessary.the most difficult part working with DSW is trying to educate those customers who are persistent on changing the companies policies and trying to avoid a customer complaint. i would have to say the most enjoyment working  for DSW is simply the that great customer service experience and being able to be part of the team while making people for great through the power of shoes.
good,"I help people find shoes every day that I'm at work. My co-workers make working there so much fun, and they always makes me laugh!"

good,"I loved working at DSW. The co-workers were great, managers as well and they helped you improve your knowledge of the product. The focus was always on the customers but we were also allowed to work on projects to keep us busy in between."
good,"Everyday I come in, I take over the register and ring out customers. In between the customers or when there is down time, I am given tasks to do at the cash wrap which is usually clearance. When there isn't any clearance, I am on the floor from time to time helping out customers needs. We are big on getting our new customers to sign up for the rewards program and that can be tuff at times but I do well with that. Busy days like the holidays are tuff as well because it can be overwhelming with long lines at the register but from working there so long, I work fast paced and great under pressure. I love when a customer leaves happy that we've helped them find what they are looking for and compliments our store as a whole because it shows that we are doing our jobs. I help out with shipment when needed. Also, we are always recovering our assigned zones to help keep the store clean and presentable."
good,"Everyday at Town shoes is a good day. I learn something new about a customer or a new product, I learn about how to deal with different situations everyday and what to say to customers about products. The management at Town Shoes is great everything is organized and clean, the co-workers are just as great, everybody treats others with respect and helps each other when we need help. This job doesnt have a hard part, everything there is explained to you and if you need help with something there is always someone there to help. The most enjoyable part of the job is everything, if you enjoy helping customers and love shoes then this is a place to work."

The assistants are fun and super positive. Saturdays were the best time to work.  It was always busy and I really liked interacting with the customers.  The customers were really great, much better than my previous retail jobs. "

This, combined with comprehensive training that can help even the totally uninitiated become knowledgeable about the products and services the company provides and well-trained, amicable management at all levels made working at DSW an absolute joy. If my long-time career goals did not involve something different, I would have likely stayed onboard to become management and help the company grow even more."
good,"I was a holiday help, so I didn't get to learn too much about how DSW operated, but while I was there, it was a pretty easy environment and you get a discount on the shoes! It was easy to learn and the customers were almost always in a good mood. The hardest part for me was getting people to sign up for the rewards program."

good,Coworkers were always helpful and it was very enjoyable giving assistance to people. Flexible schedule was available and good paying job. Very friendly workplace.
good,To be honest one of my best experiences. Management was awesome and helpful. If I was falling behind I always had back up from management and other associates. There rush times when you have to be quick-paced. As long as you do your role and keep busy the job will be easy. Plus who doesn't want to have trendy shoes.
good,"It was my first job ever and I loved it! I always had a happy face going to work, I enjoyed everyone I worked with. My managers were super easy to get along with, and we were all one big family. Great for a first job, definitely recommend it."

Meaning you can start as a sales associate and eventually become a store manager or higher. The whole culture is just very inviting and inspiring."
good,The managers were constantly positively reinforcing good qualities in workers. They encouraged advancement in the workplace. Placed a lot of responsibility on workers in a reasonable way. I would not have left if I hadn't moved closer to my school. Honestly the hardest part of the job was hearing the same mantra about forcing the rewards program on customers and feeling bad that I was not confident enough to convince customers to sighn up.
good,The staff is always willing to help when you have questions. They're friendly and easy to get along with. It is a very enjoyable place to work. Get to interact with many people and just have a fun time overall while working.

I learnt that you must communicate with customer in order to determind what kind of shoe this person would need.

Workplace culture relies on a collaborative, communicative effort."
good,"Good company and friendly employees. I learned about fashion and shoes and it helped me with providing great customer service. "
good,First we call our customers shoe lovers which shows that each Shoelover is important in our store. A typical day at work would order fulfillment also known as web orders which I do on a daily basis when I work. Another thing I do at my workplace is help out Shoelovers and I also have three and a half years of cash and retail experience. I learned how to deal with different types of situations in a proper manner.  The management from the beginning was not good because I was always afraid to go to work because I did not know what to expect or if they would yell at me for no reason but now the management is amazing because the management we have now they know exactly what they are doing and they are teaching as so well. Workplace culture is perfect everyone is so nice and they help each other out which I love about the workplace. The hardest part is that there are some situations that can bring you down but you know that management will always be there to back you up no matter what. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and the management because they are very diverse and if you have any questions they will always be there to support.

It is efficient and happy and we were all very motivated to do our very best because we all had goals and genuinely wanted the best for the company. The hardest part of the job was definitely working with technology because it was sometimes very slow and it was hard to do my job for the customer quickly when the technology wasn't up to speed. Another very hard part was dealing with rude and unhappy customers and trying to help them be happy with our services.

I had an amazing supervisor and manager who worked with me well to improve on my skillset. I was able to coach and managed my team members and meet the sales targets and expectations of the store. Great and fun environment to work in, and so many incentives and perks. Bonuses were easy to achieve in this high volume store.."
good,If you love shoes best place to work is DSW.  What people don't realize is that DSW has a specific padding on the floor that doesn't hurt your feet when rocking 6 to 8 inch heels like myself.  I was known for my sky high platform shoes and the only rule my boss gave me is if I can walk and run around in them in 8 plus hours they don't care how high my heels were.  It's a Fashionista's Dream to have that shoe closet.  I love it.
good,Pretty easy work space. A decent start out pay. Gets pretty busy in the fall and winter. Not that many hours but its a good first job to get the hang of.

good,"Management and coworkers were very helpful and understanding, but it would have been nice if the part-time position offered more hours, as I usually got less than 20 a week."
good,"The staff was amazing to work with.  "
good,"Honestly, this is probably one of the best jobs I've ever had. My managers are so understanding and can relate to each and every one of the associates. They're always there when a question needs to be answered, or a customer is irate. You clock in, here what the numbers are for the day, and then have fun. I've learned that I can switch to becoming a people person almost instantly. Management (at the store in Tyler, TX) is beyond amazing. I've worked there for a little over a year, and within 8 months, we already talked about me being promoted. My managers just want to see us become successful. When it comes to the difficult part, I do shipment and sales associate, so the real hard part is shipment, but you get the hang of it. Sure, you'll get annoyed and a bit irritated, but with my managers, we coordinate and plan so fast, the bad part is usually over by the time I clock out. I love my coworkers. Hands down, can fully admit that we're a family."
good,"Managers are nice, coworkers are great! I wish i didn't have to move! I loved working here! They always work with your personal schedule! Highly recommend it!"

good,"its always a bright day at DSW, its easy and lovely helping customer dress up. I learned that customer are sometimes very stressed at times and if I can  help by helping you shop I'm in. management were great timing schedules perfectly. the work place is very friendly and very busy at certain rush hours that is were I learned to add information into the cash register. the best part you get a discount and still can be on their mailing list for better discounts."
good,This was my first job that had many components with customer service and goal accountabilities.  It was a very professional setting and all the employees were helpful and professional.

I loved the environment also everyone was super nice and it felt like family.

good,Amazing place to work. All my coworkers were friendly and it was very enjoyable when I worked. The hardest part of the Job is that when their were many shoe lovers in the store and only a few associates working. We call all our customers shoe lovers. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we did not have to think of it as our job we think of it more of our home because we are all together as one and if we have a problem we are able to figure it out all as one.

good,a typical day at work would begin with a prayer and then we would be stationed at the places that we would clean for that particular day until it was time to go home.i learned that it is important to keep our environment clean and tidy at all times.Management always did a good job in keeping us motiviated and treated well.my co-workers were very friendly we got along very well.the hardest part of the job was the increasing load of dirt because it was the feastive season.the most enjoyable part was when we finished work and the places we cleaned were dirt free.
good,I absolutely loved working at DSW. They assign tasks to you based on what you are best at. Your talents will truly shine here! The company loves to promote their employees so there is a lot of growth opportunity here.
good,"At first I wasn't a shoe love, when started working at DSW I enjoyed try on shoes. My first job at retail store. It was a thrilling experience once I got promoted as a Cashier Lead. Their job spirit and rewards encouraged me to work with enthusiasm. Loved to be part of DSW company."

I learned that the way the way the customer feels about the atmosphere is extremely important because that determines if they would come back or not. The management at this job are excellent in terms of training, friendliness and suggestions. they can kindly tell you what you need to improve and they ask for suggestions on what they need to improve. the hardest part of this job is dealing with difficult customers who don't appreciate the fact that you are trying to help them. however, the most enjoyable part of the job is also interacting with the customers and making them happy."
