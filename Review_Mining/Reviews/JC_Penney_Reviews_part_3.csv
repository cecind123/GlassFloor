How's your on the register do layaway is on the register how do you fix the clothes the way they supposed to be socks and etc. "
good,"My job at JcPenneys was very competitive, high pace and stressful due to meeting quotas every month. Due to the increased number of sales I had my quotas where very high. I averages sales of six figures plus annually; therefore I had to sale $100.00 an hour most months and the pre-holiday sales required more sales per hour."
good,i enjoyed working there because of the discount and always meeting new people and i enjoy shopping so i always get to latest fashion trends and it located in the mall.
good,It was a good place to work but understaffed.  I enjoyed working there.  Employees were expected to handle a lot compared to the pay.  It needs to either be more pay or more help hired.

good,You become family with the people you work with. The managers are all friendly and understanding and will work with your schedule. The hardest part of the job would be seasonal around Black Friday or any major sale because a lot of the clothes and tables get thrown around and dressing rooms overrun so it's a lot to do but its fun to get to know the customers and the time always passes by pretty quickly.
good,"I really liked this job. They are very understanding. If you have to leave work early they will let you leave. If you cant come in on a certain day, all you had to do is call in a couple hours before to tell them you cant come in. Sometime the store would get really messy and you cant really clean it in a whole days worth because the customer will just come and mess up again."
good,"Un día típico en el trabajo consistía de aclarar las dudas de los clientes respecto a la mercancía, cobrarles, hacer pedidos online, cumplir las ventas del día mediante interacción con clientes. La gerencia era bastante organizada; me gustó este trabajo porque tenía descuentos en la tienda, y porque pagaban un poco mas del mínimo. Debido a que era un empleo temporal, pude experimentar todas las facetas como diferentes departamentos(hombres, mujeres, calzado) en poco tiempo."
good,Work life is what you make of it. Very happy working there. The manager was very heart warmi8ng and other staff will make you feel at home away from home.

good,A typical work day at JCP was straight forward. I would come in start my meeting and after go down to my work area. I learned a lot from working at JCP because it's a big retail store and i got to see how retail works. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers but it showed me how to stay calm and hard situations with people. i enjoyed putting smiles on the customers faces because i felt like i really could connect with them.

good,"I worked in three different stores at different times, it wasn't anything I expected,  the people were all wonderful.  On our breaks we all bought coffee and donuts."
good,"I am sick of people who watches what your job description is but nonchalant when it comes to theirs. Some ""managers"" would rather watch you 'mess up' than to let you excel and work! a typical day involves morning meetings, cleaning up work place before work. opening registers, stocking clothes, making sure the store looks presentable. The hardest part is someone breathing down your back, and a store closing because they couldn't bring in more revenue. I feel like if I work in a place I should help by contributing revenue, not just my customer service skills, in other words, I feel like I should be helping to meet sales goals each and everyday I work not just making sure they sign up for credit."

good,"I worked in the salon of JC Penny's. I loved working here meeting new people, hearing their stories as I styled their hair, coloring, and cutting hair"
good,"Every day was different and yet the same. There was some routine in making sure that the sale floor was always presentable and executing final sales, exchanges, and returns. The real contentment was in having the opportunity to meet different people every day, learn their individual stories, and the small satisfaction that comes with knowing that the little extra step one took to get to know the customer or to go out of one's way to help them find something makes the customer feel that much more appreciated and could possibly have made their day better. Small acts of kindness go a long way."

I then became one of the trainers for our call center.  With this job I learned to train customer service and order entry. I had never presented in front of a classroom setting. I worked closely with the training manager and became her second assistant. The hardest part of the job was not having a set work schedule.  The most enjoyable part of the job I was there for over 10 years.  The Nashville call center out sourced it's work load to one of the other 12 centers across the US.

good,"Most of the days are a bit boring, as the business can be slow sometimes, but the days that are busy are really fun. No matter what department you work for, you'll have cool coworkers to talk to. Many of the workers that have been there for over 5 years or so, pass down what they know to new sales associates, as most people there have had that job before, so they know what it takes. Management is flexible with hours for those who actually work. For the most part, you'll switch between small jobs, but I mainly only worked the cash registers, which is actually a fun part of the job, but you'll also clean fitting rooms, organize shelves, return clothes to their proper shelves, and many other things like that. It's a pretty sweet deal."

Everyone has a voice, so everyone is important and we get the best out of people so that we can be a better team. All the customers are polite and courteous to us as we deliver professional customer service. We enjoy the customers and love helping them. The co-workers are the best part about work. When the store is very messy and we have had a busy day, we pull it together and succeed at the end of the day with a clean, satisfying store."
good,We will get customers tickets and it will let us know what they wanted so we will go to the location in the warehouse get the merchandise they asked for and double checked everything was okay to label the merchandise with the customer information and after place the merchandise on the conveyor. And my manager and supervisor they always helped out associates how ever they could .

I started from one end of the store and I would vacuum all dressing rooms clean brake room throw all trashes clean and mope all bathrooms dust and clean all mirrors thru out the store. As I went around cleaning and vacuuming all departments I began to know the coworkers there at each department and thru out the store. Every one there was so friendly and really made me feel like part of the team even tho I worked with the prestige department. During my time there was a change in management. I also got to know the new manager a little and was very impressed with him and how much he cared about his store. I think the hardest part of my job was that I was just prestige and not a  employed worker for JCPenney the company. The most part that I enjoyed about my job was taking pride in keeping the store looking nice neat and clean for customers and coworkers.
good,"Productive and fun workplace. A typical day at work was just that- a typical day at work.

Every customer has a different reason for what they've come for. Whether it be for a wedding, birthday, holiday or any other special event. When a customer asks for a specific shoe to try on, I have to go to the stock room to see if we have it. If we do, then I would happily give that customer that shoe. If by chance we don't have that shoe, we would offer the customer a  similar shoe. If the customer isn't satisfied then I would look on the website to see if the original shoe can be ordered. While working with customers in the shoe department, I've learned that everybody's feet are different. I've also learned that certain shoes are made for certain reasons. The management is fair. Every manager that works at the JC Penny's South Point center in McDonough, Georgia always wants the best for all associates. My co-workers work well with one another and represents Penny's at its fullest. We are ranked the best JC Penny's in the District. The hardest part of my job is providing the best customer service but still unable to turn an upset customers frown upside down. The most enjoyable part of my job is persuading customers to apply for a JC Penny's card. When a customer agrees to applying and the application is complete, the sale associate would call it out on the radio to let all team members know that you've just recruiting a customer for a card.
