rating,review
bad,Extremely political place to work for. HR favors managers and doesn't listen to the regular employees who voice concerns about harassment in the workplace.
bad,No te dan la oportunidad de crecer en la empresa no hay motivacion para los empleados
bad,"I worked there as a temp for 18 mos, the whole time management lied to me telling me they would put me on permanent. The employees are overworked and underpaid. This company does not seem to care about there employees at all. Very bottom line thinkers."
bad,I didn’t enjoy working for them they werent very kind staffed. They were not understanding of sick days or family emergencies. They didn’t treat employees well. They under payed you and made you work almost 7 days a week every week. Was a horrible toxic environment. I would not recommend anyone to work there!
bad,Hated everything about this job. EVERYONE IS WATCHING.lunch time is paid because it's only from 11:00-11:20 or 11:30-11:50 also you can't leave the campus but then again where could you go with that time.There were a few people who made the job less stressful but good luck finding those bunch. Dude let me tell you there is a handful of guys that are extremely good looking only thing that helped me get through the day were those faces.
bad,"Review previous and outstanding action items."
bad,I worked there for four months as a temp and it was terrible. Favoritism was rampant. There was no accountability in management. They would just play the blame game amongst each other. They would also put most of the workload on the temps to make sure their buddies did as little as possible. Definitely wouldn't recommend this job.
bad,If you like slavery then this is perfect place to work . They are not treated employee good. Worse ever . Do not expect any rise from them . Not friendly .
bad,Will not hire you unless you're either a college student (doesn't matter what degree youre pursuing) or at lease 10 years of machine operator experience. And yet they are hurting for help.
bad,"Failure to provide the proper training to do your job, then when it comes to light there you haven't had the training needed the employees/managers treat you with disrespect and unprofessionalism. Very Hostile work environment for people of different cultures."
bad,"Para empezar,  sueldo miserable...  No hay personal suficiente..  Y el de nuevo ingreso renuncia a la semana de haber ingresado..  Muchas presiones, los jefes quieren más producción... No quieren que cruces palabras con nadie.. Porque dicen que perdemos el tiempo.  Hubo un aumento mísero del 3 al 5 por ciento. Pero a los almacenistas les aumentaron el 20....Y gente reclamo al departamento de recursos humanos y con la prepotencia que les caracteriza dijeron que pues si no estamos a gusto que podemos renunciar.  Es una impotencia que no te resuelvan nada. La verdad ya no sabemos que hacer...."
bad,"No voice, raises were few and far between and were NOT good. RARELY a bonus. Bonuses usually came in the form of OT being offered. Equipment and environmental issues. Several things kept me there for as long as I was, but it was never because I enjoyed working there."
bad,"Long daily work hours in warehouse, including most weekend.  No compensation for excessive hours worked.  Unfair work practices, no support from upper management, or Human Resources."
bad,"Falsely accuse of allege events that occur, I would not recomend this place to anyone."
bad,"bueno,aprendi a manejar montacargas,administracion regular,buenos amigos,la presion que existia,buen ambiente de trabajo"
bad,"If benchmark wants to advertise wanted ads here, they should at lease warn everyone that you need to apply at a temp service first. Here in the winona area, HR office will redirect you to manpower temp agency, and then tell you none of the jobs are permanent. Too bad i cant sue them for false advertising."
bad,Low moral
bad,Work on Inventory with spread sheets and loaded trucks. This is all there was. I ran the warehouse on 2nd shift. and banded and wrap material for shipping at night.
bad,If you are a drone and a person that can not think for your self this would be a great place for you. There is no job security! They laid a lady off for having to take her son to chemo therapy! The supervisors allow line leaders to yell and belittle the workers. They do not pay well.
bad,"My experience with Benchmark was so bad, it's almost hard to believe. In my 20+ years of working, I have never seen a company so badly run.  Communication is impossible.  You ask a question, you either don't get an answer or you get 4 different answers.  Nothing there is clear.  Most of the people don't work - they chat or play with their phones.  The person in charge of training me kept telling me to go home, she had nothing for me to do.  I was dumb enough to believe her and wound up getting in trouble.  It took over a month to get working email and access to the ERP software necessary to do my job, but then I had to submit 5 separate help desk tickets to fix issues with the broken (and very, very outdated) ERP software.  Before even 1 of the help desk tickets were addressed, they fired me for not doing my job!  But, I couldn't do my job because I didn't have the software to do it!  And the person in charge of training me just wanted me to leave so she could chat with her friends all day."
bad,"Top Down Management.  "
bad,"This location has changed hands three times in the last 5 years. This type of CM business is extremely price and schedule driven, and when understaffed will never be able to drive the process control required for world class Quality."
bad,"muy mala empresa, te obligan a tiempo extra, la paga es muy poca, el comedor malisimo, lideres y supervisores prepotentes"
bad,"A small company acting like a big company. Minus the resources and infrastructure. The mode of operation is: to work harder and longer with very limited to no resources, i.e.., head count,robust systems development, processes and accountability. Vast tribal knowledge, very fluid quality adherence and process issues depending if it is near month end . The reward for good work performed is more ""opportunity"" and more hours to work. "
bad,"During my time with Benchmark Electronics, they're as always been a severe lack of communication within the company. Espcially when it comes from upper management."
bad,"Have worked at large corporations as well as smaller companies, without issues.  This company has many issues and they all start at the top...They don't care about employees, their work schedules, their families or anything else about them.  It's all the bottom line and the Texas upper management knows next to nothing about what goes on in their plants or how to run them."
bad,The SVP is one of the worse executives I have ever met.  The lack of leadership is crushing the organization.  The only thing that matters is $$$$$$$$.
bad,Poor management . Supervisors feel they do need to follow any procedures .
bad,"Untrustworthy management.  They will tell you than you can be hired after 6 months if you preforming good and have good attendance but it's all lies.  They will use you and abuse you until you figure out that no contractors get full time position there.  I did everything they asked me and I heard great job over and over and over but you will be there as long as they can keep you as a temp/contractor for 3 years even more and no benefits and holidays are not paid as a matter of fact they will come up to you asking you to work on major holidays and if you say I would like to spend time with my family ,  they will respond:  it's up to you if you want to work or not but it can effect your hire.  Straight to your face with no shame.  I worked there for a year and a half and I even showed up on holidays to keep them happy but in the end they get what they want and you still remain as a temp"
bad,"I troubleshoot OEM medical equipment if it fails during the production process. The work is challenging, for every piece of equipment has it's own semi unique issues. The work is also rewarding to know that I am verifying that life saving/sustaining equipment is getting distributed at the best quality that I can provide."
bad,"Benchmark takes at least two months to hire, and has major communication issues. The Purchasing dept. has been without a  Manager for over a year and a half. The employees there are wonderful, but the morale is at an all time low, and key people are leaving."
bad,"Many people working in management. Most surf the internet all day, when they are not taking credit for your work in the continuous, endless meetings they have on a daily basis, which achieve nothing. The good workers are loaded up beyond capacity with work, while the lazy ones do what they want for .50 cents an hour less. Many people on the payroll, not many working.. anandhkur"
bad,"I worked there for 3 months and it was the worst experience I've had managment didn't seem to know anything and the team leader I was under was rude and disrespectful she said rude things about me to other employees when I first started saying I wasn't ""fast enough"" they reward your hard work with overtime constant overtime and the days are long enough as it is the breaks are unfair 10 hour days and all you get is a 20 minute lunch and two 10 minute breaks dont bother there"
bad,Was very disappointed whet in very positive. Was meeting a Lotta good people and trying to do a variety of work and grow my skills at the time very sweat shop like conditions. Pay was barely adequate. Treated people less than friendly
bad,"I have been with the company as a temp for so long already when i first started it was great. I work 50 hours Monday thru Friday and Saturday anywhere from 4 to 10 hurs i do so much, but i feel like im not appreciated."
bad,setting up machines and runnig and when errors occur fix as fast as possible and keep running if not able to run needed to r&m to fix. I learned alot from benchmark and will always remember working there. management needs to be replaced they play favorites and if they don't like you will find any reason to get rid of you. co workers were ok but everyone was for themselves. Was trying to keep your nose out of things and do your job. My most enjoyable part of the job was constant learning i really enjoyed my job and miss it.
bad,"I worked at Fremont PT location. Most of them are Vietnamese and they don't value much of their employees."
bad,"No permiten el crecimiento dentro de la empresa, y el sueldo. Muy bajo. "
bad,I was given a raise around 2 days before I was terminated because of downsizing. No one seemed to know when something may happen to there job.
bad,"I do not want to talk too much about Benchmark. They fire me without reason. Need to move on. Worked for them 12 years. They pay well, and was fun to work there, but they not appreciate hard working workers. Benefits was good, vacation, sick days and 401 K."
bad,Benchmark is growing and has not a good corprate support to this growth.
bad,Worked there for almost a year and Ienjoyed my work but many of the co workers are childish and kisses up to the leaders and supervisors. They watch your every move and discuss you just for normal conversation. All of Winona Benchmark workers come to Rochester Benchmark to work and get paid for the commute. And have been doing so for years. The company pays for my lead's dog sitter. They leaders perform their jobs very poorly. They throw you into your job with very little training and expect you to learn on your own. I was trained by a temp and they tell you no one is suppose to train you except your lead. They can't keep good workers. So glad I finally quit. I miss my benefits though.
bad,I rate this company very low. I learned a lot about the electronics business and met a few nice people.
bad,It was very stressful working environment and can be fast paced.they want quantity and not so much quality.  I worked 3 12s and had 4 free hours but if  I worked overtime was 4 hours of first overtime day was regular pay
bad,muy dificil de crecer en la empresa el ambiente muy malo
bad,Made some friends while there.  Not very good with leader ship in the HR department -most everyone I worked with is gone .  I don’t really have anything else to offer the company has had its ups and downs with losing some very good people in the process of making poor decisions .
bad,I was employed through a third party company hoped to be fully staffed by the end of my first year with the company. the company ended up laying off several of its employees including all the temporal staffs due to financial reasons.
bad,"No accountability for staff. Management is production focused only and cuts corners and time to try and get product out. Lazy employees don't pull their weight and management expects other staff to pick up the slack."
bad,"Poor management, team leaders were great but were working under horrid supervisors. Supervisors were either abusive, obstinate or outright harrassing to female workers."
bad,"I have worked at this company for several years and have experience working with super computer customers, medical equipment customers as well as aerospace customers. Benchmark has a wide variety of engineering backgrounds and technical equipment for process development.  Full failure and analysis lab available on-site to assist with root cause for issues as well as confirmation of rework development."
bad,"La empresa le da muy poco crédito a la gente q es de agencia,así como recursos humanos nunca soluciona los problemas de manera adecuada"
bad,"Percision Technologies division aspires to be-all and do-all, but does not have leaders capable of executing.  They are big dreamers and big talkers but do not have any experience outside of the company.  They really only know, and are beholden to one customer."
bad,"It's a good starting point if you want to go into computer/electronics field but it's NOT a ideal long term job. You'll never make a lot of money and there is no job security. What's worse is that some of the Supervisors tend to show favoritism to the worst employees. And when I mean ""worst employees"" I mean that they play on the computer/phone, walk around pretending to do work in order to avoid working and even some that take 1-2 hour breaks. In the 1st year I was there, I was met with racism, prejudice, and sexually harassed by 3 Supervisors. When I reported it I was told to ""drop it"" or I'd be fired. Besides that it isn't that bad of a learning experience both from the company and its people."
bad,"I worked there for 7 months on a temp to hire basis. Usually after 3 months you are converted, I wasn't. Then they changed staffing companies and implemented ""approved time off without pay"" I took some of my 'approved' time. I was let go because I exceeded my absence amount (10 unapproved days is the limit) WITH my APPROVED days I only had 6 total."
bad,They had their best month in sales and laid about 20 people off.  Their is no real training for employees.  They set you at your job and let you go.  They invested in machinery and things they really did not need.  No real leadership.
bad,At Benchmark Electronics I trained all the new employees that came into the stockroom. I also went to other departmetns to help as well. I ended up in the shipping department working on Kentrox shipping them  all over the world
bad,This is a good company to work for. Good benefits. Really no where to advance. Raises are really small. Good people work there. Need to improve management skills.
bad,I got the notion that we were all just a number and not a person. Making it mandatory for overtime hours made it hard to balance outside relationships. If I needed some extra cash I knew that I could work extra hours to help.
bad,"Pagan muy poco,el personal es no tiene cultura de trabajo en equipo, no se cuenta con valores, no ahí oportunidad de crecimiento, lo bueno son los horarios pero la empresa te los asigna"
bad,Management was lacking at Benchmark. Not much support given to employees. I had a good manager but his superiors were lacking in dedication to employees.
bad,"If you are a recent high school graduate, a retiree, or attending community college part-time, Benchmark might be for you. Otherwise, don't bother with this company, at least in Angleton. "
bad,"Benchmark has lost good workers over the years that has forced employees that are still at Benchmark to take up the slack. Some of the job duties that were assigned to me I was not qualified for. Also Management has a issue when following their own policy when it comes to co-worker issues whether it be personal or business."
bad,Benchmark is a very productive place as long as they have the parts to build the equipment. It can also be a slow pace job as well. Management is really bad on communication when it comes to talking to the employees. Its no respect there.
bad,La empresa tiene un ambiente agradable pero como en la mayoria hay muy pocas posibilidades de promoción.
bad,"El ambiente es bueno, el sueldo no, es muy bajo en cualquiera de los puestos"
bad,"Excessive Mandatory Overtime"
bad,"- stressful days at work "
bad,"Small electronic business not sure of what they are doing, bad company culture, a lot of rotation and zero career growth. In general not a good experience, however the job security is good"
bad,The job it self wasn't hard it was who you where working with that made it hard. Benchmark altogether is a good place and good people too I loved working the but sadly they let me go on false accusations.
bad,"Worked at benchmark for 12 years.  Overall a poor place to work.  They force mandatory OT on all production workers for extended periods of time, like YEARS.   If you don't do the OT, they will terminate you.  Management, engineering, etc., obviously did not have to do the OT which made the environment tense.   Alot of long time employees leaving, high turnover rate on new employees due to the poor working conditions."
bad,"Benchmark needs good management to run the business."
bad,"Long hours, little to no help with tasks given, everything I have learned I taught my self, manager here are rude and do not help their staff, lower level employees are great to work with"
bad,"Easy job, not a good work environment. no team. lazy supervisors, learned a lot, worked at this company for 2 years as a temp and was never hired on by company. no benefits."
bad,Good company. Great people with a good company directive to achieve contract manufacturing goals. Customer satisfaction was a big part of the companies success.
bad,"Management is top heavy, often having many bosses for one employee. Some, though not all managers will take advantage of the work you do and claim that they did it."
bad,people were nice very fast paced job not enough family time would have to work a lot of weekends management was fair hardest part of job was being under staffed
bad,"If you enjoy being treated with disrespect and overburden with work with no clear direction, then this is place to be! You'll be thrown in the chaotic work and expect to survive. "
bad,"A typical day for me is a challenge everyday trying meet shipping deadline for the end of month and quarter, the hard part is dealing "
bad,"No traffic driving south, somehow less stress working environment, but will not learn something now.  Technologies are outdated."
bad,"Empresa con mucha oportunidad de desarrollo"
bad,Para mim foi como uma grande escola.
bad,"This company has many good people and most are very pleasant and knowledgeable."
bad,"One of the most unorganized and cramped machine shops I’ve worked in. A constant struggle to find fixtures , Jaws , tool holding , measurement devices and simple stuff like hex wrenches. The semi conductor industry has taken a dump because of the China tariffs and they have one contract that makes up over 80% of revenue so they are headed downhill."
bad,"es una empresa muy estable donde se aprende mucho y ay demasiadas oportunidades de conocer varias áreas de trabajo ay  un ambiente laboral bastante agradable, amistoso y múltiples opciones para aprender nuevas actividades."
bad,"Production personnel should be considered for input with respect to the work flow and layouts."
bad,"Employees were friendly and Team work"
bad,nice place to work but pay not all that good they work 24/7 overtime is posible off certain holidays very big
bad,Trabajé muy agusto pero los salarios están muy bajos.
bad,"to be honest i didn't have a good personal experience with them, wages were alright and it was a temp till they let me go,overall it was an ok job to help pay bills"
bad,"Asistir a reunion de operaciones con las areas de produccion y atender requerimientos de aduanas y embarques diarios."
bad,pues benchmark es una empresa que tiene buena estabilidad laboral pero el ambiente es un poco pesado pues la organizacion de la empresa es un poco mala pues el producto no esta correctamente manejado.
bad,se aprende mucho y si tienes permiso de conocer otros puestos
good,Extreme high turn over for temp. people. This company has the Good Ole Boy system down. upper management don't take their employees to serious when there is a problem with supervisors or management and basically take the side of the people who have been there longer than a temp. Because their word is BIBLE.; Hence the Good Ole Boy System.
good,"I was 'fired' for being 30 min. late one Saturday when I came in for optional overtime, I had got a speeding ticket on the way in to work.  they said it would have been better if I just didn't come in at all, but since I was late I was canned and my managers were not even there on Saturdays. it was just a co-worker that was playing 'manager for the day'"
good,"First off, Mandatory overtime of 16 hours a week.  Second, $11.25 an hour for soldering circuit boards for important and government contractors. Third, I was never told how to access benefits and PTO. It was a horrible company with a greedy CEO and IMPOSSIBLE supply and demand expectations. Work here only as a last resort."
good,"- Demasiada rotación de personal."
good,"It is ok work place, but not easy to get hire on. Many people come and go because they don't get hire on for long time. When busy they want you to work long hour and seven day for a long time."
good,"I was formerly with Suntron Corp., which was bought out by Benchmark Electronics. Lack of communication from upper management and political maneuvering seem to be the norm for Benchmark. I am looking for a new position because they are now closing the Phoenix site."
good,"i learned alot from my trainer shes very smart and she could go a long way, the management was not that great except my supervisor he sometimes didnt have a sense of humor but most of time he did.i miss my coworkers i really enjoyed being with them.hardest part of the job was trying to learn everything and keeping it straight.what i enjoyed most was learning new stuff and being with my coworkers. the thing i hate most was when you leave the company and you call them for something that you need ive called 3 times for something important and three  times she never returned my call now thats not professional."
good,"Es un trabajo con buen ambiente, y buenos bonos por trabajo extra."
good,"I believe it is a good place for short term employees just entering the field, because you can accrue job skills in several areas.  although, it is usually confusing for new hires as you don't always know where you are working from day to day.  There is a lot of tension for long term employees,  as it is very hard to advance.  It is unorganized and that can be stressful.   There is too much focus on people's issues,  while a handful do all the work. However, If you are willing to work wherever needed,  you have a chance of getting overtime hours, and learning many skills that can help in your future endeavors."
good,"A typical day at work, come early morning, work eight hour, work fast and efficient. Management should take more course in interpersonal skill. However, workers were generally good to work with."
good,"I had a tech that was willing to teach me how to program, so that was interesting."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of clocking in, testing you ESD equipment, and having a meeting to know what we would be working on for the day. Because of the products that were being built you were constantly waiting for the person ahead of you to complete their portion of the job and then when you finished your part, you would pass it on to the next step. It was not bad work, but was extremely slow."
good,Lot of great people to work with great work culture doesn't pay for nothing work at there for 12 years only got three raises out of 12 Years management was poor was pretty good part time job but I wouldn't make it permanent
good,"You are promised promotions and advancements from upper management, but no follow through. The company seems to look outside for positions that come available when advancement opportunities open up for the most part. Good work atmosphere and work flow with fellow workers which will be missed greatly."
good,"While the people were easy to get along with, this is a large international company, and trying to advance is kept to a minimum."
good,"I go in, I get everything needed for production, I receive in new boards to stock and then print off all of the reports to issue to the floor against work orders. I print labels and batch lot product so that people can keep a proper count of all the necessary material required for their Work Order instructions. I then receive and order parts for different warehouses. I check to see which orders were shipped in our system on a daily basis and ensure the shipping dates and labes all get passed through accordingly. I report any discrepancies up the Chain of command starting with my team lead or coach. I check any priority work orders or shipment dates to see what needs to be shipped first. I also prepare orders for shipment with the correct Country of Origin codes, weigh orders, and order parts such as product license keys for the work orders."
good,I worked with a lot of great people here. The work load was always up and down. Lots of overtime followed by lay-offs. I liked working on the machines and troubleshooting problems.
good,"desde que inincia el turno se  validad las corridas y modelos a correr en lines de SMT, se realizan reportes de ooba y los YELD diarios, para presentarlos en las juntas asigandas.  revisar correos y dar soporte a dichas peticiones., lo que mas me gusto fue haber trabajado con un ingeniero el cual muy responsable del cual pude aprender varias cosas. tanto a ser Responsable como  Proactivo."
good,"lamento no poder crecer ahora que estoy estudiando he pedido la oportunidad para crear experiencia en mi area ,la cual solo ha estado retenida,,"
good,lack opportunities no raises as employees are paid about 20 to 30 percent less then all competitors in area. great managers for most part and people that make u comfortable
good,Benchmark is a fun place to work with lots of learning opportunities.
good,Troublshooting & repair of communication equipment.
good,Paperwork clear & controlled inventory. Forced vacations & 2 temporary layoffs a year drew unemployment those weeks. 3% raise a year insurance raise rates 3%.
good,"you can play it during your lunch time or breaktime. alot of overtime.Workers on production are not happy. unable to talk alot. "
good,"Contract manufacturing.  Employees don't have much say in decision making. Totally controlled by corporate office. You need permission for everything, no local control.  It is a top down organization. Lean manufacturing is a joke here"
good,"Was great place with management that cared about the employees until a new CEO came in and hired his CFO and CIO from previous companies and then an IT Director from their previous companies.  New Mgmt does not care about the employees the way previous management did and does not foster an environment to help the IT staff grow in their profession.   Also, the pay is usually much lower than what can be found closer to the Houston area."
good,Relaxed atmosphere but getting hired on from being a temp is extremely difficult. Lots of work available and options to sit while at stations are available.
good,"Muy buenos compañeros, lo que no me gusto de trabajar ahi fue que hay muy pocas posibilidades de crecimiento y la contratacion es por agencia y tiene muy pocas prestaciones, pero para empezar y enseñarse esta bien."
good,"Endless overtime when there is a lot of work. "
good,"Typically, a day would consist of packing customer assemblies according their preferences. A good portion of time was spent problem-solving, as most product was brought to our department with issues preventing them from being invoiced and shipped. the management knew of such issues but seemed resistant to change or address most issue. Most co-workers were friendly and understood the stress and frustration of our department, as their departments had issues which also made their jobs difficult. The hardest part was dealing with these solvable issues on a day to day basis. These conditions allowed me to learn how to think ahead, and address certain issues before they reached my department. It also allowed me to learn the importance of communication between people/departments. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing that I worked hard daily. It also was rewarding to me as it allowed me work at a very productive pace, while maintaining accuracy and customer satisfaction."
good,Empresa que tiene que administrar mejor el crecimiento que tiene e invertir a tiempo en este.
good,I worked there many years but over the last several work moral was very low
good,"Tiring place to work, worked late and had mandatory overtime for a year then suddenly they screwed up on a contract and we got our hours cut. Worst part was that your supervisor determined how much of a raise you got."
good,"It's a good place to work for a short period of time, but the wages are below average and once you get a leadership position, there isn't anywhere to go up except if you have a bachelors or higher education. Associates degree will get you nowhere."
good,A workplace with friendly staff & easy to get along with coworkers. always there to help when needing help or have questions. some room for growth within the company if available.
good,"fast pace management has no clue as to what goes on in the field foremen are put in positions that they are not ready to lead, new hands get the lower end jobs"
good,"Benchmark es una empresa que actualmente se encuentra en crecimiento. Es muy interesante ya que se está extendiendo a diferentes áreas de negocio. Aeroespacial, médico y ferrocarrilero."
good,Benchmark was a decent company to work for when I was younger. The 5 to 5 shifts were brutal. Management did not shy away from giving hard workers to grow.
good,"Unstable work culture, Low salary, Micro managed and over worked"
good,"Benchmark Electronics is a company that accomplishes many things for many clients regarding technology. We make test and distribute back to the clients a variety of things such as military tech, medical advanced machinery, and household security."
good,Too many lay-offs; Lack of good management. What I liked most about my job was learning the ins and outs of Quality Control and working closely with the managers in order to apply what I knew with the new hires.
good,Tienes oportunidad de aprender cosas nuevas pero no siempre existe la posibilidad de concretar tus propuestas.
good,"Enjoyed working with Electronics, working with different Customers, and most of all enjoyed people from all walks of life."
good,"Worked for this company three different times, layoffs almost yearly, don't seem to put their employees first, in any situation. Learned a great deal about the business"
good,"het is wel goed te werken kwa produktie,maar het bedrijf is afhankelijk van ASML ,word minder geen werk,word meer word je opgeroepen.dicipline is er wel ,maar geen principes."
good,From home drive about 15 minutes clock in
good,"Benchmark Electronics is a OK place to work. It's not ""outstanding"" and it's not ""bad"". It's just OK. They are a very results oriented company, but the results are often gotten by the will of individuals alone - not due to planning or a program. If the right individuals are no longer there, then things won't easily get done."
good,This work place offers a  variety of foods that are located in the cafe. Plenty of parking spaces available and a safe badge in/ badge out system that made it secure for workers who did over night shifts.
good,"Empresa muy estable en cuanto a la rotacion de personal, solo que no tiene un plan de carrrera para sus empleados"
good,Been here a number of years.  Culture has shifted to being more political and the current changes have many people questioning what is going on.  Work environment is definitely for the companies benefit with benefits less than some companies.
good,I have work for Smart Electronics for 12 years. Smart is very good company. people work hard and support each others. just like big family. the management team is willing to provide opportunity to all employee and provide proper training. it's my honor can work for Smart Electronics.
good,This is my second time working with Benchmark. Would have loved to retire from here but the Huntsville Plant is having a reduction in force. This is my second time working with Benchmark. I had a great supervisor.
good,"Buen ambiente, buena labor de equipo, se busca satisfacer las necesidades del cliente y cumplir con las metas. Se requiere una medición mas amplia y detallada de los puestos de trabajo, capacitación constante y práctica."
good,"At the very beginning, the job was really great. Over time, the culture and moral has dropped tremendously and lack of leadership is hindering progress. My production supervisor is the reason i stayed at this job."
good,Considero que Benchmark Electronics es una empresa viable para comenzar una carrera en el rubro de la manufactura de electrónica. Cuenta con un buen equipamiento y el ambiente de trabajo es agradable.
good,"everyday work was very productive and management team are very smart and kind."
good,"Desarrollo de pruebas de contaminación iónica, validación de procesos complejos, Aeroespacial y medico."
good,"Cambios de planes dia con dia"
good,I enjoy working there but work ton of hours Some of the weeksI work 90 hours a week for months
good,"Empresa enxuta, onde se necessita polivalência nas atividades do dia-a-dia."
good,Chalenging area with great opportunities. Experienced open minded employers.
good,Cuenta con todos los procesos de manufactura de placas electronicas
good,I liked working with the different employees within Benchmark.  There are a lot of changes happening with the company right now.  This makes it so there are a lot of opportunities to do different things.
good,BEI going through some growing pains. 3rd CEO is Five years. Seems to be a lack of urgency in getting new customers. Lots of uncertainty about the future.
good,"I've worked for Benchmark for 13 years and got laid-off. "
good,"Ran an account the dealt with spares for the semi conductor industry."
good,"Se trabaja bajo presión pero aprendes a manejarla, he aprendido el trato con todo tipo de clientes tanto nacionales como internacionales, el trabajo es muy flexible con los horarios pero en cuestión de sueldos esta muy castigado. Por este motivo es que estoy buscando otra opción de trabajo."

The one part I dis-agree with is in my 4 years here I was only given a 20cent raise. The economy keeps rising and healthcare going up every year but the pay stays the same. It makes it hard to survive in cases where everything grows around you but your check

good,"Problem Solving is very interesting, purchase and issue parts, working with people and teach them everything I know."
good,"Good company, however location was not great. Work load was overwhelming was hard to find good help that would stay and work.  Management had no choice, but to off load the work onto current employers."
good,"I start at looking and answering e-mails.  Then setting up what needs to get done for the day.  Check on Receiving Inspection for any items that they need help with.  Check on the new assembly being run on  1 of the SMT lines and start the qualification of the line for that assembly.  "

good,"Sometimes during busy months or end of quarter, employees had to perform more tasks during the day and it can get very tiring. On a normal business day, there can be much to do or non at all. There is no job security. There are various lay-offs during the year. But overall, its a great company if you want a decent steady paycheck."

good,"I started at Benchmark Electronics as a solderer, I then quickly wanted to learn more i learned how to desolder parts that needed to be exchanged with new ones or in board with wrong polarity, I then learned how to work with surfuce mount parts and how to tell if they were outta speck and how to manuver them into place. I eventually took a 2 week class too become an inspector. Inspecting boards was a great job i loved it. Eventually my boss came to have a talk with me about running an area alone meaning build the boards have another inspector inspect the boards, i then put the boards in to their casings and did a functional test i repaired the ones that failed test had the inspector insspect the repair and then i had to ship 300 a day i suceeded and then they did a plant closure."

good,"I work for benchmark as a manufacturing Technician on third shift. I got into the position with no college degree, but the manager that hired me retired and new manager definitely would not make that exception for somebody being hired into the position I'm in. Also, this new manager won't let me advance without a degree. They offer to reimburse for schooling, but my specific role is third shift only, so doing that full time while going to school would be a struggle."
good,"empresa muy accesible para cuestiones personales, pero con una calidad laboral deficiente, los postulantes para nuevos puestos ya estan asignadas por favoritismos"
good,"Benchmark does give space for growth within the company but it is given to whom they want to and not to whom deserves it.  People are not treated fair all the times.  They let people with huge attitudes run the manufacturing floor, they talk to people rudely.  They say they have a open door policy but that's not true.  If you go to HR, they will handle the situation only if it will not offend the person that you are reporting. They do not pay what the people are worth, they don't give good raises nor do they give good bonuses."

good,"Great place to work, Challenging to say the least. Very flexible. No two days were the same. Management was unorganized. The hardest part of the job was getting management support. The most rewarding part of the job was the workplace culture. Friendly and laidback environment."
good,"Worked with engineers helping provide them sources for components to support the new design project. Procured prototype components for all aspects of this design project. I had the opportunity to enhance and improve my project management skills. Management and culture changed from family environment to all about the business, did not care as much about the workers as in the past. I really enjoyed working with my co-workers and teammates."

good,"Benchmark was a productive workplace, a great set of people to work with, it was like a family because people have worked together for so long, they care about each other.  Benchmark is the kind of place that will allow growth but only to a certain point, the ones that should be in supervisor positions are not given the chance, but they are the ones that do most of the work without the benefit of receiving the pay that they deserve."

good,"I loved my job, everyone was nice and friendly but then 145 co-workers got let go. They havent hired anybody on in over 10 years."
good,"On a typical day at work I would often be tasked with several areas of production that included, manually loading/unloading the Stress relief chamber of between 6-20, 60 lbs semi-conductor pedestals, Electrically verifying heater insulation utilizing the Fluke meter, MEGOHM, and HIPOT test sets and then test the TIG welds for leakage utilizing the Varian 947D and 979 helium leak detector machines. I worked mostly in conjunction with the weld departments daily production schedule but also volunteered to assist the assembly department with hermetically sealed packaging and detail department with applying 12 grain finish. The hardest part of my day was communicating with the machinist due to the predominately Vietnamese demographic and language differences but the Production supervisor always made a great effort to bridge the communication and everyone got along great as a team. I enjoyed having my own work center and being the lone Leak test technician because it allowed me to prioritize my work based on my knowledge of the processes to get parts moved to the next process. As a result I often exceeded the daily projections which gave me great job satisfaction and bestowed trust from the production supervisor of my input during production meeting."
good,Had lots of overtime and management was not the best. The co-workers were very helpful. Always layoff people.
good,"El salario esta bien, además de que el ambiente laboral también es bueno"
good,"you came to work, did your job, went home. The people were all basically friendly and enjoyable to work with. Being willing to cross train on jobs was a plus. I enjoyed that because it made me more versatile and I wasn't stuck in the same job all the time. It allowed me to move to different parts of the factory and to work with different people. I liked what I did for the most part. Like any job some people were great to work with, others not so much, but management did work with me when people issues became a problem. (i.e. I was moved to another area so I didn't have to work with a particular person because of personality clashes)"

The problem with management there is that we went through 4 supervisor every 6months.The most enjoyable part of the job. Is that I was happy when I got my job done for the day. Even if time was up I would stay late to get the assembly out of the area. I was always working overtime when they asked. My co-workers where good people, we all have are ups and downs. But we always pull togather. The hardest part of the job is when we have to learn something new when they don't want to train you the right way and you have to learn on are own then train other people. I loved working over there for 6yrs. Out of the 6yrs I worked there I learn how to do a lot of stuff. The plant manager will always asked me to go work in other area and I would do that.
