rating,review
bad,"Terible place to work, Human Resources are evil and wicked and management i horrible. They fired people who had been there 15 years wihout any reason and benefits are lousy."
bad,The Corporate Culture for Devon was venomous and cut throat. My last supervisors that I had moved up from different positions and they used to be kind men and then their attitudes changed very significantly and became very arrogant and didn't even acknowledge me as a team member or communicate with me. Other then the pay I wouldn't recommend Devon Energy as a Company to work for unless your willing to play the Corporate games.
bad,"I would rate this as the worst Production company out there. If you want to work with a company and always be in fear of losing your job Devon is the perfect place to work. They are lacking in experience starting at the top ranking potions. they are poised to get people hurt.. They can not follow there on business plan, the worst grouping of inexperienced professionals around."
bad,A lot of back stabbing; low collaboration; low communication; great technology; great oil plays and a lot of capital; nice facility; ruthless HR department with low credibility
bad,"Management needs to be replaced instead of workers."
bad,If you are an honest person that turns in insodents in like you are told they wi find a reason to fire you.  I was with Devon for five years and I do not have a lot of good to say about this company.  It mostly has to do with the Weatherford office and management there.
bad,"This is a cold corporate environment. Potential employees have to submit to frustration during their application and management doesn't really want to be bothered. Their job description is meant to lure good people, but their application methods are demeaning and clumsy. They chase more good people away."
bad,"Family members got the good jobs, back stabbing every time you turn around, was told by supervisor to change consultant firms and when I did my job ended, I was told the job ended but later found out I was let go because I changed consulting firms."
bad,"Ok place to work but you must be among the ""click""  to have a safe job, outside the click there will be a reason to let you go and hire a buddy. (GOOD OL BOY NETWORK)"
bad,"Think twice before working at this company. Management is focused on consensus and getting along. This causes everything to move at a snails pace and progress to be over turned again and again because one person disagrees with the direction. This company does not understand the benefit of discussions and debate. In addition, be aware of the 'good old boy' environment. Advancement and staying power is based on friendships."
bad,A new supervisor came in and statred sending HR around asking different questions. Little did we know the HR and the field superintendent were having an affair. So anyone who said anything negative was laid off.
bad,"Very selfish managers. It felt like a sorority. Some people loved it, my experience was not so pleasant. Some of my co workers quit as well. Very superficial people, it's all about how you dress, what you have. If you are an extrovert you might fit here easier. They promised me that there was advancement in my career and it turned out only if the manager likes you or not."
bad,"This company says lots of good things about how ethical they are, but in reality, contracts are awarded to the one that offers the most kickbacks.  As the oilfield slowed down, people were laid off and the ones left were expected to do as much work. When I was hired in my department, I was the 13th person to report to my manager.  When I left, I was the only person reporting to him.  We were working 6 a.m. to 7 or 8 p.m. 6 days a week.  The pay and benefits were outstanding, but not a place to work if you want to have any type of personal life."
bad,"Sadly, in Canada at least, Devon has eroding assets and an ever more toxic corporate culture. It has gone downhill the last 2 years and morale is at an all time low. In short, the best and brightest mostly left with the divest to CNRL in 2014. The leadership that remains is on an isolated island from the rest of the staff and has some gaping holes in both their capability and experience. Pockets of quality people and good leadership remain but are getting scarce. Should you choose to go there, expect the classic 'clan and hierarchy' structure and be prepared to silence any constructive critiques you may have."
bad,management and panel operators get retention bonus. the rest get 0. equal bull. like one manager said we can get monkeys to run plant. well have not seen them there yet. maybe he was referring to his siblings or family.  flights given to B.C. and Alberta workers rest get your own way to work. then they preach safety on the highways. lots of favoritism.
bad,"A typical day at work would be to pull files research them on the various links. Than printing out a label and putting it on the files than taking them to scanning. I learned different document types. I had two very helpful co-workers. The hardest part of my job was being underestimated due to my age. The job itself was easy to learn and over all fun due to the fact of researching, and being able to feel like I had accomplished a lot with the files iI had finished that very day."
bad,If you're looking for a career where what you do actually matters to your manager don't work here.  They layoff people continually due to the poor choices of executives.
bad,"paid good, no support, no loyalty to employees. dangerous environment. no recognition for time with company, laid off so buddies could keep their job."
bad,"When a company pledges to lead it's industry in new technology adoption, but simply throws technology at a problem instead of cultivating the cultural, process, people issues that are inherent in such a bold pledge, the company is very difficult to take seriously. Add in poor leadership cohesion, no federated direction, and biased/insulated technology leaders, and you get a company that should put itself out of its misery."
bad,Pay is great. co workers are terrible. cannot think of any thing enjoyable about it. there is no structure with in this company
bad,lot of things not revealed until hired... then assets were sold after a year of me being there. Picked up knowledge within industry that I had seeked but it was rough getting it
bad,"The stock market does not like Devon for a reason.  Very high on G & A with very little to show for it.  Horrible money management and poor vision for the future.  Now they are laying off people thinking it will help wall street like them more, but management is the issue and we all know it."
bad,"So far off regular enviromental and safety practices,  was nervous every day working at site.    unsafe practices were an everyday occurance"
bad,"Lacks true vision and employees are treated terribly. It was great for a couple years, then layoffs have completly destroyed the company's moral. All of the good employees are leaving at alarming rates."
bad,"I am only typing this review because indeed will not allow me to move on without it.  Therefore, I am just type type typing away.  I am nearly there, and there is the 150 char limit"
bad,No security in job. Always wondered if I was going to keep my job even during the good times. I wouldn’t recommend this job if your family relies on oil and gas to live.
bad,"It was a great work Experience at Devon, lots of opportunity to learn and grow in the career. Positive team work and good coordination and very flexible in adverse natural calamities"
bad,"Productive and fun place to work with a ping pong table, Everyone was very nice and respectful, they only talk bad about you behind your back."
bad,"Devon offers great training, benefits, and compensation. Aside from that, I lack to find positives. Too much management that has now authority to make decisions. No vision for the future. No accountability. Overall, a toxic culture to work in at the moment. Devon is stuck in between being a small company and a big company and doesn’t know what to do. Changes are implemented and then dropped in 6 months. They need to figure out a vision and stick to it. "
bad,worked for few year in the thermal side of Devon Canada.
bad,It was an ok place to work with decent compensation but overall the work environment and constant worry about having a job the next week was too much stress.  Devon is not the place to work if you plan on working somewhere to retire at.
bad,"It used to be a fun, happy and productive place to work, but after some people left, especially some team leaders left , the culture went to down the average ! There was competing or finger pointing or complaining ,  but not cooperation and teamwork! Some  team worker was so selfish, cold hearted, no caring at all and lots of back stabbing, or trying to give bad or difficult time behind! No common rule for each one, so no fairness there,  like covering the corresponding course tuition : some people got covered , so they could move faster by taking part in  courses in school!  A lot of politics , same mistake , but not same treatment for different people ! the culture not for getting work  or company business  better , but worse! So glad left!"
bad,Very volatile day at work with an ever changing environment.  Lots of meetings and little time to work.  I have learned a lot about Supply Chain and Project Management.
good,"I started out working in completions. I was asked to fill in as a lease operator when another lease operator left. I was asked to help out in the DSC room when one of the operators quit. Several months later they asked me to work cathodic protection. Everytime I was asked to moved to help out, the training was self taught. I was the jack of all trades. They sold the field office in June and discarded and treated people like garbage. Ever wonder why they spend so much money of PR? Devon is in for the ivory tower downtown. Field people are inconsequential"
good,Procurement Culture is heavily business unit based. I learned a lot about facility and pipeline construction.
good,"Working as a contract inspector in my key rule, a typical day would consist of going or spread sheets to prioritize jobs by government due dates. Coordinate contractors work load. Coordinate contractor bids. Estimate projects for engineers to create WBS/AFE for projects. Stop by crews go over job scope and safety. Phone or field meetings with BLM and State inspectors. Complete daily reports email reports. Work place as a contractor very fast passed. My supervisor was up to speed at tried to create a good work culture for the group. Hardest part of job was driving in high traffic area lots of miles and wear on personal vehicles. Best part of my job was reclamation, reclaiming old locations back to natural land contour and seeing vegetation return. Learning curve for me was timing of planting due to desert environment. Learned a lot in respect to battery removal."
good,"To be fair, I worked here during the trough of the oil recession and was laid off along with almost the entire team. However, the culture and management was terrible even when the economy was booming. Countless ethical and legal violations."
good,Working at Devon in the field is awful.  When I moved here everyone said Devon was the place to work and that is the company to work for in Oklahoma.  Working for Devon in Stillwater was the worst company I have every worked for.
good,Great company heading in the wrong direction;
good,You have to remember that this is an oilfield company.  This is not a career oriented field and the market goes up and down.  It was fun while it lasted.
good,"Started my career with a company where you felt valued and were proud to call Devon your place of work. Slowly changed over time and you became a number. The people were great, but management needs help in clarifying development for employees and direction for the departments. Devon also has a bad case of the ""good old boy"" system."
good,"Devon was an excellent place to work, but the new management has driven down stock price with little reward for the stock buy back."
good,"Great compensation and benefits. Period. Unfortunately in IT, there are major management issues. They have a lot of communication break downs in the chain of command. Also, a lot of architecture decisions are made at the Director level and pushed down from a ""just make this happen"" level with no input from those that have to maintain or manage the infrastructure."
good,"Typical day includes reviewing outage reports, working with other groups to address communication issues and needs.  Obtaining funding to install new hardware."
good,"This is a great company if the following never happened:"
good,Dramatically shrinking company. Many waves of layoffs. The company is having difficulty finding a direction. Large turnover of people and management exacerbate this problem.
good,"I loved the people I worked with and the pay was great. Everything else was disappointing, especially management and company direction. Devon could not weather the oil downturn like other companies."
good,I only worked at Devon as Temp in their Accounting Department.  From what I could tell from the short period I was there was that as it is in the oil and gas industry there are frequent layoffs or rearrangement of personnel.  Pay is not what it should be for a company the size of Devon.
good,This was a great place when I started in 2014. Since then the culture has changed drastically and well stinks. Managers pit employees against each other. Collaboration doesn’t happen. No one can make a decision. Everything has to go through a bazillion layers of management to get done. Managers play favorites in a serious way. The last round of layoffs was the nail in the coffin. Basically cleared out all the experience and kept the youngins with lower salaries. I am 29 yrs old. There’s hardly anyone left older that I can learn from. That’s a huge problem.
good,"Devon is currently trying to figure out who they are. Several rounds of layoffs and constant pruning of staff otherwise has sapped morale. Great if you work Delaware or STACK, frustrating to be in other units."
good,"It is obvious that Devon is going to be completely outsourced in the near future.  Poor management decisions and the inability to listen has contributed to Devon's stock price being so low.  No change is expected in the near future.  Reducing headcount is not fixing the problem,  just making the company even more management heavy. "
good,"Devon was five years behind in technology from my previous employer.  They had dated procedures and software.  My productivity suffered by nearly 30% due to this."
good,"It's life in the oilfield, there is a roller coaster ride of emotions and and job stability. New field structure removes any chance of furthering knowledge or advancement."
good,"The culture is great to work in but some wrong leadership is promoted which causes work/life/health issues. "
good,"This is a company stuck in 1988, and it shows. Dress codes and clock-watching people with professional degrees were more important than developing efficient business processes and training new hires. The pay and benefits are good, despite the ongoing commodity price problems plaguing the industry; but round after round of layoffs have made the entire corporate staff strung out, stressed, and demoralized."
good,The best part of Devon Energy is the people.  The coworkers make the job enjoyable and fun.  Things can get mundane just like any other job but the people keep you coming back.
good,Wish they would have stayed in our area! The best company I’ve worked for til this day! Upper management only cared about themselves. No loyalty when it came to cuts
good,"When I first started and for the first 2-3 years I loved my job. I had a good boss, no micro managing, great benefits and a real employee and family feel. Toward the end and leading up to the lay off the benefits where being cut yearly, no bonuses, no raises very poor management."
good,"Great benefits and comp but no work/life balance. My duties included: "
good,"I greatly enjoyed my work place and the people I worked with. Unfortunately given the state of oil and gas at this time, no job security."
good,"I worked at Devon for seven years, and at my performance review at the end of each, I asked for more challenge and responsibility. Not once was my request addressed - so I maintained a flat trajectory for the duration of my work life there. Work/life balance? Salary? Fantastic. Job satisfaction and management? Not so good."
good,A very good company to work with. It is nice being part of the SAp implementation project at Devon.
good,Just had a bad manager.  Never been so micromanaged in my life. Had to track ever part of my day and met with my manager every morning to go over the previous day.
good,All companies have positives and negatives.  Devon is no different.  They are internally focused and don't always see things as they are seen from an external viewpoint.
good,"Devon Energy is all talk when it comes to any diversity and inclusion program. Be careful not to speak too much of your mind if you're more liberal. They come off as cool and innovative, but it's going to be several years before things really start to change for the better around there."
good,When I first started working for Devon It was a great place to work. Then layoffs happened and it went all down hill. Work Work Work. Also the people are so judgmental.
good,I loved all of the people I worked with on a daily basis but upper management always kept us in a state of flux with pending or possible cutbacks.  This led to a constant sense of dread and too many rumors.
good,"Allocated Oil and Gas for Offshore Leases.  Reported to Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Montana of the company production of water, oil, gas."
good,I loved the work I did in Administration.  Before that I was in Accounts Payable where only 3 people handled the invoices.  Very stressful.  Overload.
good,"Devon was a good company, and even though my first line manager was substandard, by and large the organization was well-meaning and worked hard.  The atmosphere was low stress, yet still encouraged people to think outside the box."
good,"Atmosphere is friendly, benefits were great, but the leadership in certain departments was non existent. Lack of leadership made it hard to work with other departments, teamwork was not evident."
good,"Loved working for this company.  The pay was great, the benefits were great and you were allowed a lot of freedom.  The gas price drop in 09 changed the culture a lot and it stays the same today. You now worry about your job every day, and they just laid off 100 people last year at this time."
good,"hard to get schools for new devices, expected to figure issues out without input from management."
good,"team work."
good,"This company has for years been rated for as a great place to work. I would say that is true for experienced hires. Otherwise, it is a coin toss based on where you work."
good,"Devon is a good place to work, but no longer have my services.  I learned valuable lessons at Devon I can apply to my next Job."
good,"worked long hours, chasing rigs. fabricating, welding structural and pressure. People seemed nice and fairly organized. Pay was good. Was hoping to continue working for them in the future. Hardest part was the amount of hours I worked."
good,"Work with good people who appreciate hard work and dedication.  Also work under some members of management who even though they are not involved in the day to day duties, don't listen to those who perform those duties.  My immediate supervisors were very appreciative and worked well as a team to accomplish projects."
good,"This company put on airs of being one of the very best to work for, but this is not the case.  The working atmosphere is very negative and management is very poor.  The work life balance is terrible and the phrase ""evertime is expected"" is used all too often."
good,Devon energy allowed me to be me. I was free to train in my style and allow me to control my class in the way I see fit. It was an awesome opportunity.
good,"Standard office environment, corporate culture and good people to work with. Job was extremely normal in all respects, nothing flashy or difficult to accomplish, though dull at times."
good,I felt like a number instead of an employee. Had supervisors and managers that were easily directed in wrong direction for the company.
good,"Onsite well supervision. All facets of drilling, on your own hands on type situation. Very knowledgeable company ownership. Worked daily with drilling contractors without problem. The hardest part is and will always be, being away from home. Most enjoyable is the sense of accomplishment at the end of every well."
good,"The benefits are among the best I've seen. However, the crunch management has started placing on employees made work more difficult and stressful. The cuts in staff force those remaining to take on much more work."
good,"great place to work, but never at home.co- workers we great people.I worked with and trained new employees when needed. They have a good safety program.Devon was bought out by BP and I was not offered a job at BP"
good,I learned about Cisco Unity Communication Management tool and many other skills.  There was never a typical day at work.  Always something new or unique.  My co-workers were great to be around and supportive.  There was was no hardest or most enjoyable part of the job.  It was always interesting and growing experience.
good,Enjoyed the job and the people I worked with. Upper Management did not seem to exhibit the same culture that they attempted to project.
good,I learned a lot about IT and how it operates. They provided me the ability to build a world class data center with little interference. Hardest part of the job was creating the group and all the documents required to operate.
good,"I used to think this was a great place to work, but I've lost confidence in the way the company's being managed.  I've been in oil & gas IT since leaving college over 20 years ago, but never until coming to Devon nearly 8 years ago have I had to face down the threat of major layoffs.  TWICE now in as many years."
good,"Input files into computer, where the clients would be able to locate the files when ever they needed to work with a partictual file. Oil and Gas files."
good,"The work is great, but the employees and management do not like outsiders. The handling of my transfer was sloppy and rushed to where I almost went broke working there."
good,"WAS a great company; Hopefully it will be again."
good,Always had professional catering for their meetings.  Great people. They compensated well. Safety department was proactive in dealing with any safety issues that needed addressing.
good,"My experience at Devon, while working as a Cost Analyst for their contractor on various well pad modules, was positive & professional, one that exhibited mutual respect and a desire to complete projects on time and within the desired scope."
good,Good local company to work for. The culture and the people make it a great place to be and surround yourself with. They actively contribute to the community and encourage volunteer opportunities throughout the year.
good,"Company has a nice restaurant and coffee shop in the main lobby.  Facilities are beautiful, clean and well maintained.  Free parking downtown.  Nice park across the street."
good,"Could have been a great company, but turned out just like most oil industry companies, no company loyalty to employees, were workers ideas are exploited by lower management, then good employees are terminated/laid off."
good,"Stable job with good training, good benefit package, team environment, monthly safety meetings to discuss and resolve issues, good bonuses."
good,Great place to work...enjoyed the family atmosphere and the challenge of new exciting opportunities...great place to work in OKC.
good,I had to opportunity to work alongside some very good consultants who taught me strategies that I can employ in my directional drilling career.
good,"Promotes learning and trusts employees with challenging work."
good,This company is highly regarded in the industry and I have thoroughly enjoyed my limited time here
good,Great place to work with excellent pay and benefits. Co-workers are like family at this workplace and the building is beautiful.
good,"""Old"" Devon was a fun place to work. These days there is a lot of fear of layoffs, no upward mobility, no room for challenging status quo. Lots of benefits still to be had but things have changed."
good,Working for Devon was good I felt secure and the benefits were great.  One of the few problems I had was I felt they were very focused on what went on at the headquarters for PR and not so much at the satellite offices.
good,The culture and leadership has taken a dive the last 3 years but still a great place to work. Opportunities to advance are few and far between if you aren’t one of the “chosen” ones.
good,"Interaction with landmen and outside landmen, approved land leases, spoke with royalty customers, etc.  Interacted with both inside and outside contractors."
good,Management has changed but benefits are still among the best in the industry. Paid time off is excellent and so is the health benefits. Management is selling off too many properties.
good,"Paid very well, along with great benefits package. Safety is priority at Devon which was great! Worked a ton of hours, work life balance poor at times in the winter"
good,Devon is great when the industry is doing well.   Best part of this company is the people it hires.   The friends made are invaluable and irreplaceable.
good,I loved my job. Sadly it ended too soon . I would go back if they would consider rehiring me . I started as a senior staff and promoted before the end of the day to Lead Accountsnt and stayed there in that position until the layoff .
good,"Devon is great place to work and offers great benefits to their employees. I have learned a lot about the oil & gas industry during my time here in upstream, downstream and midstream."
good,while at the company they were willing to let you cross train in the different aspects of completion Work letting you learn and grow
good,"A typical day started with booting up my computer and checking me dashboard to see how many invoices were in my queue to be coded.  Most of the time I would be done coding by lunch time  Then I spent the rest of the afternoon offering assistance to other people in the office.  On days that they didn't have anything for me to work on, I would spend the afternoon taking online training courses through Devon's educational site."
good,Devon Energy has a lot of superb drilling professionals and is a great atmosphere. Their commitment to safety looks and sounds good when discussed publicly. Their commitment is only superficial and does not meet the corporate goals of an incident free workplace. Safety is discussed in every meeting but there is no genuine commitment to safety and there is still an obvious diconnect between operations and EHS.
good,"On the whole Devon is a great company, at the department level it can be hit and miss. With the recent growth many managers have been promoted well beyond their capability."
good,"oilfield based company, fluctuates with oil price along with ups and downs that follow, good paying company and very involved in the community. training programs, paid college, travel, boot and clothing allowance"
good,Devon continues to find the right size of employee to run their company.  Often difference organization have completing goals that contradict each other.
good,Company feels like a major corporation but is really a small company. I would recommend you have experience when working for Devon. People really know their job here.
good,"I liked the job but the oil industry crashed in 2016. I only met my direct supervisor. I crunched numbers from home. I worked on my own time sometimes until four in the morning, sometimes half a day. I was just required to get the projects given done, by X-day. I have worked on call 24/7 since 1980. I am not a good sleeper because of that life."
good,"I worked in the off-site records firm and we handled relocations to different sites and early exits from the company. We would take accounts and belongings from employees at Houston site and transition them to the OKC downtown site, or we would perform exit services, closing out their tenure with Devon. It was a lot of responsibility to be entrusted to a temporary worker and I thank them for giving me a great experience , even if it was just for a short time. The culture was great, it was laid back but focused with very flexible hours. I could arrive and begin working at 7 a.m. take a 30 minute lunch and leave by 330 if I chose. It was great. The only con was it was sometimes boring but that is any job. I recommend Devon 100%"
good,Devon Energy was a good company to work for until they closed the Houston Office. I enjoyed working there.  The people were wonderful. The gym that was installed for the employees had the best workout equipment.
good,"I was under a contract when working for Devon.  They had new software they wanted to roll-out.  I installed cable and video equipment in the conference room for the safety videos for their team to review.  "
good,Devon is a good company to work for and has a great culture. I had friends in various departments and based on the feedback I received from them it really depends on your manager to create the right environment. I had some challenges especially when it came to goal setting and department direction but overall I enjoyed working there.
good,"My day might consist of records management, SAFE Program training, issuing or replacing fleet vehicles for field employees, Alert Response team training or fire drill.  No micromanaging; flourished in this environment.  Employees helped each other.  Good compensation."
good,Great senior management and CEO. Would have been good if the integrity was able to filter further down to the senior manager level.
good,Good place to work. Technical G&G teams. Asset teams enjoyable to work with Challenging projects. encouraged innovation and implementation of new technology as justified. Great resources for job requirements and performance. great IT staff. .
good,"I enjoyed my time there, and had lots of exposure to projects & products - however being an Oil & Gas Company their primary focus was definitely NOT Information Technology."
good,I enjoy going to work as everyday I learn something new. The people on my team mentor and are very supportive. The company encourages education and growth.
good,"I received a great performance review every year with bonuses.  The training, facilities and fitness club there was first class.  Devon has grown into one of the finest workplaces in the world.  A typical day at work for me started at 7:00 a.m. the atmostphere was hushed and no one freely communicated or talked to each other in our department..  There was a job to do, we knew our job and we set down to do it.  There were many changes happening during the SAP implementation so our jobs changed on a regular basis adding more and more work.  The stress level was incredibly tough and we worked many long hours and some weekends to ge the job done."
good,"The work day was very busy.  The company strived for excellence.  "
good,Work all day then work all night shift work all was well until they sold out. They gave me a great severance and away I went. learn a lot was a goodJob.
good,"Great place to work, safe, productive and fun. Great management, excellent co-workers. Excellent compensation packages with PTO, Healthcare coverage, vision, dental and wellness incentives."
good,"Work directly with the engineer to layout the work schedule for the week.  Then I was free to wok at my own pace and ask any questions as needed.  Devon provided with many training opportunities to increase efficiencies and knowledge gained.  The people were all great to work with and were always welcoming.  The most difficult part for me was obtaining enough information about the facilities in order to do my job successful.  I mostly enjoyed getting to know all the various types of people, making new friends and working together to finish a project on time!"
good,"Great place to work,  learned a lot about horizontal and vertical wells.  Along with battery management, well production.  The most enjoyable part of Devon was the comradery with my co-workers, and the best way to describe our environment would be competitive fun."
good,Great place to work but newly created department heads and its employees need to be accountable to the bottom line. Unfortunately corporate feels these newly created departments streamline the organization but does not realize how unproductive they are. Their department managers and assistant managers need to be held  accountable for expenses associated with projects in the respective field they support including contractor expenses they farm work out they should be doing themselves.
good,"Private offices for professionals, tuition reimbursement, good salary, opportunities for travel and interface with all levels of employees, great benefits, etc"
good,Great company that takes care of their employees. The benefits and salaries are very competitive. Advancement opportunities if you work hard and take on additional responsibilities.
good,I enjoyed my time at Devon Energy.  Unfortunately oil and gas has its ups and downs.  Compensation was  great as were benefits.  Management seemed fair.  Co-workers were great.
good,Devon was an amazing place to work and treated me very well over the years.  Their management has made some very questionable calls over the years but the employees there treat everyone like family.
good,"Worked shift work, 7 days on, 7 days off. Did 12 hour shifts, so the days were long, but they went fast as I enjoyed my job. We had a good work environment, and had facilities after work for recreation. I personally enjoyed playing hockey with my fellow employees and squash."
good,I spent 15 years working for this company.  Devon Energy is a company that hires talented individuals and maintains positive goal oriented atmosphere.  It was a challenging and rewarding experience.
good,Daily safety meeting were held by myself at 5:30 AM and 5:30 PM where in instructed rig crews only daily safety procedures related to the days activities. I oversaw the daily activities as well as daily rig audits.
good,"In the oil and gas industry, IT is looked at more as a cost center than a value add. While that view is changing slowly, it's still not that uncommon to hear ""you don't need a computer to get oil out of the ground."" "
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was making certain that the data could be readily obtainable to the business users.
good,"Very Busy atmosphere, meetings, reports, calculations, job decisions, prioritize tasks, very nice office and fun employees to work with."
good,"Its a rotating shift work with 12 hours per shift, 28 days rotation. I learned Natural Gas process from wells to sales. The management were nice, they are very concerned about safety of individual. My mentors were great, taught me safety procedures, like doing repairs. They are very supportive. Hardest part of the Job is you have to work in any type of weather condition but I dont mind it. The most enjoyable part of this job is everyday challenge. You have to use all your senses."
good,"Great working environment, Culture and insane employee benefits"
good,"Great company if you are a permanent employee. But if you are a contract worker, you are treated like a second class citizen, at best. Contractors be warned!!"
good,Was on a two week rotation they were willing to work with employees on time off and switching hitches. Management was easy to get along with. Home time was great.
good,Really a decent place to work...you'll never get rich working for devon but you won't go hungry either. Management was a close knit group but they were pretty good at their job
good,"The fun never stops at Devon. Depends on what u call fun. Lots of work, great pay and compensation though. It can be a stressful job at times but that’s the oilfield."
good,Worked with mostly professional colleagues who were dedicated to Devon's mission daily. Workplace culture was relaxed and where everyone was encouraged to voice their ideas and concerns. Company is dedicated to adding shareholder value. It also strongly supports charitable and environmental causes and is widely viewed as a great corporate neighbor.
good,My experience was not typical due to low oil prices and downsizing. Whole departments and floors experienced layoffs. The atmosphere was tense and as too often the blame-game creates a culture of fear. It is the nature of the industry.
good,Devon was a great place to work.  When the layoff occurred things changed and was done incorrectly according to the majority.  Overall great place. Just not very open management.
good,"I enjoyed many years at Devon Energy. I would go back to work for them given the right opportunity. As with most corporate environments it could be extremely fast-paced, but the compensation was great."
good,"This company provided excellent benefits, concern for the environment and raised money for the local United Way by holding events like lunches, clay shooting and auctions matching what was raised locally.  They also held family oriented events throughout the year."

good,"Was a great company in the beginning.  After company layoffs, company started to fall apart. Very poor management in some areas. There are still some great people there."
good,"Great oil and gas company providing good benefits, work atmosphere, and good perks (gym, restaurants, free coffee and tea).  I was very happy while working for them for over 10 years."
good,"Fun place to work a lot of hard work when its needed, but pretty laid back and fun place when everything is running smooth. I learnt a lot about my field not really from the company but mostly from the people that work there. They have a desire to teach those who are willing to learn. The hardest part of the job is working nights, it really throws your sleep pattern off. The pay is definitely the best part of the job. Because it is fly in and out they really compensate you well in that aspect."
good,"Is a great place to work, you have your goals established, you have your boss support, job and life balance is great. You are surrounded by professional colleges, people with good experience and knowledge"

good,"The company itself was very employee oriented and health conscious. I answered phones and provided trouble shooting for technical issues via phone, web, email, and chat"
good,"I was a geologist at Devon. I had a great income with great benefits. However, at the same time, I had to earn that income by putting in extra hours each day and some weekend and overnight work was required. Overall it was a great place to work with nice people, but at times I did feel like I was just a number."
good,"Start my day. Drive to my sour plant. Walk through plant. If nothing pressing go review wells on SCADA. Then do dailly books and plan day. Winter time alot of dealing with hydrates using all methods. Changing particle and coal filters. Dealt with water plant at camp..Operated turbines, wakashaws,and ajax..Taken many courses through Devon. Well and compressor optimization. Trouble shooting catydines..countless saftey courses.."
good,"The amazing culture of improvement at Devon was a huge plus. Training was not frowned upon at Devon. Managers encouraged employees to take a certain number of necessary courses per year. Also Devon provided reimbursement for employees that wanted to attend Universities for continual education. At times, the company even allowed for using company hours to attend those courses."
good,"Overall, I loved working at Devon. I would return if I had the chance. Daily activities were as expected, and it was a great environment. There were great community service opportunities. Devon does offer severance pay, which is great given the volatility of the oil and gas industry."
good,"Devon Canada is a great place to work.   In my opinion, it's one of the few places that lives up to its values and the people working there largely reflect those values."
good,Great culture and work life balance.  Gym is nice to have on site. Covered parking.  Easy access to lots of downtown events. Lots of learning opportunities.
good,I enjoyed my employment at Devon. Not only were the people good to work with but the culture was one to keep you around. I always felt my work was appreciated.

good,Enjoyed my time there. I love the balance and what the company offers for their employees.  They understands how value you are withe the company  home life.
good,Great benefits and flex work week. People are really great to work with but shift in upper management has changed the structure of Devon where management decides business implementation without a lot of input from the end users or people it directly affects. Major issues of data management and coordination and communication through business units.
good,"devon was a great company with solid plans in place.  They were fair in all aspects, great people to work with.  I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,A great place to work. Not sure if all management is highly trained to be promoted as managers. Constantly changing environment. The right opportunities are available for those who catch the eye of the right manager. Corporate culture is positive.
good,A typical day at work consisted of checking 50+ gas wells. I maintained production while working safely. I learned to be a team member and manage time efficelently. the most enjoyable part of my job was working outside and getting my work done!! Management was great and I got along well with others.

good,Devon has an excellent work environment and you always feel your input matters.
good,"I was very productive at Devon. There was never a day when I was twiddling my fingers. Great people to work with. Unfortunately, there are some managers who should not be in their current role. Most of the managers are very knowledgeable and will go out on a limb for you. Others will just push their work on you at the last minute and really wont address problems to you, rather to other people and hopefully you are in good with them to find out"
good,* Typical day envolves happy employees who always have smiles on their faces and are willing to help.
good,"Unfortunately, Devon has decided to close the Houston office and I did not want to relocate to Oklahoma City. I supported the Business Continuity department for the past 4 years and also supported the company as a Life Safety first responder."
good,Very good working environment.
good,Great management teams that cares about each employee's future. Awesome place for growth opportunities if interested to relocate to OKC. My overall experience with Devon compared to other companies I have worked for exceeds and sets the tone for top 5 best place to work.
good,Excellent people
good,A Great Company to work for with great benefits and flexible schedule. they care for your family and support you during difficult times. I enjoyed my time there but I was looking for stability.
good,"Good teams to work, Great learning, Fun at work, not much pressure, people are helping nature. "

good,I enjoyed my time at Devon.  Management was pretty much hands off and let you do your job.  Great team work and environment.  Great compensation and benefits.
good,Devon's a great place to work. The people and facility are top notch.  The down side is the stability of the oil and gas industry right now.

good,"This is an excellent company to work for.  They have a very good work life balance, and is very competitive with total compensation across the industry."

good,"Devon Energy is an overall excellent company who values the opinions of their employees."
good,"Devon Energy was a great place to work, I enjoyed going there everyday. I had great joy in working close with my co-workers and my daily duties.  On a typical day I helped run a Mail department with the utmost integrity and efficiencies to ensure other departments received their correspondence's in a timely manner to aid in their efficiencies.  The hardest part of my job was learning the multiple pieces of mail the arrives in a company of this magnitude and maintaining the many sorting guides as the company was constantly moving employees around."
good,Devon Energy gave me my first landjob being a Landman. I started off not knowing a thing about the industry and I was trained thoroughly within 3 months to run basic mineral title. By the time I left (1 year or so) I could complete drill site title with little to no help. I would not have been able to do the amount and quality of work without the training they gave me. Everyone was very nice at the office and willing to help. Job security is above average with Devon and their brokers but it is still the oil and gas industry and if you have ever worked in the field then you know it is volatile. The culture is cut-throat due to the money at steak. Although they are nice at the office I would not want to make anyone's life harder that is above me for fear of losing a contract. That aspect of the job is just about the same wherever you go.
good,"Devon Energy has been an excellent place to work. In my three years of experience here, I have met many extraordinary professionals that have not only been mentors, but friends. I love working at Devon Energy and being a part of this great company. I'm currently seeking advancement in my career and hoping to add value and success in the next phase of my path."

good,"I enjoyed my time at Devon. I learned a lot from experienced employees who were team players and always willing to help and share experience. "
good,Productive and very knowledge work place to work for. Everyone was very respectable and got along with everyone. The hardest thing that I experience was working with people that were negative . I like working with positive people. Devon cared very much for the welfare of their employees.
good,Treat their employees well. Plenty of opportunities for advancement.
good,"The team at Devon Energy is pretty awesome, they are very professional, cooperative and very passionate. They are flexible with employees and the management listens to the employees. Overall very good work culture and good work and personal life balance."
good,"Collaborative environment, supports people, such as e-professionals, in their individual and cooperative work. It is simply teamwork taken to a higher level."
good,"Amazing company with amazing pay/benefits. People that worked there were great, and the work was interesting. Unfortunately, the oil bust forced the company to cut back a lot, including headcount reductions. But boom and bust is the nature of the oil industry."
good,I learned a lot about the Oil & Gas industry through networking and classes available to move forward in the company The CEO would also allow you to provide idea to make the company better.
good,Devon energy is a fantastic company that really tries to provide the best environment for its employees. With the down turn of oil the environment has definitely gotten worse but they are still a great company.
good,"A typical day involved answering lots of emails from teammates, clients, etc, as well as looking over documents, planning, and attending team meetings."
good,Enjoyable atmosphere to work in.  I am happy to work for this company and hope to continue to for multiple years.  Even if I go to another company at some point I will remember the lessons I learned while working here and apply them to new positions.
good,"Even though Devon is a large corporation, it is a great place to work. They care so much about their employees and have so many extras available."
good,Decent company to work for. Difficult to understand management structure and system. Too many middle management non-decision makers to effectively run business. Overall upper management was good to work for.
good,"I spent 12 years at Devon Energy in various roles in the Project Management office."
good,"Devon was also a fun place to work in, no one chatting in the hall ways and people spoke low tone it was a quiet environment to work in. People were friendly see you down the hall way immediately greet you and wishing you a nice day. Overall, a rather professional setting to work."
good,"Arrive to the office in Calumet OK at the processing plant, check in with my supervisor make sure he didn't anything before leaving to check the stations assigned to me."
good,"Great place to work, just not as a contractor. Recommend going for full-time position. Great benefits and compensation, just watch for oil downturn..."
good,Opportunities for growth were available. Most managers were encouraging and had an open door policy. Writing your own review was a difficult task twice a year.
good,"Enjoyed working as a contractor with this company, other contractors where great. Always had the completion superintendent always threatening and causing problems between the co-workers. When you needed to talk with him he'd never answer his phone. But other wise I would make my home at this company. Waiting for these elections to get over to see where the USA heads."
good,"I love it! Great job, wonderful people for the most part. It's a very laid back place, as long as your getting your work done."

good,"Over the years of work with Devon I was given the opportunity to expand on my role and thus learning new skills and advancing my career. I expanded my SAP knowledge base, learned the new skills/roles and aspects of Oil and Gas. Devon has been hands down the best company I have ever worked for in the Oil and Gas Sector and beyond. I took on many roles as the business would realign through divest and lay offs. The people were the best part, great group of staff. Due to my many roles I was working at full capacity for over 2 years, and the hardest part was trying to take the time for a lunch break."
good,"Permitted Federal/State permits in Permian New Mexico."
good,"Great place to work.  Demanding, but rewarding.  Was promised that our office was safe from closure, yet that is what happened.  Great team to work with and I learned a lot.  I would recommend this company merely for the benefit package alone."
good,"The Devon culture is second to none, and the benefits package is tremendous. The Oil and Gas industry is very cyclical, which makes job security an issue in the lean times."
good,"Great company with very good employees. "
good,Best job I've had. Avg Salary is over 160K a year. Only bad part is working in Oklahoma City. Company realizes how bad that is though and pays more to try to compensate for it.

good,"Although some of the leadership practices were stuck in the 20th century, Devon was a great place to work. Devon greatest attribute is their people. The level of respect and help from co-workers was amazing!"
good,"Great place, however totally dependent on commodity prices. Currently, oil and gas is going through a tough time with low prices."

good,Leaving Devon to go to work for Well Master is very close to the top of the list of things I wish I had never done.
good,"This is my opportunity to give back, just a little, to a company that supported me and my family through some very difficult times. Special thanks has to go out to the entire team in HR. their structured, and very kind approach to dealing with tough situations makes a huge difference. Mostly though, it’s the people around you, your team, that contribute to success in all endeavours."
good,One of the top companies to work for in the Oklahoma City area. Very competitive and challenging environment.  The environment is constantly changing and very demanding but is also rewarding. The facility is one of the nicest and high tech locations in Oklahoma City.  I enjoy the challenges and variety in the IT department that requires constant learning and training to meet technical updates.
good,"Best Company that I have ever worked for. Took great care of their employees and great culture to work with. Yearly review on your progress, the more time you work during the year, the better the bonus when the company is doing well."
good,"Great job, great benefits, fun people, nice equipment. Lots of training, just no advancement if the field you work in goes up for sale. Just looking for something new, moving to Casper."

good,"Loved working for Devon. Has many perks for employees, but I was offered a job with a much higher salary elsewhere.  The department I was in was not competitive salary-wise to other companies, but if I had a chance to work there again, I would take it.  I left on good terms with the company."
good,As a production operator at Devon you maintain production of oil and natural gas wells and attend many safety meetings which can be boring sometimes and very informative other times.

good,"Devon is a fantastic place to work. Work life balance is great, compensation is remarkable, and the company likes getting ideas from it's employees.  I would recommend to anyone."

good,"Devon is a great place to work. There has been a recent shift from a corporate dictation philosophy to a field/common sense philosophy. It has been refreshing. The corporate point of view is a necessity and is important to what we do. The inclusion of the field in all aspects and teamwork between corporate and the field has made Devon a better and more efficient company. The compensation is fair, work/life balance is great and there are plenty of great people, managers and relationships. I would recommend Devon to anyone who is looking to work for a solid company with talented employees of exceptional character. We no longer do things just because that's how they've always been done. Everything is up for debate now and needs to be able to withstand the vetting and scrutiny through the lenses of common sense and efficiency. Now, the best idea wins, regardless of who's idea it was. You'd be a fool to not want to work for Devon."
