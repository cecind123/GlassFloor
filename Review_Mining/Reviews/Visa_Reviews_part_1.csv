rating,review
bad,"They presented the job as being different from other ""call centers"" however it is not. They lead you to believe you will get ""benefits"" for your hard work however it is the same old matrix as other call centers...it depends on favoritism, and opinions.  I loved assisting the people who called in and felt very appreciated however not by my manager. She seem to be very insecure, and IF you should excel you will not be appreciated but criticized. I was appreciated by the trainers, other staff members, and the evening manager but not my manager. I created a training manual which she tried to take credit for. The only reason I would suggest this company is because of the evening manager, they have great benefits, and some people like ""call centers"". Because of my experiences, I refuse to work at a call center again."
bad,Bad place to work.  Bad management. Unfair bonuses if at all.  No upward mobility.  They hire an H1b contractors for full time position over an equally qualified American.
bad,Being kept in a big box with no escape then you have to find another job which is hard because you can't ever leave . Guards make you feel like a criminal .Do yourself a favor and pass on this work in this environment
bad,Talk about having someone micromanage you  and your every move. It was terrible. You couldn't go and do your job because you were chained to your desk in meetings.
bad,"In my department, I was lied to repeatedly by numerous employees and managers. I would not suggest anyone ever work there.  Not a good experience for me."
bad,Job not applicable to review. Cybersource division not a true representation of Visa corporation as a whole. Inexperienced management that shares inappropriate information and partakes in conversations with employees about confidential information with other colleagues.
bad,"If you are young, energetic, excited, and looking to grow, do not work at Visa. Creativity and innovation do not reside there. Use extreme caution. Time is wasted on jargon and hackneyed POCs and POVs"
bad,"Not a good environment to work, at least the dept I was in - thank goodness it was only a contract role. Don't have a lot of options when your a contractor there, can't use the gym, can't use a lot of their processes to do work."
bad,The job was very stressful and hectic. Managers did not offer and positive reinforcement as an incentive to inspire hard work. Abundant favoritism shown to certain people.
bad,"Not good, strict, not flexible, unyielding company, modern indentured servants at this company................................................."
bad,Lots of improvement with Management needs to happen here other than that the  staff and people are great to work with in the control and badging department
bad,"A typical day at work is to answer calls that come back to back. No time to breathe and no time to regroup without being penalized. Training is short and handled by a team that is not product knowledgeable. Being bilingual is not reinforced for the Spanish speaking representatives nor management. This place is good for the younger inexperienced person who wants to have Visa on his or hers resume. Overall, not enough balance, nor incentives, one has to fight for it all, and results are based on unrealistic criteria."
bad,"Provided support to customers after hours and on weekends.  Resolved problems efficiently and professionally by applying knowledge of software, applications, and hardware"
bad,"Stay away from Visa. It is a big bureaucratic machine that will kill any creativity that you might have. I suspect that within 5 years, or so it will be an irrelevant 'also-run', not a leader as it's been for too long."
bad,Since working here ive been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I was told there is 6month period in between raises ive never recieved one despite me being in good standing in attendance and performance.
bad,"Very poor work culture. There is no work from home, very inflexible and crazy hours for global teams, culture is of course team specific. Buyer beware check before you apply"
bad,No actions will be taken on complaints regardless of it's nature. It's all optics. The middle management is rampant with these attributes and the senior leadership does not care. Extremely hard to work with no clear vision or planning.
bad,"If you ever get in...gain 1-2 years experience and quickly get out. 'Live Free or Die' caption works perfect for this company."
bad,"Joining Visa was the worst career move ever in all my years of being in the workforce. "
bad,Unhealthy Political environment. Especially from Management. Needs improving. The overall work culture needs to change. Unfortunately very little scope for learning.
bad,Hopefully it has changed since management in the Risk division have left the company.  It was rotten all the way to the top and I feel sorry for the companies the three worst offenders are working for now.
bad,"Regardless your skills or achievements, you are simply not allowed to have direct interaction with other teams even though the project requires it. Everything has to go through a FTE. Contractors are clearly treated as secondary citizens at Visa. Such a bad culture!"
bad,You are expected to deliver on vague outcomes.  A typical day starts with boosting your executive management's egos.  Management does not understand financial planning nor understand change management.  This is a payment processing company trying to become a tech giant.
bad,visa is a company that deserves better managers. they would always raise up quality and have us not help the customers. that's why the customers would always complain on the phones when i first started it wasn't like that at first. 2 years later everything has changed. it wasn't about customer service anymore. it was about how many phone calls can we all take in  a day and its very wrong they would want us to be on the phone less than two minutes. when all these customers have questions and need assistance.
bad,"They call for high ethics standards and care for their employees, however this is all not true. In other words, many Managers/senior leaders I know are fake and they treat their staff badly: micro management, disrespectful, controlling, bias, etc. but unfortunately this behavior is tolerated and not monitored by HR or hiring manager. Politics are common thing in Visa. HR are to the side of managers and they dont give any importance to employee's raised issues or concerns. The bottomline, you may be asked to leave right away without any consideration to your loyalty and years of service. Very disrespectful ..."
bad,"Working for Visa was a nightmare. I had a lot of bad days working here which I wont go into detail. Things that stuck in my mind is how everything was run internally, there was no true sense of leadership. No care for their employees, no organization. A lot left to be desired. Other than the big pay upgrade, the only reason I stayed, it was a disaster and really learned what not to look for with my next company. Don't let the big name and most of the reviews on indeed fool you, this is a horrendous company to work for, Ashburn specifically. Please be better informed using Glassdoor.com for a true consensus on being an employ of Visa. Most of the problem stems from management namely namely top tier and their greed and no understanding of how to treat their employees."
bad,"Visa is a very good company to work for IF you are in management. If you're unfortunate enough to be hourly, then you are just another replaceable number who can and will be let go for no warning or reason. "
bad,"I have never worked at a place so discriminating against minorities. the company is extremely toxic. Please do not take my word for it, just ask other of ethnic backgrounds"
bad,"Pros: Good pay and benefits"
bad,ITSM is a joke and many internal processes are still manual.  Excel files in use for system updates.  Very political.  San Francisco contingent stuck in the dark ages and has no experience in other environments.  Very siloed and extremely political.  There is huge inconsistency in management direction and performance management.  No career path.
bad,"I would not recommend this place to work for others. The managers have too much expectation and not respecting the employees. Totally demotivating managers."
bad,It is my opinion that to be in management one should have a genuine concern for people and their well being.  It seemed as if everyone there was looking to move up and self occupied.
bad,WORST JOB EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!! Its like the circle with tom hanks....smh. 1. They DONT pay on time. 2. They are racist and LOVE to stereotype. 3. If you dont Brown Nose you will not last. 4. They are VERY unprofessional. I wouldnt trust these people with my money or personal info.Horrible management. I would not EVER work at the Austin Tx location. Worst job experience so far. They dont even deserve the one star they got.
bad,"Politics plays a huge role in advancement. Also, there seems to be an endless cycle of reorganizations. You never know who will be there one day, gone the next."
bad,"Work long days and expected to be available 24x7 whenever help is needed. When taking vacation time, still had to be available if major issues came up. Lots of vacation time that could be carried over but hard to actually get time off. The pay and benefits were good for the area."
bad,"My Visa experience has varied over the last few years, I was able to move up the ladder (5 levels) and see how each level and position varies throughout the company. "
bad,"Visa offered great material benefits in high wages, commuter benefits, health care...However, their culture and management are totally toxic. The managers do not care about your personal development. I received vague instructions and even people who tried to damage your career. I would not recommend this place."
bad,"It was about 3 years ago when I was working at Visa. There were many fraud cases, and they were all intense. There was the inside job too. The management was also involved in fraud. Even though the work is exciting, there is no place to escalate these fraud cases because managers, directors, former employees were also involved."
bad,"The leadership doesn't know what actually drives the business, and frankly they don't care. It's the most political company I've been a part of, and I hope I never make a mistake like it again."
bad,"Company is in the process of putting profits over employee satisfaction. Company growth will continue, however, they will continue to loose quality employees."
bad,"•	Entail quality calls assuring best professionalism and proficiency while meeting goals and requirements."
bad,"the only good thing at visa is the benifits , nothing else, management is very biasts and based on who is their favorites they pick and choose to get rid of not fair at all"
bad,"Great learning opportunity for beginners but horrible work culture .Sr. management is quite political in nature.This is not a technology company and overall there are no processes and less supportive management.If you believe in saying yes to your boss , no matter what, then you can survive here"
bad,Not so positive and promotion goes to ones that don't work but sit in management's office with tales to tell.  Lack of encouragement and definitely a lot of bullying.
bad,"A few years ago technology lost its way. Now product lost its way. New CEO hasn't drained the swamp, he may be the only one trying to make a change. The rest of the executive group can't figure out how to even spell strategy."
bad,"This employer offers above average pay and benefits. However, the middle management isn't up to the task of managing talent. Manager's insist on daily ego stroking, devalues innovative thinking and is unable to accept an alternative point of view."
bad,When tax season comes around it's a great place to work. A LOT of overtime. that's the good part. The bad Part is everyone can be mean and in your business. Just do your job and you will keep your sanity.
bad,"Management works against you, not with you. Very difficult to move up/around the company. "
bad,"We would pick up work orders for Visa employees and complete IG. raise desk surface, install keyboard tray, fix cubicle, install monitor arm to desk..."
bad,"I loved my job and my co workers, but the way management conducts themselves leaves a lot to be desired."
bad,"gained customer service experience, but the company overall was not a great experience."
bad,"Once upon a time, it was a wonderful place to work but now it's, ugh ugh ,ugly with constant infighting. Visa has changed for the worse over the last few years with never ending rounds of layoffs at the end of each quarter. There is little team building, since you never know if you will have a team there to work with when people you are counting on are suddenly gone,There are still some great people and products but the current CEO and his executive management team is killing off the spirit of what made Visa great."
bad,The upper management is not trained properly on the procedures the agents have to follow so they are not resources you can reach out to if you need help or advice. They also base all of their performance goals off what the client wants and not what is realistically achievable by the agents.
bad,"The technology is good, most of the people are good but top level management really need to listen. They think they're doing a lot better than they actually are. Generally its an unstable environment which given the nature of their business is a big story waiting to happen. They have the potential to be so so much better."
bad,"No strategy, horrible leadership - especially in IT - expect long hours, nights, weekends.  Tons of politics. No collaboration. “Mean” culture. Very poor place to work."
bad,Temporary position before relocation. Multiple opportunities for additional hours if wanted. Colleagues supportive. line manager proactive and prooductive
bad,"Negative environment created to put you in your place and make you stay there. No freedom for creativity and exploring new ways of doing things, executing process, and a culture that instills fear in breaking from the norm. Reprimanded for free-thinking and continuous contradicting feedback on a daily basis. If it wasn’t for the salary and a savings plan I’m on track for, I would have quit a month into the job."
bad,This place was good for the money if you worked your life away. The management were awesome people. But it's a call center don't expect too much.
bad,"Visa has the name and pays decently, but if you're looking for something that really excites you then you should look elsewhere"
bad,"ok place to work, safe & secure job.  no excitement.,  annaul review process is biased,  no motivation to perform  /work.  compensation is not equal to all for the same role."
bad,really did not enjoy job. the work enviorment was not reall clean and management was never available. my manager never work on my shift
bad,"Benefits and pay are very good, but benefits and bonuses shrinking under new ceo"
bad,"They make you many promises that they can't deliver on when you get hired. Allegedly there are many opportunities to advance but if you're in the call center you can only go so far. Managers play favoritism. Extreme micromanaging even for a call center environment. For example; ""system-down"" time isn't an actual metric but if you happen to show a high percentage of system down time(which is very common because the platforms used are always glitching) you will still get a talking to from a manager who is just going through the motions and doesnt actually care. Or by a lead desperately trying to look good for upper management. High volume. No appreciation for a job well done. Horrible customers. Obviously, since it's dealing with their money. Entry level agents get paid a lot less to do more work. Have a problem? You can always email HR. Until they don't know what else to tell you because they're wrong and they know that. But they will never admit it. Radio silence after that. You could bring it up to a manager but even if they care they will probably say they can't do anything either. At least this was my experience."
bad,"no work life balance"
bad,"most department heads are in California so the career prospects are low in Austin. Once you are a director you have hit the limit.  If you are not a ""yes person""  my project or work is always green you will be fine. If you are a person that thinks outside the box for solutions and comes up with risk and issues that need to be resolved, you wont do well at Visa. Visa is a manage up to your supervisor and say it is all green mentality.  It is a very traditional company like banking and remember that you will do great there."
bad,The workforce is being replaced with cheaper labor.  Benefits have been diminishing over the years and pay is not competitive.  Slow to adopt new technology.
bad,"VISA Europe a very well known organisation, however behind the brand is a dysfunctional political company, which has become a mecca for incompetent managers to prosper within!"
bad,The atmosphere was very poor. Most third party workers were under valued. A social aspect was never encouraged. This tended to depend on who your boss was - as some departments seemd to have a great time and others definitely didn't
bad,Not getting a 1-1 with one's immediate manager for almost 6 months because they were too swamped and taking their managers job was demotivating and the lack of connection impacted my effectiveness.  it seems that getting the next rung on the ladder is more important then solid support and leadership.
bad,Internal processes make the day-to-day work hard to get done.There are attempts to improve company culture but there are major flaws in basic procedures that should be addressed first.
bad,Thought I would be there for a long time due to the pace but soon found out with infighting and arguments that it was not possible. Very poor communication and disconnected design community. If you go don't expect to be doing anything fun or interesting.
bad,"Visa has changed drastically under the new leadership and CEO. During my tenure, I seen 4 changes in leadership and the stance taken has been a focus on the bottom line, moving it to a technology institute and a sheer lack of interest in investing in their employees."
bad,"answering Customer calls and processing each account"
bad,"•	Manage 2nd level technical support and operational customer service needs for Visa Client Institutions (General Support Team, First Tennessee Bank, BB&T, Desjardins) using one or more of the Visa supplied software products and provide reporting and portfolio management for assigned products."
bad,Very political. Hard to get promoted. Bad management not held accountable. The brand is well respected and the core products are good.
bad,I realized working this job that the abuse call center agents undergo is not worth it considering the strict guidelines they have to follow on the call center floor. There is practically no liberty in even standing up to use the restroom and this system was not for me.
bad,"The culture in some orgs is unfortunately very bad, especially for people who are accustomed to working on creative and collaborative teams in progressive tech workplaces. Leaders are not typically expected to be good people managers at Visa. As an example our current leader's only motivator is to remind us how cush our bonuses are. For those of us looking for fulfilling work on a team where our skills are valued, this is simply a reminder that we are cogs in a very, very wealthy machine. This is a company where leaders of some orgs still sit in offices with closed doors and you can get a hand slapped for trying to step up and do something meaningful. If you get an offer, really feel out the culture on the team before you commit. There are some great teams at Visa, but also some really bad ones! Just watch out for those golden handcuffs."
bad,"I worked here 20 years and enjoyed the hey day of pre-public Visa.   The employees enjoyed wonderful food, great parties, and a wonderful 401k plan.  One of the best.   "
bad,"Major changes in focus and vision leading to 1,300 layoffs during successful financial periods, solely due to Sr. Executives securing bonuses, and then departing the company."
bad,Used to be a great place to work until the last CEO & direct reports came on board.  New CEO should be able to turn around fallout and negative morale
bad,The company is very political and corporate. Management makes the most irrational decisions. Great brand name to have on your resume.
bad,"Toxic environment, good brand"
bad,"Visa isn't a terrible place to work; let me make that quite clear! However, you know the saying... ""People don't quit their jobs, they quit their supervisors/managers/people at work."" That statement rings true for this company. I enjoyed doing my job but I did not enjoy the people that I worked with. I also didn't like that I wasn't being compensated for doing a million different jobs that probably should have been divided into new departments and maybe hired more staff."
bad,Back stabbing environment. A lot of miscommunication from staff no advancement whatsoever. Happy it was a contractual assignment. Only good thing about this place were the hours.
bad,"initially I enjoyed this workplace but came to find that there is alot of favoritism and management picks and chooses their favorite people.  Performance is not as important as your social skills  to favor someone from management.  "
bad,Employees were more focused on stock price and end of day to really have joy for the job or improving the program. It is a nice place to work if you are an employee but contractors are brought in to do the actual work and employees are shamed if they work too hard.
good,"Managers are working for 10+ years at Visa, changing from department to department. But, sadly do not have any knowledge on outside technology or haven't learnt people skills which was getting difficult for us as employees to grow or bring new ideas to improve.  Managers are rude by yelling at employees and have no respect. My last manager walked into my cube and broke glass cup and did not have the common courtesy to clean up."
good,Job offered part-time positions with no opportunities for growth. Some in-house training. Job did not offer benefits. Management was lousy! Limited breaks and lunches.
good,A typical work day is clock in unable to speak to your neighbor behind you. Unable to be not even a minute late for any of your breaks. The management is unprofessional. You have to limit what you say to your manager if you dislike it because it will be taking up the ladder with a negative impact against you.
good,"Good company and benefits. Difficult culture,  a lot of tenured employees that are resistant to change, old technologies and processes. You must know how to network and build relationships."
good,Company will benefit greatly by providing growth opportunities to employees to keep them motivated. Done a good job in ramping up the intranet portal with self-learning opportunities.
good,"The legal department at Visa was treated as the enemy of business. Every single business contract that is executed by Visa, of which there are thousands per month for any geographical region, must be prepared, reviewed and approved by the legal department. The business teams are frequently incapable of describing the business terms of their own transactions and rely on the legal department to draft them. There simply is not enough time manage this volume of work, which leads to extraordinary friction and disappointment between the business and legal teams."
good,Most of the Visa team is from India and thinking out of the box solutions are not in forced. This makes the job hard to steer around different departments to get work done. The company believes in automation.
good,Mid-level management does little to develop or retain employees. The culture breeds unnecessary stress by devaluing relationships and focusing solely on how quickly things get done.
good,It's a drag going to work. All my career advancement skills were taken away from me. My manager never provided the correct guidance or support to achieve my goals
good,"Fraternity like company. Many families or relatives hired in the same department, friends from college, etc. The Ashburn location was very fraternity like."
good,"The company rely on the non technical people and deciding the factors, they have lot of funds for the project but having more Managers than the Developers . Nowadays nobody is working , Mostly everyone id trying to survive in the corporate VISA"
good,"It's a high security environment, and I dug in and learned a lot in daily life.  There is an advanced effort with developing an enterprise CMS/CMDB, and an application repository which is generally ahead of the industry.  I really thrived in the environment where new technologies were not managed well, i.e. too many groups not collaborating and buying their own solutions, so it was up to our team to deal with the CMDB aspects of these decisions.  Generally speaking I the facility and the culture was fine, and the on-site cafeterias were nice."
good,"A typical day can start at 07h00, from skype meeting to client meetings. An innovative place to work and ahead of technology. Advancement of financial inclusion"
good,"As this company was fantastic to work for 25 years ago, it is very different and has become too robotic. As the management has changed, this company no longer has a family vibe."
good,Very legalistic culture.  Difficult to do any innovative work there or at least get approval.  Much of the work is relatively uninspiring and not of obvious value.
good,"- A once great place to work has been ruined by poor Executive Management. "
good,"Very stressful and hostile environment. You must bring your ""A"" game when you come to work. Very cut throat environment, not for the faint of heart. It was a much better company before going public."
good,i cant not have to much exprince but i well try to good job hard work good job use the good time i am alredy work in tyechnical fild substion 132kv and 33 kv i know the besst about elctrical nd mechnical fild
good,"Don't work for CIBT. It's not a good or productive place to work. No room for growth. They're not empathetic to their employees. Rain sleet, or snow, you must come to work. They don't care about your safety or well being."
good,"There is all this talk about work life balance that has never happened for anyone over the last couple of years. There a culture of keep your head down, don't mess up and cover your butt. A lot of people who have been there more than 5 years are trying to find anyway to get out."
good,"A good environment to work at but in terms of projects, leaderships and processes, Visa is lagging behind in comparison to other large corporation."
good,Working at Visa was a great experience and really enjoyable to work for.  They provided a good working environment and all the tools necessary to do my job.
good,"Good place to work."
good,Visa was a good company to work for but Sr. Management was difficult.
good,Enjoyed working in the digital payments space. Got to work on some interesting projects and support many leaders. Like that Visa is becoming more technology based.
good,"VISA tends to ignore future payment methods and sticks to card-based systems.  Likewise, it tends to lag in technology, or pursues  irrelevant technology in an attempt to remain ""current"".   If you're a technician, expect to be always ""on call"" as the offshore teams are often not that great and merely act as conduits to the US developers."
good,"I worked really hard here,--over hours--but was constantly referred to someone who was ""only a contractor."" It felt like a big fraternity/sorority. My manager provided no support or acknowledgement for the job I did-- she was totally disengaged."
good,"It used to be something to look forward to, however, after 3 years in the same position I'm getting bored and there doesn't seem to be any advancement opportunities available for me."
good,There is not a great deal of worklife balance that can be found at Visa. A typical workday can be 10 to 12 hours days and can be expected to monitor e-mail all through the evening and weekends.
good,"As areas não se conversam, causando duplicidade de trabalho"
good,was good but changed.
good,"The IPO changed the old Visa into a generic multinational corporation that values profits over people. It's a cliche, but true. Look for a better corporate culture."
good,"You will have a large amount of work for mediocre pay, the road map to advancement is as fast as the individuals that quit ahead of you. Mgmt will lead you to believe it is equal opportunity when in reality it's not the case. Good luck"
good,The company was pretty good. The workflow was always pretty busy and my managers and supervisor made the environment a good one. My time here was short but I wish I could've worked there longer
good,"Workplace culture has changed in past couple of years as the resources were getting leaner and leaner, this affected how people interacted with each other. Increased stress made the company culture focus inwards."
good,I really liked working for Visa. It was a contract position that I had hoped would turn into a permanent one. The company is great. Not happy with the team and team dynamics. I would like to go back there to work in a different department.
good,"For many, there isn't much advancement even if you are qualified. Others get promoted while they're on vacation. Best advise, make friends with decision makers!"
good,"Compensation and benefits were very good at Visa when I was there. However, there is a trade off with work/life balance. Management varies throughout departments and organizations; they could use improvement on hiring/training managers with good supervisory skills as this is lack in many departments. Job advancement is difficult. Once you land in a job, it's very difficult to move up or into a different department."
good,Constant unproductive change is the name of the game. Innovation does not exist here. Too much stuff happens behind the scenes. I don't know how any one can feel a piece of mind in a place where they are not valued or heard.
good,"Successful managers empower their employees, capitalize on their strengths, provide consistent message of what success looks like, and address areas where employees can improve.  Visa is a most fascinating and complex environment to work in, their technology is very advanced, their project management maturity level is very high, they have a large number of smart contributors. Where Visa falls short is employee burnout is extremely high, managers often raise their voice during staff meetings, respect of individuals is not part of the culture."
good,"-The job sucks and the management makes it works "
good,"The company has good benefits and advanced education program.  Work/Life balance is good.  Job security is bad since the new CEO came.  Management sucks.  The department I worked has lots of politics.  People were competing each other instead of focusing on team work.  "
good,"Look over your shoulder."
good,"A typical day at work is spent makinsuppose calls, preparing spreadsheets and customer/client follow-ups."
good,"Visa is a great place to work if you are in the tech industry. When it comes to the non-tech world and Visa, your career path is limited. Work Life balance is very valued at the Visa Offices."
good,"Not such great leadership."
good,"I'm 9 years of progressive and successful experience in one of the premier companies in Dubai. A high producing performance driven dedicated professional with significant experience in supervision of retail outlets, sales, staff, stock and resources management. Recognized for commitment to excellence, a motivational team leader to colleagues as well as a team player that approaches duties with focus and diligence."
good,"since the Americans turned up there is no respect for work\life balance, They seem to think we should work hours that fit in with US pacific time, Colleagues have been berated by their American managers for not answering emails at 01:00 in the morning, One was told that their hobby outside of work should be Visa!"
good,"If You get an offer to work as a contractor at the call center.  Be aware this is not an easy task.  Some temp agencies are aware that this is not going to happen.   There is a lot of preasure and the coaching will be minimal."
good,"First several years as a systems architect was great.  There were a lot of  complex integration challenges. interesting work,, more diverse culture, great benefits.  First year or so as a Director was even better, with new focus on Agile development and new applications.  For awhile it was fun."
good,"Poor management, unapproachable. Felt like I couldn't be myself at times around people. Often times on PTO still required to take calls and answer emails."
good,"At Visa, contractors are viewed as disposable and less than employees. Decent wage, but unless you are hired as an employee full time, don't count on anything."
good,"As with working at any remote office, visibility of your work to senior management is limited if you are not in working at the main campus. Culture is very silicon valley."
good,Good compensation and benefits. Good work culture with good management team. Unfortunately I had to leave early. Love to go back if the opportunity exits
good,The call center was a very stressful environment.  Call volume was extremely high and everything was driven by metrics.  Internal mobility was a challenge due to organizational issues.  It might not have been as much of a challenge if professional development was prioritized more by management in this department. Working Weekends and holidays was a requirement.
good,Good place to start. Working at Visa gives you advantage of learning from the pioneers. Visa is one of the early contenders to grab the market change and exploit the technology.
good,I was working on a contract so had No Benefits through Visa & wasn't yet eligible for them through the agency.  Commuting & traffic to and from Foster City is difficult at best.  Visa's shuttle system is Not for contractors - employees Only.
good,"Visa is a great company but as it is in big companies, theres little time to balance life/work. overall is a great place to work and i´ve met the most amazing human beings in this office."
good,"Visa is trying to break into the tech culture by hiring younger talent. However this has resulted to a mixture of new inexperienced young talent trying to change the culture and older employees who are too comfortable."
good,"I have worked with white resort for more than three years ,i have been a hard working self motivated person.I have learned a lot and acquired more skills in housekeeping,waitress and hostess."
good,Job was good but people were bad. Employees treat contractors like trash though most of the work is done by contractors. No job security or opportunities for growth(you will get fired if you talk about it). Difficult to drive on congested highways; nearest caltrain station is two miles away with limited shuttle services. Takes two to three hours to commute daily from south bay. Small cafeteria and very few restaurants within walking distance(no other option if take train or bus). No regrets getting out of this place.
good,I worked as a customer service rep for a sesonal opportunity. My time there was as expected.
good,Great brand. Good people. Little creative freedom to develop campaigns locally but strong Global assets to leverage.
good,"FP&A never has a predictable day at any company, and Visa is no exception.  I learned a great deal about the payments space, and had very nice co-workers.  Extremely collaborative culture, the downside of which was that decision making was sometimes slow to ensure all parties were on board.  My biggest concern is there is a lack of strategic vision currently which will begin to show up over time unless addressed."
good,"Visa is going through it's fourth re-organization in the last couple of years, and in turn moral is low."
good,"The company was fun to work for. A normal day was filled with fun, laughter, and angry customer. I leaned that keeping yourself calm is the best way to resolve any issue. The hardest part of the job was, dealing with the mass amounts of calls that came in everyday. My manager was great at keeping every one happy and going smooth. My coworkers where probably one of the best parts of the job"
good,a tough place to work if not use to fast pace. Generally can work individually or in group. some times workload overwhelming.
good,Not a fun place to work. Hard to make decision due to the bureaucracy.
good,"Lot of bureaucracy and politics and favoritism has spoiled the work culture  Work life balance is good . Compensation is good  ."
good,"This job was torture for me, because I'm a hard worker, and I struggled for a promotion for a long time.  That opportunity never came, and I ended up burning out, and never really receiving any kind of support to help me recover.  I also felt suggestions and process improvements went one way only, and the management had unrealistic expectations towards ground-level employees."
good,"Great place to work, really nice people and free sodas. I was able to love to a senior position in 5 months. However getting away from the phones is near impossible. Quality is constantly micro managing and making it more and more difficult to want to continue. You have to pay yourself for time off if you don’t have the hours to take off you can’t leave. Even if you don’t want to pay yourself. Management could care less about you or what you need as an employee and are more focused on hitting their goals to get their bonuses and making themselves look good for their leads. Great job though if you like being on the phone all day"
good,"In my experience there was extremely poor management. It seems they were trying to change this, however, in my case, I had a manager that was there for over 20 years and was part of the old style Visa."
good,Work is there from morning to late in night. Sometimes we need to work for weekend also. Everybody is working like that there. The compensation is not great.
good,"When i started, it was a great company to work for. There was always something interesting going on at work. Cupcakes, popcorns, pretzel day, some random games via email etc. we were excited to come to work. Not too long ago before leaving, it became such a stressfull environment. We were being micromanaged, they were setting unrealistic goals. As a customer service agent, they expected us to be like robot. Take calls, go on break and go home. No side conversation with your coworkers, can’t standup on the floor while working, just stare at your computer for the full shift. It was hard to even get a day off"
good,Reasonable workplace and work settings. Didn't feel that there were a lot of opportunities for job advancement in my case. Training opportunities seemed limited.
good,"I had a contract job at Visa so there were no benefits nor career advance options."
good,It is a good company to work for. It is close to paddington train station and I know a lot of people go from there so easy to get in from around the country
good,Great place to work but lots of red tapes to go thru and makes the process alot harder than it should be.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to meet people from all over the world and learning the different cultures.
good,advancing projects is near impossible. direction by management is inconsistent if ever available.
good,"This is inappropriate information to require."
good,"Significant organisation led by old boys network of back biters."
good,Excellent challenging company with great working environment.  Great chances for professional opportunities.  Great benefits and compensation package with very motivating team.
good,"Great Brand and exciting transformation work. Not for everyone . If you love solving everyday problems in a creative scalable manner, then this place is for you!"
good,"The growth in the industry is exponential and now is a time for exciting things."
good,"It depends on the department you work "
good,"I liked being very productive and having a supportive team. I enjoyed I was able to learn new things each week and doing a lot of problem solving work,"
good,Very corporatized culture.  Great for people who want clear guidelines and direction from bosses.  Culture is not warm and difficult to build relationships.
good,"the work place is quite competitive, the whole atmosphere is amazing and challenging. Learning alot of work through the time. the peers have been quite helpful"
good,I would work for this company again and I think they are a good company that is not afraid to bring new technologies to the market place and their customers.
good,"Visa in Miami is a very busy office. there is always work to be done. There are many different procedures that need to be followed depending on which client we are assisting at the moment. Must be able to listen and type at the same time. Must have active listening skills, and be able to problem solve immediately. This is a fast paced environment. There is a Very Heavy call volume. Managers are very strict and will not allow poor job performances. The most enjoyable part of this job will be your coworkers and the great friendships and relationships you will build. They offer 401K and Great Benefits including tuition reimbursement."
good,"Even though the strategic importance of diversity is growing, the business practice of intentionally incorporating inclusive practices in strategy and operations has not caught up. Blacks and other minorities are not given a chance to truly be considered for leadership roles. The culture of promotion is that people have to leave Visa and come back in order to grow. This is especially true in Miami for non-Spanish speakers."
good,"Enjoyed the culture, believed in the business direction.  Working with smart, innovative thinkers.  Always something new and interesting going on.  FinTech hot space right now."
good,"Poor management, and the focus is heavy on quantity of calls rather than quality customer service,  with demand for strict attendance,  adherence,  and 2 minute or less in call metrics and resolutions,  despite whatever task your serving. High stress environment,  but great coworkers at peer level.  Good benefits.  Great recreational activities and facilities for agent break time."
good,"It is hard to rate a company as a contractor , we have minimum access to data and other things .work pressure depends on the manager and group you work for"
good,"The company was in a state of flux when I worked there, with an upcoming takeover on the horizon, hence it is very difficult to give it a fair and through review."
good,"Great company to work, great location with cafeteria, gym, game room and working cubicles. Visa was flexible to let employees work remote. The hardest part of the job the team was spread all over the world"
good,"Depending on what workforce your report to, the work life balance is great. Expect long hard hours during busy parts of the year.  For the most part...teams are great, people are great and love the benefits."
good,well paid and well known company with good benefits especially matching 401k. Ability apply for other position within company. ..........................
good,I have been working here for past 4 years. I truly enjoy working on challenging projects. Managers are good and help you in building career. I wish all the best for the future endeavors.
good,"visa is mostly interested in hiring employees who speak one or more languages, Portuguese , French ,  Italian , Spanish  ,and Chinese.  Otherwise when I had worked there the other employees were temporary."
good,"good co workers"
good,"I worked as a freelancer for a company developing an application for VISA , overall the application was interesting and nice to work in , It forced me to use new technologies and material design which was honestly perfect."
good,"Its feels good to work here."
good,"Good place to be, depending which group you are in. Great benefits and a lot of brilliant minds to be around. Some groups get treated a lot better than others though. Management changes can be frightening, as layoffs happen for no good reason other than someone trying to make a name for themselves."
good,"I worked in the Global Customer Care Service, the work was interesting and had to handle contact from customer from all over the planet. "
good,"Great organization to start your career at, but can get challenging as you progress up the management ladder. The good thing is that you get to work with some very smart people and learn about payments, but there is frustration with internal politics and what appears to be a never ending cycle of lay offs."
good,Company has great brand name and can be a fun and rewarding place to work.   Innovative culture.  Nice work/life balance with competitive salaries.
good,"Its a Very nice Environment to work with .... I thoroughly enjoyed working in visa .... Every day is a new day with a lot of hard-work , and learning new things ..."
good,"Visa appears to no longer to be striving to be the best rather the median. Lots of unhappy people working here."
good,"Visa has a group of very smart talented people, working on the next level of payment systems, leading the world in the best way to pay and be paid everywhere."
good,"very big corp with lots of benefits and a good starting pay. Unfortunately is hard to move up unless you get along with the managers. Also, the call center hours can be murderous."
good,"Typical day can be booked with conflicting, overlapping meetings.  High stress, fast paced environment.  On the plus side, work with many great people.  Problem could be upper management."
good,Great place to work with good work life balance. Excellent work ethics and work culture. Some group provided flexible work arrangements and work remote option.
good,"This was a temporary job. I enjoyed being on phones, talking with customers, helping them with their needs. Being able to solve problems on time."
good,"The company has great benefits.  Retirement is nice, as is the free shuttle.  Trying to change company culture with pool table and ping pong table on site as well as open communication.  Company provides continuous training for their employees so your skills do not get outdated."
good,Visa treats its contractors very pooly.  I wonder what its like to be an employee?
good,Very poor compensation to developers. Simple task gets very complicated because of processes involved.Nothing is free. Not even drinks. Only good thing is pride of working for VISA.
good,"work closely with the product managers, developers and QA."
good,"I was able to see Visa before and after it went public. Obviously, the higher up the chain, the more you get. That is understood and agreed. There was just a much bigger split after it went public. There were more and more Senior Business Leader positions created, and Head of ... positions, with more and more benefits for these positions. Their roles were not outsourced. Meanwhile, the lower positions had perks whittled away, and were the brunt of layoffs."
good,"Like most any other professional work place, when the industry is up the environment is also up, when the industry is in turmoil - so is the environment on the job. If one can bend in the wind of the swings they can do well here."
good,I felt like they were a good company to work for and had fun working seasonal for them.
good,It was a good experience for my call center job. I liked inbound call center environment.
good,"management varies depending on what organization you are under, pay is good, but there is way too much burocracy in the work place."
good,"Visa has changed over the past 5 years. It all really depends on what department and region you work for. Advancement is very, very slow, Often recruiters do not know what the business needs are leading to poor interviews dragged along by a lot of red tape. Pay and benefits with some perks are good. In the past they offered complementary Visa stock to employees who exceeded and now they are not. Many inconsistencies in Senor leadership often changing leadership without any change management assistance. "
good,Contractors are not treated as well as employees.  My job was fairly stressful.  Seemed to be not well defined from day to day.  Needed to work directly with customers and with developers in India. A lot of night work .
good,"Productive and fun workplace, except that people tend to speak in their native languages even about the work, which  makes the other people who doesn't know the language feel left out."
good,"Amazing benefits and room for advancement, but poor micromanaging was too stressful to deal with on top of stressful calls. The competitive pay was not worth it."
good,"The company offers great opportunity to learn and progress ones career. Depending on office location company culture can be vastly different. Visa strongly supports work place inclusivity, diversity and equality in its practices and actively supports important global and local causes such as earthquake relief or local school projects, something that is very important to many of us."
good,"It has a good culture and nice people,  it has good managers and it is a fun place to work."
good,"I came in as a director and within two years I was promoted to Sr. Director. I had the chance to relocate from San Francisco to Austin Texas. The offices in Austin are really fun and new. Good camaraderie in Austin. New CHRO, which I do not know. CEO is great and value his employees."
good,"Interned twice, on two different teams. Very large class of interns, ~200 total U.S interns if i remember correctly. Your experience will highly depend on your team, but the overall experience is designed to expose interns to as much of the business as possible."
good,"Freedom to work and i was learn so many things, it was a great experience, we follow the timing the working environment is different places we have to travel more than 120 places in one month because our client is emirates post group they have more than 120 branches. I really enjoy my work."
good,"Bad upper Management. They do not work on anything new. No stability to projects, things change on the fly well into the coding cycle. All ancient technologies."
good,"Working with Visa is like a family. We work together as a team. Individual's idea is being shared to everyone. "
good,Not a great place to work fun. Needs to be improved lot on this basis. Not a contractor friendly company. Clear bias between full timers and contractors.
good,"Various pockets of dysfunction..  Very Hierarchical, politics and who you know reign.. "
good,Decent pay but staff are not valued as employees.  Very rigid in their thinking and not open to new ideas.  So much expertise in the company but not allowed to tap into it.  So afraid to make a decision.
good,Very Busy work environment. Difficult to spare time to look at the big picture. Good coworkers. I got lucky with some god managers.
good,has led to uncomfort at the mid-senior management level; the processes continue to be a big bottleneck in the organization.
good,"Collègues et collaborateurs agréable, très bonne ambiance de travail. Les managers participent également au développement personnel. Trop d'administratif cependant à coté de notre travail. Certaines équipes sont toutefois trop dépendanteS du management au très haut niveau. Privilèges qui faisaient la différence ont été enlevés."
good,This is a good place to work short term but don't recommend it for long term. Their isn't many option to move up within the company and management isn't very professional.
good,This was a backfill role. But I really did enjoy my time at Visa supervising/researching cutting-edge solutions that aimed to automate complex engineering processes using machine learning.
good,Visa is a great company with good benefits only thing is that when you need help during a call or for anything else there is never a manager onsite to help you with anything.
good,"-Great solid corporation to work for if you like big corporations."
good,"A great place to work, very friendly and diverse community. Both leadership and subordinates share common goals."
good,"Nice company..."
good,"Fun place to work, good work life balance. Somewhat limited in technical modernity and innovation, but is transforming itself. Quality of people  (technicallY) is relatively lower than in typical silicon valley companies."
good,"job was fun at first with a lot great people but the expectations of upper management i felt were unreasonable.  While entering in a new market they did not take the time to learn or teach what they wanted  in way of soft phone skills, no matter your knowledge of their product"
good,"A typical day at Visa is showing up to work and being ready to be on the go for the majority of the day. My job requires me to be in 2 places at once. Every day is different! I am constantly working on multiple projects at once, some with a hard deadline, and others that you just need to get a head start on."
good,It was nice working there because it was my first job in London. It was a bit too corporate and stiff at times.  The hardest part was feeling tied to a desk and my role wasn't very inspiring.  The best part was the friends I made.
good,"It was a great gig to work remotely as a contractor. Larger companies have fewer issues with the procedural setup of contractors, including payment. They are usually more flexible with schedules as well. Since Visa is a global company, it allowed me to work early / late with teams all over the world. The people I worked with were friendly and helpful."
good,"Visa can trace its roots back to 1958, when the Bank of America launched BankAmericard, the first consumer credit card program available to middle-class consumers and small- to medium-sized merchants in the United States. It didn't take long for the company to grow; the company expanded internationally in 1974, followed quickly by the introduction of the debit card in 1975."
good,"Visa is a great company to work for with excellent benefits, but a lot of the management are stuck in their ways (retired in place) and averse to new things. It makes things boring, difficult to get things done and difficult to advance in the company."
good,"Personally, the team I work in is very energetic, some very intelligent folks are there and I love to work with them, learn from them every day. Visa provides good facility (cafeteria, transportation, team outings etc.) and competative salary as per market."
good,"Typical Work life balance with less salary increment every year. Work wise you get to work on technology that was famous few years back. (catch up time is too late)"
good,"There was many good qualities of working at Visa. Amazing name recognition, good people, but management can use a little work. Furthermore, for those who want to move out of their current role there is little to no advancement."
good,"Company is trying hard to be a favorable workplace for Millenials.  In the process, older workers are often ignored or not given opportunities for advancement.  If you are young, in the San Francisco area and have a technical background, this is a good company.  If you work outside of the San Francisco office, opportunities for advancement are limited."
good,"I have a very good work/life balance at Visa, Inc.  But I don't feel very motivated at work.  I do my job and want to go home."
good,Good company to work with. Management is helpful and become good mentor. Team is helpful.
good,"The company could definitely be fair at some points but then it would say no paper at all including pictures of your family inside the call center or if you were in call center you couldn't attend any of the fire safety drills. Which to me shows that the company cares more about its customers than the safety of its own workers. Otherwise it was a good company, a little strict."
good,The people who work for visa are awesome and they support you to be able to do your job to the best of your ability but the job expectations and the card holders that you have to deal with are sickening and stressful.
good,"If you work on the floor as a customer service rep taking calls, it is a rather stressful environment. Almost all the calls that come in are complaints and disgruntled customers. It does have growth opportunity, but it is stressful to keep up with all the numeric goals you have to reach. If you meet one requirement you are most likely failing another, a lot of walking on eggshells. This is a general complaint for most. It has become stricter as time as gone by."
good,"Love the fact that everyone is made in to a subject matter expert on all technology and applications.  "
good,My team was unstructured and lacked guidance. I was moved around several teams and locations. I was not assigned work for few weeks after joining due to realignment in the organization.
good,"The office located in owings mills,md was like a slave ship. I made good money there but I hated my job for 3 years straight. The managers were rude and disrespectful. And when I realized all they were concerned about was us making them money, thats all I began to be concerned about making my paycheck."
good,"Visa is using a lot of contract employees in the SF Bay Area. It seems like they have a strategy to reduce the California workforce. Every 5 months or so, they go through a round of reorganization and layoffs. This affects morale and makes it difficult to get hired as an FTE."
good,The re-org did not aid the number of empires. Way to many chiefs and poor guidance from senior stakeholders and managers caused confusion in the ranks
good,"As a global company at the forefront of the electronic payments industry, Visa is a dynamic organization. Those who are entrepreneurial and interested in seizing opportunities for growth and personal challenge will enjoy working at Visa, where innovation is not only the cornerstone of our culture but also our most powerful advantage in creating cutting-edge solutions."
good,"•	Responsible for Development of Scorecards from end to end in MicroStrategy. It includes development of MicroStrategy Schema Objects (facts, attributes, hierarchies, Transformations) and Application Objects (Reports, Documents, Filters, Prompts) for projects and final reports business stakeholders. "
good,Visa is a great company as far as benefits and pay is concerned. Since I've been at visa there have been endless amounts of Overtime. However Visa is lacking in the leadership/management roles. The managers are no help they don't know the job and they're always upset when they're forced to do their job. They do have roles for advancement but they play favoritism and sometimes stretch the truth about receiving positions. Managers can and WILL intervene with your success and career advancement. Its hard to get approved for PTO especially during the winter holidays. The attendance policy and schedulues make it hard to want to come to work. you only can miss work 2 times in a rolling 30 days but they never approve you for PTO so you have to call in and take those attendance hits.
good,"Cover your own base. Work hard and do not let manager be micromanaging. "
good,I had a chance to work in a stress relief environment and also to work with the very much experienced and established people at VISA inc. A very beautiful and huge data center I have come across.
good,The training was very thorough and specific.  Various tests had to be passed in order to continue the hiring process. Constant talking in the phone was not for me.
good,"Visa is a vibrant and exciting place to work in a rapidly changing industry."
good,"Challenging work enviornment, interesting market, lots of smart people."
good,If placed within the right team and management then Visa is the place to be; however that's not always the case and as a person you need to do what gives you passion and motivation.
good,A place with flexible work hours and fun filled events. The work really depends on the team you work with. Most of the technologies used here are advanced and you always find abundant opportunities to prove yourself.
good,"Visa is a good company to work for.   You have to work hard; however, it is a fantastic organziation with lots of opportunity and great people. Wonderful experince working there."
good,"excellent company but it has evolved into too much politics while corporate treats  employees as expendable pawns. Do not dare to question or point out any flows on proyects being pushed by corporate or you will be label as problematic.  Manage by fear is the new style"
good,"Depending on the role, a typical day at Visa can encompass working across multiple teams to get to the end goal."
good,"normal workday"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Visa, it is a very interesting and diverse place to work with excellent staff. It has been many years since I worked there however."
good,Visa Inc. is a visionary company that is constantly coming up with new ideas and initiatives and looking towards the future. I was a contingent worker and did not have the chance to be considered as a full time. I was discharged at the end of my contract.
good,"OK place to work.  Not crazy about the team work and management style.  The team that I was part of, they don't care about the quality of the work but the timing delivery.  The team was in a strange position, don't really have any authority but have responsiblity."
good,Fast Paced Call Center environment assisting customers with account issues and identifying Fraud activity.  Team oriented with supportive managers eager to help you achieve your goals.
good,A great place to spend 1/3 of your life. They are great with work/life balance and provide a variety of wonderful benefits. They avidly listen to employees and seek to get better in areas they are deficient.
good,"Really good employee focus"
good,"It was good experience working with them.. "
good,Work here is very structured and established. They are a big firm and things have to be done through specific processes. There is tremendous amount of work but the employees are well compensated.
good,Training is typically on your own time using online tools such as pluralsight.  These are nice to have.  The benefits have stayed the same over the years with the exception of the pension being dropped as a benefit.
good,Good work environment. Good team work. If you are looking for a place to grow your craft this is the place. You must be up for a challenge and adapt to change.
good,"Good place to work.  Helping improve lives and economies around the world. From advancing financial inclusion to helping in times of crisis, we're using our products, know-how and philanthropy to bring about positive change. We are a global payments technology company working to enable consumers, businesses, banks and governments to use digital currency."
good,"A typical day at work consists of a lot of talking over the phone, either with card holders (mostly), the banks associates, courier, money transfer company and so on. "
good,Fast paced Agile SCRUM environment. Good people to work with that are very focused. Free snacks and Peet's coffee. A bit too much overtime for my taste.
good,"Whilst being owned by the member banks Visa Europe felt like a small organisation punching way above it's weight.    It provides a world-class payments platform with relatively small number of employees.  Like any organisation there are areas for improvement, but likely to be very different environment after the merger with Visa Inc."
good,"Visa Inc. is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in Foster City, California, United States. It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards and debit cards.["
good,"The stock price and benefits are very good, but the culture is under constant change. Work life is out of balance with a strong emphasis of moving away from experienced workers in California"
good,"the hardest part of my is work time, management is very easily done."
good,"Visa had a very laid back environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the dress code which was casual that included jeans 7 days a week.  Additionally, management trusted the staff- As long as your work was done and done to perfection it did not matter.   It was a very interesting business to be able to see millions of Visa transaction run through the NOC every few seconds."
good,Great work place and had a change to work on a very big environments.
good,"Verify eligibility according to Terms & Conditions for each contract. Verify medical necessity, Medical records translation as necessary, process reimbursements requests and payments to providers accordingly. Resolve and escalate customers complaints and appeals. Process requests for early return, trip interruption, and delay returns."
good,Great environment to work in. Encourages productivity. Excellent experience gained in payments industry.
good,"Fast paced and demanding environment. "
good,"Good company to work with. Good work culture.               Nice initiatives , good management                       "
good,1. Very busy days
good,"i really love working at visa i have learned alot working for visa. i learned great customers service skills, learned great use of words both english and spanish. my job was to answer inbound calls both spanish and english and assist them in the best possible way with whatever they required or there problems. the hardest part was just the starting of it had alot of products to remember they had there own limits nd rules."
good,Just another corp company where there is red tape with good benefits. Typical problems with organization cooperation across various orgs.  Typical challenges with year-end ratings.
good,"Great strategic direction and senior management thought leadership."
good,"No comments. "
good,VISA INC is a market leading credit and debit processing company.  They use hundreds of software tools that help support and augment the core card processing platforms.  My work at VISA was on these support tools.
good,"Visa has experienced a lot of changes over the years since IPO. There are some amazing people that collaborate well, but it can be challenging at times. Under the new CEO, the company seems to be headed in the right direction regarding employee development and succession planning."
good,"Pretty good. Management was lacking. Training was non-existent, culture is fun. Lots of office drama. I would work here again. Benefits are amazing..."
good,Amazing place to work for 4 year but the last too were tough with a new IT management. VISA decided to not use test management and go to a more development focused management which killed the autonomy of the testers to find defect.
good,"Great place to work, excellent insurance but not chance to move up, unless you are hired into a position. Also the Screening Management Department has great team but room for growth."
good,"I had the opportunity to see several different departments and work groups at Visa. The way people are treated is inconsistent across the enterprise."
good,"While we recruiters aren't normally the lovers of process types, Visa's hiring process was outstanding and very fluid/logical.  Made getting interviews, offers, hires move quickly and painlessly. (for the most part)"
good,Working with people who know the business and felt I learnt a lot every day.  The industry is going through a transformation and Visa is well positioned to leverage its assets to continue to transform payments around the globe.
good,"pretty monotone but solid desk job, answering calls and emails. Sadly, males get paid more than females, and usually it is a butt-kissing event when it comes to promotion"
good,"Good Job very busy.  Excellent benefits,  401k, pto, stock options.  benefits day one.  Biggest issue is once you go so far there is nowhere else to go and unless you know the right people you won't promote beyond csr 3"
good,"Overall a good company to work for, has its pros and cons like anywhere else.  Work/life balance can be a challenge and it can be difficult to break through in some organizations but once relationships are built there is good partnership."
good,It was exciting and fun to work for a world class brand like Visa. The Olympics was a fun time. Their benefits were excellent and the cafeteria was so -so.
good,"Visa is not a bad company to work for. That said I have a couple concerns. Profit vs. Employees, in 2015 Visa announced it would discontinue the 100% company funded pension plan. Seemingly replacing it with a 100% employee funded stock discount program.  "
good,"Impossible to get things accomplished at Visa because of old and inflexible processes."
good,"Learnt a lot about payments .Got to know what exactly happens behind each credit card transaction."
good,"A very enjoyable place to work, although it was a contract position, I felt part of the family, as most of us were contract workers, I had the most awesome Manager and we learned a lot from one another"
good,"Visa was a great place to start my IT career.  I was involved in different aspects of networking which helped me identify where I'd like to take my career path towards.  The work atmosphere is fine, co-workers were very professional as well as the management.  Days are very busy so time passes by fast for the most part."
good,I've worked for Visa International for five years. As a valuable employee this company had many ups and downs. The pay wasn't bad and benefits was great. The only issue was being a Customer Service Representative you can become burnt out due to being over worked and often you would have to keep putting in vacation requests which sometimes took awhile to answer back. The hours was great with occasional overtime which sometimes could be much or even having to do a earlier working shift to cover for other employees who didn't want do their  jobs properly. Far as the corporate later goes you had to work for this company a very long time to reach the top which at some point people began to run out of patients and felt like they was going no were fast. Toward the end as I saw it coming they began to fully outsource their employees which means paying people who are half way around the world for less and no need for Americans. Which totally demeans the value of this company since being laid  off and was offered to move with the company but no raise or bonuses enough to cover for the expense of moving. So in all if you sign up with this company be prepared for some challenges and sometimes cut throating to reach the top along with either going international or going to some state in America were things are more expensive.
good,This is the company by which all others are measured. From the state of the art equipment to the process used to help the client everything is tip top professional. I enjoyed that professionalism.
good,"good mangement and team."
good,"The experience is what you make of it.  Good everything can be great if initiative is taken.  Good salaries & benefits, advancement opportunities for those that buddy up to the right people.  All in all, its a sound place to participate, grow and develop."
good,"As an application manager i was responsible for a team of 15 - 30 application programmers.  I worked on issues related to budgets, project management, corporate/government audits, resource planning, meeting project deliverables, monitoring project status, personnel issues, management reporting, formal and informal staff performance appraisals, and more."
good,Great culture and work style - although this was Pre-ipo days.
good,Great enviroment that value diversity and work ethic. Customer service is given in professional manner.
good,"If you are qualified and interested, apply. Global positions with many opportunities up and across. Great benefits. Market or above market rate pay. Be prepared to work hard and long."
good,Long hours and sometimes weekends. Excellent benefits. You will learn a lot. Many high performers. Change departments if you think that you are not meeting your goals.
good,"Everyone knows the VISA brand, that reputation and popularity is what creates an environment filled with loyal employees. Employer brand is definitely important in talent recruitment."
good,"Has good benefits and is a very stable job, but promotions come once in a blue moon and they underpay market value.  This workplace is ideal for somebody 30+ looking for an amazing 401k match and good work/life balance."
good,Great place to work if you are willing to put in the time. Room for advancement is easy as long as you are recognized by the right people. It's all who you know
good,"Great work-life balance, and good perks."
good,"Overall good place to work; good work-life balance and benefits. However, need improvents to retain talents, promote from within and train managers. A lot of managers are great individual contributors but not competent at leading a team."
good,It's stressful. Too much of workload and had to make schedule in advance for vacation. i was layoff unexpected after a vacation. All staffs for 3rd shift were layoff because Data Center was moved from US to Asia.
good,"The company is overall a good company to work for.  Depending on the group, management can be hit or miss.  Its a pretty relaxed environment.  Casual dress every day.  They do have a pool table and ping pong table, although some managers are reluctant to let employees use them.  The hardest part about working here is the silo'd nature of the organization still.  They have attempted to correct this but have not been totally successful yet."
good,I worked at several positions within VISA and I would defer to my resume.  The scope of all of the positions that I held were fairly similar...general administrative work.
good,Good company.  Interesting work.  Many smart people.  Rapidly growing industry with lot of opportunities and challenges. I liked working there.  Would recommend
good,"Good company to work for, with good benefits and decent pay."
good,"Great opportunities within the company, fun corporate culture, excellent pay and benefits. Very interesting and exciting to work with staff across the globe. Opportunities for international travel."
good,"Overall, I enjoy working there, management is the only thing I have an issue with. Benefits are good and overall compensation is also good. I like that they have free shuttles as well."
good,"Benefits good. Salary, fair. Commute assistance, Paternity Time off, Legal Service Benefits, Discounts through different merchants. Overall, good job security."
good,"work culture is good"
good,"Good employer, but I outgrew them and the restructure made my position untenable. Knowledge gained is highly specialist making you a great future candidate for some roles but not for many."
good,"I worked here for a couple months. Learned a lot, but around the time I was there, there were quite a bit of layoffs. Regardless, Visa is trying to change and incorporate a younger work environment (i.e. ping pong tables, foosball, events, etc.). I got to work with many different teams--the employees are nice and willing to help when they can. I thoroughly enjoyed my time."
good,Nice working environment and good people to work with. The company is working on latest technology and very flexible for working hours. Multiple networking events hosted by the company to grow your network within the company. Overall fun place
good,"high volume call center, with a lot of different products, long hours but a great place to work at, fun environment. needs better management."
good,"After being in the wild west of consulting for 3 years, it was really good to have to have gotten the chance to come to work as a full-time employee once again. Visa Inc. really values education and my current manager is always valuing input and proactive attitudes. I have been with the company long enough to have some reservations with the way that upper management is leading the company. Many of the upper IS managers that were working with Visa 3 years have retired and/or left to other companies. Read that as you will. "
good,I enjoy working at Visa. I enjoy the people I work with as well as the fun events Visa plans for us. I don't have anything negative to say about Visa.
good,"Hard working, heads down environment.  Very bright staff, collaborative staff."
good,"Management need to focus equally on Business side of the departments similar to Technology"
good,"There are no typical days at work, as on any given day, I could be either in the office and at my desk, or half-way around the world in front of 25-30 banking professionals delivering a training class on Visa-specific information.  "
good,"Check daily schedule"
good,Handled an average of 80 calls a day (inbound and outbound calls).
good,"A typical day would include various meetings from one to ones with members of my team, through to leadership meetings with the exec on wither operational or strategic items. "
good,"Great work life balance, flexible work environment, more conservative but fun"
good,"employer had great benefits & incentives: 401k, stocks, cash rewards, & corporate perks/benefits... made great friends"
good,"A typical work day for me was working in a deadline driven environment. I knowned how to listen and understand the customer need. Also how to relate to the customer and most importantly I learned how to be patient. Management was okay, they were willing to listen to your idea and inpute. My co-worker were harding working and willing to lean a hand when you need help. I enjoyed talking to customer and assisting their need."
good,"Overall its a good place to work but there are certainly lot of things that needs to be improved."
good,The work can become mundane.  That is great if you like that sort of thing.    You are allowed to work at your own pace.  Visa is a great place for introverts.
good,new facility. coworkers in my class was excellent ...training could have been better but did the job.. very high call volume pay was ok plus benefits as well were good
good,"Most days it was fun to work, However many days added pressure was placed on workers to reach goals that was more robotic than  anything else.  After being there  you were expected to become robots not having any  breaks just call after call not time to reassert yourself.   it became as though you were not human."
good,They have work time and location flexibility. You can work wherever you are. Meetings are usually on Skype. The also allow work from home on certain days of the week. They provide Shuttle services to/from  various locations.
good,"Good company, many opportunities, great people and culture - fantastic Christmas parties - everyone involved with free transport to and from the office"
good,The company has been constantly doing well on a year on year basis. Work Life balance may get distorted at specific times. HR culture is extremely good. Learning is encouraged. Opportunities for vertical as well as Horizontal growth is plenty.
good,"Upper management kept changing the priorities. The team would be hurried to complete one major deliverable within record time, only to be told after the release that it wasn't very important and that there has been a change of direction/priorities, so now the team should work on delivering whatever the current priority is, again in record time."
good,Visa was a great place to learn as a Jr developer. The work at visa was fast moving and learnt a lot working with experienced people. I would suggest anyone who is willing to work at Visa.
good,I enjoyed working at Visa from 1997 until 2006. After that they combined with Innovant  and my work days changed to where I had to work every other Saturday and Sunday instead of every Saturday on my previous schedule. Innovant tried changing things to the way the like to do them but it didn't work out very well with the computer system and jobs I processed for the domestic side of Visa. Innovant thought they way was better but they were wrong.
good,"Visa has a very diverse pool of employees and they will be your best assets when you work there. "
good,"Productive and fun workplace with lots of entertainment and friendly environment . Because many companies create their own employee self-assessment forms, the forms come in many specific and different types. MIT Human Resources offers sample forms that companies can use as inspiration or that employees can use to promote thoughtful responses in performance reviews. These forms are aimed at promoting a career development focus in the self-appraisal process. The Society for Human Resource Management has an example of a lengthier type of self-assessment form, which focuses on more specific skills and duties within a company."
good,"Visa is a very good company to work for if you remove the layers and make it little flat organization."
good,"Strategic direction is unclear but offer lots of opportunity to try new things and gain global experience in a rapidly changing environment"
good,"The demand for break fix solutions ,  software and hardware are challenging . Days fly by , 20 onsite techs servicing 3 thousand users.Tech bar  busy 9-4 all day. Our team also in process of refreshing EOL laptops. Learn by doing. management does a good job of managing demands of day to day challenges . Hardest part of job is the Time for formal training. "
good,Visa is moving forward with an emphasis on employee morale while continuing to deliver on its core products. It is also investing in making processes and procedures less cumbersome. Visa is a great global brand.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Visa.  I found there was room for growth, much to learn, and great co-workers.  Because of the nature of the payments industry (heavily regulated), the environment truly challenges you to be agile, persistent, and effective."
good,"Visa is a good company to work for that offers many employee benefits and employee engagement activities."
good,"A typical work day at Visa. Daily meetings with account management team and management. Daily account management of new task and prior working tasks with financial institutions. Daily email and phone communication with clients, management and operations to complete standing client questions, outstanding issues, data delivery issues and complete and incomplete client implementations."
good,A typical day at work would be a non stop of inbound calls from many cardholders of many different branches. Was able to learn about the new updated system that is only all done in the computer like even answering a call through the computer. Management kept very professional and was direct when needed to be regarding the work environment. My co-workers are not much to be spoken off since there was no time to interact while working. There were gatherings after work with my co-workers but I never attended.  The hardest part of the job I would say to be is not being able to take a quick breath right before the next incoming call. And the most enjoyable part of work was due to high call volume time was the one taking over and before I knew it work was over.
good,"Worked in Loyalty program in Visa International. Worked with different loyalty programs such as VINCIR, TAQC, Sweepstakes. etc. VINCIR is an Incentive program with the objective of providing selected merchants the ability to have greater and more targeted access to selected Visa cardholders. TAQC is designed to provide benefits to cardholders in terms of loyalty point or cash back based on the norms defined as per the sponsoring organization."

good,"Great place to work with great benefits. Has office politics  "
good,"You interview with a specific hiring manager and they choose if they want to bring you onto their team. Depending on the team, you have more or less work to to do."
good,"For a young engineer VISA may not be the right fit. Tech stack can often be old, and the pace is relatively slow the company. "
good,"At the time that I was employed, Visa workplace culture started out great and then a new upper management team was brought onboard, and needless to say, they destroyed the culture and employee moral. Managers showed favoritism and then job security became a concern for certain types of people."
good,"It's a great place to work if you have family. Very flexible and caring manager. Problem with working there is if you get too comfortable at Visa, you may not want to work anywhere else."
good,Benefits are outstanding. The building is really nice so is the food. I would recommend this place to anyone starting their career and to grow in a company like this
good,A typical day at the office would consist of answing phone calls and assisting customers with their inquiries. The hardest part about the job was dealing with irate customers.
good,"Work was very productive, culture seems like they started hired a lot of ethnic people, "
good,Everyone is friendly and willing to share their knowledge and experiences. The most enjoyable part of the job is the collaboration with other groups to accomplice a goal.
good,"Some real dorks masquerading as directors. Mostly incredible managers and staff. Very professional firm at the cutting edge of what is possible and delivering in a consistent way. Resource Solutions is rubbish. Try and avoid them if you can, very nepotistic."
good,"My salary left alot to be desired as did my immediate supervisor (who was subsequently dismissed due to job performance), this is an excellent company to work for. The hardest part of this job was my last day, I did not want to leave, only did due to family obligations."
good,"I love working at Visa. Great Health Insurance, bonuses, and work related programs to better education. The engagement in the community, and diversity is like no other company I have worked for."
good,Solid company with solid benefits.  VA office does not have as many opportunities for the employees.  Stable safe work environment for anyone that wants predictability
good,"Here you'll find all the benefits of a good product company except  exciting work , cutting edge technology , new technical challenges .   Even not good managers ."
good,"With all of the changes taking place in the payments space, Visa is one of the few companies at the forefront of this change.  Innovation is encouraged and expected at Visa."
good,"Multinational company with lots of friendly professionals. Work\life balance is fairly good. Salary\benefits could be better. Although a fun place, I would not recommend to work for a long period, since it offers limited challenges to most of the workers."
good,"Had a good exposure to BI application and business knowledge. "
good,J'ai grace à Visa Europe eu l'opportunité d'aller travailler à l'étranger et de voyager dans le cadre de mon travail; Depuis 10 je travaillais en free lance et voayageais dans toute l'Europe.

Visa is diverse many different cultures to interact with. I learned about restriction and hidden fees on card, Visa the company is a transaction company visa does not issue credit cards. The hardest part of the job is the back to back calls without increasing your after call work time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the bonus and reviews"

Once a contact is fulfilled with a client most employees hired for the client will have to be release and only a small fraction stay if any.
good,"My (regrettably) short time with Visa as a blessing. The project manager was top-notch in skill, while remaining quite down-to-earth in demeanor.

good,"Descent place to work,  can be  really challenging at times, Management  seems to have no idea on how most of the systems work in the  industry, but  after all consideration the place  lacks room for improvement, staff has no say so in any type of work improvement but the pay is enough to keep you around if you are only looking for a paycheck."

good,working hours are flexible learnt a lot things over here
good,Overall Good Company. However you will not get quality work if you are part of India Team. Due to dual management( Funtional(in USA) and Local Reporting) you sometimes have to struggle to prove your work.
good,There is too much work and the promise of back fills for those who have moved on are empty promises. To compound that the hiring process takes 3-6 months.
good,Great experience. It takes A long time to learn if payments is not your area.

good,"Most of Visa is a great place to work.  Like any large company, there are pockets of poor managers and difficult colleagues.  But for the most part, they stick to their mission and vision as well as their leadership principles."
good,"Growth has been promised more than 5 times, but has never been shown. Management will tell you that they feel you are a perfect fit for a specific position, then you do everything they ask you to do, and more, but then they pull the position out from underneath you. Very tough to maintain a positive attitude when something like this continues to happen."

However, they should recognize internal contract candidates to be hired for full-time positions, and give chance contractors to explore more instead of looking for a new contractors and go training hustles and waisting time all over again."
good,I enjoyed my time at Visa and I feel that I was well compensated for my work there.  The culture at Visa feels as though it is suffering a bit due to increased workloads and raised expectations.
good,I have worked for Visa for many years and have been given the opportunity to grow and expand my skill set. Amazing pay and benefits.

The team was a close knit team and we supported each other daily as well as when there was a scheduling conflict and someone needed to be off for personal reasons.

good,"-Multiple shifts, 8 hours/day."
