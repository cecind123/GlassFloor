rating,review
bad,If you're looking for fair compensation and encouraging place to work one where your hard work is rewarded this is not the place for you.  The managers don't understand the systems that their employees are using therefore are very myopic in their expectations. All they're interested in is covering their own back side and hanging anyone else out the dry that they can to keep from drawing attention to the own lazy inept behavior to their own lack of understanding
bad,"Très mauvaise expérience "
bad,"L'ambiance et le management est à fuir."
bad,Harsh working conditions. No opportunity for review or advancement before two years there. No compensation for overtime. Working overtime is mandatory. Very low pay.

bad,"This place is a management wasteland. "
bad,"Unfortunately OMG creates many problems for itself by under funding project, poorly thought out time frames and lack of strategic direction.  Not the mention the political infighting which makes the relationships between the various IT organization dysfunctional."
bad,Phd has gone through 3 ceo's in 2 1/2 years. Mgt has no clue on what they are doing. You are either in w/the CEO or on hit list.
bad,Big clients look good on resume but that’s it. Terrible culture sweat shop atmosphere. Stay away from this agency. Good ole girls club at its best......
bad,"Everyone is so stressed at Omnicom, it's difficult to find balance and take advantage of the many training opportunities.     Upper management is not cordial and they lack diversity."
bad,"not great, poor management - confusing, losing business"
bad,Management is scattered and out of place. You can work 10 hour days easily. Office is clustered. They haven director for multiple accounts so there is little guidance.
bad,People are nice but there really is no career advancement. No real training for new hires and lack of periodic training to keep up with changes in technology
bad,Work load has been too much lately and unable to maintain work/life balance. Learned a lot on systems level and domain administration. Management can be better from top to bottom. People are nice overall...
bad,"Overall, you will overwork yourself for a few years and find out at the end that you will not get a raise and promotion at all... Even reviews don't ensure the your annual salary will increase by standard of living cost (3%)."
bad,"I started out with a position and was promoted to a new one. With more responsibilities, no training and the same low salary. The agency management leaves a lot to be desire."
bad,"A lot of gossiping, jelousy withing the team. Hard to connect with co-workers. Very quite environment. "
bad,"My role mainly focused on Monitoring/reconciliations of statements , with weekly reports and daily insertions of invoicing. I was able to understand the advertising agency and was able to use practically apply my financial knowledge."
good,"It depends on the team and team leader, My reporting manager was horrible and management didn't take any action."
good,"the company was a chaos."
good,"Reasonable culture, good support for creativity.  Like any large multinational, they have KPIs that need to be hit, its a head hour business so job security depends on client retention."

good,"Walk in to work grab my coffee and sit down in front of a computer for 4 hours. Go to lunch come back and stare for another 4 hours. No one speaks, everyone is silent. I learned how to work with the software Trial Master. Co-workers were average. Hardest part of my job was staring at the computer screen for 8 hours and hurting my eyes. The most enjoyable part was a great friend I met while working there."
good,"My current organisation has given me a very good platform to learn and manage the pressure on my own. All the employees are friendly and very easy to approach. I learnt to handle my accounts all alone when my seniors were not available and also managed pressure during campaigns. The hardest part of the job is to keep in loop all the TV channels, Print and Radio during the campaign, it is very important that all the mediums are on the same page and have the respective briefs of their tasks. Sometimes we also play songs during work hours, which is the most enjoyable part for me."
good,9-5pm. Easy to coast.
good,"I personally loved my time here but often here that people are not happy with workplace culture.  Offices and hallways are overcrowded.  Desk and chairs are everywhere, even right outside of bathroom"

good,"Libertad y autonomía"
good,The people at Omnicom are not friendly and are very focused on themselves rather than the team as a whole in order to serve our clients. They expect you to work 24/7. I have worked multiple holidays and received no compensation for it. There isn't much room for growth either.
good,"I enjoy the culture in Advertising Agencies all around.  There are always inclusive activities and ""parties"" to celebrate various groups, holidays or training."
good,Enjoyed working with my team.  Upper management was only interested int he bottom line.  They decided it would be cheaper to outsource everything instead of keeping people on-board that understood the complexities of their environment.
good,"The people were friendly at Omnicom Media Group and the job was enjoyable, however I decided to travel Europe at the mid-way through 2018 and that meant I had to resign."
good,enjoyed that the train dropped you off at the door. Nice views from the windows. Fun working downtown Dallas. People there were nice But this was a long time ago.
good,Le plus dur dans mon poste était le trajet que j'avais a faire chaque jour entre mon domicile et mon travail.
good,There Is no room for opportunity to grow or advance. Management does not want to take care of their employees that work there for a long time. They would hire new people than to take care of the ones working there for a long time.
good,"Overall, Omnicom Media Group is a very nice place to work, and depending on the group you work, you might encounter a well balanced work-life environment."
good,If you're looking for professional development you definitely want to work here. There are so many courses and webinars available for anyone to take!!
good,I am not ready to provide a review on my previous employer at this time.  I would like to take time to reflect on my time with the organization and provide a fair appraisal.
good,It is a dynamic working place but could be very stressful when working on some big accounts as deadline is on a daily basis. 
good,Management was great at PHD and kept employees in the loop through townhalls. Promoted office culture and avenue for different teams to work cohesively

good,"Interesting experience at a time when Omnicom was establishing its corporate presence in Asia Pacific, particularly in China"
good,"I think it’s just time for a change, as the company is changing in a direction I’m not sure that I want to go in. I’ve been here over 15 years now and have maxed out position wise."
good,"Great company to work for, however the salary and rate for promotion is very poor."
good,"Nice environment, management very involved with ability to rotate to other accounts after 2 years."

good,Un bellissimo ambiente dove poter crescere ma bisogna essere molto fortunati ad essere assunti a tempo indeterminato
good,"I got to learn a lot about the finance department in a media company,which gave me the knowledge that i inculcated from my education to my professional life. The work environment was very friendly, mixed cultures and views made me broaden my opinions and vies on how an media company works."
good,très bon groupe avec une culture trés orienté vente et je souhaite encore aujourd'hui pouvoir integrer ce groupe en suisse
good,"Most people there are really friendly, but there is also a Corporate vibe at the same time.  There is a definitive rank and file.  Compensation is fair, except when numbers don't hit budget.  Then they make up for it by slashing bonuses and raises and layoffs.  But that can be said for most big companies."
good,"Lavoravo nel reparto OOH dell'azienda, ritmi abbastanza stressanti ma i benefit di una grande Azienda come Omnicom non sono da sottovalutare."
good,"Plenty of opportunity and many extremely smart and sharp folks across a vast and diverse network. Workloads are not very balance and often understaffed, therefore work/life balance is a challenge."
good,"- formation des nouveaux entrants trop limite"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of status calls with clients, reporting deliverables, meetings and presentations. I learned several things related to the future affect that 'big data' will have on digital advertising, and advertising in general. My coworkers were knowledgeable and easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was seeking opportunities where I could advance within the company. I thoroughly enjoyed being on the cutting edge of technologies that will have a great impact on the evolution of advertising strategy from both a media and creative perspective."
good,I really appreciate and value the privilege avail to me in the telecommunication industry to achieving my dreams and goal. Omnicom solutions a sub contract to Huawei Technologies is good place to work.
good,"Enjoyed time immensely but depending on the agency you work for, leadership might be very strong or quite weak. This is the norm for a large holding company. Much of what they are doing today is world class."

good,"Great place to work, Great company to work for. Great people to work with. Overall, its been a very great experience working here."
good,"Good work environment, with nice office facilities. Colleagues are willing to help and solve any of your inquiries as a new member of the company."
good,"Analisi dati, continuo aggiornamento scenari sui mezzi, creazione di documenti ad hoc sui programmi televisivi. Ritmi di lavoro frenetici ma stimolanti. Alla fine dell'esperienza panoramica generale di tutti i mezzi pubblicitari"
good,"El iniciar en esa empresa me dio una buena visibilidad de lo que era Medios y de lo mucho que se puede hacer en este rubro."
good,"Veel telefoon die goed moeten worden doorgestuurd met soms het nodige research. Veel klanten/exploitanten aan de balie om te ontvangen en door te verwijzen."
good,"A typical day at Omnicom can see a large variety of tasks undertaken, from the construction of existing rail measurement systems, to the research and development of brand new systems. Management style varies with the pace of the work & the company is just small enough for everyone to know each other personally."
good,"This is the sub-company of Omnicom, so my opinion is not towards Omnicom Group. CSpace is a place people value fake smile and always on 24/7 energy more than the actual work. Which I found it hard to follow after a while. My manager at the time was great, one of the few that are honest and real. "
good,"Omnicom has some of the most talented advertisers, designers, developers, strategists, etc. They source great talent. The pace of work is very fast. Things are constantly changing but I made some of my best friends working there."

The top Management like CEO: Mandeep Sir, VP: Hitesh Sir, GM HR: Kavita Ma'am and every one is too good. I love you CPM and love you all. Take Care and Keep Growing like Present, wish you good luck for a bright future. "

good,"I have been working for Omnicom Group as a temporary HR Consultant for the last two years. I have learned so much in my time with them about myself, my capabilities and definitely about Human Resources. In short, the company is committed to making the actual work environment fast but productive."
good,"Large user base required constant task prioritisation."
good,"The company has many advantages but the kind of leadership, development and follow up ruin many good projects. People look more interested in their own advancement rather than company's development and as a consequence we worked in huge silos difficult to overcome"

good,"I found this one of my favorite places of employment. Unfortunately my department was outsourced to India (so boo to saving a buck), however, everything else was nice prior to the transition. The culture is very open communication between employee and manager. It's media, so there's always a mixer in office or at a location in the city. The work is pretty straight-forward. Depending on your department / manager, you get remote work from home options as well as flexibility in your schedule as long as YOU the employee are consistent. There aren't too many additional services, trainings, or incentives, but the everyday culture is great."
good,"In terms of culture, it was quite relaxed but also close-knit. My team was super helpful and welcoming. I really enjoyed getting to know everyone. I was only there for three or so months (I was an intern), but I learned a lot and was treated fairly."

Since the media space is constantly changing, and you are expected to change with it, it makes for an exciting and challenging work environment."

Trabajo agradable, gente contemporánea, activa y sin una jerarquía muy marcada."
good,"Eu cresci muito na empresa, por que desenvolvi habilidades e competências não adquiridas anteriormentes, já que não havia trabalhado em uma multinacional."
good,A lot of long hours with minimum supervision people are fun to work with but the hardest part is working with a no budget or having to break best practices to keep cost down.
good,"hardest part of job is urgency, work life balance. "
good,Omnicomm is a great place to work although promotions and pay raises are somewhat politically motivated and not necessarily given to those who do the best job or show the most enthusiasm. Great work life balance and the culture is also a major perk. Benefits are decent although the 401k isn’t the best.

The management was terrific.  They did not micromanage and I worked my way up to management as well.  The workculture was great.  They were serious but allowed a lot of fun in the office.  The hardest part of that job was only my commute...100 miles per day and the most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge of meeting the payroll deadlines because I like a challenge and the annual company meeting.
